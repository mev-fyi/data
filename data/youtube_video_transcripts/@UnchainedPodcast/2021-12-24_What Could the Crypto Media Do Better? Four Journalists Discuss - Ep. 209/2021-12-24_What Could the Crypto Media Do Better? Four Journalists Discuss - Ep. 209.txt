the description today since it's the eve of a holiday we're going to have a casual conversation among crypto journalists and we're all going to discuss the uncrypto and other issues involving the media plus the year ahead joining me are michael casey chief content officer at coindesk jeff roberts executive editor at decrypt and michael del castillo senior editor of forbes welcome michael michael and jeff hello there okay well great great start to the episode um [Laughter] so just a heads up before we discuss um all things crypto media everybody there will be no weekly news recap this week um okay so actually michael delkisson do you need to go get that or no my amazing wife has discreetly snuck down stairs and uh seen to whatever that was okay perfect all right so we will start with an open-ended question what do you guys feel like we're the big crypto news stories of the past year and to help people distinguish voices i will call on michael casey first since you were you know you're overseeing everything at coindesk so yeah the entire thing so um am i allowed to give a bunch or do i have to give one and like because i don't want to steal what these guys i hate this and you always want one for me i mean you can just maybe maybe do two your two biggest okay the two biggest i would say um the china crackdown on on mining bitcoin mining was a pretty big story um and i think probably just the nft zeitgeist just the sort of the emergence of this whole new mainstreaming phenomenon that that none of us i i wasn't certainly ready for uh those would be my two biggest stories do we want to discuss them or we're just gonna like put the name put them out there to start with well why don't why don't we have jeff go next and then we'll call him michael it's i'll kiss you last and then we'll we can all discuss all of them okay well now that mr casey's picked off the big ones so let me think um yeah i think i'm seeing you already in this you guys you understand that right all right all right i'll take the scraps actually they're not i think equally big stories are um the emergence of uh public companies into crypto um ip i mean on coinbase and robin hood having ipos the likes of square and twitter charging into the space i think that's kind of shaped and shifted what's going on and the other uh another big story i think too is the emergence of dows and web 3 going mainstream you know remember this flickered in 2017 also late in december amidst a huge boom but they kind of flickered out quickly and i think you know we've seen uh the re-emergence of dows is a very big story and michael del castillo those are all awesome ones um i'm gonna second uh the public companies issue uh i've obviously been tracking that for years um the forbes blockchain 50 this is our fourth year um we it used to distinguish being on that list that you had to be voted a billion dollars or more um and after this year it's like who cares everything's valued a billion dollars or more so um the what we used to consider a huge milestone is just wrote now and that change just blows my mind so i have to second that one um i'm torn between bitcoin mining uh nfts but i'm gonna throw a new one out there and and say the venture capital space uh in 2020 to 21 was just epic um we tr we did our best to track the 12 largest venture capital rounds uh of all time throughout the course of the year and in one week we had to change the list three times and nine of the ten largest rounds in the history of crypto happened this year it's over twelve billion dollars total just in the top 10 um investments of all time and that just blows my mind i think the the the impact that in the venture capital world made in 2021 will not stop being felt for a decade when you look at that money and you look at how long it takes to build and to invest that money uh at a corporate level um the the ripple effects are are just you cannot overestimate them i love this because you guys i had written what i thought were the big stories of the year and i definitely missed several of the ones that you mentioned but i'm surprised nobody said what i thought would this was one of my top two um was regulation i feel like the big story from the past year and it's going to extend into 22 but in a different way where i feel like it's going to perhaps become more of a political force and we started to see glimmers of this but i feel like the fight over the infrastructure bill obviously kind of really galvanized the community and uh kind of woke up a bunch a bunch of congress people about the importance of this and kind of i you know we saw clearly in the hearing from last week that there's definitely a lot more understanding and nuance of the technology than we've previously seen from these different congress people um you know the stable coins hearing maybe a little bit less so um but i do think that what is happening is that probably um we're gonna see more politicians kind of clue into the force that is the crypto community and wake up to it in a very political way um meaning they're probably going to realize there's a lot of money to be had here and so i'm kind of looking forward to seeing like oh how's it going to play out in the midterms next year you know and um jeff i saw that you at decrypt or i don't know if it was just you it might be you and dan that write these together but you know you have this piece about how you feel like democrats um well not all of them obviously because you know i wouldn't say necessarily that i think crypto is clearly a partisan issue at this point it's it's really not it feels kind of like a mixed thing it just feels like um for the people that are more vocally pro uh crypto they tend to be republicans and for the people who are more vocally anti-crypto they tend to be democrats but you definitely have bipartisan um support on both sides it's just maybe the louder voices follow along those lines but yeah i'm definitely interested to see how that's going to shake out and then the other two that i had on my list that neither of you mentioned were el salvador adopting bitcoin um as legal tender and you know i know even the bitcoin community has kind of like mixed feelings about you know which country it was and how they're implementing it but still that's that's kind of like a really crazy story that uh we have you know just kind of everyday salvadorans that are now having to deal with this currency and or at least getting education about it even if they're not transacting in it and then um well actually another one that i forgot to write down but three we've already got two how are you letting him through well i'll just i'm just doing all right you're the highest your prerogative i suppose come on give us your third one laura but well before i get to the third the related one i just thought of that's so similar to el salvador is actually infinity in the philippines although i guess you could say that also was 2019. um but still again like kind of a non-typical um you know cohort of people that are really getting into crypto and then the last that i had was the bitcoin futures etf um you know i know that the crypto community again felt like this isn't the right vehicle but just the fact that at least there's something now um that you know i think is is a momentous step and definitely sets the stage for the coming fight over um when and how this next spot bitcoin etf is going to play out so laura i mean just to interrupt you then in the spirit of the conversation that you said you kind of wanted to have um yeah like those are seven or eight amazing events that happened um that we were pretty quickly able to put together without any uh forethought um i i feel like every year we say it's the most important year in the history of crypto um can we say that this year like how big is this year and when you look back at those events and compared to last year's or does it just always feel that way in crypto well i think because you know it's like um uh you know when you're looking at any new thing any new startup or project or whatever and it's like oh you know it it made one thousand percent gains that first year well yeah okay it's starting from a small base so i feel like yes it's gonna be like this for a while yeah yeah this is clearly the biggest year and going back to what mike was saying about the venture capital remember like we'd get stories like so-and-so raised five million dollars like go by let's write that and now it's like just five million 59 who cares you know it's just the numbers are so big and so crazy it's just you know i can't keep up oh yeah even before that i remember when like if if the if a middle level vp of a company that my mom and dad had heard of said the word bitcoin on stage we did an article right well to be fair there are some outlets that still do that but um but wait wait speaking of big numbers by the way you guys i've just been thinking there have been so many defy hacks for hundreds of millions of dollars i mean it's kind of like it's crazy it's just like whoa and or maybe not even all d5 some of them are even centralized exchanges but it's like wow this is like such an everyday occurrence now like this is kind of crazy and yeah like another thing that i feel like for the regulation story i'm a little bit like why is it that the regulators are so focused on these and you know like having an intermediary doing the reporting and like they're not looking at all these crazy hacks going on all the time it's kind of like don't you realize that that's like the real issue here um so i wonder yeah it kind of going down sometimes it does pop up in their commentary because they do they recognize that there's sort of the the security issues around smart contracts and and so forth but you're right it's it's largely focused on you know protecting the little guy protecting the investors uh and the intermediary's role in that but i also think like one way to think about that like we're sort of blase about it right i mean i just see hack and you just kind of forget about it those of us who are around for mount gox in you know 2014 just remember like at that stage the biggest story that the whole world was going to fall apart because there was this hack and and in some respects it did it it really had a big impact on the on the outlook for bitcoin and everything else but the but the sector and the space is so much bigger we've just been throwing around these numbers right so a 200 million hack is kind of tiny compared to you know fdx's 36 billion dollar valuation or whatever you want to call out right so not saying fdx was hacked which is just like that that juxtaposition just shows you the difference in scale right now in a similar vein there michael uh the the mount gox hack obviously but also the dow collapse when when the original wow collapsed i mean it was blow by blow cover every day there were three or four stories i i've read i read a really good book about that thing um who was that [Music] it comes out february 22nd everybody it's called the triptopians that i it is a very good book laura it's an excellent book it is very good yeah i had the pleasure of reading it too and it's i love the kind of heroes and villains too from the early aetherium days too i'm sure it's good to see your patients pay off there but in all seriousness the dow was a huge deal and what i like about the juxtaposition between that and now is like when the dow collapsed people were talking about how daos failed how the dao concept died and it was it was so naive it was so short-sighted and it represented just such a misunderstanding of uh the progress and evolution of open source technology and now like when when a defy application gets hacked we're not hearing as much hand waving about the death of defy right um and i i'm not sure if that's because you know the world has become so used to such big numbers in crypto that they're numb to these relatively small losses or if it's because dare i say uh the readers are getting a little bit more battle tested and perhaps the skeptics are a little less likely to throw gasoline on the fire so like i think that it's actually it obviously the defy hacks are are a weakness of vulnerability and a sign of immaturity um but i think the reaction of the d5 hacks could actually be seen as a positive you said it interestingly then michael you you talked about like the battle battle testing and the fact that you know it's it doesn't get rolled in to the you know development of open source systems and i think that that's i mean i think we're still a long way from mainstreamers looking at things like a hack and going oh that's actually a kind of a not exactly a feature but it's something that you learn and grow from right it's part of the iterative process um but but that said i think it's starting for those of us who've been around this for a while you start to see how great this is whether you like it or not something that happens in these open systems and it is part of the growth process that right the the hack that the whole gets filled something gets built on top of it um you know and the dow is a classic example of that we have all these dowels now being rolled out that are functional and they're not seen as something that have have necessarily unless you're elizabeth warren i suppose see them as systemic risks um and so it is you can look at it from a broader perspective and say this is how you know anti-fragile systems develop i don't know that mainstreamers talk like that though right they still tend to see any big problem mistake as as a sign of impending doom rather than the fact that in an evolutionary environment it's actually how the whole system eventually gets stronger whether you like it or not but i do think what's happening one thing i will say is like back at the time of the dow um you know 14 14.6 percent of all eth went into the dao i mean it was like i remember a source i don't remember if i put this in the book but somebody was like oh at that time the dow was ethereum it was like you know so many people had put their money into this and yeah now when there's these different hacks like it's definitely not existential to any chain whatever chain it happens on um however you know i guess what what i was just thinking of when i mentioned that in terms of regulation like i do keep thinking oh i wonder if an sro maybe is the best way to handle that because it's really a code issue and there should be probably standards around um you know deploying different contracts or whatever it might be that could protect against that but it's hilarious that michael you were saying like oh it's part of the iterative process and i think maybe you meant from the developer's perspective but also i moderated this panel recently where i raised the question of rug pulls with nfts and maria paula fernandez was on my panel and she was like oh she was like no we shouldn't protect those people like like that's how you learn they kind of had this very darwinian um notion of how people should learn good behaviors when it comes to protecting your private keys and like not being a you know a victim of a phishing attack and all the stuff and i was like oh wow okay you don't want to put in any protections at all i was like all right not what i was expecting but um fascinating answer so um anyway clearly yeah the the space has matured a lot and um yeah we will have to see where things go um so wait so we just named a bunch of big stories um do you guys want to kind of give any verdicts on how you think the crypto media handled its reporting and why don't we also distinguish between crypto media versus mainstream media uh i think yeah all of us came from mainstream media about michael's still in the mainstream media but um michael casey and jeff and i all have mainstream media backgrounds so i think we can discuss both who wants to go first any particular story or just generally yeah yeah uh so from the crypto media side you know i i think like it's actually sometimes the opposite of what the problem is on the mainstream side and as i still think that we live in our bubbles too much and uh do not do a good enough job uh contextualizing uh these sometimes complicated things uh to the outside world and and sort of explaining why it's important so um you know sometimes uh you know if it's a discussion around the china story and the and the the departure of mining um you know we'll be out there digging into stories about the hash rate whether it's going to rebound or or not um whereas the mainstream is is focused on a completely different sort of story about how you know authorities are going after bad guys in china um so i i feel like there's a there's a need on our side still to figure out the way to sort of responsibly talk to what we call coindesk the stakeholder audience the people who are really invested in this and make sure that you're continuing to inform their needs but at the same time making stories accessible i think it just applies to pretty much everything we do to be honest um it's still all of us i mean i actually you know uh i mean look both decrypt and forbes both of you guys do i think do a very good job of of making your stories readable um uh but it's it's it's a challenge for everybody so yeah that's a general comment really well i think the shift is you know i remember once upon a time fortunately you have to defend why you're writing about it in the first place you know it's like you almost apologize for writing about crypto because it was seen as exotic or a novelty or this or that but now you know everyone's writing about crypto all the time so i think the crypto first publications have really sort of you know shined this year um and i think most of the mainstream ones are doing good job too i think the journal does excellent coverage bloomberg does too the new york times less the only one that really bothers me out there is the ft which seems still sort of stuck in this attitude of like you know i've said this before but i remember i'm old enough remember when the internet was first becoming popular and there used to be kind of a genre of writer who'd sit there and make fun of the internet and say oh it's for criminals and perverts ha ha you know and that was sort of that shtick and the ft still does that like that their alpha bill thing it's just like not funny anymore they just sort of start to seem antiquated and not really funny maybe that's just me but i have a question because like i have to say that when i started covering the space and i started reading the alphaville blog more regularly i was so confused because it just seemed like you were saying like just commentary but not necessarily facts and then i eventually realized oh it's like just blogging opinion but not reporting so um you know maybe that's their opinion but i don't when i read the alphaville blog in particular i don't know about the rest of the ft coverage but i now look at it as like you know similar to like a krugman or whatever like just an opinion columnist and i don't look at it as i mean i know the the i guess the reason i was confused was because they're also reporters so it's like they have this gig where they write their opinion but then they also do reporting and i don't know i didn't know what to make of it well michael casey you've worked as a high up at the wall street journal i mean my theory the ft is that there's someone at the top who likes that stuff and is encouraging them to do it because uft overall is excellent but the alpha bill stuff is just you know what how do you explain it i actually don't know that it's a top down thing um i i think isabelle kaminska is the driver of it i mean she's a very good writer and she's you know extremely sharp and she ran with this thesis that the whole thing is a big you know ridiculous fraud and there's just too many too much hype and everything else and so what she says is true right but she's unfortunately it's it's everywhere you go you can find some truth if you just narrow the focus but she doesn't step back and see the big picture of of development all the stuff we've been talking about this incredible growth reflecting the the development um so i but i think that she's such a personality and she kind of ran with the anti-crypto line early on at in ft alphaville and that became their shtick that's that's my take i don't it doesn't feel to me as if it was a top-down decision necessarily but i might be wrong well you know i mean clearly there are negative things that are happening in crypto and we also all report on them as well so um you know if that if that is the niche that she wants to stake out that's definitely her prerogative um but yeah like i said at first i was just confused because i didn't understand that it was more of a commentary type thing and i was like wait how can she say these things where's the reporting i was like you know where's her sources and um but anyway all right so in a moment we're gonna discuss some kind of juicier topics like animosity that sometimes the media sees from crypto and tech people but first a quick word from the

that's n o d l e dot i o slash unconfirmed back to my conversation with michael michael and jeff all right you guys so here we're gonna just get right into it what do you make of sometimes uh the negative comments that we can see from different people in crypto and tech towards journalists i love it it's just so great yeah it's tremendous we thrive on it um oh all sorts of thoughts on this um you know there's silicon valley uh and not to silicon valley but also just anybody investing in this space confuses wealth and the accumulation of that with somehow being truthful or or just owning the facts right like it couldn't possibly be wrong because uh look how much money i've made um and it sort of builds this sort of uh a very one-dimensional way of like arguing you know um it's almost like the sophisticated version of have fun staying poor which has just got to be the most ugly meme one could ever dream up right and i so i find that that it inculcates a kind of a um us and then view look look at us and we know what we're doing we've proven it every time look how wealthy we've become uh mindset and and i think there is like i i go back and forth with with biology a lot about this sort of stuff balaji srinivasan who um is has an interesting take on what what media should be doing i know he's had some sort of pretty big fights with some some crypto and tech journalists in in the valley as well um but there there is some realm and it's funny because biology is always promoting paul's in my book the truth machine is some sort of uh uh like factor in his thesis but and that is that um there's a world in which media starts to could start to become more decentralized in the way that it addresses the idea of what truth is that there is a there is a consensus way of thinking um that you know the crypto and blockchain worlds embrace and that that's the future of media and i find that a very interesting idea and i do think in fact you know the failure of uh a lot of mainstream media to you know litany of mistakes that have been made over the years somehow do reflect the kind of centralized nature of media dominance on the other hand and this is the big butt that needs to come into this right there this this assumption that that you hear so often that um journalists are in it for for some motive that there is uh uh because it's because you know dcg is own owns coindesk and so the reason we wrote about grayscale or we didn't write about that or i mean was that somebody else i think you know carl gibson one of my favorite trolls uh was was attacking us because one of the dcg portfolio companies was in our most influential list you know and that was obviously because barry silbert told us to write that and put it in there right that that that just becomes this kind of accepted wisdom um and i find that infuriating um that there isn't a deeper understanding in our space of the kind of norms of behavior in some respects the kind of professional pressure that journalists are on not to do that sort of thing that this is sort of you know an aspect of our of our profession that it's taken extremely seriously yeah the the knee-jerk assumption of that there's a ulterior motive is is something that's very hard to break and i think just to jump in there michael uh i'm sometimes torn with that assumption in its in its own right because uh it's hard to tell the earnestness of the critics sometimes and like in writing on on the the slack channel or the telegram channel or the the the webinar interaction software that happens to be they might be claiming that they think that such and such is biased or unreported or or whatever um but i i can't help but wonder if if it's just more shills out there um i i i doubt the i doubt the the genuineness of a lot of the criticism in the first place um that makes me i do want to expand on that just a little bit though because i don't want it to sound overly negative and perhaps in a counter-intuitive sort of way so like oh 12 years ago you didn't see ibm stock owners uh shilling their their their stocks uh in the the comments of mainstream media outlets that that just wasn't how business was done and and and most retail investors didn't own ibm stock uh they just couldn't buy it even if they wanted to um the fact that these shills exist at all the fact that they're so vocal at all though incredibly annoying and i will finish this this rant by by saying why i think it's actually harmful um is it necessarily totally negative like the fact that these people have a voice the fact that they care the fact that they are investing the fact that they are participating in the economy is new and and in a lot of ways i think that they're exercising their enthusiasm and their sense of skin in the game in a kind of childish way they're they're they're they're doing it in a way that someone that hasn't had the opportunity to do it before and is really excited about pumping up their asset um so if i want to give the haters sort of the benefit of the doubt um i i do like to tell myself that that you know they're new investors they're really excited about having the opportunity to invest and uh blockchain and and uh any asset built on top of it that lets the public buy is is a way to make that happen so you you could see that hate as a positive thing um the the haters on the negative side though i will say um helping uh grow a young team at forbes of new crypto writers um and helping um veteran writers write their first ever crypto stories they're daunted by these the visceral attacks uh it scares people away like you know we all laugh about it um you know we've been writing about it for years and years and years now and i think we we were able to we're like the frogs that didn't realize they were boiling because they were in the water as it started to get hot and now like when when we look at the the boiling water around us like oh yeah this is normal but the new people who come in the young writers who write their first bitcoin article their first god forbid xrp article you know the veteran reporters that that have been talking for years that finally start writing about something and they get attacked you know they're not used to it they don't know what this is and whatever agenda these shills think they're fulfilling by being so hateful especially to young reporters they're hurting themselves they're hurting the future of storytelling and they're discouraging young writers from getting in so i think it is a nuanced issue and i definitely like the fact that our readers feel engaged and empowered and finally have a say in their their finances the way they did in the past but my god i hope they grow up because they're going to scare away an entire generation of young reporters that didn't grow up boiling in the water well that's probably not so worried about the uh reporters being scared away it's part of our job to have thick skin like you know you got to learn to take it and deal with it i just think the larger culture of kind of dunking and hatred i mean i think was promulgated in part by you know president trump putting that out there and making that a norm i think journalists part of our job is just to kind of be tough enough to take it and if you can't well you should probably get another job maybe that's insensitive i'm more worried about how this culture in terms of bringing people into crypto it's so dominated by like you know not dominate but there's you know nastiness and insults and the racism and the sexism i just don't think that benefits the broader crypto community and you know in the past i think media had a bigger chance to check that and put help put these people in their place but it's it's hard now because you're right uh michael does castillo like everyone's got a platform everyone's a media so what you do about that i don't know yeah my take on the um yeah some like insults and whatever you want to call it that sometimes comes from that crowd is um you know sort of like michael del castillo said so um i you guys probably know if you listen to my show like i'm big into meditation and like i used to teach yoga and whatever and um you know this is something definitely it's not like an easy mantra to just suddenly uh kind of what's the word inhabit but i really try to take or try not to take things personally um like there was a really great book that i read about that uh called the four agreements by don miguel ruiz and um you know like there was this moment earlier this year or i forgot yeah it was i think in the spring or something um by the way i was like so knee-deep in book stuff like i just could not even i didn't have the time to deal with this issue but um as you recall somebody made a clip of an interview that i did with michael saylor where he um like if you listen to the full interview what happened was i asked him about that time early on in his career where he had a run-in with the sec like his company for those of us who recall those days was like super high flying in the early com days and then it had this major crash because there was this like accounting scandal and stuff so i asked him about it and at that point in the conversation um he kind of started turning against me ever so slightly like it's very subtle to hear in the interview but somebody took a clip of that and um it's this moment where i had actually gotten this question from a listener from uh a twitter follower who was like oh is michael sailor going to kind of take some profits when the next bitcoin cycle reaches its top and then buy in later and i asked him this but it wasn't even like something i would recommend he do or anything like that was not my position it's just like a good question you know um but he turned it personally and was like saying laura it's going to go forever and so now people constantly tweet this at me and this was like that like the video clip i forget how many views it got but it was like very viral and i think there were like reddit posts about it and whatever but you know i just tweeted i was like so the person who made this clip said at the very beginning i've never listened to laura's show and she's a traitor and influencer and i was like oh this person like literally has no idea what i do for a living he doesn't know that i constantly ask questions that do not reflect my personal beliefs because that's my job and so i just tweeted i was like you know i know people keep tweeting this at me and whatever but like this has nothing to do with me the person who made this clip thought that i have like a a totally different role from what i have they think that this is like a question that reflects my personal views it doesn't and blah blah and i was like okay whatever and so people still tweet this at me like i really just don't care it just doesn't bother me um you know thankfully i haven't had uh some of my sources who are these big names who do take issue with the media take any issue with me but you know i mean if that's their opinion they're you know they're free to have it um i personally you know would maybe this reflects my midwestern roots but um i try very hard and this is also maybe like a value instilled in me by my parents to not ever try to assume something about somebody just based off of any fact i might know about them you know you never know what people are dealing with you never know where they are coming from and certainly there are journalists who go out there and their intention is to do a hit piece um you know i ha myself now that i'm being interviewed a little bit more i've i had a one a strange experience where um let's just you know i'm not gonna go into all the details on it but um i just once the finished piece was done and knowing what the facts were and knowing what they chose to put in their piece and how it was basically not what the facts were i was like okay that's really weird um but you know i guess they had their narrative and you know i had this moment where i was like okay i could uh create a fight with them on twitter um but the fact is i don't know i watch twitter all day long and it looks to me just like a bunch of egos fighting each other all day long and like i have zero interest in participating in that like not at all so i was like all right you know what i'm just gonna use my platform to push the facts and like make sure people know the truth and so in this one piece that didn't happen but whatever um and yeah so i don't know that's that's kind of my take oh the idea of fudd right that that there's an assumption that by asking those questions uh by you know questioning whether this or that is as good as it is you are participating in some deliberate act of undermining the great cause of you know bitcoin's uh relentless forward march right and it's just yeah it's it's and the thing that's hard to get through is like no you need these this questioning you need transparency in fact it's it's built into the ethos of crypto that there is transparency there is questioning so if everybody's cheerleading it's not going to be a good system right and and uh and yet yeah if you're not that i think this is one of the the broader problems of the you know of the memes of the st of the uh you know have fun staying poor or we're all gonna make it right it's this this idea that together it's all about how much money we're all making together and anybody who questions anything along the way on that is clearly not a participant and and should be you know dumped on so i don't know how i don't know how we deal with it that's that's that's part of the culture and and you just have to just keep rolling with the punches i suppose but it is very evident yeah that's well put michael casey because your transparency is kind of a paramount value in crypto but so is tribalism and almost like a religious sense to it too the amount of people have met who you know are kind of basically religious nuts you know if crypto didn't exist they'd be in a cult somewhere else i think so it's interesting to figure out how to balance it yeah tribalism is a very way to describe it right but tribe tribes with with investible tokens right tribes with money attached to it they're incentivized to to to have to go into warfare which is you know interesting all right so michael casey kind of led the discussion there a little bit already um so why don't we just now you know after we uh uh hopefully it didn't come across as complaining about the fact that yes we do regularly we love you all of you readers and viewers and everyone else we really do trust us even the people who attack the media we love you too um so why don't we just talk a little bit about what we think that crypto media could do better in the coming year and then we will look at what we think are the big stories for 2022 what can crypto media do better and and mainstream media covering crypto i mean i think it's a pacing issue i think that's probably the one thing that everybody would agree on um is to take more opportunities to go slowly um the the pace is relentless um we're all getting the same emails about the same 350 million dollar venture capital around that's coming out in three days and uh we're all hoping that we get our take on that um and the result is a relentless cycle of similar stories uh with slightly different takes and occasionally a well-thought-out um in-depth piece um and the sad truth is that in order to pay the bills those short stories about 250 million dollar capital raises that get 50 000 views in an hour um help pay the bills but the value that we bring in in the long run uh takes time discipline and focus and we have to have the support of our various news outlets to do that um so you know in going into next year you know i would hope that you know uh so-called mainstream media outlets like forbes and uh trade publications that specialize in the industry all get that license from the powers that be to take that time um let's let's let the the press releases fall to the ground occasionally and take a breath practice some of laura's meditation um and go for those those those big those big stories sounds like wise advice um i was going to take a look at the mainstream media one of the things i just get very frustrated with in terms of mainstream assessments of this stuff is that is the is a lack of what i would describe as um systems thinking um and it gets a little bit to what we're talking before about like you know oh god the this particular hack is is a sign of the death knell of such and such right and a failure to step back the assumption often in mainstream coverage of anything happening in crypto is that it is in stasis that at any given moment this is this is the state it's going to be in it is always going to have transaction fees and gas fees at this level it's always going to have scalability challenges it's always going to have um you know only you know money launderer is working on it or whatever right that that and yet you look back and anything any story of crypto is about incessant constant change and and development right that it is nothing but a progressive story so this kind of like hand wavy it's the end it's the end and it's it's all a failure and look how bad it is and the failure to see that this is this is a step in the process of change and i i find that a very frustrating perspective again it's not to necessarily come across as a cheerleader although i you know i am a believer in crypto um but it is to say like analysis of all of this the same way i feel about the analysis of of bitcoin mining in the environment right it's a there's a there's a lack of understanding of how the incentives around bitcoin mining renewable energy and the sort of the system around how this stuff works could result in a far more positive outcome than you know the massive carbon footprint that's that's out there um and it's just there's a lack of sophistication uh i think i also just to believe maybe a little more pessimistic there i'm not sure if it's a lack of understanding i think sometimes it's willful ignorance because the headline gets more readers that's true like like bitcoin is dead gets a lot of readers and that's the the reason why people keep claiming its death might be because of lack of understanding it might be because of a lack of systems thinking but i think there's a lot of there's a lot of mainstream media writers that don't really care and are just trying to get a story that their editor says good job for getting a lot of clicks and it's easy to just write a story that's in two dimensions and get those reactions because the people that see it in three dimensions get annoyed um and they click on it and the people that see in two dimensions think it's real and they click on it so there's not really an incentive for the people that are sort of telling willfully telling two-dimensional stories to be more nuanced uh hopefully it just stops working someday here if i can um yeah michael is that i think i know exactly what you're talking about but i think it's getting a lot harder to do that you know why just because millions of people are coming into crypto and a lot of them are in high school a lot of them are graduating in college taking crypto courses so once upon a time it was easy to explain bitcoin and crypto as some sort of criminal conspiracy or some sort of like nut case thing because that's what people want to read they didn't know they didn't understand and now i think just too many people are curious about it once you know a bit about it it's those stories are just going to look more and more stupid so i think you know the balance is tilting our way in terms of having a much broader base of people who get what's going on yeah and one mainstream oh yeah i actually wanted to credit one mainstream publication that got a story along the lines of what michael was michael casey was talking about correct which was in new york mag i don't know if you guys saw um wasn't jen fiechner your former colleague jeff um i forget who wrote this but they basically wrote about how um bitcoin mining could be combined with renewable energy plants in you know uh kind of you know places that are not near big cities and why that could actually be a good thing and was kind of a promising idea and they wrote about it with a lot of nuance i i was it jen or i can't remember who it was i remember the piece i can't remember she's done some good stuff too but you know you're right there's just more and more nuance coming in because people want an easy thing to write off the whole industry you know first off it was a scam now it's that it's wrecking the earth you know but i think it's just getting harder and harder to make those cases or those simplistic stupid headlines you know i mean we're still gonna see them but you know i'm hopeful there's gonna be fewer of them yeah okay you guys so we're running out of time uh i'm looking at this old bitcoin obituaries site you know 99 points yeah and like they actually there was a nice steady decline until 2020 when there were only 14 uh recorded instances of the claim of bitcoin's death but sadly this year the number more than doubled and we've had 41 claims of the death of bitcoin so we seem to be trending towards the uh that that technique not working but we had a little bit of a blip this year yes that's that's strange given what we were saying about coinbase and el salvador and the bitcoin futures etf et cetera et cetera but anyway okay so for 2020. i talked about the regulators though and you mentioned that the hearing last week and i and i think that's another indication to to maybe jeff's point about a growing awareness the fact that those congress people ask the questions they did i was aoc i was stunned how she talked about stable coins and the role they play in the plumbing of exchanges and i was like god somebody somebody has truly educated her well and and um that that was a that's just a sign of the sophistication that's now and that that was we just a year ago we would constantly get these stories out about how you know out of touch congress was in the past year a lot of aids on the hill have done a lot of educating and uh that in itself is going to be a major factor in how the stories get written because regulation is a huge story and that discourse you know whether we like it or not does get driven by washington so informed washington politicos actually saying intelligent things believe it or not is going to also shift the dialogue that we're involved just on that note michael's thinking about washington and next year now we're almost out of time but that's me one to watch laura you said at the outset that politically it's become bipartisan i disagree i think there's a lot of young democrats who like crypto but the people who kind of have the keys to the you know the white house um elizabeth warren and gary gansler and janet yellen hate crypto and i think they're forcing that view on the party and i think you know that's could make a big difference in politics next year if the democrats continue to be perceived as anti-crypto from their leadership so yeah i didn't i didn't say i think it's bipartisan i said um well it's more in the camp right now in my opinion that it's neither partisan nor bipartisan but um just on a very technical level you could say that there is bipartisan support because obviously we saw with infrastructure bill there were democrats who were signed on and as we continue to see new crypto legislation introduced there are democrats that are introducing those bills as well but um yeah so very quickly because we do have to wrap in a few minutes so um do you guys want to run through what what the other big 2022 stories are that you're going to be looking for sure like you know so so i um it is in a way still regulation right what what is going to happen with stable coin uh regulations bank charters that sort of stuff um i would also say that um in a similar vein um will we actually get a real bitcoin etf is gonna be one of those uh one of those things instead of the fake futures one um there's a whole host more i'll i'll i won't steal your thunders guys what you know what do you think i'll i'll go and follow up i agree with the bitcoin spot etf or a real bitcoin etf i think the likelihood of that happening next year is pretty likely um i think that if you look at their last rejection letter the wording that they used to explain it which they have always used to explain it looks absolutely preposterous in a world where they've approved a futures etf like you can't use the same rationale about an immature industry as a explanation for why you're rejecting a spot etf after you've just approved a futures etf which really helps undermine helps create that maturity so i i i believe that was done intentionally it was done with thought and i think that next year is going to be the year that the spot etf happens um but i i would be remiss if i didn't throw out there um i'm gonna go ahead and be take take a risk and say that in spite of all the um smoke and mirrors about the metaverse i think a lot of it's gonna pan out to be real um and i think that we're gonna start to see something that starts to look like what a lot of people have in their imaginations before the end of next year uh we won't see anything real like like the actual metaverse that we're hearing all this talk about until 2023 2024 2025 but um i don't think we're gonna have to talk in the abstract by the end of next year yeah i just want to add one for next year this is more your wheelhouse laura than mine but i think we'll eat 2.0 work out just because this last year was kind of the year of ethereum i mean just crypto is more ethereum than bitcoin these days you know apologies to the bitcoin maxis out there and will they be able to pull it off you know i just i'm not that close to it but you know ethereum's always struggled to make these big changes and a lot tried not just for ethereum but the whole industry including the metaverse whether the proof-of-stake transition is going to work okay the only other last one i'll throw out there because we have to wrap is just so obviously i feel like you know nfts and d5 will continue to grow however when i look at both of those trends i feel like oh they're both moving to dows you know all the major d5 protocols are becoming downs the a lot of the nft things they're becoming doubts and so i'm like oh i think maybe the big meta trend for the next crypto thing is going to be dowse and that kind of like you know is going to create a um uh it's going to come to a head with the regulation trying to kind of force there to be intermediary so you know that's kind of an interesting thing i'm watching out for all right you guys this has been so fun we will have to do it again sometime um thank you all so
