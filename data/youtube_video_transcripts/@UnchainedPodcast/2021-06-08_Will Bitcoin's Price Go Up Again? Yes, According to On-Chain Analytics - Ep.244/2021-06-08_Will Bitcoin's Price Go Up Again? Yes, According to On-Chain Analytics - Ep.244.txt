connected world discover how people are re-imagining the world around you on tazos today's topic is bitcoin and what the on-chain metrics tell us about the price here to discuss are willy woo an on-chain bitcoin analyst and writer of the bitcoin forecast a market intelligence newsletter and raphael schultz kraft co-founder and cto of glassnode welcome willie and raphael hey laura great to be back hey laura thanks for having me five years of uh the podcast i didn't know congress thank you the market has been in the doldrums recently with bitcoin as of the time of this recording which is thursday morning eastern the day before the official start of the btc miami conference trading in the high 30 000 as opposed to 30 000 range as opposed to the 64 thousand dollar set that it was at in april and bitcoin recently saw a big sell-off on may 19th which featured the largest daily candle in bitcoin history which showed an intraday price range of 11 500 it was also the day in which an all-time high of 4.53 billion dollars in losses was hit and that's the all-time high by quite a hefty margin so for raphael and willie what do you two think is the reason for this drop you want to go first yeah willie how about you go first well um you know obviously um you know a lot of people have seen from the news that um elon musk tweeted out um that they were no longer taking payments to um you know pay to you know for the tesla sales and they cited reasons um that bitcoin was you know very very fossil fuel heavy in in its network um and so in in that view there's there was this finally there was someone who was relatively respected amongst technology actually validating a lot of one of these flood points that um uh the the mainstream media have been throwing at bitcoin which i don't think is actually valid but nevertheless um it sent a shock wave of fear through the market the the price started plummeting within seconds two minutes of that tweet and the market set up at that point was already quite soft um there was it was making a um a light recovery it was tentative and it was starting to move upwards and that that's also from a fundamental lens when you look at what was happening on the investment activity on the blockchain and then when that tweet came out it instigated severe amounts of selling not only on derivative markets and spot markets um we actually saw like significant sell-off um as coins started to flow into exchanges um so real coins got moved and they they were moving from um wallets that um were quite young um the the coins the coins held um between one to six months of age so relatively new um cameras to bitcoin is what i can tell and um i think a lot of them saw a lot of you know really nice rises in bitcoin from the 20 000 up to the 60 in the 50 to 60 range and they probably took the opportunity to take profit and so um you know we saw this this huge huge um well i just call it tidal waves of coins moving into the exchanges and um ultimately the whole derivatives market started to unwind um anyone who was long got um liquidated um so they added further selling pressure and so just we had this cascade of complete unwinding and sell-off and um what i think it went down to 30 or 29 000 um in the final when the final dust had cleared and it bounced up and then it was recovering and then china announced that um they were banning bitcoin miners and reiterated their um their stance on um no trading for their their nationals so um and that's a big thing because you know miners um are heavily located in china so um that set another wave of fear and price sold down so we're now in this situation where bitcoins um heavily discounted below fundamentals um and the markets you know attempting a a um a recovery um it's going sideways up us now rafael what do you think yeah um i second most of what willie said i think um there is um from my perspective two major driving forces here um i think i've it i don't remember once last time when i saw the market react so much to news to actual fud or you know to tweets um i think this was i saw this much more happening in in 2017 so you know with elon musk with um with the news from from china um mine shutting down china oh you know banning banning mining and so on and so forth on the one hand that um and uh what we saw on chain is that you know most of those reactions were um you know to like more new market entrants right very short term holders um that that sold um you know at losses um or actually yeah panic panic sold in eventually and the second thing i think is um that um the market uh was just highly over leveraged right um and i think um that what what willie mentioned this cascade of you know margin calls and liquidations um investors you know aiming to buy the dip when in fact you know the the sell-off wasn't uh it wasn't over yet and so sort of like cascade cascaded down and and we saw that huge drop of you know over 50 percent down to uh 29k um so so that combination um i think is this is what really um you know made all these uh all this price action happened i totally get that the market is not rational and yet for the tesla news i mean it's not like a huge percentage of bitcoin transactions were being used to buy teslas and tesla kept all the bitcoin on its balance sheet other than you know what it had sold previously um to tesla liquidity in the market which i think was just them trying to like do fancy accounting tricks but anyway um so in that sense it's sort of the re the reaction to sell based on the news doesn't make sense and is it just that that's what it is these are newbies and what they're doing doesn't make sense is that why that tweet had such an effect yeah i think it's um very much their case like we've got some new entrants they've only been holding for less than six months and then you've enjoyed a lot of price gains and then something comes along and it validates you know so-called um mr um you know the the iron man guy that that has space rockets and tesla cars says no no this is this is solid it's like this is like um you know it's a big going to be a big contributor to the world carbon emissions so um you know it's just the guy saying it is is very well respected and um for sure like that that will i think well it obviously did change the um the views of people that came in recently saying oh maybe this is um something that's not going to work in the long run and they emptied their bags and sold off yeah i think the the simple reach of um you know of a personality like elon musk just um you know is something that we hadn't we hadn't seen before right um and i can very well imagine that um it it wasn't you know just the inability of many investors to you know see the nuances of you know those those messages such as hey we're not accepting these anymore because of you know x and y reasons but actually we haven't sold and we don't plan to sell any of those um and and other investors that i bet um you know we're we're batting probably on we're betting probably on on on you know an irrational market reacting to this and and saw the opportunity and then started selling that well so here's one area where i actually disagree with you willie you know where you said you don't think the environmental issue is such a problem for bitcoin or or not even just bitcoin but proof-of-work chains in general um like i mean granted i used to cover the environment as a reporter so maybe i'm kind of tuned into that segment of the world a little bit more than the average person and and perhaps in that regard give them more weight than they have but um i feel like their concern is only just growing because you know obviously the more time we let laps without doing anything about it the worse the problem will be and the harder it will be to fix so in that regard i i actually feel like that could be quite a concern for bitcoin going forward but you seem to really not think it is merited yeah i look i'm my training as a mechanical engineer we studied renewables um and you know the thing is the cost economics of renewables is is still in its rollout stage and it's very marginal and so what bitcoin does is it makes um something that's marginal um cost competitive and so in some regards you might see an old coal powered station that's that's going to be shut down but along comes a bitcoin minuses we can mop up that energy and make it hang on for longer but there's you know there's so many places in the world where renewable energies is deploying and a mining setup can make that marginal deployment come about much sooner as the cost of renewables start to drop and we're on this arc where renewables are becoming cheaper and cheaper so eventually this whole um infrastructure of energy that the the planet's on um will eventually move to renewables like the the age of fossil fuels is coming to an end and so what i see is that like you've got this tool here that's making things that are marginal mainly renewables and it's going to accelerate that so that's the argument and people see these smoke stacks and go oh that's that's bad but they don't see this um this increase in acceleration of renewables that's facilitated by these new economics and not to mention that the the efficiency of the bitcoin network gets better as it gets bigger per capita yeah and now that china is cracking down on mining we could see the switch to renewables for mining bitcoin accelerate and so that obviously would also be good and i think what you're referencing too when you talk about a renewable energy generation and combining with bitcoin mining that is are you referring to the arc square paper that they put out talking about how the economics of that um could make you know renewables stronger i i haven't actually read their work um i think they talk about it as um maybe um like in the home or something but i'm i'm not sure this is just from first principles thinking um as an engineer um and seeing the like yeah i've i've done i used to be a renewables geek too so i did a lot of the calculations um you me and chris burniske yeah yeah yeah but i have done the calculations you know okay okay one other thing that i wanted to ask you too about who was selling at the time was um willie i think you had also it was tweeted or you wrote about this in your newsletter at that you also saw some institutional selling can you talk about that a little bit more uh yeah there was uh like uh we saw i wouldn't say institutional i'd say um you know technically they're whale selling um holders over a thousand bitcoins so that's either very very large holders that are personal and private or um institutional but like their holdings dropped um and that would they were dropping slightly before the the um the crash and so yeah that dropped um and un unlike you know normally what we see is when what we have seen in past months is whenever the institutions or whales dropped their holdings the next tier below which is like 100 to a thousand bitcoins and holdings they would gain um almost a mirror image and they were soaking up those coins um and in this case the the next tier below the the what we call the dolphins and sharks um they they were pretty steady and so um all of those coins that were being unloaded by the whales just were um had to be absorbed by um the smaller buyers which they they couldn't maintain the price at that point and so yeah um despite the interesting thing was that as this whole thing started to to cave and the price dropped and um you know crypto twitter the world was going oh bitcoins going into a beer market it you know we don't see 50 drops like this without like a beer market um that was completely different um that view was completely different on chain we saw a whole lot of new entrants come in for the very first time to buy their bitcoins and the holders of one bitcoin or less so you know fifty thousand thirty thousand dollars investment um that um those numbers started skyrocketing and so um smaller players came in to buy that dip and um so the actual user count um on the network increased as this thing was selling down and it's just that the the buying power by a sea of smaller retail it was not um sufficient um to counter act the the sell-off coming from wales and rafael glasnode recently wrote a blog post also talking about a potential slowing in institutional demand how are you all determining that yeah so what we see is um you know one is maybe the the institutional products right the gvtc the etfs um that that you know um have been have been trading at a discount for for quite a bit um now um which you know they seem seem to to to require recover slowly and we'll see we'll see how that plays out within the next couple of of um of weeks and months but um what we saw is that going into the end of 2020 um and and early early 21 we saw this huge unprecedented spike of um of number of whales in the network on chain right um and um and that started cooling off um you know in february even in in march so so that kind of shows that you know distribution of of of potential you know institutional or whale buying into um into smaller hands um and um i think um ultimately you know this this led to what willie says although we see this this huge um entrance of of of new network participants right of new users coming into into the network um they they were simply not able to to sustain the price because um because uh you know just just just uh because of the buying power as compared to to this institutionals uh this institutional rights or whale rise uh that we saw uh towards the end of the year and beginning of this year and um i also you know you guys parse out the chain metrics in so many different ways and i know both of you have also seen some trends when it comes to the movement to and from exchanges what are you seeing there and what does it say about where the market is headed yeah i think um so what we saw um you know the trend that we started seeing since uh essentially a bit over a year um since you know black thursday was was this you know general depletion of um of supply and exchanges um and and and so that of course leads to you know some sort of liquidity squeeze um there is there's not enough um essentially to to to be bought up um and so this this reduces substantially the selling pressure you know with the with the the rise to to new all-time highs and you know before and and now you know after and during this drop um um we've we've seen some we saw some some increased um um supply um on exchanges right that is now cooling off again um and so these coin movements really tell you story um about you know um investor behavior on chain and and the liquidity and potential cell pressure um that that you see there it's a bit more nuanced than people usually put it because it it really depends on on on the exchange and we've seen recently you know this sort of like this geographical difference between um you know increasing supply in in on asian exchanges decreasing supply and on u.s exchanges um right so there there might be some uh geographical um you know things in in play as well but generally um you know you can you can see this this recent cool off that um you know that that it seems like you know investors are essentially done um with the with the cell of well actually um in order to kind of paint a broader picture the three exchanges that you were talking about that are picking up coins are finance bitfinex and bittrex is bittrex i thought that was an american exchange or i'm i don't want to get ahead of myself here um but um i i thought um or at least um that they were they were operating there maybe okay but i don't want to get out i had on myself i'm pretty sure that's american is it but it's not a very large um by volume exchange the main um you know the big 800 pound gorilla is binance and um you know that's interesting because i'm like i'm seeing like you know even in the chat analysis and looking at the way in which um the price action is analyzed the selling comes from binance and the buying comes from coinbase and there's a net shift in coins and i don't know if it's some intricate arbitrage thing that's happening or whether or not um it is actually chinese the chinese selling their coins and like now that we've seen the banning um banning mining i don't know what the what's causing that but it's definitely looks like um the west is buying and the east is divesting it's hard to remember the you know what the exact wording was in the blog post um where it talked about that but i i feel like it hinted at people essentially trying to move their coins offshore maybe to avoid certain regulation or something so flight but will you feel like it's um simply that uh asians are so or the asian market is selling in that america the western market is buying yeah i i'm just guessing it theories i have no i have no real information i'd probably have to you know figure out what really happening in the industry by talking to people um rather than just looking at the sheer numbers on charts um but yeah and you know like you know back to this point of the the supply on these exchanges um the interesting thing for me is that we we've been in an era with um such strong institutional and high net worth um buying that um on-chain has come very become very dominant in the first half of this year uh because those guys move their coins off the exchanges and put it into cold storage uh but now we're in this phase where retail's really ramping up and they're coming in to buy this dip and typically the second half of these you know one in year bull markets that you know go crazy vertical um the tail end of it is very very dominated by retail and um i think the picture might be a little bit harder to read mainly because um there might be a lot of buying from retail um but they don't withdraw from exchanges as much as an institution would they they're quite happy to leave their coins on their coinbase wallet and so you'll see potentially the supply on these exchanges increase in increase because they're they're in long-term holdings by retail um and it looks like um coins are being sold in but um in actual fact they are in long-term hold by by retail who are just using their their the exchange wallet so um i think the second part of this year will be quite interesting and um i think we need to know that and that effect is happening and maybe to add on this to to add to this um i think you know one of the the major depletions that we've seen is is actually coinbase right which we all know um you know they they they have um custody uh service again also for institutionals and actually we're currently doing some research on um you know identifying some of these you know larger clusters of on-chain that seem to be very very closely related to you know the the the coin chain uh the coinbase wallets um that we see whether it's you know coinbase custody or something something else um you know hard to say but but at least it's something that um interacts very very closely with them and so um you know as willie says much of that could be related to institutional buying versus you know retail um on the other hand uh potentially more on finance and so on that um you know just leave um come in and leave their coins and on exchanges in order to to keep trading so i do want to ask another question about institutional but before we get to that just to continue on this finance thread um one of the glass nose class node posts um talked about how it could also be that people are moving coins to exchanges not simply to sell but also because they either want to rotate into each or they want to trade on chains like binance smart chain so do you think that that's also you know influenced the sell-off in the bitcoin price and would that also account for this movement we're seeing of coins going on to finance i i think so i mean i don't know what the extent of uh of of really of that how much influence it really has but but we've seen those those rotations right and and we often see this i mean this this is something typical for for bull markets as well where or people um start um you know moving into into different um altcoins into other assets um you know most recently then potentially also into into buying and smart chain which you know didn't exist in 2017 and so um i think that that those those are things that um come into play as well um and and something that we're observing closely in terms of you know how does this look like um now that we've seen this this immense dip you know is it coming back um into bitcoin right in order to to rebalance potential portfolios again and and and see how that you know what kind of effect and that this has on on the bitcoin price itself as well and so to just wrap up this institutional conversation i did also want to ask about gbtc because the story around that has shifted quite a bit in the last several months from what it really had been for years can you tell us what changes we've seen there and what that says about this current market uh sure um so um i'm you know i think i i saw this too and i i was actually a bit surprised to be honest um to see this this this huge flip um in the last couple of months um because that narrative was a big one right and this was this was you know the the essentially the the front page of hey institutions are here um the holdings of of you know gbtc were going up um for from for you know for months people were comparing it that you know they were scooping up more coins than actually uh coins were being mined and and so you know this was naturally seen as something i mean very very bullish and then that changed and that change happened actually um coincided with with the introduction of of the canadian purpose etf right and and so um people are speculating right whether investors might be you know reallocating and going into the etf rather than gbtc just because of of you know the the structure of how these funds are the trust is being set up um and and so and so the the gbtc premium um dropped uh you know and and flipped actually into a discount um and and for me this was actually going to be something that you know people must be arbitraging this right so it's just going to be you know a very short period of time and it will um you know flip positive again very very quickly but you know this has now sustained for what two months or so i i don't even know for for very very long um i think much of that has to do with you know the structure of the trust itself and um but i'm not too much too deep into that so i i cannot i cannot say whether this is this is true and whether you know um you know uh because it seems like it's a one-way road right you can you can sort of like uh you know put things in into there but it takes a lot of time to to recover them um and so um yeah um it seems it seems like that discount has cooled up a bit i mean it's still negative right but but it's it's going sideways um and and so i'm super curious to see um how that plays out specifically because the etf itself um is is also trading at this con currently uh but maybe uh willie has more more insights on that as well yeah i found it um interesting that you know the arbitrage was not closed we didn't see buyers buying bitcoin at well is it over 10 discount at one point um you don't want to buy exposure 20 20. okay 20 discount on you can either buy bitcoins on coinbase or you can buy the etf at 20 discount i found it phenomenal that sure if no one could arbitrage it because of the structure um of of that fund surely um investors would see that opportunity and and bring it back up and and maybe reduce their buying on standard exchanges but it never did and i was i don't know it was always this mystery to me um but i have seen in this start to the the dive flip or change directory and now the the premium is starting to become less negative so that's you know that that's a positive sign that's saying you know people are starting to buy um buy this this um this etf so there's there's more demand coming from that side um but i i think overall um that was a warning sign in hindsight kind of this hidden warning sign that um there was market selling in the etf the etf holds i think um was is it like three percent of all bitcoin supply it's something like that not sure um and so like that was being sold down and then it wasn't reflected into um the main market um because the way that etf is structured is that it's it's kind of like hotel california those bitcoins go in and they cannot leave um so like um the coins weren't being emptied out of that trust to be sold onto the market to to track bitcoin it just meant the the the premium drop that it was heavily discounted um so yeah it's it's it's it's an interesting one that one um like really you seem to have you seem to you seem to have a very v very very nice uh analogies to the music industry i was gonna say the same thing rick astley um this is this is great they're always important the classics right yeah i i have to agree i was just going to comment on the same thing all right so in a moment we're going to talk about other areas of the market and what they say about the bitcoin price and where it's going but first a quick word for the sponsors who make this show

the description back to my conversation with willy woo and rafael schultzcraft so we touched on this briefly um but we could probably talk about a little bit more what have you seen in derivatives trading and how has that played a role in the bitcoin price as of late oh um it's well derivatives is like um you know it's it's really was an invention by bit max in 2017 um and that got to phenomenal volumes by 2018 and so when i look at the bitcoin price i go oh look at those sheer uh walls of fear um as derivatives get unwound and i look at the chart going back to italian of 2018 i see 350 drops of sheer walls of terror and everyone um you know screaming with blood on the streets and that is the impact of derivatives as people get completely liquidated on these derivative markets with their um you know 100x leverage i think binance published that you know they do the largest volume and they published 60 do 20x or more leverage on these things um so uh the the price volatility of bitcoin has made market um jumps upwards since drifter markets have been um out and force um and yeah i think that um a lot of people um are trading these things um and i don't know it's a little bit like crack cocaine when you're on 100x leverage and it's it's fun if you can make something and then we've got now a generation of bitcoin traders um that are like experiencing this on the one hand they're learning um you know how markets work how you can you know push price around you can buy things you can liquidate other people it's like this full-on game and then um the other side you get this you know crazy kind of whipsaw in the bitcoin price which um deters long-term investors because the volatility is it's it does some pretty crazy things you know and um no different from what we just saw now with this um you know almost 50 drop um and in covert also and to put this in perspective i think um the last metric i had um i didn't read how many people got liquidated in this last crash but one of the unwinds from the the the low 60s that was the derivatives unwind and it happened when i think the miners um tripped over the power cord in in china and the hash rate dropped on the network people sold off the drives of derivatives um uh went into a cascade of liquidations and it was one million traders that got liquidated so it's um it's not it's it's you know there's only about 150 million holders of bitcoin in the world um and one million of them are trading derivatives and well that's like a generation that is learning how to trade markets at um no i i think this is a new thing this is a new phenomena when we look back on the history books there's like a generation learning how to trade all right let's raphael do you want to add anything or we can we can talk about stable coins there's quite a lot to cover when it comes to stable coins uh sure sure let's let's let's stay with coins i did see that one of the glass node posts also talked about how in the months leading up to the coinbase direct listing demand for stable coins was so high that tether usdc and dye all traded above the peg for a month so why is that can you explain yeah i think um you know people might have just been looking for you know liquidity to to exit right i mean in the end for for i feel like as we see this right the the the price of a stable coin even if it's packed to the dollar um you know is susceptible to you know just market forces and if there's huge demand for for those um you know potentially for people to you know because they're wanting to to to exit right and and to move into those coins we saw that you know the pack for for you know for usdt usdc and i um just was you know for for over a month just slightly above above the dollar pack right um wait but can you break this down for me because i don't know if i fully understand because obviously the coinbase direct listing that's you know in the traditional stock market that's like a totally separate financial system and then you're saying like people might want to exit their cryptos um so i i just i don't feel like i really understand the connection yeah yeah i mean that's i mean that that's that's one of the interpretation of of of what we saw right because it it was it was it was rather constant over over you know a period of of a month um just before before before the dip right um and and so and so this is this is this is you know looking at those at those those packs and and how they deviate from you know from from from the from the actual underlying value um is is something that essentially by chance we we saw and we're currently looking a bit more into you know some more you know systematic analysis on on how that really changes over time and you know if that actually not means anything at all or what it does um and because um it's uh it we just saw it you know across multiple uh stable coins um over the period but what would the trade be it's that they maybe themselves don't own a coin based stock or or is it for the people that do like i didn't get who it was was it the people who have coinbase stock or the people who don't i i me i think that's that's speculative um um like i i couldn't say right i mean it's a it's it's it's it's more it's something that is you know i i wouldn't go as far as to to bring in that interpretation um i'm leaning more towards you know the soul sort of like you know data-driven um you know observation of of of what that what the pack and what the price say um uh so so i i wouldn't i wouldn't want to go ahead ahead of myself there too much right so that's that's one part of that's one part of you know what we've seen um with um with respect to to stable coins the other thing is um that it has um you know the supply has has increased quite a bit right um and and we've seen this actually accelerating during this this this during drop as well right so um what this means um is is essentially that you know we believe that there is there's a lot of gun powder out there right um that that can be used essentially in these markets to to you know buy up um bitcoin and and essentially increase the um the price um so one of the metrics that we look at is the the stable coin supply ratio right that essentially compares um it compares the the supply of of uh the stable coins to to bitcoin and actually willy had a very nice modification of that adjusting for um the downtrend over over the over the last um you know over the last couple of months um and um that actually shows that we're you know historically um at the low end of it which you know could could indicate that um that you know there is um you know that there is essentially you start com comparing it historically as as you know as looking at this oscillator um a lot of dry powder to to to to you know start moving into um into bitcoin again so people are essentially buying a lot of stable coins kind of waiting for a kind of a type of bottom in the market to deploy is that what that indica okay yeah because like if you're selling out of your bitcoin and ethereum and whatever cryptos you have you're gonna sell to us dollars and you've got a choice right you can either sell to us dollars and withdraw it to your bank or um the other choice is to sell it sell it to a stable coin and keep it in digital form and that is the advantage of um you can just move it straight back into into crypto very quickly and effectively so um what we've seen is a lot of the value um go out of crypto and into stable coins sitting there on the sidelines just ready to fly back in once um the picture of price action starts to move bullish um so um it's it's a it's a good picture you know it's um like if it was bearish i would say people would want to exit their stable coins and move it to stocks or something or gold or something traditional where you you wire the money out so um and we're we're in these historic um kind of all-time highs of stable coins um when once you you you take out the skew and the in the picture um so i think it's um it's very positive for the the longer term price that we're kind of in regions where we've overextended and overselling that's my interpretation of the data um and like we've got a lot of upside and the downside is quite limited at this stage okay yeah let's talk about some of the metrics that show that um willie obviously you're well known for the nvt ratio um why don't you remind the listeners how you define that and tell us what it's currently indicating okay so um you know most people are familiar with price earnings ratio and stocks and um bitcoin doesn't really have it's not a company it doesn't have earnings it what it does have is it's a pure store value network so what it does have is um volumes of um bitcoin moving between investors so you can measure the value moving between investors as as how active that network is um as a as an investment network and you can run a ratio to its network value the market cap and that's essentially nvt ratio it's the price earnings for bitcoin um you can you know it's a fundamental equation you can put it down on first principles and you can show that price earnings of bitcoin which is mvt multiplied by the volume that oscillates that gives you a evaluation for bitcoin um just like you you might say this company has a forex multiplier from its price earnings this category or company and so you can go okay let's see what earnings it does and okay the valuation is four times um so that's that is essentially what you can do with nvt and mvt is that that pure ratio like a price earnings you can multiply it by the volume and the long-standing volume like the median and you can map it back to the price domain and so it gives us a very nice kind of trace of where the value should be based on the investment volume going through the network between individual investors and currently that sits at 55 000 even though we were not long ago in the low 30s it's it's in a historic band of undervaluation um and i notice um you know plan b's um pretty well known stock to flow ratio another fundamental based on the scarcity dynamics of the network um that's that's currently at sixty five thousand dollars so those two are pretty much in um the higher agreement of between fifty five and sixty five thousand dollars uh and also if you look at how far the price is currently deviated from that that metric it's it's also in a band where it's um all-time undervaluation um when you look back on the history so yeah i mean something that confuses me a little is if we're at this moment where bitcoin is you know quite well undervalued um historically and yet at the same time we're at this moment where you know there's this huge amount sitting in stable coins um then why aren't we starting to see kind of the beginnings of a more bullish market or maybe we are and um you know i'm just not aware that that's what you're thinking yeah i actually think that we're in a um you know a post a capitulation um reaccumulation of coins so so many whales dumped out and it'll take a bit of time for those coins to be reaccumulated and i i think once the price action starts to tip um properly bullish so maybe a little bit of sideways and price action starts to look good i think a lot of those stable coins um will come back in and i like all these metrics are telling me is like we are very overextended and in the cell down and um historically when we are below these fundamentals the recovery is quite quick um the only times where the recovery is slow tends to be when the price was way above fundamentals and it's taken a long time for the price to come back down and recover so i think the time to a lot of this is telling me the time to recovery is going to be faster than maybe what we saw in 2019 took months after that 6 000 to 3 000 um drop um and i think it'll be a lot like um the covert white swan crash in in 2020 um we dropped below fundamentals there and we recovered in a matter of about eight weeks i think yeah this actually reminds me something i wanted to touch on at the very beginning because one thing that surprised me was that neither of you mentioned that the may 19th cell sell-off was kind of like right around the time that taxes were due here in the us and i did wonder you know because i did see other people saying that that could be a contributing factor do you guys both think that that could have been as well i'm actually i actually don't know too much about you know text behavior in the u.s i'm not a i'm not another resident there um i mean if it is um and and people often point to that uh right in when when when spring is here um that that it does have an effect and uh and always when we see those dips um around the that period right um on a yearly basis essentially um it's it's being pointed out as you know one potential factor um for the for the for the you know for the corrections for the dips and then for those price drops um from my perspective though you know this year um you know uh the the black thursday last last year and so on um they they definitely go beyond that right um and i think there's you know these these more more obvious factors that led to you know those more extreme corrections um than than they usually happen um but um but but overall it seems like you know there is you know there is some some effect um uh due to you know tax season and in the us um on the price um i from my perspective i i wouldn't you know over overestimate it too much um but um but but it's probably probably plays some role yeah i'm just realizing i asked two non-americans this question yeah but i don't know that is that thing walk away in may i think um now i know it's maybe because of the texture but it's normally in april it was only pushed because of the pandemic one month oh okay yeah because it's normally april 15th and this year it was may 17th wow i can't remember why but it has something to and it doesn't seem to backtrace that that great you know like a lot of times in april it's climbing quite rapidly in the bitcoin price history so no i don't sure even like now i think we're in the era where a lot of people were choosing to not sell their um their bitcoins to um to pay down taxes because that incurs even more taxes um they might just collateralize it and get a block fire loan um so you know you know more leveraging system but i've i noticed that people are doing that um rather than to incur a tax event on capital gains with their bitcoins yeah yeah and i was going to say it could be a bunch of the d5 yield farmers but since there isn't a huge overlap with the bitcoin community um that may not be the case um all right one other of your favorite metrics willie is sopr i actually don't know what that exactly stands for i know how you define it but can you give us the definition and explain what it is that that says about the market now sure this is renato's metric who called it spent output um price ratio um so profit ratio sorry profit ratio um yeah so essentially um let's say we'll pick a day and we'll i'll get someone to count um every coin that passes between um let's say investors where should we just look at between wallets but let's say the ideal case is investors glasnote actually does it for investors um and you go all right those coins moved and you can because the blockchain tells you when those coins arrived in that wallet you know the price that the seller sold those coins for and now you know today this is the price they sold it for so you can get a profit um on that that guy sold for you know you know maybe fifty thousand dollars of profit for all those coins and that person sold at a loss because they bought it a higher pricing and so you kind of do a ratio of the profit that is transacted during that day and you can say you get this readout you get this chart and um typically what you see is this chart you know in a bull market um the price runs up higher and higher and higher so anyone who's transacting coins is obviously um moving coins that are now at vast profit and so once the price starts to tip um you know like the people just are now like selling their coins and some of them are selling at a loss because it's it's now possible to sell a loss because it's coming down in price they bought earlier when it was higher um and generally what you see is um you know the as it goes down more more people sell because they're taking the profit that they've got on the table while it's still in hand so this is this profit taking coming as sopa goes down and down and down and down until it hits the 1.0 line which is like there's on average the coins that are moving between investors in the market are no longer carrying any profit and so typically in a bull market no one wants to sell a loss so the selling stops and the price bounces up so soap is a really nice kind of chart that tells us you know when does the profit taking end when it hits the 1.0 there's a high chance the market will no longer sell at a loss from a bull market um and so yeah sober in a nutshell all right so we're running out of time so i want to touch on a few things um before we wrap up but one is obviously a huge trend in bitcoin the last like nine months 10 months has been um corporate treasuries buying a bitcoin and after this winter's bitcoin for corporations event that microstrategy held i kind of expected we would start to see you know after some time period another steady drum beat of corporate news about bitcoin being added to treasuries but it's actually kind of died down a bit and i wondered if you're seeing any evidence on chain or even just hearing from the industry you know where that's going is that a trend that has kind of died out or is it just something that takes a while because we're talking about corporate treasuries here or where do you think that is headed so from my perspective um it's something that that that will continue right in the continuous the thing is that you know what you hear um is obviously you know publicly traded companies um and and only those that started those processes very early on um to get those you know bitcoin on their balance sheets um we have to remember that those are you know those are processes that you know take take quite some time right it's not it's not like hey you know let's let's let's let's buy and then that's it um and so um you know now that the infrastructure is is essentially there that that you know wasn't simply there a couple of years ago and for sure not during the last bull run um this this is now possible for those right and i think what we heard um so far are those that that really started um you know setting up their bitcoin strategies very early on um and from from what we saw um on chain um this might have you know cooled off a bit when you look at at least when you look at you know large whale entities on chain i mean of course they're not always you know one mapped uh one-to-one um many of those um you know are not holding their coins in in self-custody but but your services for that um but um i think that um that we'll hear much much more of those um in the upcoming months um and and i think so because um i i believe that you're you're probably risking a lot if you don't have a proper bitcoin strategy nowadays um and also because you know what we what we hear out there are the the publicly trade companies um but um i mean us as class note like you wouldn't believe like what conversations were having at times right um there is there is hedge funds there's family offices there is big high net worth individuals there's really you know a lot of like big private folks that that are looking into this and if those are you can imagine how many how many others are so i think there is there's there's a lot of things going on behind closed doors and it's it's from my perspective it's it's just a matter of time until these start popping up more and more um and announcing you know what their holdings really do you want to add anything uh yeah i i'd also think that there's that again i agree it's the timing thing um you know like i believe michael saylor said that it took a microstrategy six months to get um prepared to to actually deploy into bitcoin and they were very fast but most most companies would take nine months or even longer and so i kind of started the the clock ticking from when that conference kicked off and said well let's let's go six to nine months probably nine months um and i was like that's going to be very very interesting if if those guys really do um deploy and it is going to be in that time frame we're looking at a fourth quarter of this year of um buying from large in large ticket sizes which is typically what we kind of expect that's the time where the bull market starts to wane the momentum starts to die out around there but if those guys come in i'm i'm thinking that's gonna be and make a very interesting um fourth quarter because um you know most of the models predict or just i'm guessing that like past cycles we we might top out near the fourth quarter um so it's an interesting timing if if this this money starts coming in all around the end yeah we'll have to see so one other kind of wild card is that i did notice in some of the recent analyses glass node has referenced holders rotating in each as i mentioned before and i'm sure you're well aware ethereum is going to be instituting probably the biggest change to its monetary policy ever and it's one that many people believe will make eth deflationary which in my from this is my personal perspective but i feel like then this is the first time where bitcoin and ether kind of will compete in that regard because even though there has been a narrative that they're competitive or whatever that you know to my mind they're kind of just different things and if you're if you really understand what you're doing with your money then when you put your money in one versus the other it's for different reasons that's my perspective i'm sure many people don't actually really do the research to understand on that level but anyway still given this change to it's monetary policy how do you expect that that will impact the price of bitcoin going forward now that they will compete uh you know in this kind of deflationary sense yeah i think um in terms of a um you know a store of value asset um i think ethereum has been competing um for a long time and now even as early as 2017 i was very young back then but now we've had maybe getting on six years of price action history we've had a lot of a lot of the kind of properties you want to see in a store of our asset develop inside the ethereum network um even though we're you know it's like a smart contracts network and we have d5 running on it i think a lot of the the value that has accrued to ethereum is really people wanting to hold it locking that up um and i i think yeah it it certainly does impact the um the valuation metrics if you're going to reduce the inflation um significantly yeah i think that's that's what i'll say is that it is developing those lindy effects and i have seen that um you know it is becoming a choice um for corporate treasuries um it's starting to yeah where previously the conversation was just bitcoin and is that because of this change i i would not know i would not know um i think that i for me looking at this as an analyst i go well actually if you look at if you look at the sharp ratio the risk of adjusted return on this network it's very similar to bitcoin um and i think that the traditional world is very very um comfortable with diversifying and having baskets rather than all in one asset raphael do you have an opinion yeah i think yeah i i i'm more on the side of of you know um those are not competing networks um i'm not i'm not quite sure if you know this this this will really grab so much of of of bitcoin um i think bitcoin is still you know regarding its history regarding its simplicity or regarding you know this this very you know um static monetary policy that is you know has been established now for for 12 years it's it's still something that um that that from my perspective and where i believe you know serious money at this stage um is is probably you know more more inclined to to deploy um because um you know ethereum has just made other choices right and you know this change is is is experimental right um you know but i mean it it will have to see what what like how much and how what it actually does to it um it goes into that direction right it points towards um you know doing something similar um and and you know making the assets uh you know deflationary but um but but it's still still still uh still i still view it as as as you know something something you know yeah on the sides um and not not competing and and you know um grabbing grabbing capital off of of bitcoin at this stage at least um and we have to observe you know how this actually plays out um and what it does with the ecosystem i think a lot of interest though comes from the fact that um there's just so much development happening happening in the in this um in this ecosystem right um so many things being built on top of it and in so much more things that you can actually do now holding ethereum um in those decentralized protocols then you can you know uh in in bitcoin um and that makes it very interesting for many um investors i believe yeah yeah when mark cuban came on my show he felt like because of the number of things that one can do with ethereum that that might be uh the coin that more people end up holding which is kind of interesting and you know that for me was a fresh idea um all right so for you what are you looking for to determine whether you know when we'll uh flip back to a bull market or do you think we already are and um going forward why don't we say uh august and then end of year what would be your price predictions for those two moments in time well i'm actually very careful with press predictions as everyone is probably so my my answers to this are usually a bit more fuzzy um i think um we we haven't exited a bull market at this stage from an on-chain perspective from a structural perspective there is there's little that points to that um so um as of now i still believe that you know this is a correction a big one within the bull market but we're we're still on track um seems to be you know looking a bit um like uh like that like the 2013 double top if you will if you take you know the 65k is the first stop um and and now this uh you know this this correction a bit longer i feel like i'm uh um i don't know if i'm as optimistic as as willie is with uh you know how fast we'll will we'll go back up um i at this stage i feel that um you know the downside risk right now is very very small but um i still wouldn't be very surprised if we get another burst of pain and another kind of you know shakeout um before you know we we start we start um you know properly um uh you know regaining um the the trends the bull market trend essentially over the next couple uh weeks um of and months but um yeah structurally i think we're on track and um it's um it's it's as long as the data doesn't tell me anything else um i i remain bullish and um and we'll see where we end up um towards the end of the year willie what about you yeah very similar the structure is not bearish if this is a beer market it's the weirdest weirdest done beer market i've ever seen um and if it keeps dropping from here like it's like what's wrong with this network is it broken it's um we're very very oversold um these people joining we um you know we haven't even dropped from a high mania phase which is very consistent with four bear markets they they ended it they end with a bull market pop and then we we have to revisit fundamentals yeah we were already at fundamentals when this thing sold off so i think that we'll rebound relatively well soon niche and i don't think it's going to be multi-multi months longer than two months um but you know anything can happen in these markets um yeah i think that will we'll we'll we'll climb back up um i'm pretty confident that there's nothing in the data that shows me this is this is um serious um you know the most bearish thing i can find on the network is that capital was moved um out of the network in terms of realize cap which is you know good metric on how much this stored there and so that's dipped quite a bit and i haven't seen that before in the middle of the bull market um so there was some significant sell-offs um but just remind listeners what realized cap means it's it's a sum of all um all the coins sitting in wallets at the price that investors paid um for those coins um so that's dropped that means that people sold higher up and now realize kept is no longer capturing a higher value of those those extra high coins and this is one of the things that typically rises very easily and very seldom doesn't drop and it has dropped at a level which um is consistent of a start of a beer market um but once again there's it does not agree with some much more telling metrics like um the number of new entities that we're seeing on the network and the number of users coming on board some of the companies that i have the data on so the yeah the customers are coming in new users coming in that's a bull market it's just a matter of when um those coins will be reabsorbed and bought and held um which and so if you were gonna give your august end of your price predictions what would those be oh august is tough but like um i'm looking at you know i have a model which is just um a moving average of um you know the market cap and you tweak a little um it captures all the tops in history it probably won't catch this one because everyone's looking at it now but that's that was prior to this this crash um that was starting to look like it was winding up to three four even five hundred thousand dollars near the end of this year now it's starting to reduce its trajectory um looks like it'll comfortably reach 200 to 200 it might reach 300 but we have to see how that develops so you know once again it's like i'm just naming this model i'm just reading what what it's pointing at but it keeps changing so i'm safe there right okay all right well we'll have to see what happens at that time and circle back so um thank you both so much for coming on unchained where can people learn more about each of you and your work okay i'm on uh
