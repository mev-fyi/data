thank you so much and I look forward to hearing from you all hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the podcast that reveals how the marquee names in crypto are reacting to make stuff headlines and gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon I'm your host flourishing in response to the challenging times crypto TOCOM is waiving the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases download the crypto dot-com app today today's guest is Yan Lieberman co-founder of Delphi digital welcome yan Thank You Laura thanks for having me Delphine digital released a massive report on Bitcoin time to the having this week it began with the current macroeconomic conditions that seemed favorable to Bitcoin such as quantitative easing capital controls and investors search for safe haven assets the section of the reports that you wrote concerned themselves more with analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain and one of the metrics he analyzed was the Bitcoin wealth distribution over time what did you find there yeah so we tracked the wealth distribution in in two ways so the first way was those this distribution of supply by wallet size meaning what percentage of the overall supply fell into a certain wallet so you know wallets holding one to ten Bitcoin a certain percentage of supply was in those what percentage of supply was in wallets holding ten to 100 and and so on and so forth and so we tracked it you know back to inception and and it's interesting you can kind of see the the kind of distribution that happens on the the tail end and so wallets between 0.0 0.0 1 Bitcoin was as granular as we went and that's basically one to ten dollars let's just use the round number of $10,000 Bitcoin so realistically sorry about 10 to 100 dollars and well that's somewhat of a useful kind of bucket to think about it and it's a bit too small in terms of thinking about retail adoption so you know you kind of look at the next the next line up which is 1/100 to 1/10 which is 100 to $1,000 and you start to kind of get into the slightly more retail investor position but then I think the the 1/10 to 1 and 1 to 1 to 10 so it's you know investors between holding between a thousand and a hundred thousand I think the retail kind of fits in that bucket and we've seen a consistent consistent growth in those in those numbers and so if you're thinking about the amount of supply that's in wallets holding less than ten bitcoins so you know what percentage of overall supply is in wallets that are holding less than about $100,000 and and that that number has grown considerably from the beginning of 2015 where it was 6% where and at this point we're up to almost 14 and a half percent and I think that's significant in a handful of ways one because I think this kind of understates the distribution in two ways one the the the value of that Bitcoin back in 2015 was much less so realistically you know you the fact that you're starting to see while price increases you're still seeing these lower buckets fill up considerably I think that's that's very positive and at the same time they're the growth in coins on exchanges as obviously has picked up and so that kind of understates the distribution because while everyone is encouraged to kind of keep their own coins you know you know your keys not your coin and then that kind of ideology a lot of people are made some are lazy some just don't care some really prefer the convenience and and these like you know keeping your coins on something like a coin base isn't that risky it's it's not advice but realistically you you should be fine and so even though you're seeing this disbursement you're seeing the the amount of these smaller wallets grow despite the fact that there's still a considerable amount of coins that are held on exchanges and when they're held on in exchange they're held in in the exchanges hot wallet which holds everyone's coins so it mixes all of these would be smaller wallets into one larger one and that's why you kind of get an understatement on the lower end of the curve and when you look at Whale activity as well like if we're if we're gonna be talking you know just in general about this wealth distribution I was curious to know at that upper end like what are you noticing in terms of their activity absolutely and so so the one way was the distribution of quantity per per wallet eyes but the other was just the quantity of each of these wallets so in that that's kind of where the whale accumulation distribution kind of thing happens where while we saw these smaller wall to pick up we also saw considerable growth in the quantity of wallets that hold one thousand and ten thousand Bitcoin and and so realistically the exchanges are popping up but not at rapid rates so you're not really seeing there's so many of these extra wallets come up but so with the way we kind of think about these these are a lot of the earlier investors that are effectively smart money and you can if you kind of plot the quantity of wallets that hold over 1,000 Bitcoin and you plot that against price you can really see how the amount of these wallets grows when there's after a you know a post peak and the the multi month multi-year sell-off you'll see those wallets accumulate and then as price starts to pick up you'll see those wallets till you see the quantity of those wallets decline and so you kind of see how these individuals will accumulate during declines and then redistribute and basically for profit in these rallies and so while we've seen this you know even just as much as just as recently as this past cycle we're now at a point where we're starting to see or we've been seeing strong accumulation and growth and the quantity of wallets that are holding at least a thousand Bitcoin interesting yeah so it sounds like in at both ends there's kind of ha tooling activity I guess you could say amongst both the retail and the whales yeah absolutely and and even just tracking you know age of these et exo's and kind of thinking about it that way it really shows how that's how that accumulation is happening and you also tried to deduce whether bitcoin was being used as a store of value by looking at the addresses that you believed were multi-sig wallets what did you find when you looked at that sure so multi-sig wallets are wallets where you need multiple signatures in order to move coins in and out basically it's the simplest way to describe it and there's different types it's usually you need some kind of a majority so two of three three or five but what what happens is these when transactions go into these wallets they leave a certain kind of signature so you can basically track the amount of tokens that are held in these multi-sig wallets and when you think of these types of wallets they represent some kind of custody solution or some kind of advanced way of of holding Bitcoin more securely than then your normal retail investor would hold and so you can track all those different types of wallets and just looking back even starting at the end of 2016 early 2017 you see a really big up taking those wallets and an interesting thing is in order to know type of wallet it's sat in the Bitcoin has to leave so you basically get this bucket of unspent Bitcoin and so meaning Bitcoin that was sent to a multi-sig but it hasn't left and so if you think about what that kind of means and East art to see that accumulation really pick up and right now you know we're sitting at almost 4 million Bitcoin held in multi SIG's that are unspent and almost five across all of them so I think it's just another really good barometer of institutional adoption just based on the security measures that they would have to you know go through it to kind of store that Bitcoin and speaking of institutional interests you did also look at how interest from them has from institutional investors has changed and what did you see there it's definitely I think just Cove it and everything that's happening the world has accelerated a lot of timelines both in terms of just I guess without kind of going too far down that rabbit hole and in terms of just in terms of economics facing your you're really seeing an acceleration in the the Fed the printing of money and kind of the need to to support the need to provide funding to kind of support the population right now and so with all this printing people are starting to think about what does this mean for various asset classes so with equities you kind of see the disconnect between the economy and markets and and what that means and then a lot of the macro players are thinking about all right so in in this kind of environment you get with all this printing but lack of demand you you see some kind of deflationary situation but as the printing continues you assume that inflation would kind of eventually rear Ted and so people are starting to think about how do I invest in order to position myself well for that and and the focus is one of the focuses has been on scarce assets so you see a lot of macro investors talking about moving into gold and now you're kind of seeing the next frontier and and the big big one was obviously Paul Tudor Jones coming out and really talking about how he's putting almost 2% of his net worth which is I think that was about 100 200 million into into Bitcoin and then also speaking about it with such conviction and and really I think opening the door for a lot of other macro managers he's almost taking the the career risk away from individuals for investing and now you're gonna have a lot of these other macro managers think like they're gonna the Bitcoin conversations going to come up again they're gonna have to revisit their thesis whether they were bullish or bearish and I think it's it's just it's now going to be a lot more of a common conversation in those investment committees and kind of what what I think could happen is you know a Bitcoin goes from being a a fringe investment to almost II can sense this one over the next ten years as as these macroeconomic factors play out yeah and you know just one small comment is also I think Paul Tudor Jones was investing in Bitcoin futures which is slightly different but one other thing I wanted to mention was that in your report you also did get some data from greyscale on flows into gbtc which is basically like a more like a traditional asset that does represent the price of Bitcoin and inflows into that were at about three hundred ninety million in dollars in quarter one which was more than double from the previous quarter and the average weekly investment was thirty million as opposed to five million in quarter two of 2019 alright so in a moment we'll further dive into the facts from the Delphi Digital Bitcoin report but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible in response to the challenging times crypto TOCOM is introducing three measures to help the community first the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases will be waived for the next three months second you can now get up to ten percent back by using the MCO Visa card on food and grocery shopping lastly you could buy gift cards on the crypto comm F from merchants like Whole Foods Safeway Burger King and more and get 20% back on food and 10% back on groceries download the crypto dot-com app today back to my conversation with Yan Lieberman so in terms of you know talking about the other end of the spectrum we talked about institutional but then also what did you see in terms of retail adoption particularly from cash app sure cash app is one of the really easy vehicles for retail to kind of move into into Bitcoin and so it's always it's been a pretty useful barometer for purely retail interest in the space and because squares public company they really solve all the numbers and so if you just look back and it's the way that they kind of price it is they'll show revenue and gross profit with gross profit being the demand I'm sorry with it's the show revenue and like in cost of goods and basically their cost of goods is what they charge is what the clients are looking to spend on Bitcoin and then the revenue is basically that money spent plus a fee then their which is what they collect in margin and so you can use their cost of goods for from Bitcoin as basically a direct indication of by pressure and so a fun exercise to kind of do is is to map that against the dollar value of issuance during each quarter and so you can kind of do a back-of-the-envelope type just thought process of how much of issuance is being offset by direct Square purchases and to an extent you know it's not to say that these people who are buying on square aren't selling at all either but this value purely represents buying but it's not to say that they aren't selling but realistically a lot of the individuals investing now especially on the retail side I don't see them you know selling after a thousand I think because of how late a lot of these a lot of this money is coming in it's it's a I'm sure if you know if we move up to the to the teens a lot of these people like it because it's just a lot of return but at this point I don't really expect there I think this is a bit one directional and so in terms of the percentage of issuance that's been offset by square that number has been growing we're in q3 of 2019 it was at 10% in you four was almost that it was at like 12 and then in the past quarter twenty percent of Bitcoin issuance was effectively offset by square purchases and so we're really starting to see that number grow and that's been you know positive one to see that's amazing that's such a huge percentage one other thing you liked how it was Bitcoin exchange inflows and outflows and I wondered so when inflows exceed outflows what is that signify and then you know seeing with vice versa when outflows are greater than inflows and also what trend are we seeing now absolutely and so typically we will track both Bitcoin and stable coin inflows and outflows and you know Bitcoin inflows to exchanges are typically bearish because there's only the main reason you're sending your Bitcoin to in exchanges is to sell and then the weak and then for stable coin it's it's the convert is the opposite we're sending stable coins to in exchange could be a proxy for future demand so with with Bitcoin specifically over the past several years we've just consistently had net inflows to exchanges and that's not to say that people are constantly selling I think the massive growth in stable I'm not unstable coins in altcoins in material and and all these other coins that people like to speculate on or invest in because you have to buy those with Bitcoin most of the time on these exchanges that's also been a lot of the natural reason that people have been selling Bitcoin is sending bitcoins to exchanges but again that trend has been consistently growing we're in the beginning of 2017 there was less than half a million Bitcoin on the exchanges and then at the very beginning of this year there was a bit over two and a half million BTC on exchanges but just this past quarter for the first time in a long time we've seen or in basically ever in terms of you know having this trend happen for a few months we've seen net outflows so we've seen Bitcoin leaving exchanges and I think that's you know it's decidedly bullish in the sense that you you you really can't sell your Bitcoin without moving into an exchange and so there's an overwhelming majority of time when someone's removing it from the exchange its with the intention of holding and so I think you kind of see this confluence of the fact that a lot of people moving away from exchanges you're seeing a lot of this retail demand start to kick in through all these avenues and and all of these pipes are kind of really set up to to facilitate all of this demand you're seeing a lot of the longer-term holders really hold and just the amount of overall supply that's freely traded start to go down and so I think you're all of this kind of comes together into a point where now incremental demand will have a much more significant impact on price and so there's not a lot of people that are in the space right now that are really looking to get out it's it's it's it's tough to be in right now and not be overly bullish so I think you have a lot of people in the space that are kind of continuing to invest and at the same time you've created all these avenues for external capital come in both from the retail and institutional side and then on top of that you have the the macroeconomic landscape that really shows that how how scarce that asset could be valuable in a situation where you know every every currency is being kind of debased and so speaking of people not spending their bitcoins you also did an analysis of unspent transaction outputs or UT exo's when you do that analysis what are you looking for and what did you find here in terms of you know where a Bitcoin is right now sure so one of the one of the big things we like to do is is look at the relative gates of the UT X oh so you can kind of use these use the exo data in handful of ways one of the ways to use it just on its own is by analyzing the age so whenever a bitcoin is sent a UT XO is created it's an unspent transaction output basically means if I have 50 Bitcoin $50 worth of Bitcoin and I want to send you 40 what happens is I send 50 and then I get 10 back and so every time one of those is created it's dated based on the first block it was included and what that means is you can when when you aggregate all the UT exo's and and by age you can get an understanding of when different parts or when I guess the last time different portions of the overall supply have been moved so you know X percent of the supply has been moved in the last three months certain percent between three and six months and you can go out as far as seven to ten years and so we like to track this to kind of on a slightly longer time frame to get an understanding of how these these holder flows are taking place and then when you map them against price it really shows a clearer picture of how you see the long term and holder sellout on rallies and then and I don't mean short-term rallies I mean these you know longer cyclical rallies and so we're at a situation now where we've we've been in that strong accumulation phase and you're seeing the amount of supply that's been moved in the past year really reaching lows and rather thought differently the amount that hasn't moved in at least a year reaching its peaks and it kind of really coincides with the distribution of the supply during the last having in 2016 almost to an eerie level in terms of the exact percentages and so it's definitely interesting dynamic and I think it it kind of feeds in that whole narrative and an understanding of how people are starting to really hold on in their Bitcoin and and aren't looking to kind of take advantage of these smaller trays and I think at the same time that's why you're seeing so much growth in derivatives as well it's it's been you because you have this this kind of battle not battle but it's a combination the holder base is a combination of holders and obviously traders at the same time and so the the traders themselves are the ones dictating price but the amount of liquid supply that's moving around that's basically pricing the whole network is coming down and so that's just a function of a lot of these other individuals holding and so you that's why you see a lot of growth in derivatives products and ways that people can speculate without actually having the own Bitcoin and so I think as the the like I guess the scarcity element can kind of continues as people hold you you factor in that incremental demand that's coming in and I think it really positions things well too I've helped price go up basically yeah and say one last piece I really wanted to dive into is the market value to realized value I'm gonna just full-on admit I had a hard time understanding this part of your analysis so can you explain what that is and the RV and what you found when you looked at it sure so Marv it's a it's a ratio that that's kind of used to think about how the the overall positioning of holders so the numerator market value is just market cap and the denominator realized value is so every time a Bitcoin is sent and you at UT UT X I was created and then if Majan if you were to based on the time that that UT EXO moved that's the price of that Bitcoin so if if somebody sent this bitcoin several years ago when the price was you know a thousand dollars that's the relative value of that you see XO so it's up it's based on it is basically an aggregation of the underlying of all the Bitcoin in in existence and rather than the price being total supply times current price it's it's a each individual you take so based on when it was last moved that's the price and then you aggregate it that way so thought differently it's basically the that's why it's called realized value so it's it's it can be thought of when the the reason that you kind of use this ratio of market value to realized value is so realized value represents the value of the Bitcoin based on when it was last moved or bought and sold which is kind of thought of interchangeably there but the idea is that once realize once market cap really exceeds realized value then you you you have a situation where there's the the aggregate holder base is sitting on a lot of unrealized gains because these Bitcoin will last moved at you know a huge discount to where the market is currently and that's not that doesn't necessarily apply to everyone but in aggregate it's a it's a pretty good measure of the the profit the position of profit of the of the network basically and the way that the cycles work is the MV RV ratio basically it increases it usually oscillates between 1 & 4 but these periods these oscillation periods are very long so the last time it crossed above 4 was in the rallyin in 2017 and then when it typically when it falls below 1 which means there's the the overwhelming majority the network the last time the Bitcoin was moved at you know at a certain price that's higher than the current market price now that usually means there's been a massive sell-off and and effectively the market has been oversold and those usually create really fortunate buying opportunities but what it basically means is how much unrealized gain there is in the aggregate base and so it's a really good barometer of just long-term cycles and and it even fell below 1 in this most recent sell-off in March so it's it's a very useful barometer in that in that way but it's it's kind of starting to trend up and so unless on the following slide we kind of did a distribution year verses here and so it's tough to completely describe but basically it shows you the the quantity of Bitcoin and each amount they're priced at so you can kind of get an idea of when prices ascending you're usually going to have a situation where the market value is starting to really exceed realized value because you know market value of the whole network will increase at the current price whereas realized value is fixed at the price when it was last moved which in in a situation where price is increasing the realized value is typically going to be below the market value and and it's it's a really good way to kind of figure out how overextended we are potentially in each direction and and you know kind of create a another way to to support your thesis on whether or not you should be you know bearish or bullish in a specific situation okay all right so if you're saying it's like kind of similar to where we were in 2016 then essentially it's like in that position where it's moving in the direction of one of those phases in which more people would stand a profit if they or to sell but we're not there yet right yeah it's exactly it usually trends just because bitcoin itself it like the biggest explainer of bitcoins price if you you know use any kind of model it's bitcoins price because it's such a very momentum heavy asset and so while it is in a position of profit right now it's more so to indicate like that this is the direction we're trending in and and then it's it's a good barometer when we've seen to be overextended in one direction over another or another it's a good indicator of how relatively overextended we are and and so right now the idea is that it's showing that the trend is beginning to kind of go in the in the direction of up but it's still very early and so if you think about where this indicator stands relative to previous cycles it's it's about where we were in mid to late summer of 2016 yeah and I don't want anybody to interpret my comment is being a positive in any way because it was also turning upward before March but then obviously it went back down to below one so who knows what will happen alright well thank you so much for coming on the show is great having you on unconfirmed thank you very much for having it's always a pleasure time for the news recap first the biggest news the third Bitcoin having occurred on Monday so happy Bitcoin having week if you haven't yet be sure to check out the episode I do it with Amanda Fabiano of fidelity and Christopher Ben Dixon of coin shares on the third bitcoin having now for the rest of the news first headline JPMorgan Chase banks coinbase and Gemini oh my times have changed for years crypto companies have struggled to obtain and maintain banking relationships but now JPMorgan Chase the second largest bank in the world has taken on crypto currency exchanges coinbase and Gemini as customers Paul Vania of the Wall Street Journal reported quote coin base in Gemini had to go through a long vetting process to get JP Morgan's approval the fact that both are regulated by multiple parties played a big part in the approval process Gemini obtained a trust charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services in 2015 coin base is registered as a money services business with Financial Crimes enforcement network or FinCEN and also has a specialized license for crypto businesses called the bit license from the New York DFS both are licensed as money transmitters in multiple states this news is also notable because in 2017 JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon had criticized Bitcoin as quote a fraud that will quote eventually blow up next headline reddit tries out community points on etherium participants in the our cryptocurrency and our fortnight PR subreddits who have about 1 million members apiece now have the ability to earn points on those subreddits as etherium based tokens the points for our cryptocurrency will be called moons and the ones for our fortnight VR will be called bricks you can earn points by quote submitting quality posts and comments which is basically the community deciding how many points someone deserves they can also be spent on badges custom emojis and gifs or gifts I really don't know how to pronounce this and I think the Internet has not decided either and when you buy them the points will be burned additionally points will be used in voting which will have two sets of results one in which each member gets one vote as well as the weighted count in which members get a vote for every point they have reddit explains by giving weight to votes community points lets a community see how core contributors feel about a question or a decision reddit also launched a vault which would be familiar to any of you who have used a cryptocurrency web or app wallet before and of course it's the same situation where if you lose your phone or private keys you might lose access to your points so reddit recommends creating a secure encrypted backup of your private key on reddit using a password different from your reddit password or you can also manually protect your vault using a seed phrase that you store in a secure place such as a password manager it'll be interesting to see how redditors who are new to crypto manage being their own bank other details that may be of interest community points is currently in beta and will be on aetherium x' rinkeby test net throughout the summer eventually the points will be migrated to the etherium main net and for the time being reddit will pay the gas fees since redditors may not own ether reddit itself will receive 20% of the tokens distributed and each shape of coin will approach a cap of 250 million next headline and there's a reason that I've just opposed these two stories which you will see in a minute telegram gives up on ton in a blog post practically seething with frustration telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov announced that the messaging company which has been engaged in a legal battle with regulators has decided not to proceed with the ton network but not after making a litany of explanations practically in disbelief over court judgments that did not go in telegrams favor for instance he compares Grahams the cryptocurrency telegram was trying to build to gold and seems incredulous that a US Court would also block grams from being distributed globally not just in the US he says quote sadly the US judge is right about one thing we the people outside the US can vote for our precedents and elect our Parliament's but we are still dependent on the United States when it comes to finance and technology meanwhile coin desk reports that some investors are discussing suing telegram one investor Vladimir smirk Asst head of crypto start-up token box told coin desk quote we are considering filing a lawsuit as the money pavel durov cent spent on the project caught investors nothing well at least it would be fair to talk about getting telegrams equity for example however coin desk writes quote bubbles are of has famously been unwilling to dilute his ownership of telegram and according to company spokesperson Remy von an equity distribution is definitely not on the table now next headline some ether wails may be departing for Bitcoin according to data from glass node the seven-day average of the number of unique addresses holding 10,000 either more filled at 1,050 down 6% from December and the lowest level since January 2019 in contrast the number of Bitcoin wale addresses has increased to a hundred and eleven at the end of April which is the highest level since August 2019 some analysts speculate that this may be due to an anticipated bull run following the third Bitcoin having this past Monday however others believe that the eath may also have been moved in to defy where whales could for instance earn money from lending meanwhile the number of addresses containing 32 or more ether is at an all-time high the minimum balance needed to become a validator and eath 2.0 is 32 e 'the next headline post having that the coin hash rate is declining Larry Cermak of the block tweeted a graph showing that the 90 block average for block x is now at 14 minutes on the Bitcoin blockchain additionally miners who were making about 18 million dollars a day with 4% of that coming from fees before the having made only 7.9 million dollars on Wednesday with 13 percent of that coming from transaction fees we will have to keep watching this space next headline conflicts of interest

with for the week is a piece that matt wong of paradigm wrote up on why as he puts it quote never before have we seen more interested in Bitcoin and its potential as a digital companion to gold there is nothing in this PDF that would be new for most of you listeners and he even says quote this paper does not claim any novel insight and said it instead it is a summary of the conversation we often have with investors seeking to understand Bitcoin for the first time I'm just sharing it with you all because I know a lot of people in this face are often looking for ways to explain Bitcoin and newbies and I think this could be really useful on that score it's very clearly written it has subheads it has bullets and it just might come in handy for some of you all right thanks for tuning in to
