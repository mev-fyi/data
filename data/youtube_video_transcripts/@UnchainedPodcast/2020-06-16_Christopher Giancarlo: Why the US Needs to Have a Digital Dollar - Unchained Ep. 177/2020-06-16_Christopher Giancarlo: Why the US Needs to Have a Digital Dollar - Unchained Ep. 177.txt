help go to www.kellman.law with 1l not 2 or email them at info kellman.law chris it's so nice to see you again and i know we have limited time and a lot to discuss so i'm actually going to and and this i swear it's i'm not trying to um promote my own podcast however um i did an interview with chris back in the fall which goes over a lot of his history he was involved in many of the pivotal moments in the trajectory of bitcoin and its rise in adoption by wall street frankly um even you know in its classification as a commodity which uh that was i think you know something that a lot of people in the industry were concerned about um however so uh despite all that history we don't quite have time to go into all of it because there's just so much more to discuss right now chris has been working on something really big since leaving the cftc which as uh is the digital dollar project which is a partnership between the digital dollar foundation which chris you founded with your brother charles giancarlo and with david gorfin who's the ceo of gattaca horizons which is a fintech advisory firm and daniel also was the former chief innovation officer of the cftc and accenture is also um part of this partnership so what are you proposing we're proposing a full-blown uh u.s central bank digital currency a tokenized uh decentralized uh form of the us dollar that would be a bearer instrument but in digital format uh that would be as as valuable on your uh on your uh mobile device wallet and it is in your leather wallet in your pocket so how did you i mean after doing all these things like you know working on bitcoin futures and uh bitcoin and ether whether or not they're commodities and or securities etc how did you decide that this is what you wanted to work on next yeah so i came away from five years serving uh government service with really sort of three observations the first is that just as so much of our physical infrastructure our bridges our tunnels our airports our mass transportation systems that were once state-of-the-art in the 20th century have sadly been allowed to decay and decline in some cases become obsolete in the 21st century the same is true sadly about a lot of our financial market infrastructure and even our financial regulatory structure what was once state of the art has been allowed to age and decay the second observation is that we're truly going into a new digital error the first wave of the internet was an internet of information this next wave is a wave of digitization the internet of things of value and we experienced that at the cftc very early on even before we got to bitcoin futures with the movement of some of the major the world's major commodities into blockchain-based distribution systems and then of course recognizing bitcoin as a commodity and ultimately overseeing the launch of bitcoin futures and and the bringing of institutional money but we really saw this new wave of the internet and its potential to render all things of value into a tokenized form a digitized form a decentralized form a distributed form in some cases and in fact a programmable form and and it and then that brought me to the third observation that nowhere is this clash between these antiquated systems and this new wave of digitization more critical than it actually our currency ourself in the united states case that's the digital dollar if you stop and think about it most of the world's things of value are priced in the dollar in international markets whether they be agricultural commodities like corn wheat soybeans cotton whether they be precious metals whether they be industrial metals whether they be energy products whether they be the world's most important contracts and debt instruments are priced in dollars as all those assets move into a tokenized digitized form how long can the dollar remain the world's reserve currency if itself is not digital programmable tokenized alongside of them others see that opportunity and are taking rapid steps to explore this new wave of the internet as it applies to their sovereign currencies and i believe the united states needs to do the same thing so you know this proposal actually exists in a landscape of some other well other proposals but also other existing digital assets that are like a dollar or peg to the dollar some of those are for instance people might have heard that in march and april some of the versions of the stimulus bills that were proposed originally did suggest disbursing funds via digital dollars however that was via something entailing the creation of fed accounts which they defined as quote an account maintained by a federal reserve bank on behalf of any person that represents holdings in an electronic device or service that is used to store digital dollars that may be tied to a digital or physical identity so that was actually not a blockchain based um form of a dollar but then obviously in the blockchain world we also have things like tether which um is supposedly backed one-to-one by dollars it's it's a digital blockchain based version of a dollar uh backed by actual dollars in banks and then die is like a really different kind it's a decentralized version which is backed by crypto assets again uh they try to maintain that value at a dollar so how does your proposal differ from these or or how is it similar to any of these okay so i talked about that clash between old systems um being challenged by this new wave of digitization um in the covid crisis we actually saw the limitations of the centuries-old accounts-based financial system we saw that for large portions of our population as much as 70 million people that were not included fully included in the banking system or did not have bank accounts registered with the irs the only alternative in an accounts based system to get them relief monies was through a traditional check issuing process which raised all kinds of issues for people that didn't have access to bank services so as any crisis does it leads for a search for solutions in fact sometimes the best uh innovations come out of crisis time bitcoin itself you may say rise that rose out of the last crisis some of the efforts to address this unfortunately confused the definition of digital dollar the digital dollar was a term actually we coined in january for a full-blown u.s central bank digital currency of cbdc but some of those efforts use the term to refer to something that's not a cbdc but is really a a an account based distribution mechanism to reach underbanked populations by giving them federal by giving that population access to fed accounts with the federal reserve to which monies can be sent on an accounts basis they use the phrase digital dollar wallets but it's not what we're talking about when we talk about digital dollars we're talking about full cbdc those proposals noteworthy um of value because their their objectives are the right thing is to address how do we get relief to under bank populations but but make no mistake that's not a cbdc proposal that is saying let's let's extend even further the traditional account based system you know the account based system goes back to media to to renaissance venice uh as a way of holding monies while ships were coming in it it's it's an important system it's served well but it's based upon an analog experience that money is physical money is hard to transport and move around while you're waiting for ships to come in so you might as well put it into a bank and record it on an account ledger and we've expanded that and we've developed that and we've electronified that and to some degree we've digitized that but we've still kept the the the double entry bookkeeping account based process that's not a tokenized solution and my feeling is if we're going to address issues of underbanked populations let's help bring that population into the 21st century and not just hook them up to a 20th century solution let's take this opportunity to explore the new frontier of tokenized money so the system that you propose is a two-tier distribution model that basically retains the current structure where we have the federal reserve bank then we've also got these commercial banks that are kind of the regulated intermediaries between everyday consumers so um well first of all yeah why don't you explain you know how the digital dollars would be issued through this and then also why you chose to stick with the existing system so what i would say it's the two-tier plus approach um it's not limited to two tiers it's two tiers plus so how does physical money bear our instruments get into the public's hands now it's it's produced by the federal reserve it's distributed through federal reserve banks and to commercial banks in return for reserves posted at the federal reserve the money is made available to the public as a public good it is seed by the government to to be the basis for commerce for activity but as we've moved into a digital world we find its limitations it you can't use it in e-commerce you can only use it in an analog setting and nevertheless that is the way the money is distributed we're proposing to distribute tokenized versions of the dollar in the same format that is it would be minted by the federal reserve digitally minted recorded to a blockchain distributed through the banking system and the banks would be responsible for recording to the blockchain but then that's why i say it's two plus you could have third and fourth and other tiers as the system builds you can have wallet providers be recipients and distributors of that digital money as well and could also record to the blockchain there will be a a minimum level of a regulatory function so that those endpoints are not only building to the blockchain but providing aml kyc function and it could be sort of a banking light extension but we'll have to develop that and that's one of the reasons why we're not calling for this to be drafted in a weekend legislative drafting session but to be built over a series of pilot programs over years as we explore the dimensions of this and why not do something more radical that disintermediates the commercial banks i did see that idea was floated in a recent paper that came out this month by the federal reserve of philadelphia and in it the the author said that the fed could be quote a central bank open to all and as you probably saw in the news with the recent stimulus checks there were some banks who also did not release the full funds of those checks to customers who had overdrawn their accounts and as i'm sure we all know also commercial banks often times don't have incentives to bank certain populations so why would you want to continue relying on them as intermediaries so i'm a realist um laura you know i i've served in the private sector 30 years five years in government um i i'm old enough to have witnessed the space program and seen how the internet evolved and i think when we do big things in the united states it's generally a partnership between the private sector and the public sector where both sides come to the table feeling they've got a stake in the outcome and where the degree of disintermediation um it's unquestionable but it's done in a progressive uh iterative fashion not done overnight and so i think that the way we've proposed is is a way that's probably most uh readily pursued uh but then i think over time there is opportunity for a a healthy amount of creative destruction and healthy disintermediation as old forms are replaced with new forms but i don't think a proposal that in its white paper form says let's disintermediate the existing incumbents in the financial system is going to be one that's going to be readily accepted anytime soon yeah i think uh that would get a huge lobbying force um by an industry that already has a lot of money so um anyway and it wasn't a joke that god created the world in six days but then again he didn't have an installed base to deal with right um and one other thing i wanted to ask about was in your white paper about your proposal um you did say that a cbdc could be made programmable and you know i was just thinking about how for a lot of consumers to them their money already seems digital you know through credit cards and paypal and genmo so what differences or what new features do you think they would notice with a digital dollar so an account space system is built upon messages telling financial institutions to uh update records of who holds what money and what's digital is the messages that are that go back and forth instructing the institutions to change and update records in a tokenized version of currency the decentralized nature of a blockchain is what confirms identity you don't have a double spend problem and you don't need all those messages because the consensus establishes ownership immediately without all of that message activity so you go from basically a double entry system to a unit entry system by consensus uh it's really architecturally a radically different change and when i talk about how society needs to update its architecture of its bridges and tunnels and its airports similarly every so often society needs to update the architecture of its most fundamental value and that's its currency and that's what we're talking about moving to a new technological architecture underpinning the us dollar right but i don't think people would notice that right like probably wouldn't their experience wouldn't okay when you go into a vendor where you can use apple pay right what you're doing is there's a wireless message sent to record that account on a ledger with a digital dollar there would be a wireless transfer of money not a message to an account to some some some validator but actually a transfer of the money um it would be like going from a fax machine produces a digitally generated image but it's a fax machine it's not the same thing as say an mp3 file which actually holds the thing itself and that's what we're talking about is going to it's going from a a digital recording of a of something that represents the value to a digital to the value itself in digital format yeah and i think um within that you could program things like interest bearing capabilities or even maybe controlling anonymity um i saw that in the white paper we will discuss that more because i already see there's a question on this topic and i have a number of questions but actually before we get to that i just also wanted to ask um so you and i had discussed in like a pre-interview before this um this event about access and inclusion and at the time that we spoke i think i asked you oh you know are there more people who have smartphones that have bank accounts because in order for this to increase access um you would have to you know have a smartphone to access this but then i actually looked at the figures and i think you said to me oh more americans have smartphones than are unbanked but actually that's not true so 81 of americans have smart phones but only six percent of americans are unbanked so it actually seems to be the reverse that the number of people without smartphones is actually greater than the percentage who are unbanked so you know how how could this increase access when you know the basic requirement is a smartphone right so you've got to drill down to these numbers even further and look at demographics and look at age categories you've kind of got an interesting dichotomy here at [Music] younger levels of the population the uh availability of smartphones is actually pretty pretty very very very strong and yet they are on or under banked to a considerable extent uh and many of them will enter the banking system um it's just that they can get by with venmo at this point or they may have a bank account but they don't have a mortgage or an auto loan so they'd be considered underbanked but still banked um and yet if you go to the other end of the age scale and seniors a lot of them are extremely well banked and yet they're still using flip phones and so they're not using smartphones it's very hard to get to the last elements the very last percentage points of the population because there are other issues involved in being unbanked some of it has to do with identity many members of our society are unbanked because they don't want to reveal identity for whatever reason they may be undocumented they may have the other issues there's also a segment of society that is uncomfortable with banking generally and so just opening up banking to them um it doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to engage it in the banking system so and then there are of course minority populations there are there are populations that have ex don't have access to broadband because they're in in in rural areas so there's a lot of different teasing out to this to do we don't say that a digital dollar is a panacea for the unbanked population what we do say is that digital fiat may provide a much easier entry ramp into financial inclusion for a population that is for whatever reason been outside the banking circle they they may be very comfortable with venmo because it's it's easily understandable in a digital dollar would be as easy as easily accessible if not more so than venmo but without the information leakage that comes with venmo all right yeah why don't we actually just jump into secure or to uh privacy right now because i feel like we're already just talking about this you know i think a lot of people would immediately be wondering how private their transactions could be with the digital dollar so how would you account for that okay so uh privacy is a very very important value and yet uh nowhere in the u.s financial system is it absolute now we we we uh we tend to think about cash as anonymous but even their policy choices have been made so cash over ten thousand dollars uses requires reporting requires it receives aml kyc monitoring so even cash is not an absolutely private feature so now let's if we if we accept the point that i'm trying to make that privacy has a relative relationship these are the issues of of law enforcement which is why aml kyc is done we then have to ask what where will society find the balancing point between right privacy rights and national security or law enforcement rights and in that regard i think if the united states does it right and designs a digital dollar right it could have superior if not absolute privacy rights compared to central bank digital currencies or commercial uh crypto currencies offered by others and let me let me just let's imagine a world where you have a digital r b you have a digital euro you have a libra coin and you have a digital dollar well the social expectations in china the social expectations in europe and the social expectations in the united states about privacy are actually quite different in china there's a higher expectation of state security in europe europe is very uh very sensitive to commercial exploitation of data they have a law called the gdpr which protects people's right uh to privacy and against commercial exploitation of data but actually does not give them rights against government exploitation of data in the united states we're the opposite we're actually relatively relaxed about commercial exploitation of our data but we're very sensitive going back to the founding of the republic and the fourth amendment about government exploitation of privacy rights and therefore if our if our cultural expectations are built into our sovereign currencies then you can imagine a world where use of say a digital r b has a very low expectation of privacy vis-a-vis the government where a european sovereign currency would have a better but still not a not compared to the u.s right of privacy against the government and where the u.s sovereign currency could have the highest right of expectation against government uh observation and would have no risk of commercial exploitation of compare based upon what your commercial development is with your commercial vendors but compared to say a libra coin where there is an expectation that the data will be exploited for commercial purposes so these are all design choices that will be need to be built into our sovereign digital currency which is one of the reasons why i'm so insistent that the united states starts experimenting now so we make sure that these these social values are built into the development from the beginning i i'm a big believer that the government should have very little ability to monitor transactions except for us as appropriate for national security and law enforcement we've got to get that development right but remember it's going to be done on a relative basis

so what you're describing then it seems like the digital dollar would have kind of built and i mean you referenced this before but i just want to know what it looks like to have kind of built in or i guess you were saying that it could even be some of the commercial entities that help um distribute the digital dollar but you know in terms of the kyc the know your customer anti-money laundering anti-terrorist financing anti-fraud all those things what what would that look like when i want to use it you know do i have to give my full identity or and then frankly well let's not get to that we'll talk about that in a second but just answer that so we would see that at the point of the wallet so as you would open up a wallet account there would be a degree of disclosure of information to establish that account and then they would perform the kyc or we could even envision that that would be done on a white label service by a well-established banking institution on behalf of a wallet provider okay okay and what level of identity would people need to give because you know as you were saying for like an undocumented person like how would they establish their identity at least look identity is a difficult set of choices we've been grappling with that in the united states for a long long time and again one of the reasons why we advocate a series of pilot programs is to find out where the balance is we need to make this accessible and so the the identity identity necessary to use a digital dollar has got to be fairly basic but at the same time we've got to balance uh aml kyc requirements and you know we've made a policy choice uh with regard to currency itself uh we will need to make policy choices with regard to digital currency itself and i can't tell you offhand where that is we're only at this a few months laura and there's a lot to be thought about here yeah and i do think that you're right that in the us people are perhaps more concerned about government um overreach in this situation because i you know was reading some of the articles that have been written on this and already i see people saying things like oh you know i could see this leading the fed to or or um the government to uh do asset seizure without warrants and you know and so it's interesting because you're right in europe it does seem to be more they have that concern about commercial overreach um currency's got to reflect the values of its society and if the government designs something that doesn't reflect the values of a society it won't it won't fly and it won't work current if you look at the course of human history currencies in international commerce have always competed against each other for the patronage of people in commerce you get you get the details wrong they will go to another currency we have to get this right we've got to design this with the right policy choices that reflect the values of of american society in this if it's going to be adopted we're going to see broad implementation even in even in physical fiat we've seen where coins are misdesigned they don't get used designing this right is critically important to attract a user base okay so i there's so much to discuss in terms of the global space race but just one last question about what you're proposing here which is that obviously we know the history of blockchain technology and digital assets is littered with hacks thefts phishing sim swaps just it's so easy to lose this form of money so and and or for these systems to be hacked and you know with what you're proposing where it's essentially kind of i mean tell me if i'm incorrect but it sounds like a private blockchain where there's a limited set of nodes and the actors are somewhat either known or at least you know kind of maybe predictable so the security of something like that seems like it would be easier to compromise than the security of something like bitcoin or ethereum where you know there's just thousands of notes all over the world so how would you make something like this secure well look if the standard for a financial system is it can't be hacked then we might as well shut down the existing account space system now because it's hacked all the time right it can't that can't be the standard uh otherwise we'll we'll never move forward right we have to recognize and the breakthrough of this technology is its consensus structure it's it's its ability on a consensus basis distributed basis to get beyond the uh the the single point of failure verification process that we have in place now um but you're right it probably will be the most hacked structure on earth and that's again why this cannot be cobbled together in a you know in a weekend congressional drafting session and launched you know three weeks later this is something you know what the the the analogy is the decision to put a person on the moon that was taken in the 1950s and it didn't take place to the end of the 60s and in in between the decision to go and the successful landing was a whole series of pilot programs called mercury and gemini and apollo and each one of them had a dozen or more permissions and each one learned from the other and they learned from the failures as much as they learned from the successes and that's why we advocate a series of pilot progress we're going to have to explore our way through this but the standard can't be unhackable because it will be and that's what we've got to learn but the beauty of what satoshi nakamoto came up with is the notion of a convinced a consensus distributed approach that if it's done right is virtually impossible to hack so thank you for mentioning the the race to get on the moon because that is also in a way what we're facing right now with the central bank digital currencies and of course china already has a pilot or actually it's three i think geographies of its digital yuan and payment system which is called dcep so do you feel like the us is already falling behind when it comes to a cbdc well look i i i have a great deal of respect for what china's doing this enormous project um and and they are and they are determined uh they are martially enormous amount of resource enormous amount of brain power and it's impressive to behold but china comes at this from a different place in the global economic system their currency is not a reserve currency it is not uh it doesn't have the role today that the dollar has today in the global economic system they've probably got more to gain than they have to lose by doing this experiment and if they get it wrong it's not going to have the same impact that it would for the u.s if we get this wrong and if we rush into this i'm of the view that winning and losing is not a question of who goes first winning and losing is a question of which society successfully brings their values to bear on the design of digital currency if our values are the right balance of privacy rights against state surveillance if our values are the right role for a public and the private to work together if our values are that the money should be a public good on which a a free market economy is built uh if we can agree those values and if we can agree and the rule of law if we can agree those values and if we can design those values into the next form of the dollar then i think we'll have uh achieved our purpose and it won't be a question of winning a race or or or you know landing a a rocket a lunar module it's a question of of values and a question of making sure that the values that that we expect in our currency are built into the next form of that currency a digital form of that currency so i agree with you that just the fact that they're first out of the gate doesn't necessarily mean that they'll succeed or become the dominant um cbdc however you know the phrase first mover advantage exists for a reason and i do think that with money that kind of thing applies because you know money tends to have network effects and in china's case they have this very comprehensive vision for blockchain technology not just apply to money but apply to all different kinds of things and they're going to be using it in a lot of developing countries that they deal with especially around their belt and road initiative so when you kind of put all that together you know and you play this out what impact do you think this could have on the global balance of power especially if the us continues to lag yeah well again i i tip my hat uh to what china's doing it's impressive and it and exactly as you say when you comp combine what they're doing with currency with their belt road initiative with the billions of dollars they're putting into um large engineering product projects and large public infrastructure projects in what is becoming a zone of influence it's an impressive combination um i i think you know again i think the united states is in a different place i don't see the united states uh again for better for worse i'm not making a value judgment but i don't think where the united states is right now is in doing large um government-sponsored investments in large infrastructure projects in the developing world again for better for worse uh for right or wrong i don't see that happening so i don't if the u.s were to compete it would have to compete in more just a currency but also in a in its own belt road initiative and everything that goes with it i just don't see that happening again i think the united states uses soft power around the world and again you know many there's many viewpoints on that and i really don't want to get into uh debating uh u.s foreign policy uh i think there's there's both things to praise and things to criticize in that i do believe though that uh at heart the last three generations of dollar dominance in the world has seen more rising living standards and more of the human population move out of poverty poverty into the middle class with with better health outcomes with longer lives uh and with uh aspirations to better education and and more human rights than at any other point in human history and i think there has been to some degree a consequence of the values that have been built into the dollar and its role in the world um and so i for one would like to make sure that those same values are built into the next version of the dollar i think the united states will ultimately have no choice but to create a cbdc i think the time to get started on that is not later in time but now take our time get it right build those values in to serve uh into the future and with that that's about my deepest foray into foreign policy it's an area where i know more about markets than i do know about foreign policy so i don't want to pronounce too far on that well so we've been discussing the threat from china but then on the other hand we have this libra coin that's going to be coming out and they'll be issuing different stable coins that are pegged to the values of various fiat currencies including the us dollar uh that will be called the libra usd so do you think that the threat then could come in that direction because facebook has a user base even larger than the population of china and it already has a very easy way to open digital wallets for lots of people in not just the us but across the globe so you know do you think that the libra usd could end up being the proxy for this digital dollar and sort of beat a future cbdc uh in dollar terms probably the only bigger user base than that is the dollar itself um look okay i think libra has done us all a service by what they've done i think they have demonstrated uh the reminded us of what money is you know again it's only the last few generations where sovereign currencies in fact the us dollar has been so ubiquitous as it has if you look at the course of human history more often than not you've seen many different sovereign currencies competing but also competing with commercial currencies during the period of the european exploration of the east coast of north america in the 16th and 17th centuries it was a series of currencies that were competing whether they be dutch guilders or french francs but the currency that was most prep preferred was the dollar but it wasn't the american dollar it was the spanish dollar and the reason why the spanish dollar was the preferred coin was because it actually had technological advantages over the others it was minted using new world silver which was purer than the other silvers in use and therefore was lighter when it was carried in a trunk for transportation uh but it was also more consistently pure which meant that the coinage itself was more consistent but the most interesting aspect was it was minted in a special way that it can be broken into eight equal sized pieces and therefore it can be fractionalized and when we think about technological advantages to a currency we need to remember that that we're competing for the patronage of that currency and having technological modernization is part of maintaining the the the importance and the patronage for that currency and that's exactly the way i think we need to think about the dollar today how do we modernize it for use in a new digital error yeah i actually just realized earlier when you said the user base for usg is bigger than the user base at facebook i actually did realize so that i think you know what maybe is concerning is the fact that facebook is a platform and you know i've seen this working in media for more than 20 years that the platforms can really uh pull the rug out from existing players um i actually don't want to go too far down this hole because we're limited on time and we need to get into covet and all kinds of stuff so let's just talk about covet now how do you think coped will play into all this do you think that it will hasten the competition among countries to establish cbdc's or um do you expect it to generally hasten a long development so it certainly showed the shortcomings in the accounts based system uh when you have a large underbanked population um and i think that there's nothing like a crisis for a spur to action but i view the need to create a us cbdc as more than just a crisis response but it's really a response to changing technological innovation you know the first wave of the internet changed all our lives and that was just the first wave that was an internet of information this next one is going to change all our lives as well and you know the dollar's role could be undermined if it doesn't evolve with it so i i think the covent crisis is a good spur to action and and i'm actually testifying tomorrow at a hearing in the house financial services committee that's to look at the use of digital technology in as a financial response and i'll be talking about my proposal for a us cbdc up but that hearing perhaps might not have taken place uh but for the covet crisis so it provides an opportunity to talk about the shortcomings in the system as as crisis response but it also talks about how infrastructure sometimes just needs to be modernized because it needs to be modernized because infrastructure is a public good for economic activity and and the social benefits that economic activity brings to all of our livelihoods and do you think that this does provide a good opportunity to start one of your pilots i have seen some other you know blockchain people make calls for that what do you think absolutely absolutely i think now's the time and and we could start with financial inclusion we can start with looking at how readily some of the underbanked populations uh could um see digital wallets as a on-ramp into financial inclusion you know there's a lot of discreet populations that i think could benefit from this immediately one area would be service men and women if you've ever visited an army base you'll see surrounding in a whole series of check cashing centers and when they check their cash they may be overseas they may be far from home they then need to get the money home so they actually may go then to a a cash transmission bureau and each step along the way they're paying something well why couldn't they just send that money home in a text message and that's what a cbdc would allow for and can you give us a preview of what you plan to say in tomorrow's testimony well it's along the lines of what we're talking about today you know people that have followed me i tend to i'm not a technologist my background although i've always been fascinated by how technology can improve uh our ways of life and i intend to talk in general terms about why i think this is the time to get serious about exploring the next iteration of the dollar we know people are broader doing it we know our economic competitors are doing we know that our economic allies are doing it we know that commercial entities are doing it we know the dollar plays a critical role in the world's economy and yet how can we not say we also need to explore its digital potential and do you have any insight into how those a couple of stimulus bills did have the suggestions for a digital dollar it looks like some of the congress people who suggest it were rasheeda talib of michigan from pramila jayapal of washington and ohio senator sherrod brown i don't know have you been in touch with any of them or can you give us a sense in general of how well-versed lawmakers are in this uh in these proposals for a digital dollar what i can say is having served 30 years in the private sector in five years in the federal government uh people in the public sector are not actually terribly different than people in the private sector you have early adopters you've got late adopters and you've got the broad uh bell curve in the middle of middle adopters there are people in the official sector at some regulatory agencies at cabinet agencies and in on capitol hill that are really very switched on understand the potential of the technology and working right alongside them you've got people that are i don't even know if they're beyond flip phones but their appetite for technological innovation is not uh keen and then you've got the broad middle that's why we form the digital dollar project primarily as a think tank our goal is to we we're if we go back to the analogy of the space race we're still in 1958 trying to get the word out that the space is the next frontier and if we can do that consensus then we can just decide whether the lunar module uses aluminum foil or whether it's powered by what mixture of fuel and all of those details that we'll need to work out but first we've got to create a national consensus that we need to move beyond what we're doing now and that's what i'm hoping to do tomorrow laura is is get the word out and how do you think the election well not only for president but also uh in both houses of congress how do you think that will affect the chances for a digital dollar to be adopted like are you finding that this is a partisan issue or bipartisan i i in my experience in washington i never found technological aptitude to be republican or democrat um i i just don't see it i i think there's people on both sides of that political divide who are pro-innovation they're people on both sides that political divide who are anti-innovation and then there's a broad middle at the end of the day you put those political labels aside they're people like you and me and so when you look at your kind of maybe future uh ideal road map for getting this adopted um who are all the entities that you feel you would need to get on board and what with some of those pilot programs that you talked about look look like well so when when china does big things as they're doing with the digital rmb or as they've done with the blue water navy it's directed from the very top and then an order goes out to 43 million communist party members to read the same book and on monday go to work and instruct everybody to perceive the same matter i'm not faulting that that's a great system for big projects that's not how we roll in the united states it never has been right when we do big things it's a messy process of trying to build a consensus of of showing leadership and then when we do launch it's a it's it's a i think a beautiful blend of public and private that's what built the space program that's what built the internet the public sector lays down broad core principles policies but it's the private sector that does the engineering that brings the finance that brings the technical talent that does the the project management that the private sector can do and having been in the government that it's very hard for the public sector to do something as big as this needs to be a a a traditionally american public-private partnership and so i'm hoping that those pilot programs call for the best and the brightest from the private sector some companies like you know like i don't want to seem like i'm endorsing anybody but there's so much good work being done right now i've met with many of the companies in the space and the blockchain space are building things i would like to see let's try you know ethereum in in one area let's try corda in another let's try digital asset in the third let's work with paxos another let's let's have a beautiful explosion of innovation and ultimately even if we're if we go back to the analogy of a race which i don't like to use even if we're starting late with that explosion of talent with that explosion of of of creativity i i think we could create a dollar that would be the killer app in terms of sovereign digital currency okay so you don't want to describe any kind of particular pilot that you already have in mind well i i i think that uh military service compensation salary is a good one i think veterans benefits may be another one i think rural area distribution that that have difficulty accessing banks i think inner city areas with some populations we're going to have to explore a lot of things we're going to explore digital identity which is a subject that's been very controversial in the united states do we have a central identity system do we use other means of authentication so there's going to be a lot of work to be done there this is not something that's going to be done overnight it's not something that's going to be done in a few years this is something that's um a multi-year exercise the more pilot programs we can get going both in sequence but also perhaps uh simultaneously the faster we can learn and therefore the the perhaps the the the better our design building can be to get something that we can ultimately launch in a universal fashion okay so we have two questions from listeners i just want to get to one is do you see a currency exchange rate between the us dollar and a digital us dollar no that it would be critically important that there be no arbitrage that it be if it's got the full faith and credit in in physical form it has full faith and credit in digital form there should be no arbitrage and then the last one which this is a great question i should have asked this before so for somebody who doesn't have access to a smartphone how can they get a hold of a us digital dollar so that's something we're going to have to explore i mean it may be that we have a program of smartphones for some sectors of the population uh to make sure they're financially included you know uh you know a low-cost smartphone is probably ten dollars a month uh that may be actually a bargain compared to the notion of the federal reserve going into the retail banking business for which they are not set up at all now and would have to restructure probably the entire federal reserve so we may be better off creating a uh a system of government-sponsored smartphones for sections of the population that might not otherwise have access to it and something that's certainly worth exploring great okay well where can people learn more about you and the digital dollar project thank you for asking a digitaldollarproject.org we've got everything on the website my testimony will be posted there our recent white paper is there we've got a great advisory board of 30 experts in a range of fields from privacy to aml kyc to banking their names are all there and we have an opportunity you have an opportunity to write to us there if you have thoughts and ideas we'd like to hear from you perfect well thank you so much for this interview and thank you to nyu stern dean naomi diamond renee
