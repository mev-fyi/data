let's just run through some of the other suggestions that I've seen online for how creators can either deal with royalties going away or or just just different variations on how to make this work for both the creators and for the um buyers so one of them was something that we mentioned about artists just keeping some of their early work to sell later once they become more well known you know we kind of talked about this but I was curious you know to hear if you had anything else to add on whether that was something feasible or not yeah I mean I I mentioned it earlier I think that it's it's really only viable in some situations like how do you do that for one-of-one work also I just think that that's like a bad incentive right because it turns artists into Market participants and then let's say that you know I've got a bunch of my early work and suddenly things are doing really well in the secondary market like the collectors want artists to suddenly dump a bunch of new work on the market that wasn't available and like mess up the supply demand curve also you're like constantly looking at the floor price and the you know price dynamics of the day like is this one I should sell my own work like it's just it's just weird you don't want your artist doing that you want the artist you're collecting to like focus on making great art and you know um paying attention their careers and not like trying to like hustle their own collector base out of more out of more money on like this weird dynamic way it just seems like uh obviously a bad idea if you enjoyed this clip watch the full episode available now on Unchained
