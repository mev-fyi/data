guest is Brian Klein partner at Waymaker welcome Brian thanks for including me and having me on the show Laura I'm a big fan oh and I've listened to many of them excited to have you former FTX CEO Sam bankman freed had his bail revoked and he got sent back to jail last week what appears to have tipped things over the edge was that he leaked parts of Caroline Ellison's Diaries to the New York Times and judge Lewis Kaplan said when he revoked the bail that he believed SBF had likely intended to get two witnesses to back off and not cooperate as fully with the government Caroline Ellison being one of them do you agree with the judge's decision on this and do you agree that those were likely Sam's intentions well I think the defenses said those aren't Sam's intentions and obviously the government took a different View and the judge agreed with the government judges do take that very seriously usually a condition of release for any defendant is you not contact any of the other Witnesses in the case um and that you not try to do things in just a general precept of that is you not try to do anything that would intimidate them from coming forward and testifying especially when they've been identified and there you're referring to how we contacted the former general counsel via text message kind of implying that you should try to be on the same team is that what you're referring to well I think that can be one thing contacting somebody directly there may be reasons you would contact someone though for example you may saw business dealings or other things sometimes you would clear that through your lawyer or even through the court and have a carve out that wasn't done from what I know in this case and as for the Karen Ellison situation I mean what's the reportedness he had a meeting with a New York Times Reporter at his house or his parents house and provided his diary to the reporter and you know the story came out and it was somewhat salacious um and I think the judge in the government felt that that was a wage try to get her to back off from wanting to testify bullying truthfully this trial she is an expected witness one of the government's key Witnesses from what we know and I think there have been a number of other instruments that had gotten the Court's attention about Sam when he's been out and so I don't think people were surprised that he was detained I think most people I've talked to were surprised he wasn't detained from the start and so now that he's detained though that really does change a lot of the Dynamics or preparation for trial and it does make it much tough around the defense to prepare for trial and just a quick point I think at the time of his extradition from the Bahamas there was speculation that the reason he was released on bill was that he had made it a condition of his extradition do you think that theory holds water oh yeah it's very possible a lot of times when client is in extradited if they agree to wave extradition which is what happened here so he stops his fight in the Bahamas and said I will come back that often is something that the defense will try to negotiate with the government because it is important for a defense lawyer to have full access to their client and just having your client available to answer the phone meet with you respond to emails look at all the discovery it's just a thousand times easier when they're out and at a residence or somewhere but you can quickly do that with them now Sam is in detention he's in jail um and he was a much more limited access so it's just a much harder preparation for its trial much harder for the defense to work with their clients and his side has appealed his detention How likely do you think it is that they'll Prevail I don't think it's likely um I think it's a tough road for them I understand why they would appeal and they file that we haven't seen the briefings yet so maybe there are arguments I'm not aware of judge Kaplan is a very well respected member of the bench there in the southern district New York a very seasoned judge I haven't read the transcript of that hearing but I'm sure he documented his reasons very well and has given a lot of discretion under the rules so I think it's unlikely that it would be changed um again judges are given a lot of discretion in this era with the law so walk me through now what it is like when you know the defendant side is preparing for trial under conditions similar to what he had at his parents home under bail versus what it will look like now that he's in Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn sure so when someone's out I mean they may be restricted in terms of where they can go otherwise but they're always given access to their lawyers that's one of the almost always a car about them so they can go to meet with their lawyer they can get on the phone with their lawyer usually you're giving the ability to email with your lawyer sometimes not depending on the crime it'll be an alleged crime and so that depends but there's just it's just like anything else you can pick up the phone and call your client walk through an issue or you can invite your client in or you can go meet with your client and look at documents together and it's just there's no like set times or hours you can do that once someone's been detained those facilities have lots of other people there they have their rules about when you can come they have lengths of stay you can stay in a tree you could probably show up in the morning and stay a long time especially in the lead up to trial but you're bringing documents in and out your client is now detained sometimes there is a lockdown at the facility no one can get in or get out sometimes you know there's some other incident that makes it hard to see your client and so it's just a much more restricted interaction and it makes things a lot more difficult you can't just do things on the Fly you have to really sort of plan more a HUD again it's not impossible many people are detained and prepare for trial with their lawyers and it's affected but it just is a hurdle that defense lawyers really don't like to have they don't have to of course and you know it affects the client it affects the defending I mean he is now getting he had some he was attained a little bit in the Bahamas for a short period of time now he's going to be detained leading up to trial a lot of prosecutors view that as a favorable thing a lot of times I think it's sometimes more likely that the defendant will choose to plead guilty once they've been detained for a number of reasons so it's just overall it's an advantage to the government and a disadvantage to the defense when someone is depending and um when it just a quick question earlier when you said that the defense lawyers will have to bring documents in and out do you mean that they they can't um just go over things on a laptop together but they have to literally print out physical documents and bring those in you can get permission to bring a laptop in it has to be usually a laptop that just has those documents on them and so it's just more cumbersome overall and the client with defendant can keep documents in their cell they're usually given a box and it's marked attorney-clack roads or something like that it depends on the jail so there is a way to do things and for them to hold documents or view them on their own it's just more cumbersome you know because they can't just come to your office and go work in a conference room and have lots of boxes of documents around them and be shuffling through them and looking through them with you you know these rooms typically where you meet them are small very small conference rooms not comfortable the lighting isn't great you know this is a jail right it's not designed for Comfort or for ease of meetings heels take their mission seriously in my experience of giving the lawyers access you get more access than just the his parents will get to him again it is a burden and it wouldn't surprise me I'm not saying this will happen but it wouldn't surprise me if they defense asked for continuance of the trial date based on this it may be that Sam does not want a continuance because he's there and he wants to get the trial as soon as possible but the additional burden made me mirrors a request for a continue which means a delay in the start date of the trial yes possible this will lead to a requests for that but signs do not point to that right now to be clear but a lot is possible and you also said that in this type of situation the defendant is more likely to plead guilty what do you think the odds are of that sometimes the difference but yes I think I I think in this case the odds are not high I mean this case has been litigated for months now the charges are serious and extensive there's been no indication that there are plea discussions every side has been filing motions doing the things you do as you do you're really preparing for trial not engaging in clean discussions I'm confident just because I know how the process works in any case there is at least some back and forth about the possibility whether it will defense asks about it or the government just says hey if your guy's interested here's what it would look like so that probably happened at some point but whether there's ongoing discussions I don't know it's just in my experience some defendants some clients when they're open in prison would contain they uh really once or are more interested in pleading part of that is because the jails typically are much you're in a mixed population with lots of other defendants both people choose the violent crimes of non-violent crimes whereas if you're a white collared offended and you plead guilty oftentimes you'll get sent to a camp which is a much more Humane facility much more comfortable I'm not saying it's comfortable but more comfortable and you're usually only in with non-violently introduced offenders so you're not with like you know violent drug dealers for example or go to Camp typically so the your fellow prisoners are you know more like you of your white collar The Thunderman um and so usually people when they're out they're not dealing with that sort of situation you know Sam was at his parents home which is presumably a comfortable nice house in the Bay area right now he's you know has a sharing a prison cell or maybe by himself because he's a high profile defendant but he's in an uncomfortable prison cell in a moment we're going to talk about why it is that Sam didn't just plead guilty but first a quick word from the sponsor you see make this show possible overtime markets

Sam is facing a trial in which three of his co-conspirators have already pleaded guilty and as you mentioned there are like numerous reasons why somebody in his position might do that but why do you think he hasn't you know I'd be guessing like anybody of course I think there's a number of factors probably at play one is I suspect that the prosecutors to the extent they offered a plea offering they're not required to to be clear there's no obligation to engage in quick discussions there's no legal requirement that will be a plea offer Sam could always walk in any day and plead guilty to any of the charges he's obviously pled knuckle but the prosecutors have made an offer I suspect they had it's probably for extensive prison time I would guess 25 30 years or more you know they're seeking if he's going to plead based on the allegations of the loss here which are you know billions and the scope of the number of victims alleged victims and everything so it comes the legend the indictment I suspect for whatever reason you know based on his own counsel with his lawyers and probably with his parents he is not willing to consider that at this time now again his mind could change at any point and he may ultimately choose to plead but I think the moment for him to plead and get the most credit for it was early on because at that point he could have pleaded he could have cooperated in a sense with the receiver and done lots of things like they would love to pick his brain and figure out what happened here and what all these accounts mean and everything right you can imagine right um and so the three who did we understand are cooperating and they will get credit for that presumably by the judge who will sentence them um but he's chosen not to so you know I guess if you watch his media interviews they'll lead up to the charges I don't think it's that surprising that he hasn't chosen to plead because the way he talked about what happened the way he's presented himself publicly both of the war is arrest and census arrest does not give any indication that this person's someone who is inclined to go both sides files motions in the lemonade on Monday can you explain what that means and then also give an overview of what each side said sure so there's really two sets of motions typically in federal court in the criminal case one set of motions is early on in the case where a defense might move to dismiss a case or suppress evidence call those substantive motions in a sense and that happened to you right the defense move to dismiss the charges the judge denied it and that that's over now you're at the next phase of the case where you're getting ready for trial in a trial there's obviously a lot of things happen when this is good to testify exhibits are being put into evidence and so both sides have sort of started to think about the trial what it would look like and they are telling the judge through their emotions hey the other side shouldn't be allowed to make these arguments or introduce this evidence or we want to make these arguments introduce this evidence and you should let us do that and they were looking at the rules that evidence typically which govern that and so judges want this they want these issues fleshed out before the trial started so that they get a sense of what the issues are and it's possible they rule on them because it allows a trial proceed in the orderly of fashion as possible and the way I think about it is like if you look at a trial this is not a Perfect Analogy but it's like a play or a show right you want to know like kind of the framework of it like okay how many characters are there and what are the props right and that's kind of what this is can get up on stage and talk and what props can they use and you want to know that before you start to play you don't want to Freed for all when the play starts where everyone's just grabbing props in the back trying to put them on the stage on the stage manager in this case the judge would be like or the director will be like no that's not that shouldn't be out so not the best analogy but I think that sort of is What's Happening Here one thing to keep in mind is judges often Reserve rules so it's very often that you'll file motions and eliminate and a judge will with all of them or most of them say okay I hear your issue but let's see what happens at trial like let's see if that really happens let's see what the government says and let's see what the defense really does like we need to see it play out a little bit it's premature that's a very common judge response to motions in the weight now some issues they will want to decide in advance there might be some exhibits or some witnesses that are so provocative or incendiary that it even just allowed to come into play would just you know cause a lot of problems later if they if the prosecutor like mentioned it in their opening argument and said we're going to introduce this evidence and then later the judge excluded it that could be a real issue both for the government maybe for the jury and creating a pilot issue so judges do want to see this they've filed both sides filed extensive motions and lemonade not surprisingly in this case it's a broad case with a lot of evidence so both sides have filed those um they filed those earlier this week the same day the latest indictment was filed and the judge will then with his clerks review those motions usually set up a hearing aid and make decisions I suspect some will be deferred some will be decided on some of the ones that I noticed um the government uh said were hey these are based on charges that have been removed from this particular trial but we want to submit these types of evidence that are related to those anyway uh they were around like political donations straw donors like foreign bribery do you think that will be allowed I think it depends I think that was the one the judge made punt on a little bit so I think what the government did because of what happened in the Bahamas is we know they removed some of the charges right they dropped some of them but now they in their latest they've angled with like well part of the motive or the reason he did this and so they have this money so he could do these things so motive in why someone committed why someone why you think someone committed a crime is a you know you're allowed to put into evidences across you right you needed the money to finance your high lifestyle you need the money for whatever reason or you need it to do this for whatever so motive is always permitted to come into play let's scope of how much motive you can get into and how much you can tie it back to the actual alleged offenses is in question here I suspect the judge will let that lead he made limited he doesn't want what we call a trial within a trial right so he's going to trial to focus on the charged counts not on counts and aren't charged but typically putting in Vogue is allowed and I suspect he will commit that to come on that's a full extent the government wants but to some extent and sdf's lawyers also submitted their side and they said that the prosecutors had repeatedly failed to meet the deadlines for turning over evidence to the defense and uh you know as an example they said that three days prior the prosecutors had produced nearly 750 000 pages of slack messages from Gary Wang's laptop and um basically requested that the government not be allowed to use evidence produced to the defense after July 1st what do you think is the likelihood that those requests will be granted I don't think they'll be granted that's a hard one for the judge to Grant there's two reasons why that one is the judge could say if you need more time I'll give you more time for the trial right okay so there's an October date that you wanted but you know what we can pick a different date later on and give you more time so that's a typical response to that kind of thing again if the government produced it like the day before trial or the night before trial or there was a specific order on a specific date that wasn't meant the judge might be more harsh on that but you know we're talking about July and October trial that I don't think the judge will grant that motion I think that's a defense preserving in the pellet issue or maybe keeping its options open for asking for continuance which they probably are keeping in mind more than ever now that Sam has been detained pre-trial and so I can understand why they might file that motion I concede the Strategic reasons to do it but I think it's unlikely that the judge will grant that motion and so what can we expect these next several weeks before the case goes to trial and you know what are you watching out for whether it be something but you know before the trial or at the start of the trial both sides are going to be working furiously I mean this is the go time for the trial I mean the government is going to be focused on getting its exhibits in order meeting with its Witnesses and preparing them to testify because remember the government the burdens on them they go first defenses have to call anybody so they're going to be meeting with their Witnesses and they're going to have you know a number of witnesses they're going to go into the exhibits and there's a lot of documents to go through where we're going to be calling out what they think about the key documents they're going to be coming up with a framework for their case in terms of the order of the witnesses they're going to call and Hal like running Pioneer opening statement and they're gonna even probably start thinking pretty soon about their closing Stadium because even though you think like oh you wait to start your clothes until the trial is almost over in this kind of case you're going to need to start thinking about how it all fits together like the entire play right now right so if you go back to my analogy you can't just think about the First Act and second acting and forget about the third Act so I think they're very busy doing all that they're probably still looking through and discovering things too doesn't mean they won't supersede the indictment again or maybe change a little bit like your focus right they're still learning about their case this case has moved along very quick quickly for a big case a multi-million billion dollar alleged fraud here you know listen to Google on very quickly the defense is also equally busy so they are so they're I'm sure they are doing this and I'm sure they do feel jammed up with getting stuff at the end they're looking through all these documents too all this data they're working with their Witnesses they might have someone listen they want to call both sides will likely call experts in this case I'm sure the government will call many experts at least one or two guns may have some rebuttal electrics that they want to call those experts I think in this case would focus on how cryptocurrency Works our blockchains work and how maybe some of the financial mechanisms work here because there are complex you need someone to distill it down and explain it to analyze the financial records the defense is probably doing that too in addition you know they're meeting with their client they're coming up with their Theory they're doing their own investigation they may be interviewing their own Witnesses so both sides I mean it's always off October but it's kind of a string at this point um I wouldn't be surprised that they're working pretty close to seven day weeks right now in lead up to October because the last you know for every week of trial let's say usually at least two weeks of prep and so that's how you have the back loans you know multi-week trial they're going to be prepping starting many many weeks more in advance and if you were to guess how many weeks the trial will take what how long would you expect it to last based on the North slim down indictment I would say several weeks definitely obviously more than a week will take a while to select a jury here you know this is a complex case in the sense of you know it's sprawling and I would suspect several weeks a lot is going to hinge on whether Sam testifies because if he testifies that's going to be probably several days two and they might have their own experts so it wouldn't surprise me if this trial was you know two to three weeks I don't know what the estimates they've given now they might give some new estimates based on the new indictment that's something the judge will be Keen to know because when they call the jury and they're going to have a large jury pool here they might they'll probably do a way to do a questionnaire they're going to need to know that people are available for those periods of times most cases don't last weeks and weeks right um an arc is high profile this is you know setting aside the Trump case which is consuming all the oxygen in the room this is one of the most high profile criminal trials happening yeah well I guess we'll have to see how it all goes down um
