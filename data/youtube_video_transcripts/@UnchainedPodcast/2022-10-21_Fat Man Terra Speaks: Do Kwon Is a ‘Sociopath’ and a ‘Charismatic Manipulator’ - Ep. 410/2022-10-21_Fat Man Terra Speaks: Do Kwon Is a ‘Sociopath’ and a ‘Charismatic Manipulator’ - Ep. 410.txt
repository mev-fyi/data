hey everyone in this episode I talked with fat man Tara about his response to my interview with dokwan of terraform Labs throughout the interview Fatman makes a number of allegations against doe I reached out to doe to get his response to these allegations he wasn't able to respond by press time but he offered to do another interview with me in the near future based on ongoing developments so stay tuned now here's my conversation with fat man Tara hi everyone welcome to Unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host Laura Shin author of The cryptopians I started

the anonymous Twitter account dedicated to Bringing dokwon to Justice welcome fat man hi Laura thanks for having me on in case you guys can't tell a fat man is using a voice and atomizer and for those of you who are familiar with him on Twitter there is where he runs an anonymous Twitter account Fatman for those people in the audience who aren't familiar with you why don't you explain how it is that you came to create the fat man Terror account and what your goal is with that account so the fat man Tara account was uh created after I posted a proposal on the Tara Research Forum it was a proposition on how to redistribute the Luna Foundation guard funds my proposal seem to strike a chord with both UST victims and people in the crypto Community people sort of rallied around the idea of a fair distribution to smallholders and uh trying to prioritize making them whole rather than um deploying it back into the market and over time I've tried to use my my history as a crypto and financial researcher to inform research behind Terra and I'm trying to understand what Tara was and how it was used as a scheme to enrich certain insiders so as that info comes out as research progresses around Terror and various other um crypto developments my goal is to try and bring those things to light and I think ultimately I'm quite interested in getting Justice for UST victims and allowing them to gain restitution for the crimes that terraform labs and do corn committed before we get to that um what was your involvement with Tara before the collapse so before the collapse I was quite a big Terra fan so I was a passionate member of the mirror and anchor Community I was um involved with some background Terror research but I was never a big name I was never involved in crypto Twitter much I was just sort of in the background as a passionate Community member you could say I only really came to prominence after the crash after I got more involved into the research side of things and trying to understand uh exactly what happened both based on a more in-depth research as well as some insiders who came out and spoke to me about certain things that were going on behind the scenes so earlier when you said that you felt that do Quan and terraform Labs had committed crimes what are those crimes so there's really a wide gamut of things we can speak about but I guess it boils down to um manipulation it boils down to lying to the public it boils down to unfairly enriching themselves through through mechanisms that were uh that were not made public and I've tried to use my account as a place that all of this is documented more neatly but it's really just it's several months of uh of various things that that we can talk about okay and yeah and when I asked my question I should have said alleged crimes because obviously it's just everything is being hashed out at the this moment and there's nothing definitive so let's now talk about the interview that I conducted with Joe that was released earlier this week you you know as you mentioned just have been steeped in all things Terra Luna ever since the collapse and when you either watched or listened to that interview what were your thoughts about what doe was saying so first off I'd like to say that you did a really incredible job with the interview I think you asked all the right questions you stuck to the facts and you pressed on when necessary so I think in general it was nice to see a more human side to do because I know that online emotions can run high so it was nice to see a civil sit-down conversation but that being said I was disappointed to see that some aspects of his behavior haven't really changed he's still attempting to use obfuscation misdirection and embellishment and trying to rewrite history I find that he's very good at using many many words to say not much at all if that makes sense it's something I'm familiar with so but were there any particular parts of the interview that you felt were just further from certain facts that you had uncovered yeah for sure I feel like there was a lot of dancing around questions a lot of uh not answering things directly there were a few untruths and um there were some interesting Revelations that that I'd like to talk about especially when it comes to things like like chai and other other stuff he mentioned well okay so why don't we just start with that what were some of the revelations when when we get down to his his financial explanations of things that he were he was talking about I I noticed that he has this uh this habit of uh gaslighting and misdirecting people essentially when he goes what people don't understand is as a preceding phrase before explanation so he expresses this condescension and making the viewer feel dumb and I feel like you asked some very solid and straightforward questions and he tries to take it into a completely different tangent to mislead the conversation and at times you had to explicitly bring it back on topic so when it comes to Chai I found his um his explanation for lying about chai was honestly quite ridiculous he went I misremembered I didn't have visibility into the figures I should have fact checked like he here's a deal when you're handling a multi-billion dollar ecosystem people cling onto your everywhere word right especially when you're disclosing specific Financial figures crucial to the business I've had multiple people tell me that the only reason they were interested in UST was because of the real world by pressure coming from the try use case so you cannot just misremember these things and then lie about them in a podcast it literally led to tens of millions and inflows even hundreds of millions so these false statements that he made which he now calls mistakes in your episode directly ruined several lives so when you when you combine this these mistakes and this misremembering with the fact that he was cashing out massive amounts of UST into the ensuing liquidity you get a pretty bleak picture so you can call me cynical but I believe doe was intentionally lying about these figures to misrepresent the success of USD and Luna and regardless of whether you think he intentionally lied or truly misremembered making completely false and fraudulent Financial declarations to investors that cause losses can and should be punished either way I think okay but just from what you said it sounds like you don't actually have heart proof that he definitely knew that the partnership with tri had ended when he made those claims about how it was bringing 2.6 million users to Tara right so I mean there's no way to to look into state of mind and actually know whether or not he actually knew but he goes on to these podcasts and he's making these sweeping declarations about millions of users tons to try demand real world and all this and it's the onus is on him the responsibility is on him to make sure that these things are real because people are investing based on these words so I highly doubt I highly doubt it when he says that he misremembered or he didn't know I believe that he he was well aware what he was doing but regardless of whether uh he knew or he didn't know it's still a crime and it's still wrong with him to declare these things and when he finds out that the facts are fake he should at least come out with clarifications and explain what the real numbers are so I feel like many of his declarations his public declarations about UST were heavily mishandled and then one other thing that you said was that he cashed out a ton of money um what evidence do you have for that so as far as a career of cash outs go there is a there's a lot of on-chain blockchain data and uh you even in your episode you directly asked about the 2.7 billion that was cashed out through curve and we have blockchain evidence of that and he has provided no explanation on Twitter and he offhandedly described it as Arbitrage after a long-winded technical explanation intended to misdirect in my view if it's really that innocent why doesn't he just release the trade logs of where the money specifically went because we have all this blockchain data proving that tfl cashed out Millions from UST why doesn't he just provide a breakdown just say okay one billion went down three one billion was for Arbitrage to be fairly simple to show this evidence and when you combine this with the fact that insiders are coming out and uh declaring that tfl has hundreds of millions stashed away it all paints a picture of uh lots of liquidity being siphoned out into his own personal offers all right so in a moment we're going to talk about additional issues surrounding dose such as his legal case and um the personal

doe interview is that at that time I interviewed him I said that there was a PDF of the arrest warrant but it was a PDF of the notice that his passport would be revoked um but regardless fat man when you were listening to Doe's response to all the legal questions that he faces in particular his opinion that the charges against him are legitimate I was curious for your thoughts on that okay so when it comes to enforcement I feel like there's been a lot of goal post moving especially from the Die Hard Luna Community so it started off with you know there was an attack and there's no proof of fraud then when we gather Insider testimony from people involved with with Tara it becomes oh they're just lying then we get blockchain evidence confirming tfl cash down billions it becomes oh fat man is just spreading Fudd then we hear the SEC is investigating Kara oh it doesn't matter because there are no charges and finally we end up at literal arrest warrants being issued and the excuse predictably is something like oh the government must be wrong so ultimately there's a faction of people deeply married to their bags or in this case their reputation and they will never concede no matter what because they'll never admit wrongdoing they know that doing so puts them in a lot of hot water and um in your episode don't mentioned Korean authorities coming after him for crypto laws so he wants people to believe that all cryptocurrencies fall into the same basket and that the government attacking Luna is an attack on coins like Bitcoin but it's really not the same at all because Luna and UST uh they had special characteristics I would say making it completely different from most token models for one most stable coins don't have a Bitcoin backing Reserve sitting in one dude's wallet and vitalik Metallica Satoshi they don't have control over an advertised Reserve to keep their coins price stable it's really quite different and it's no surprise that Regulators are specifically coming after Terra and at this point instead of running or making up excuses I think dough should face his Reckoning and then attend trial so that fair verdicts can be made oh yeah and also wanted to talk about his location uh because there's a lot of manipulative double speak going on on that front so on on Twitter he goes I'm not on the run I have nothing to hide I go on walks I'm sure people from crypto Twitter see me all the time and in the interview he's like uh no sorry I don't want to reveal my location due to personal security reasons so it to me it's a classic sign of a liar he's not able to stick to one story he just has like enough stories to write an anthology like the refusal to disclose his city is quite odd to me because there's no risk of some psycho trying to break down your door as he like he claims if he knows you're in Singapore or Dubai or whatever as long as your actual address isn't out there I think you're safe the only legitimate reason for not revealing your broad like your Broad City or general region is if you're trying to evade law enforcement because if you mention a city Interpol might attempt to activate law enforcement in that region and then you know go on the hunt through their databases or whatever but it makes no difference to public facing security issues unless you know you've done something wrong so in my view he's definitely on the run and that part is an outright lie on his part I asked him about the people who had lost huge sums of money and at least in the case of one man someone who committed suicide due to the collapse of Terror what did you think of Dove's response hmm so as far as remorse is concerned um this this is a opinion based it's subjective but personally I strongly believe he's putting up a Persona because I've spoken to several people who've known doe in a personal capacity and they know him as a sociopath who has little regard for people's feelings and he's also known as a charismatic manipulator when he wants to be and I think the same thing's Happening Here because in my view it comes down to follow the money um you asked about his net worth now compared to before the collapse and he refused to answer you asked him about getting rich while his father's lost everything and he dodged the question ultimately I think owning up to responsibility verbally that's great sure it really doesn't do anything as we know as you mentioned people lost their livelihoods over his fraudulent promises their savings our families in some cases their lives and and really the only fair remedy for that is to return a portion of his ill-gotten gains to the Sabers who lost it all and he has yet to pledge a single dollar of his own money for restitution efforts personally I'm going to start believing he's sorry when he starts paying people back the money he scanned from his own pocket until then it's all just posturing to me I asked a number of questions of dough concerning the operations of Tara some of these actions showed I guess a tendency to perhaps not really disclose things that go against the ethos of crypto for instance there was a pre-mine that was worth 1.4 billion dollars there was a dow-like hard Fork that reimbursed a VC uh that had lost some private keys to its money and that was not proactively disclosed and discussed with the community beforehand as you mentioned also he made a number of misstatements about chai but whether or not he actually knew that the partnership which I had ended is an open question um but I was curious you know just amongst the various different I mean there were so many of these things that these weren't all of them um you know as we talked about there was the 2.7 billion dollars that perhaps got cashed out um but were there any other questions that I either didn't have ask him that you'd be curious to know or were there questions that you had based on his answers like they raised additional questions for you I think in general uh like I said he managed to use a lot of words and not say much at all and um there was a lot of dancing around questions a lot of post-hoc representations of things that they really don't add up and in general I don't think he added any any massively massively new info but he did give us some interesting uh insights into his thought process you definitely raise a good point about transparency and how it doesn't match up with the crypto ethos and the whole thing about decentralization doesn't really add up if you have the coins entire backing sitting in a single guy's Bitcoin wallet I feel like he certainly downplayed some of the aspects of his involvement for example you mentioned in the interview though had been a part of failed stable coin basis cash and he tried to heavily downplay his role in it but here's the thing it absolutely matters that you made a similar stable coin in the past it absolutely matters that base is Cash crashed and burned in a spectacular fashion this is a this is a critical disclosure because it gives investors a window into terrorist potential faith and and past performance of your models and algorithms are crucial in understanding their viability loads of investors long gone also do the usd's relatively stable history but if they knew that one of those table coins had failed before I firmly believe that many retail investors could have either bailed out early or would have never invested at all so it's another example of where him not being transparent about everything he's done led to people directly losing money at the end of the show he said he would love to still contribute to the space and also let on that he's been building again doing more coding what did you think of his intentions it's a tough one it's a tough one um because those those history isn't really the best and look look when do corn makes statements like like I truly believe in the stability of UST and all this I I want to believe him I want to believe he's a good actor who can do good things for the space I really do he's he's an incredibly intelligent man I'm always going to respect his technical Acumen and personally I do my best to try and see the good in everyone and I thought for days I've rocked my brain to come up with any scenario where he's innocent any world where he's not alive but it all comes down to one thing if you really believed in UST why did you cash out so much why were you simultaneously pulling out these hundreds of millions while filling its stability to retail investors and why were there so many blatant lies intended to make USD stability and its surrounding economy look more how do you say robust to investors if you really believed in it why not let it stand on its honest merits and real achievements and so these made up statistics why would you intentionally inflate anchor borrow using your own wallets and lie about chai usage like all these things when you go through his history it's literally just lie upon life online eventually you come to a point where even his once Ardent supporters like myself we have no choice but to come to the only rational conclusion which is that Tara was a technically brilliant scheme it was definitely technically brilliant but it allowed dokwanda siphon money out of retail investors into his own pocket under the guise of the safe savings product so I I hmm if I was to supposed to think about where we can go from here like as I'm sure you can tell I'm pretty passionate about cryptocurrencies and the space has been my home for the better part of a decade but now it's being invaded by by leeches like Doh who seek to ruin and Destroy for their own benefit and I think in the past year there's been way too much damage and destruction in this space like these people are predators and they will come back again and again so if you allow me to to send a message it would be we as a space we need to come together and become more resilient if we ever want to succeed and this means calling out scammers when we see them this means making sure that vultures like dokwon aren't able to return after pulling off these massive highs it means pushing on for justice no matter how hard it gets and with all due respected though this talk of him coming back with new products designed for his own profit I I think it's pretty sickening and I think he should take a step back and bow out of this space if he had any morals he would take the hundreds of millions he earned through his fraudulent lies and return it to his victims who were most impacted now if he's too greedy to do that that's fine then just let him come to court and let the law decide I'd say I'd say let him face a fair trial where all of the evidence is laid bare and analyzed by a neutral third party but whatever whatever ends up happening I think one thing is clear I think we need to make an example of dokwon we have to show scammers around the world that you cannot come into our space take our money run away and hide and then try and come back later after everyone forgets we're not going to forget we're gonna learn our lesson we're going to build up new protections we're going to put in place Fail-Safe mechanisms and we're going to come back stronger and this is how the space will grow and become more successful and and like people like you Laura I I really commend you and everyone else who tries to bring the the truth to light and honestly even though all these things have been happening uh I'm pretty optimistic about the future of the space because I see people becoming more aware over time and um I hope to continue my work and I hope you continue your work the best we can and I I want the world to fully understand what Terror really was at every level whether this whether this is through more insiders coming out or Court Discovery whatever it is I I really want to see the perpetrators of crypto's biggest fraud brought to Justice and as long as you know we as a human Community you me everyone watching everyone in crypto Twitter as long as we don't lose our drive for the common good I'd say I think everything will be all right in the end yeah all right well thank you so much for sharing your thoughts after uh most of the crypto Community was following your tweets obsessively for the last few months it's been a real pleasure to hear from you directly thanks so much for coming on Unchained thank you very much for having me don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap vigilante group sets out to find dokwan the financial times reported that a group of Terra investors is trying to hunt down dokwan members of the UST restitution Group which has about 4 400 members have named possible locations for Quan such as Dubai Russia Azerbaijan the Seychelles or Mauritius amongst other locations they plan to start looking for him in Dubai since as one member posted Dubai is friendly to crypto very International he would not stand out and has limited extradition treaties in place this person added it would seem like the best fit for the three to five hour time zone shift apparent in the data the group even claims to have people who are very very close to do Quan their expedition to Dubai starts in little over a week Aptos Launches on mainnet but gets a negative reaction for its tokonomics on Monday aptoslabs confirmed the launch of its main net Aptos Autumn Aptos is a layer 1 blockchain created by former meta employees that had raised as much as 400 million dollars from investors like a16z FTX Ventures jump crypto multi-coin Capital binance Labs coinbase Ventures PayPal Ventures and others disclosure I write a newsletter for bulletin product the launch got a lot of criticism on crypto Twitter for not disclosing the token allocation scheme especially considering that big exchanges like binance and FTX listed the Aptos token on their platforms the following day Aptos posted an overview of its tokenomics which said that only 51 of the tokens would go to the community raising a lot of concerns about the decentralization of the blockchain additionally aptus was accused of benefiting early Venture capitalists way too much Olaf Carlson we the founder and CEO of paulington capital A crypto VC firm that did not invest in Aptos tweeted Aptos token distribution scheme is among the worst designs I've ever seen and I've seen a lot Foundation 67.5 percent team 19 investors 13.5 percent the only way coins get into the community LOL is through arbitrary foundation and distributions so the entire Supply is controlled by a bureaucracy which will grant the coins one by one it's also proof of stake so new coins cannot be earned by actors outside this distribution method I would love to hear an explanation from any person who thinks the design is good DC investor a crypto influencer wrote the near categorical rejection of Aptos created by ex-libra devs as a fairly blatant cash grab and of course funded by The Usual Suspects who've extracted billions from the space may be one of the most important social shifts we've seen in the space in a while Voyager Executives to settle on potential missteps an investigation in the bankruptcy case of Voyager digital recommended that the executives of the company settle on alleged mismanagement Voyager CEO Stephen erlich and previous CFO Evan saropoulos lent three arrows Capital nearly one billion dollars in crypto but following the implosion of Terra and its stablecoin UST the crypto hedge fund went bankrupt and failed to repay the loan to Voyager the executives were under investigation to discover whether they had failed to perform proper due diligence on the loan however there was no clear evidence of mismanagement or fraud making it very hard to prove it in court the conclusion was that Executives settle for an amount between 1.3 million dollars and 3 million dollars from their personal assets and up to 20 million dollars through insurance only a few days before a court filing revealed that the top Executives of the company were seeking legal immunity an idea which was received with a lot of contempt from voyager's creditors committee additionally three arrows capital is being probed by the cftc and the SEC as reported by Bloomberg according to the media Outlet the agencies are trying to redefine whether the failed hedge fund misled investors by not disclosing the weakness of its balance

Jeopardy embankment Freed's acquisition of Voyager digital's distressed assets after he won the auction and agreed to pay the bankrupt crypto lender 1.4 billion dollars new draft Bill Sparks concerns about Financial Freedom Delphi Labs general counsel Gabriel Shapiro revealed a secret new draft of the digital Commodities consumer protection act or dccpa which the Commodities future trading commission would use to regulate the crypto industry the language of the draft would exclude software developers from being counted as digital commodity Brokers which according to Shapiro could be a boon to D5 crypto still the draft raised some concerns about its potential impacts on crypto and Financial Freedom on this issue Congressman Tom emmer wrote decentralization is the point if we sacrifice D5 for legislation we're throwing away the opportunity the dccpa was introduced by Senators Debbie stabenow and John buzman in August and has gained support from crypto Giants such as coinbase and FDX however the blockchain association tweeted that the bill needs to be changed what would create a ban on decentralized finance additionally SPF published a 3 800 word industry Norms

theory I've ever seen is this one which was a reply to coindesk who tweeted out an interview they did with me uh asked me questions about my chat with doe in it I said that until we have definitive
