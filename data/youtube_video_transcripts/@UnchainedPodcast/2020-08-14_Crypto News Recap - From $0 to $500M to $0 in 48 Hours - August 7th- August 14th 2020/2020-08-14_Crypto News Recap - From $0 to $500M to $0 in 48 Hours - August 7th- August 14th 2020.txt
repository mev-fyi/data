[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline microstrategy is first public company to buy bitcoin it seems the pandemic and other macro forces are prompting investors to take a closer look at bitcoin for the first time a publicly traded company has backed bitcoin as part of its investment strategy microstrategy announced on tuesday that it purchased 21 000 bitcoins at an aggregate of 250 million dollars microstrategy ceo michael j saylor said quote our investment in bitcoin is part of our new capital allocation strategy which seeks to maximize long-term value for our share shareholders this investment reflects our belief that bitcoin as the world's most widely adopted cryptocurrency is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash meanwhile the correlation rate between bitcoin and gold has reached 70 percent for the first time which suggests that at least some do agree with sailor's view of bitcoin as a dependable store of value next headline the rise and fall of yam yam a yield farming token launched on tuesday generated tons of community enthusiasm and criticism at one

enough votes 1.6 million yam were delegated for a fix to be submitted before the next rebase which was to happen the following morning at first it looks like it would succeed because enough wales had planned to chip in to reach quorum however once the votes were submitted the team figured out that the bug also affected the governance module so the proposal could not succeed at that point the

blog post that it is planning to launch a new version of the protocol hopefully the team will heed the words of lefteris karapetsus a central figure from the days of the dao who wrote an amazing blog post i urge you all to read that chronicled every step of the yam fiasco and why this whole thing could have been avoided as he puts it quote the minimum precaution that should have been taken is write contract tests have some sort of security audit of the code if you claim it's an experiment then treat it as such by putting deposits deposit limits in the code to protect your users putting an escape hatch in the code to protect your users all of this is worth a read for his explanation of also why this was a ponzi game in which as he puts it quote the first farmers were incentivized to pump and shill yam via social media so they could find victims onto whom to dump their tokens after the rebase next headline ethereum transactions transaction fees reach all-time high ethereum gas

ursum of paradigm capital wrote a comprehensive post about crypto native insurance and the design challenges it poses including the especially tricky question of whether or not payouts should be manual or programmatic while entirely programmatic systems do sound ideal as ethereum creator vitalik buterin pointed out if an insurance system is programmed to make a payout when x event happens then token teams presumably would know that they should build into their protocols a way to prevent x from happening so this kind of leads the insurance to seem moot if it's already accounted for by the token teams all right fun bits vitalik scraps ethereum 2.0 to audit supply of ethereum for those of you who were following the eighth supply date that andreas and i discussed earlier coin jazeera
