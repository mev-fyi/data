York Times report revealed that besieged U.S congressman George Santos used his political connections to promote an alleged crypto scam it's better if you hear it from comedian Ginny Hogan there's some sort of law in physics that all things that are inevitable must come to pass and everything that must be will one day be all of which is to say yes of course George Santos is now involved in a crypto Scandal a campaign donor told the New York Times that Santa sent two others tried a Nigerian prince type scam on him they approached him saying that there was a wealthy polish citizen who wanted to buy crypto but couldn't because his assets were frozen and then asked this donor to start an LLC to gain access to the funds and Santos's defense the intersection of the Venn diagram of people whose assets are frozen and people who want to buy crypto is pretty big the donor didn't go through with it but I do believe his story because it's honestly really really really really vulnerable to admit that you donated to George Santos you wouldn't just make something like that up I don't understand why George Santos can't just get into insider trading like a normal politician at least then he'd still be welcome in the Hamptons but honestly I've always believed that if George Santos wants people to believe he's innocent he should just say he's guilty and that is a wrap thanks
