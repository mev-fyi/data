will be recognized today stay tuned to find out I'm recording today from the coin desk consensus conference in New York City and my guest is Jesse Powell co-founder and CEO of Kraken welcome Jesse hey Laura what does Kraken do and how does it distinguish itself from the other crypto exchanges in the space Kraken is a digital asset exchange where we trade 17 assets and I'd say we distinguish ourselves with our customer service and our security and you offer actually quite a number of tokens compared to some of the other exchanges like Gemini and coinbase how do you get so many on the platform we've got a large team of people responsible for managing the token gateways which is basically the technical work required to process transactions on those networks we've also got a team of guys that are evaluating the tokens for you know listing qualifications and when you said that one of your priorities as security or one of the ways you distinguish yourself is security how do you do that when a lot of people talk about how you know these exchanges are big honey pots and they're on 24/7 365 and especially in your case where you have multiple tokens how do you keep things secure yeah well with with a lot of hard work and and a lot of diligence and just being extremely careful about everything we do all the time you know not just at the technical level but also at the the personal level you know in terms of like training our people how we operate the the lengths that we go to to keep things private so that could involve creating proxy entities to contract with our service providers you know to to using pseudonyms wherever possible basically trying to to keep the entire operation as private as possible Oh interesting so contractors don't know that it's a crypto exchange or ever possible yeah oh wow that's really interesting that's smart and how do you decide which cryptocurrencies in crypto assets down to your platform so we've got a very thorough evaluation process we've got over a hundred things that we look at when evaluating a token from you know the main thing we're looking at is basically is this token still going to be around tomorrow and is it a scam you know we we do some work on you know we try to look at like the technical merit as part of that but the main things are you know we just want to we want to protect people from from things that are outright scams and we also look at the technical difficulty of supporting it and continuing to maintain the protocol so if it's something that's very early stage and it's going to going to require a lot of work to maintain that might be something that we wait until a further stage of development to list so anyway in all its its it it's a very lengthy process we spend a lot of resources to evaluate the tokens so we certainly haven't evaluated every token but the ones that we do evaluate tend to be the ones that our clients are really asking us to take a look at what is a Krakken why did you decide any mere exchange after it yes a Kraken is a legendary sea monster of Norse mythology and I chose the name Kraken because it helped that I had the domain I had actually bought the domain years ago and years before Bitcoin I've been collecting domains for a long time and I thought someday I'm gonna do something really cool with Kraken and so when we got the idea to do a Bitcoin exchange we we had a lot of ideas for names and Kraken Kraken was was always kind of my first choice and I really had to convince my co-founder that this was a good name to use and I liked it because it has all the hallmarks of a great brand it's short it's easy to say it's easy to to spell it's fun and in terms of the exchange business there are a lot of metaphors that we use when talking about markets that that fit like liquidity and depth and whales and sharks and you know the Kraken is is the biggest baddest beast in the ocean you know so it's sort of the master liquidity so the name was really perfect in my mind and so that's why we went with it so it's like a Norse sea monster or something like yeah yeah probably like a giant octopus okay yeah I I personally had to Google that I was it I knew it was something in that realm but like didn't know exactly but no I agree with you it is a good name like one one time I heard I'm Sara Blakely the founder of Spanx talking about how she you know became a billionaire and everything and she was saying that she chose the name stings because like she realized that a lot of great brands have the sound K in them which is really interesting like Kodak and I don't remember the other one she listed but like that was literally like she just played around with different names until she came out with something that had his case out in it so you were said to one other thing I want to ask you about was who your customers tend to be like you know just how would you break them out in terms of who they are and then how much they account for and assets and training sure so you got several buckets of users you know there's the the retail trader there's the the more kind of professional day trader there's institutions there's people that basically know nothing about Bitcoin but just heard about Bitcoin I want to want to buy one Bitcoin and hold it so we you know we don't cater to all of those equally you know I think some other exchanges do a better job of providing that basic buy sell experience for the extremely novice user you know our target demographic is more slightly more experienced and interested in in actually doing more trading so the whole interface and the tools that we provide are all more geared toward that you may not have read this article but last summer when I wrote this cover story about initial coin offerings I had a little sidebar about a trader who used the kraken platform to turn like $8,500 into 7.5 million dollars in six months using your leverage training did you read that yeah why don't you describe the leveraged trading product yeah so margin trading is basically where you borrow money from from the exchange to to make a trade so let's say you had like $100 on your account you could borrow another $400 from Kraken to be able to trade with $500 in total and there's some risk in doing that because if we ever you know we get we have a formula to determine this but if it if it ever appears that you might not be able to pay us back what you've borrowed then we would liquidate your position so we would sell everything that you had on your account to get the loan back basically so there's some risk that you lose everything when you do this you know if you started with a hundred you borrowed 400 so you bought a total 500 Bitcoin well if you're a total of 500 Bitcoin got down to be $400 worth of Bitcoin you know just a 20% drop which we see in Bitcoin regularly we would have basically sold the other 400 and then gotten our loan back but you'd be left with a zero well yeah that guy that I just mentioned there was one moment where he nearly lost everything and it was super super close and somehow it didn't actually happen and then you know he became a millionaire but yes I definitely I definitely seen the risk in that and people at home don't try it to do with that guy did yeah definitely know what you're doing before you get into it and and if you're going to be trading on margin babysit your position and you know you really have to be keeping an eye on it otherwise you know we will liquidate your position if it gets too too close to the margin level yeah he basically said that he didn't leave the house pretty much for six months except to like go buy a sandwich and that he was just on the computer for like 16 hours a day and then would like sleep at night and and basically just yeah was constantly like doing his trades and the second it hit some target point he would you know do a buyer or a seller I'd I don't remember all the mechanisms but it sounded intense obviously panned out for him but like I said don't try this at home people because I think that that probably is more the exception rather than the rule yeah okay one other thing I want to ask you about was your background appears to be in gaming in the arts what were you doing in those fields and how did you come to launch a crypto exchange yeah so I've always been a gamer but since 2001 I had a company selling virtual items had currencies for online games like World of Warcraft gold Diablo swords runescape gold maplestory we did about 20 different games and our model was basically to to buy virtual goods from China and sell them in the West to mostly North American and European clients and it was like Chinese players that were quote-unquote mining these yeah the gold farmers of China yeah or who basically guys or BOTS usually bots it would be like one guy would be supervising like 100 BOTS no one would be playing the games they would produce the gold or the items and then sell it to us and we would resell them in the interesting so four people who did not listen to the episode with brought peers he should check that out because he talks about this business model in depth and did you know Brock from that day I did know Brock yeah back before Bitcoin we were essentially competitors and in the same business line back then yeah it's kind of interesting I I wonder if like that experience is why people like you and Brock sort of saw the potential in Bitcoin early do you think so oh yeah I think so I mean when I read about Bitcoin in really 2011 the potential was immediately clear to me you know Bitcoin was solving problems that we had been dealing with in payments for a decade you know it was chargebacks it was transaction fees it was taking and making international payments it was having a client base of kids too young to have a credit card you know or have any way to pay for something online so it solved all these problems with payments but it also solved there's just real problems that real people were having you know like kids not having a way to make payments online even people like legitimate people in a country like Nigeria you know you you could legitimately have a Nigerian prince trying to make a credit card payment to you like yeah right you know no way am i taking your your credit card payment but you know with Bitcoin you could and so people that have historically been ostracized or excluded from from the online payments were older the global financial system now had a way to to make payments to engage and so it was great from that perspective in terms of you know Financial Inclusion so philosophically like I've I really was excited about Bitcoin as well you know apart from just the practical applications and I know at some point in there you also worked in the arts so what exactly happened you were doing the online gaming business yeah and then how did the arts thing fit in along with your transition to Bitcoin yeah so by 2007 the gaming business is doing really well I had some spare cash I had a bunch of friends who are artists and they were you know the the stereotypical starving artists you know working out of their kitchens you know kind of their their art studio had taken over their apartment and I thought you know it would be really cool to give these guys a space to work and I was familiar with like what Andy Warhol had done with the factory and their other art centers around the country and around the world that had brought artists together in one space and I thought it would just be great to have a place to give these people you know so they could get out of their kitchens and into a studio and also to have the collaborative environment because I thought it was it would be really cool to see what happens when all these artists get together in the same space and can share ideas and I was living in Sacramento at the time and I also wanted to have a really great art gallery in Sacramento that could do shows like what you would see in New York or Los Angeles and so I found this warehouse it was about 10,000 square feet and I did it and I rented it out I had a three year lease I figured we'll just see how it goes and so I put an ad in the paper offering free studio space to artists and I would get phone calls like hey why trying to scam artists you know this is evil artists a poor you shouldn't scam artists and you know eventually I had some people come by and and some people that were well known in the community started a vouch for the project and so then I started to get more artists coming in and and it was great because because it was free space I could be selective about who I took in and I really just took people that were really serious and really really great artists in the region and I don't understand the scam part how could it be a scam if it was free yeah I don't know I guess they thought like somehow they were gonna come over and I was gonna steal other art supplies or you know I don't I really don't know right cuz they're so valuable or maybe I was gonna steal their information yeah yeah please don't steal from artists they really don't have anybody yeah well having a lot of writer friends I I can vouch for that as well but so then keep going it with how did you end up in Bitcoin so Bitcoin I just randomly read about in in March of 2011 and you know it was obvious to me that this is going to be huge you know I was a little bit skeptical at first because we had seen other attempts at making some sort of a non-government currency like eagled or the Liberty Reserve and these things had always just had trouble with regulation and and Bitcoin kind of existed outside outside of that and so I thought okay maybe this thing actually has a real shot and nothing ever existed like it before and you know we knew that there was a market for this because you we would know that you know kids are trading their World of Warcraft gold for you know brownies at school and stuff you know this is like their version of PayPal this is where they stored their value and this is where they they kept their money it was like in their world Warcraft account you know so there was definitely a class of people that was not being served by the traditional system and that's just like you know when we think of the unbanked we think of people you know and undeveloped countries you know in the countryside but really like it's all these kids under the age of 18 in the United States are part of the unbanked I'm just you know so there's that but then yeah there is everyone else in the rest of the world everyone without a credit card you know or we can't get a bank account because they don't have proof of identity or whatever so it was just having dealt with payments issues in the virtual goods business for the last 10 years you know up until 2011 I thought this is this has got such huge potential and I really want to do something to be involved with this and so then how did you end up lunch and crackin so at first I was dabbling in in mining and we were trying to figure out ways to get gamers to use a Bitcoin more but I think it was just too early and in mining turned out to be just too much of a headache and you know as you know my name is turned out to be really specialized in kind of a scale business so we got into the exchange thing we were entertaining the idea of doing either a wallet or an exchange and we decided to go with the exchange after an experience that I had with mountain  in June of 2011 which was you know they got hacked for you know what we're told at least it was a few thousand Bitcoin back then and the exchange went down for about a week and coincidentally an old friend that I had from the high school days Roger Vere who is the owner of Bitcoin comm and a very controversial figure in the community these days very he I knew him from playing Magic the Gathering with him in high school oh well and he happened to be living in Tokyo just a few blocks away from the mountain gods office and he was in a Bitcoin at the time as well and I was trading on Mount  so I was falling in situation closely and I was talking to Roger Roger went over to the Knox office and discovered that it was just mark Karp Ellis and one other person who he had hired yesterday you know who were there like sir these two guys basically one guy you know and who had been servicing like the entire Bitcoin community and he had like 60,000 users at the time and what what do you know what the trading volume or the dollar amount or anything I don't remember what the amounts were the Bitcoin in volumes were insane now right they were like hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin a day because a Bitcoin was like a dollar so well Bitcoin wise it was huge but dollar wise I don't think it you know wasn't like the numbers were seeing today like billions of dollars traded so Roger found like two people in the office and offered his help to mark and Mark took it and you know told mark as well that that I would be willing to come out and help and fortunately that the virtual goods business at the time was basically on autopilot and and I was able just to take off the next morning and go to Tokyo and so they invited me out to help and I spent about a week and a half in the office GOx in tokyo just helping them get things back together like I wrote the press release for the incident help them hire a bunch of people help them build like a support team to answer all the tickets and so by the end of that experience and I came back to the states thinking there's got to be another exchange I can't have the whole ecosystem dependent on this one exchange because when my box was down everything was down I mean we had no price discovery merchants could not convert their Bitcoin into dollars which was important for them because you know they were paying their bills in dollars so I thought you know for Bitcoin to really grow mainstream we're gonna need to see in exchange you know also more redundancy and exchanges broadly but in exchange is really doing things the right way professionally putting security first taking a very careful and cautious approach and working with the regulators to to build bridges to the traditional financial system and so I talked to Mike my CTO at loot which was the virtual goods business and asked him a few people linked to to do a crypto exchange and he was all on board with it he had been himself writing BOTS for four markets and he's always always been interested in trading and and money and also a big believer in Bitcoin and if not for somebody like him I wouldn't have even thought to do it is the guy's the best hacker I've ever met you know the best security mind that I've ever met and I knew that that was you know just coming out of the mountain ox experience security was something that we were gonna have to put absolutely first and not compromise on and he was definitely the guy to do it so I wouldn't have imagined doing it without somebody like that because that was the first thing that we would have to get right when did you launch Kraken so we launched the exchange actually in in beta in May of 2013 and then with real money trading in September of 2013 okay well I would have to say if you were mulling between wallets and exchanges that you chose the better option the more lucrative one at least so you brought up regulation a few times and I wanted to talk about that because you recently refused to answer a request from the former now or then New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman which was a request to answer a bunch of questions about your business about the crypto exchange ships business what did you respond and why did you decide to respond that way yeah I saw it as more of a demand than a request and it came with a deadline of two weeks to produce this like forty point questionnaire and you know I felt like that my first reaction when getting that it was like this is a total slap in the face like those are the words in my mind turns out this guy's actually slapping people in the face in his spare time right I first said they say yes they say allegedly you know it when it came to me I was just offended by it because we had put all this effort into New York years ago and the the bitlicense got like three thousand plus comments on it and what we got out of it was a disaster and so we left New York and we've had no business in New York since then and this request from Schneiderman it came out of nowhere you know most when most regulators or government want to know something they'll reach out privately they'll try to have a conversation but this just came out of nowhere we'd never heard from Scheider man before and it seems like he didn't even talk to the DFS before sending this out it was like a total publicity stunt you know rather than going to get help from from your own government you're coming till I put this burden on all the all the exchanges to produce this and we all produced most of this back before the bitlicense emerged so New York has this information a lot of it's on the website a lot of its private and you know frankly the government doesn't have a good track record of keeping information private you know but wasn't that information initially collected like in 2013 or 2014 or something yeah let me know it's 2018 so yes some of its been has been refreshed but you know the what is the AG you have to do with any of this isn't isn't the DFS responsible for this you know and why do you need to make this public out of it you know it just seemed like a publicity stunt yeah that was devoid of any real concern because he just gone about it I think the wrong way you know he could have had these conversations separately but to to make this public announcement like he's the new law in town you know he's gonna hold everybody to task is it just rub me the wrong way it came off as a bullying and you know I just had this smell that this guy is like a bully you know and I probably wouldn't have said anything but for the other exchanges coming forward and saying things like oh this is great we're happy to work with regulators and you know we're gonna respond to this and I just felt like this is the wrong kind of attitude to have I mean we have to put our foot down somewhere we can't just bend over backwards every time any random regulator in the world you know in this case not even a regulator but just like a law enforcement official comes forward and demands things you know on a deadline especially from places where we don't even have service so you know who is this guy and you know I can't stand bullies and I can't stand hypocrites and you know this guy turns out to be both so I'm glad that I gave him the response that I did and have you written off New York completely as a place for Yule tea business we would be willing to come back to New York it would take probably a dramatic change to the bit license to do it you know right now the United States altogether is only 20% of our business so you know you can imagine what what piece of that New York isn't how significant we think New York is to our global business so it's incremental revenue at this point you know the question for us is with limited resources should we put them into New York or should we put them somewhere else you know or we have you know prime ministers all over the world asking for meetings to help them craft regulation in their countries why should we waste time you know we've already wasted so much time on New York it seems like a lost cause but do you think that your response might have hurt the chances that the bitlicense would be revised in a way that's favorable to your business no I don't think so you know hopefully hopefully it sends the message that you know we're not ready to give in to this bitlicense and that something needs to be done and I think some some people in New York have recognized that that that there needs to be a change New York wants to see more businesses come in did they did the Attorney General's Office respond to you know there was no official response there was some response like unofficially of something about legitimate businesses would love to provide this information or something along those lines you know II don't have anything better to do you decided to exit Japan as well and I I read that you you were saying that your market share they are combined with the increased regulation where are the reasons that you decided to leave but when you couple that along with your response to Eric Schneiderman do you feel like that may indicate to some people that Kraken is not welcoming of regulation I guess it may give that impression you know I think we explained that in the blog post but we worked quite extensively with the regulator in Japan to actually to craft that legislation and to to develop the virtual currency Act so you know we spent significant resources in to to basically building that whole industry in Japan you know we were the oldest surviving Exchange in Japan and we had every intention to go through with with completing the process for a couple reasons we didn't get entirely through it you know we I think maybe focus too much on regulation and not enough on actually developing the business in Japan you know so we didn't we didn't spend anything on marketing you know some of our domestic Japanese competitors did spend quite a bit more marketing seem to gain more traction I mean while we were distracted with the regulation side of things so you know I think what ultimately turned out to be a good thing for Japan was not necessarily a good thing for us and in getting through the process our global business we were the only exchange to apply for the license that had a global global business and those were all the Japanese exchanges and so the complexity of our global business turned out to be a big problem because Japan felt like to understand really the risk of our Japanese business they had to really understand the whole picture like the parent company and the other subsidiaries in the organization and how everything all worked together and that was a substantially broader and more complicated task than just like auditing the Japanese entity you know it was going to be basically many audits on many entities and a lot a lot more work and it became even more work after one of the largest Japanese exchanges got hacked for about 500 million dollars so we were you know in most of the way through the process when it happened but that also dramatically increased the scrutiny on us and the FSA felt like before they give away any more licenses they were gonna have to go even even deeper than they already were and so it just became this kind of moving goalpost situation where we felt like we had done so much work already and now suddenly we're being asked to do even more work and we have this global business and we just were not prepared to you know there was some deadline to get all this stuff done as well and we just weren't prepared to divert all these resources to getting this done at that time so I think what we'll do is so we took a step back you know we got out of the process of the filing and we decided okay we're just gonna we're gonna be approach this on our own timeline we'll get out of Japan for now you know we're not giving up much because we didn't have much much market share there we'll take our time and work on doing all these things they want us to do which is you know audits on all these various entities and it's not easy to get an audit in this industry so we'll just reappropriation no interesting okay so you might you might reenter that market yeah when I combine everything with your letter to Eric Schneiderman a little bit the Japanese thing I mean it sounds like that's a more nuanced picture that involves business considerations more but if I think about all those things and then last night it was announced that you and crackin are donating 1 million dollars to coin Center and also matching additional donations for the rest of the month putting all that together it almost seems like you have some state when you want to make a regulation you can tell me if you don't but if you do what is that statement sure actually we made the commitment to coin Center even before the thing no came up ok you just announced last night we've always been from from day one we knew that we had to engage with regulators so it's not something we're trying to turn away from at all you know we've spent significant resources on regulation and trying to understand how to comply with the law but not just in the US but all over the world and we spent millions of dollars on legal counsel so certainly not something we're trying to avoid the coin Center donation I think is a reflection of just all the great work the coin Center is doing you know I'm just all the time always impressed by the work that they do I'm always able to point regulators to to work the coin Center has done their thinking on the topic of cryptocurrency and law around cryptocurrency is it's just rock solid always and so you're having run a non-profit myself I know that you tend to waste a lot of time trying to raise money and not actually working on the the objective you know the actual thing that you're trying to do and so you know we're fortunate to have a great year last year and unfortunate to finally to be in a position to to donate back to coin Center you know they've given so much to the community in to the industry I'm just proud to be able to support them even further and I hope that they can do even more great work with the money and so you don't have a larger statement about regulation I hope that there were the regulators listen to guys like coin Center I think they have a very fair and impartial approach to to what should be done you know they're they're kind of defending that the technology and in defending consumers from the perspective of providing choice in technology and you know making sure that this technology doesn't somehow get suffocated before it really has a chance to flourish so you know my statement to the regulator's well I have a lot of statements I make to regulators but you know I think our industry is global and and these regulators tend to look locally and they tend to enforce locally and I think that governments need to look at crypto more from a you know should really be looked at from like a national security perspective because it's more than just protecting people from from fraud it's it's you know a technology like the Internet you know what would it mean to to dramatically limit the way that the internet was used you know it could mean that your country joins the rest of the world and you know some kind of economic revolution or it could mean you're like stuck in the dark ages so I think we need to be really careful about how we regulate crypto and make sure that we don't go too far to exclude our country from participation in this great technology we're gonna discuss a little more regulation plus Wall Street and more but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell

slash recognized I'm speaking with Jesse Powell of Krakken what do you think the ideal crypto regulation looks like I think first first rule is do no harm you know I think that there's already a lot of regulation out there that that covers crypto I think the regulator really just needs to take care you know it depends on what are the public policy goals and our are your objectives already covered by existing law in some way or does existing law in some way impede upon the development of crypto and you know if if there's nothing there already in the way I think just taking some time to wait and see how things develop I think is the best way to go if you can't wait and see how things develop I think creating some sort of environment where you can keep an eye on things like a sandbox type thing where you can have companies register and you can have a dialogue with them and you can keep an eye on them I think that works really well you just don't want to jump the gun and go too far because it's really hard to predict how things are going to develop and I know you work in multiple jurisdictions like for instance I think Europe is your biggest market is that correct that's right so are there any particular regulators that you think are doing an especially good job um you know Europe so far has been pretty hands-off with the regulation so I wouldn't point to anyone in particular you know in Europe that has like the perfect crypto regulation so far there hasn't really been any crypto regulation in Europe it seems like Malta is making a play to be a crypto player the yeah I wouldn't say you know I think the VC Act in Japan is really one of the first decent example of like a comprehensive regulation the one that you helped okay you're also the only exchange I believe that offers leveraged trading of crypto via Paris at least here in the US market is that correct that may be possible there are some other exchanges that offer it I don't know if they're servicing the US okay what are the challenges in offering that and how do you make it happen technically it's a really difficult thing to do because you have to you have to keep track of these balances and the amount of credit kind of allocated at all times and then what the liquidation points are so it it significantly complicates the technology you were taking a task for your servers being offline for two days in January for a system upgrade and you also suffered an ethereal flash crash due to a DDoS attack what mistakes did you guys make that allowed those events to happen yeah so the the etherium flash crash was not actually due to a DDoS attack you know it's actually not entirely clear that there was a real DDoS attack you know it's hard to know whenever you you have a service outage because of a tremendous amount of traffic it's it's you know kind of on the scale of things like you don't know how much of it at least immediately is is real legitimate traffic and how much of it is denial of service traffic so around that flash crash it just I mean we've we've looked at all the the records extensively we've tried to to determine whether somebody it seems like somebody was attempting to intentionally cause that to happen and we can find any evidence of it but what it looks like was just naturally there were a lot of people that were very long either so they had a lot of margin trades open they borrowed a lot of of currency to buy ether and then when the price of ether started coming down there were a couple a couple cells just in a row that kind of drove the price down to a point where you had one liquidation and that liquidation you know when we liquidate we sell so that's sold that drove the price down a little more that caused another liquidation which caused another and so you have this cascade of liquidations that ultimately drove the price down a lot and that is natural market behavior I mean think everything worked as it should have and those are just that is one of the the big risks and trading on margin is that you can be caught up in one of these cascading liquidations and you might be forced to sell your position at a very adverse price yeah the same thing happened on G Dax and in fact they you know halted their margin trading and haven't even brought it back since in general how do you keep the exchange running 24/7 365 and how do you prevent further situations like these ones we just talked about yeah so I mean with regret to the outage and the 24/7 365 operation is something that traditional markets have not dealt with right they're operating 9:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday we've got to keep it going continuously 24/7 365 it's it's very difficult to do that you know sometimes you just need to have downtime in the case of our two days we basically were coming off of a many months of really having a poorly performing service at peak times which which is a really bad user experience and we could have done more work to ahead of time to better prepare for the transition over to so we replaced the trading the old trading engine with the new trading engine that required a significant amount of downtime while we kind of switched over and tested things before we put it back online and in testing we we just discovered that there were some flaws in the production environment that we hadn't discovered in the testing environment and the two environments were not identical they were extremely close but not entirely identical and we could have you know the really right way to do this if you have an unlimited amount of time and resources just to have your test environments and just the identical to your production environments in every way and you have like many sets of hardware in your system replicated many times to be able to do this but we didn't have all that setup and so we could have set all that up but that would have delayed by several more months the the upgrade and so we thought from testing you know we're we're like 99% sure this is gonna work but when we got it into production we started to find things and then it you know it was like one of the strings you like you pull it it and it starts to like you just it revealed kind of more more like a deeper problem and it took a long time really till I actually get to what the source of the problem was and so we just couldn't bring the exchange back online it rolling back would have been just we really needed to figure that out in production there wasn't a way to really roll back to the old system and then like work out the problem in in the test environment further so we kind of just had to stick with it we didn't know how long it was going to take and we expected it was going to take a few hours to do the transition ended up taking two days unfortunately you know we definitely didn't expect that we certainly learned a lot from it but now that that's done you know it immediately solved the problem the people had been having for months and so I think if you ask anybody they would say it was totally worth it to have you know now a fully functioning exchange rather than kind of a crippled exchange again for four months while we try to work out this perfect test environment and if you have to do that type of upgrade again then are you gonna build a production I mean sorry a test environment exactly the same as the production yeah yeah now we have the time to do that that's in process now so any other major upgrade like that would definitely be tested in an environment that's basically identical to the production environment traders on your site don't receive 1099 KS that help them calculate their capital gains tax do you have a plan to offer such reports or plans to help customers in some other way with their capital gains tax yeah we do have some some plans in the works for providing some tax tools for people we don't offer anything at the moment you can export your history there are a couple other services that do provide I'm gonna log parsing and in tax support for Bitcoin is quite complicated especially if you're doing margin trading and especially if you are buying and selling Bitcoin outside of a single exchange you know you have to identify what your cost basis is and before you transfer it in or or what you did with it after you transferred it out so you know it's just the picture from one exchange may not be at all complete you really need to put together all the information from every we're and I think that some some services that that provides support for for all the exchanges together have a better opportunity to really provide kind of a comprehensive report that people really need yeah and for listeners who want to know more about this I cover to all things tax and crypto back in January I think it was and they indeed did say that some of these reports are misleading from some of the exchanges because you do really need to to calculate it from where you bought it so if you bought it on a different exchange then you would need to figure out what your tax basis is from that point you've only raised six point five million dollars compared a coin basis two hundred million how does your strategy differ in a way that allows you to not need to raise more money actually we raised more like twelve is you're probably connect CrunchBase okay thanks for the correction yeah we yeah we raised about twelve so we did a series a there's about five million and then we did another one another round later privately there was about another six million so you know I guess we just we've been more efficient with capital and Quimby's has explored a lot of things you know they're doing a lot of stuff but you know they've also there's a trade off for that too right I mean they were they were able to continue building through the downturn in the market and that's because they had all this capital to do it and so you know that has its advantages and just being able to being well positioned and being strong to be able to handle like a giant wave of growth and you know maybe they might be more prepared than we were you know say you know because like the the downtime is an example of this you know they might have had the resources to really develop all the test suite and all this stuff properly whereas and there was a period of time where and we laid off half the company because things were so tight and because the market was was bearish and we were just gonna having this like 2014-2015 we were just kind of flatlined you know the market wasn't growing and that was when we really like to scale back and we were just kind of like in survival mode for like two years well had we raised a hundred million dollars we would have been able to continue to build throughout that time really toward the future you know instead of being kind of behind and having to like try to catch up I win the next wave hit so so I you know I think we're very strongly positioned today but you know there's something to be said just for having a giant war chest to be able to build through a downturn and not have to to make cuts does that mean that you're thinking about taking on more funding no actually I mean we're doing so well now that that there would be no reason to take on funding unless there were some like massive like five hundred million dollar acquisition or something like that that that we wanted to do what are your revenues I'm not going to disclose the habit they're good IntercontinentalExchange is working on a platform to trade Bitcoin and Goldman is also working on opening up a trading operation although they're apparently not going to be trading crypto assets directly at first do you worry about these incumbents from the traditional financial services sector entering the space or do not consider them competitive with you I think if those guys get in I would consider it you know a massive win for the entire industry and in ecosystem I think they will open up crypto to even more users and bring it even further toward the mainstream so generally I think that's fantastic as a business you know I don't really see it I don't see it as direct competition you know they're going to increase the size the pool by bringing more people in and I don't think that they're going to be as agile as we are and you know I don't think they're going to be able to evaluate and AD tokens as fast as we can I don't think they're going to be as understanding of what the market really wants you know we've we've got so much institutional knowledge you know we've been in this base for so long now you know the companies nearly 7 7 years old I think we really understand what people in the crypt of space want and so you know I think we're better able to provide service to them and so I think we've got a strong competitive edge there you know I think I think you know if Nasdaq starts trading crypto that may be the first stop for new people coming in but I think as they develop more interest in understanding that we'll come over to us for more kind of specialized services and you recently hired Steve hunch the former CTO of jump trading which is a high speed training firm and obviously you know as I mentioned we're seeing this convergence of traditional Wall Street and crypto so how do you think that will play out what direction would you like to take the company in the next few years as the ecosystem it loves yes so actually we've heard quite a few people out of traditional financial firms lately and we're seeing even more interest coming in like a lot of people coming in from traditional finance and Wall Street who want to work at cracking just reaching out to you cold yeah oh well yeah I mean it's really surprising it's completely the opposite of where we were like five years ago so I think it's really exciting and I think we'll we'll see more of that and I think that you know this is maybe another reason why the traditional players may have a harder time getting into the space because you know their best and brightest are leaving to go join crypto companies now so you know I think it's it's great for the crypto companies to have you know what traditionally had been you know I don't come from the world of financial services and neither does my co-founder and you know having those people with that institutional experience come in to Kraken and teach us everything that they know from that world is really great I think it's going to help us professionalize and and you know help further going to build those bridges to to the mainstream and so when you think about like how this is going to develop with both sides kind of coming together how would you like to position Kraken you know I hope to continue on with the original mission which was to really be the professional compliant service that the people can look to and Trust and is seen just as capable as any of the traditional financial institutions out there you know the people trust and can rely on for the crypto exchange alright last question which is sort of like tips for listeners I know that you think security is a big focus and you will also written a number of blog posts that talk about how people should secure their coins what tips would you give people for securing their crypto yeah well I you know that the hack that everyone is getting hit with these days is the the mobile phone hijacking and we have a blog post about this and how to secure your mobile phone it's one little bit you know we see mobile phone numbers are stolen and not to use to get access to email accounts then the email account you just access to everything else so that I'd say is is the prime you know problem say like use two-factor on everything don't use SMS for two-factor or try to use a Yubikey or Google Authenticator try to keep your involvement with crypto private as much as you can you know don't advertise all over your LinkedIn profile if it's not necessary you know that you're into crypto because the hackers are they're scouring LinkedIn and they're scouring Twitter and this is how they build their target list for people to go after keep as much personal information about yourself and your family off the internet as possible you know I know that this is it's come to light more recently we thought the Facebook stuff but really you know most people have just revealed everything about themselves online and you know service providers are still very far behind in how they handle security you know they ask you questions about your personal life that are available to the public on Facebook you know like what's your mother's maiden name well I can just go to your Facebook account see what your mom's name is you know and and then answer that question and that's like a security question quote-unquote you know so quote people I think need to just take more care of their privacy online and we're seeing how much this really matters now if with how that data is being used against people yeah it amazes me that you said that the most common attack vector is still that the phone hijacking one because I wrote the about it too and that came out like a year and a half ago so it's kind of sad that I think they haven't I think they haven't taken it seriously you know it's something like if it hasn't happened to you or someone you would immediately know you just don't you think like that's not gonna happen to me I'm not a I'm not a target or whatever you know but they have their list and they go down it and in some cases people even have called their phone company to ask them to put security codes on it but you call them a hundred times and you just get that one agent you know there's most most the time there's not like a technical impede meant to - doing this is just like the agent is supposed to follow the notes on the account and one in a hundred times you get that agent that just doesn't read the note and he does the change and then you're screwed yeah yeah this happened to Ryan selcas last week we both surmise that maybe it has to do with his appearance on my show where we criticized XRP but who knows it's not clear but um yeah his phone number was stolen then and then his Twitter was hacked but he got everything back as far as I understand but you're right that you know they impersonated him and they probably tried a bunch of times but it was somebody in like a foreign country that went into a store so yeah we've seen yeah people showing up with fake IDs to stores as well it's not just calling online well alright well on that sort of depressing note it's been great having you on this show where can people get in touch with you or learn more about Kraken thanks for having me you can follow me on twitter at just pow SPO W and then go to cracking calm or blog cracking calm for more information about the company great
