different than a lot of other places we want to be focusing actually kind of more away from the crypto native investors into a more masonry investor we're going to be trying to take advantage of things like layer twos and account abstraction and embedded wallets to make the experience really really seamless and we want to bring that that more kind of normal mainstream investor have them barely even realize they're doing everything fully on chain into self-custodial manner but get access to this deal that they can't get anywhere else and so then I think that is that's a good way to bring more people in because again it's not just anything they can just go on their Fidelity account and get it's something that's that's unique to what we're doing and also in terms of investors you know if we can take Capital directly from investors anywhere in the world there's all sorts of you know payment processor fees that don't have to take place on chain and then you know eventually we can get all these other benefits of interoperability and transparency and stuff that you know Robert's been talking about
