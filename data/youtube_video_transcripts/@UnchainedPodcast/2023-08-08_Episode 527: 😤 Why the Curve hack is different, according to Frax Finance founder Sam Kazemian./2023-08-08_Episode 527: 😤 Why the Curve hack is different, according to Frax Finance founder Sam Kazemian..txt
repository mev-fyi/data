the main thing here is that we've never seen at least I haven't seen and I've been in kind of the ethereum web 3 space for a really long time a major compiler level bug which means that the code was written correctly uh it was just not compiled correctly that is different than 99 of uh issues that you might see where value gets stolen whether it's anything right whether it's for example a bridge hack right where like the the actual solidity code you know didn't check something properly like the person writing it forgot to check something or like the classical stuff um you know like the Ronin Bridge hack right where the the keys from some employee or something you know that was running the bridge were compromised from some phishing attack or something like that or they got access to their servers that validated transactions or whatever this was much more different I think this is just a different class of vulnerability and in the different situations
