Ricardo thank you very much for having me Laura you have an incredibly fascinating background it's one of my favorite backstories in all of crypto tell us what you were doing before you got into Bitcoin and how you got into it um you know now that you're putting me on the spot I feel like I should change it up and be like I was a super year and then I quit my life of crime fighting to like get into Bitcoin well if you did that I would just tell everybody that that's not true so what why don't you stick with the real story cole slaw stick with a stick with the truth in and the absence of an interesting lie no I I've been a developer for most of my life eventually worked my way up to quite a senior position at a listed company in South Africa and I did not enjoy that for a number of reasons I felt that corporate just was a good fit for me and the way we treated employees and and the way we didn't value them really had an effect on me so after a couple years of that my quit and started an import/export business with my wife my girlfriend at the time and that ended up becoming quite successful I wrote all of the back-end systems for that which I think contributed at least I hope it contributed to its success and along the way we took on a bunch of stuff we took an event she took on a general manager to manage operations and I found myself in a position where I was largely non operational and that freed me up to do other things and I discovered Bitcoin and this was early 2011 I read an article on Slashdot that was about a Google engineer who had was he was either writing or I had finished writing a library for Bitcoin and I was like well if a Google engineer thinks it's interesting maybe it is interesting and I sort of went down the rabbit hole started with mining Bitcoin which i think is a journey that a lot of people take they sort of look at mining and they go wow this is a way to earn free money which it isn't but your brain tells you that and went from that to ready poking holes in Bitcoin because I I felt that it's claims as to security and robustness were not entirely valid and so I spent a lot of time proving it to myself and writing you know sort of theorizing about civil attacks and even writing tools to try and attack the network and through the process I learned a lot about nakamoto consensus under to lock a blot about the robustness of proof of work and eventually led this led to me getting really interested in the ecosystem the mining ecosystem and as well as the burgeoning ecosystem as a whole and eventually I started a bunch of things along the way some of some of them are still going some of them were crazy ideas that crashed and burned and you know did a lot of experimentation with like you know ways for to enable people to earn Bitcoin and eventually in 2014 discovered Manero just before it was launched when it was pre announced and got involved with manera from day one well so there's a piece in there that I feel like you left out which is what I find so funny and interesting but wasn't at least a piece of the business that you ran with your wife one of it was bikinis and the other was gel nail polish nice yeah good memory so I was working from memory although although those were such good details that yeah I probably did remember them so yeah so we in the with the import-export business our main main product lines our two biggest product lines with gel based nail polish systems and bikinis and I I would often joke with people that like I know more about nail polish gel base nail polish in particular then I think like most men on the planet and like with the bikinis as well you know like I took a I took a sincere interest in bikini design which I think a lot of men would and it is kind of weird having your wife walk in and you looking at pictures of girls in bikinis and she's like what are you doing but that's not a design that we have and you're like yes this is a design that we want does she looks at and she's like oh you know this design is terrible and you're like I thought you know having a debate about the kini design that's not a conversation that most couples have so it was it was interesting yeah and I mean I feel like even if that were a conversation that most couples would have like you wouldn't expect that then also they would be the same couple that would be talking about you know cryptography and privacy and digital currency so yeah that is a piece of your story that I love as you mentioned you did not found Manero which I think a lot of people think of you as a founder but obviously as you just mentioned that's not true so tell tell us how you came to be the lead maintainer for Manero sure so manure was started by a guy called thankful for today obviously not his real name and in case anyone was wondering and thankful for today at the beginning was fine the first few weeks he was like a benevolent dictator everything was great and after like a relatively short period of time I mean I'm talking like 3-4 weeks he just started being odd and not listening to the community so the community we'd say like oh we think that such-and-such should happen and he'd sort of put his foot down and be like no we're not doing it that way and it culminated in a in a decision where he wanted Manero to be merged mind with another coin called by coin which was like a giant scam and the community was like no we don't want to be merged mind with a giant scam and he was like well tough but that's what's gonna happen and with the massive community outcry amongst all 25 members of the community at the time it was it was kind of like you know it was do or die time and myself and six others decided to fork the software and to have a parallel implementation that would not you know if he decided to go and make manera emerge mind the parallel implementation would not have that and you know he to his credit he ran his implementation for a few months for like six months but then eventually gave up and an abandoned it and disappeared and hasn't been seen since late 2014 early 2015 hmm interesting I guess this is a lesson to all crypto creators who don't listen to their communities so many of maneras developers are anonymous how did you decide to make yourself the face of Manero that's a good question I'm I didn't decide to make myself anything uh-huh yes well I mean you know like people know who you are they could recognize you on the street so I you know my interest in manure was primarily at the time and still is ideological I have a belief in privacy as a basic human right and I was interested in this technology that could advance that that could enable people's privacy especially those who were in places and in situations where their privacy was taken away from them and I found it very interesting from that perspective and very empowering and I I I guess part of me felt that a privacy technology like my narrow would struggle to make inroads unless they were at least some people that were not pseudonymous and that was a contributing factor and another part of me just felt that like from an ideological stance like what's the worst that can happen you know if if a government that is anti privacy tries to take you out you just become a martyr so it's not really in their interest to do that that's not to say that everyone that's working on a privacy technology should use their real name but I didn't feel that it was high risk and I did discuss it with my wife beforehand and she agreed with me that that there were risks but they weren't high enough so so as to worry oh that's interesting yeah I mean if you piss off the right state actor or the wrong I guess you could state actors your point of view yeah then you definitely do run a risk but something that I find interesting is you know you talked about how you think privacy is so important but do you think most people view privacy is important because I feel like from what we see in people's behaviors and their reaction to certain big news events like the Edward Snowden revelations or this Facebook Cambridge analytic a data breach and and other things it feels like people don't really care about it do you agree with that and if so how do you make them care about it yeah I absolutely agree with that I think that people are largely apathetic which is sad they've sort of they've got this worldview where and it's not their fault but they've been slowly suckered into believing that you can have access to a bunch of services on the internet for free and that that's a good thing and what they don't realize is that they are paying for the services they're just paying for the services with their data with their information sometimes with the intimate information and I don't you know I sort of joke about this that people will gladly give over like all of their photos and all of their personal information as long as they can carry on playing farmville and it it's sad but true that people people are they just do not even realize it and I think like things that kept the camera journal it took a breach and all of the breaches have there there is a growing group of people who understand why privacy is so important but by and large the general internet using populist either doesn't know or doesn't care yeah so this is something yeah I feel I am aware of because as a journalist I've written about how dangerous it is if your data gets out there and in the wrong hands but yeah I don't know how to make people care about it because I literally just a few weeks ago was on this panel and one of the other panelists said I don't care about privacy people can have my data and I was like oh my god like you do not know what you're talking about but anyway when other thing I want to ask about is obviously maneras main distinguishing feature is the fact that it offers privacy but a lot of people have been talking about the potential for Bitcoin to adopt privacy and their interest in Bitcoin adopting privacy so that happens then what would the use case be for Minero that's a good question so I guess I have two views on this the first is the view as it pertains to Bitcoin adopting privacy I'm a firm believer in Bitcoin success I think any effort to enhance bitcoins privacy is a sorely needed and B will invariably if done you know if it's if it's added to the the core part of the protocol will definitely be a feature of excellent engineering the problem is there is a significant number of Bitcoin users who believe that adding privacy to Bitcoin will be bad that Bitcoin has only been accepted by regulators because of its transparency and traceability and they might be right it could be that trying to switch it up and make Bitcoin or in arms but coins privacy is bad and you know from regulatory perspective and regulators are just gonna use that as a reason to stomp on Bitcoin now successfully or unsuccessfully doesn't really matter they would still be an annoyance and maybe even a hindrance to most people on the flip side of things you know let's assume that despite all of this Bitcoin does add privacy and when I say add privacy I mean they add privacy in a manner where it is like it's it's mandatory you know we're maybe not initially maybe like sacred it grows over time but the idea is that eventually within a couple of years every transaction will be private and we'll have this extremely high level of privacy such that Bitcoin is fungible and whilst technically you might still be able to make non fungible transactions they will be you know they will be frowned upon they'll be the the odd one out if that is the case and if this does happen I believe that maneras existence is still interesting and important for two reasons the first is that Manero has gone places and will go places that the cannot go right now due to the lack of privacy and so menorah will have made inroads already in places like Venezuela and in countries with oppressive regimes and at that point where Bitcoin has added privacy it will not necessarily be an easy switch over for the people that are in that ecosystem the second thing is manera presents a in many ways presents almost like a back-up plan for Bitcoin so mineiro isn't based on bitcoins code which means that it has its own bugs its own flaws its own issues it has a different different types of cryptography it has a different a different elliptic curve which is relevant to the cryptography that's in use and I think that that's important as a technical hedge against critical failures in bitcoins design decisions or in its cryptography choices that's not to say that that Bitcoin couldn't change or adjust or or you know modify any of those but that in the interim whilst they are deploying such a fix they would at least be something that people could flee to as a store of value before being able to switch back later on to continue this kind of like comparison that I want to make with some of the other options out there z cash makes privacy optional so that only certain of the Z cash transactions are private why is Manero private by default is it important for every transaction to be private yes so the trick with privacy is you want to be lost in the crowd now if you're a bunch of people getting out of a bus and they're policemen standing there and they're looking for the guy with the orange hats and people get out of the bus but they're only 10 of them getting out of the bus then it doesn't matter even if everyone's wearing an orange hat you can just erased all 10 of them and and then figure out which of the orange hat bull is the culprit but now if the bus doors open and tens of thousands of people pour out and they're all wearing different colored hats now it suddenly becomes impossible it's not a task that anyone can can practically approach so maneras biggest advantage is in the size of its anonymity set and so that means that whilst in certain aspects Meniere's privacy might be weaker than c caches the fact that there are so many more users and and there is a bigger groundswell of support means that the anonymity set is significant significantly larger it also doesn't mean that you can't have transactions that are non private with manera so you can for example reveal the details of a particular transaction in order to prove that you send money to somebody and you can do that by revealing the details of their transaction just to a third party so like to an auditor you could also reveal those details publicly if somebody called into question publicly on the end on Twitter whether you made a certain payment you could cryptographically prove that you did without compromising the rest of your privacy manera also has something called a view key that lets you reveal details about your entire wallet and again this is something that you might reveal to an auditor to the taxman but you wouldn't you you don't want to necessarily reveal it publicly unless perhaps you're a charity and the view key allows you to do that so there is default privacy mandatory privacy but it is opt-out so if you need to opt out of it you can do so at any time publicly or to a third party with no impact on anyone else or on you and without putting your your wallet at risk for you know somebody being able to spend the funds yeah this is interesting I like how you also described how it could be or at least the view key could enable monaro to still I guess not be frowned upon by the government if you're kind of enabling others like the taxman as you said or an auditor to look at transactions so let's actually at this point dive into the technology a little bit why don't we talk about all the ways in which Manero is private like the different types of data that are private and Monero what are they sure so my narrow focuses on four different aspects of privacy and the first one is being able to protect the person who's sending the money so being able to hide where the transaction is coming from and if there's something it does it does this using something called ring signatures now I mentioned this first because this is the only aspect of maneras privacy that that we would generally consider week as respects to privacy because the way it does this is by choosing every transaction chooses a number of all transactions on the blockchain and then that transaction appears to come from one of those that group of transactions that ring of transactions but you can't figure out which one it is ostensibly the issue of course is people typically receive money and spend it quite quickly and so the act of choosing those decoy transactions can sometimes reveal which of them is the is the real transaction that's being spent where the money's coming from over time we've improved the way these are selected the manera Research Lab in particular has spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about ways to improve the app word selection algorithm and we're at a point now where it is I think reasonably it's probably as good as we're gonna get it matches people spending patterns reasonably well transactions look pretty uniform or the output selection looks pretty uniform at any rate and there's not much more we can do to improve that there is to come a time where we will want to replace that with something else that truly obfuscates Trudy hides where a transaction is coming from so that's better one and just yes to have you explain a little bit further so when you say it's fairly easy to pick out which of the transactions is the actual one and not the decoy is that because it's generally the most recent yes so this was a particularly bad problem early on in Meniere's history where the are the transactions were picked uniformly across the blockchain and it was almost always the recent one no one was spending money from like you know six months ago or a year ago so that that was an extremely naive decision on the part of Meniere's creators that was relatively could he changed and and through a series of relatively rapid improvements over a few years we've eventually gotten to a point where the awkward selection algorithm now includes a number of recent up recent transactions so it's not as clear-cut as oh just pick the most recent one it is significantly harder now to perform any sort of tracing on Munira but an article I read about this said so before it was about 90% of the time that they could figure out which transaction was the real one and then the article this was in wire and I'll link to it in the show notes it said that now it's about forty five percent of the time they can figure out which one it is is that still the case this article is you know not super recent so I was wondering what it is now sure so the white article specifically focuses on transactions that were pre ring CTS or ring CT is another technology I'll talk about in a bit that created uniformity of amounts where before you had to mix with denominations that were the same as yours and it was a nightmare and would often really a lot more information than anything else so by removing that and by this uniformity of amounts then you were able to choose any output and so that drastically changed things at this point in time it's anyone's guess there's no published research on on modern Manero and on how traceable a the transaction graph is that said even the the stuff that the wide article the period of time at the white article is focusing on the ninety percent is not an absolute it's guesswork so they're saying we we can guess the correct output and ninety percent of transactions because there is a recent one but that obviously ignores the fact that you have plausible deniability if someone had to somehow trace back and say oh this came from an exchange and leads to you and there's you know that the possibility is one and ten you can say well it's not me go ask the other nine people and and that's sort of where the trail ends because there's no cryptographic proof that it's you it's merely a guess that it could be you okay all right so yeah let's move to ring CT ring confidential transactions sure so confidential transactions ring CT is basically a way to hide transaction amounts and so this is the second pillar and this is obviously not done through something that involves obfuscated or guesswork or anything like that this is absolute so it uses something called cryptographic commitments and basically what what happens is that commitment represents your amounts without revealing your amount and it is a extremely robust extremely reliable way of doing of doing this commitments are not a new type of cryptography they've been around for decades and this is an extremely strong aspect of an areas privacy it absolutely hides amounts there is no no way to try and attack that it is it's it's like your amount is encrypt and no one can decrypt that mr. have the decryption key and this is obviously enabled for all manera transactions and has been for several years and that means that at the very least monaro would obscure the amount that you're transacting even if everything else had to fall apart I think in this regard this is maybe where it's most similar to Z cash am i right and thinking that um well Z cash also does all of these but it also focuses on the first three pillars that mineral manera focuses on and it it does so in you know it like like in terms of obscuring where transactions are going to in terms of obscuring the transaction amount it has the same strength I guess is probably the best way to describe it when it comes to how private it is the only aspect where it is much stronger is in the hiding that transaction graph so where transactions are coming from but it's important to note that with manera where these three pillars are applied to every transaction with Z cache that only applied to a special type of transaction where you're going from a Z address to a Z address otherwise Z caches is traceable as Bitcoin yeah I recently did a listener questions episode so for people who missed that I did note that only 13% of transactions are shielded and that less than 1% are shielded to shield at transactions so yes it's as I told Zucco in my interview with him I I thought it it sounded like a Sudoku puzzle um but anyway we're gonna keep discussing how Manero works Plus talk about Ricardo's new project re but first I'd like to take a quick break for our fabulous sponsors a startup that completed an ICO and looking to leverage aetherium for working capital a miner looking to buy more rigs

laundering tools help keep your crypto business safe and trusted learn more at siphysicians.org most before we get there the third thing the third pillar that we haven't touched on is hiding where transaction is going to and that mineiro does using something called stealth addresses in particular it uses dual key stealth addresses and this is again a very strong form of privacy there is no way for you to look a destination for an output on the manera blockchain and be able to somehow determine what the actual manera address was that was getting paid so this is an extremely strong part of nourish privacy and it means that no one can link your manila address to transactions for botching whereas obviously with Bitcoin if someone has your Bitcoin address they can go and look it up on the blockchain and see all the transactions that have occurred and and in this case again you know I mean this is this is similar to would see cash is the address paying as the address you can't see what that see addresses okay and then the fourth the fourth pillar so the fourth pillar that you were alluding to earlier is obscuring the IP address that of transaction originates from now this is this is something that is largely overblown because actually figuring out the IP address that a transaction originates from is a very difficult task it requires that you run thousands or even tens of thousands of nodes on the network and that they're all recording the exact time when they first saw a transaction and then through the process of deduction you'll be able to figure out that this is where the transaction originated from because this node sought from that IP address first it's an extremely expensive attack to compute to carry out and it's you know I mean it I can only imagine that it is potentially worthwhile to carry out against Bitcoin right now but it's also easily defeated because as an example I can use something called push TX which a lot of block explorers support and I can go visit that block Explorer on the web I can take my raw transaction that from my Bitcoin wallet and I can plug it into the the push T X dialog box and hit send and then the originating IP addresses that block Explorer not my computer so this attack is not only expensive and difficult to carry out but it's also largely useless because it is trivially mitigated by anyone with half a brain cell and it doesn't require any expensive tools or any fancy technology to mitigate it you can mitigate it without even using tor so it's it's really it's totally overblown at the same time we obviously realized that there is a very small risk that an attacker could carry out such a such an attack if they genuinely wanted to figure out way some future malaria transaction originated from and so the malaria community has been working on various technologies we are very interested in dandelion which is a technology that is hopefully coming to Bitcoin to try and reduce this risk we're also interested in tor we're adding support to Manero native support to Manero for tall so that you can use the Tor network without to broadcast your transactions without needing to download a whole separate thing and then we have the Capri project which is adding i2p supports to monaro ITP is a network hidden services network that is similar to tall it's also quite old that's been around for many years and the biggest issue with ITP is that the routing software is written in Java which is obviously an additional dependency that we don't want people to have to run and so coffee is a project that is rewriting the ITP Rueter in C++ specifically for general use but also specifically to add ITP support to mirror at some point and when do you think that will be completed that's a good question so um tall native tall support is coming pretty soon there's a Manero developer contributor lee Claggett who has started work on that in earnest and i expect that he'll probably have that buttoned up in the next couple of months cover e had its alpha release recently the alpha release happened in August I think it was when we were at DEFCON and it's probably got like I don't know I'd imagine another six to twelve months before it reaches any sort of stability and we can look at integrating that natively as well it's manera so how can users of the system be sure that there isn't double spending or counterfeiting going on so the same way that that is prevented with with Bitcoin this validation rules in place to ensure that a transaction can only be mined once and that an opportunity be spent once and so for every output when it gets spent it produces something called a key image and that key image is unique to the output that's being spent and it is it can be validated as as definitely being part of the Ring signature and it can also be validated as being unique you you know you can you check all blockchain to make sure that doesn't existed before and that's a that's all part of the malaria software and it's all done automatically to ensure that there aren't double spins and when I'm looking at a manera block Explorer what exactly what info does it show me and what information doesn't not show me good questions so when you're looking at a manera block is Flora you can see the structure of the data you can see that there are blocks each block has a block header that contains various pieces of information about the block each transaction has a transaction header that contains some basic information about the transaction such as the transaction ID and there are inputs in the transit in the transaction and most block explorers in fact all of them really let you see the ring signature on each input and you can see that a number of members in the ring signature and you can see which old transaction that links back to on the output side as well you can see the destination that is being paid which like I said before is like an encrypted version of your human error address such that each one at each time is unique and even if there's the same monaro address is paid multiple times in a transaction that destination will always look different with that's the whole South addressing thing so you will see the destinations you will not be able to see amounts a block Explorer can show you the range proofs if they're interesting the range proofs are these things that let us confirm that the amounts are positive that they are greater than zero so that we can go or the total number of the total commitment outputs less the total commitment inputs balances out and so we know that no Neumann arrow is being created in a in a transaction otherwise you could use negative amounts to create magical madera out of the name you have also talked about adding member Wimble which i guess it's now also being called grin from Manero but I'm not sure if I fully understand what this is because grin now is this good is gonna be its own blockchain with its own cryptocurrency so how would you do this when and also why would you do it when you already have so many privacy features that's a good question so number one well as the technology has multiple implementations grin is one of them there's another one called beam like a beam of light and I really do some others that are asked are interested in all that people are interested in writing admin error were interested in mumble mumble not as a base layer but as a side chain because whilst it has weaker privacy than Manero it has much stronger scalability significantly better scalability so a side chain a mobile moral side chain would be advantageous because people could go i need maximum privacy and maximum privacy and a maximum privacy okay i now am do my daily spending so i can take a bit of a hits on privacy but I need that scalability I need faster transactions need to take up less space on the blockchain for buying groceries and so that's really the idea and this is kind of a nice segue because there's another memorable implementation that is a that is being written and that is Atari so tari Labs is writing a mumble mumble sidechain form an error may merge my inside chain which will allow people to do this and actually before we move to tari I know that you guys also recently added something called bulletproof that make Manero more scalable so what are those and how do they work and how is that different from nimble Wimble sure so those range proofs that I spoke about earlier that prove that a commitment in a transaction is above 0 is a positive number those range proofs are pretty big physically like in terms of the amount of space that takes up on disk and the amount of space it takes when broadcasting the transaction over the internet but they're essential they're an essential part of the transaction and so bullet proofs is a range proof that is more compact than the ones that we were using and so it just allowed us to reduce malaria transaction size by about 80% because bullet proofs was such a sorry range proofs were such a significantly large part of manera transactions so bullet proofs have given us much smaller transactions but that's all it's really done from a scalability perspective it hasn't significantly changed Munira scalability properties at all and then actually one last question before we talk about sorry I did want to ask a little bit more about the view key you mentioned two of the ways that that might be useful was for auditing or for tax purposes what are some of the other reasons why the view key is important or ways in which it could be used sure so one of the things that I that I often talk about with you keys is charities so charity can claim that they received a hundred Manero in a year and meanwhile they actually received 150 in their skimming 50 of top but if they are forced to publish the view key then there's no way for them to lie about that so it's an important it could play an important role of transparency and and when wouldn't normally associate transparency with molera but you know there's a there's a way that manera can be both private and transparent at the same time similarly it could be used you alluded to this earlier it could be used by a government that says oh you know for manera transactions above a certain value that you were drawing from an exchange we need your view key so that we can you know make sure that you aren't that you know that you're not doing anything nefarious or whatever that it's definitely going to your wallet and you're not withdrawing it to a wallet under somebody else's control where they might use it for nefarious reasons or money laundering or whatever yeah or to make sure that your pinger taxes yeah absolutely you know is the amount of money you've claimed to have earned in a year the actual amount of money that you earned if you're being paid in naira right yeah which is kind of interesting because I feel like everybody like I when I was kind of doing some research before this episode I did see people literally asking on places like hora how to use to evade taxes or things like that but anyway so let's let's actually no talk about tari what what is Tory sure so Tory is a decentralized or whatnot is Tory will be a decentralized assets protocol when it is completed we hope it will be anyway if it ends up being something else if it ends up being a giraffe then we obviously haven't done a very good job of building it but to a making a decentralized as this protocol yes you know Tory the giraffe then we've done well and and we've learned a lot about genetic engineering along the way yeah so I guess the best way to think of Tory is as like it's kind of like counterparty so in some ways we view it as like the spiritual sister to counterparty so make us explain what that is for people yeah I don't know yeah sure so counterparty is built on top of Bitcoin and it enables the creation the transfer and the modification of assets so digital assets are things like in-game assets so you know you can have a game a crypto kitties where you have like like digital collectibles in that game obviously digital collectables on their own can be an asset class so maybe somebody creates a set of trading cards and now you can represent them in a on this decentralized permissionless platform similarly things like loyalty points tickets in-game currencies security tokens ICO tokens utility tokens DRM tokens these are all things that are are natively digital assets a digital asset is not when somebody has a physical thing and they try represents it on some sort of chain so it is a digital asset is not something like oh I'm gonna take a piece of property and cut it up into a thousand pieces and represent that on chain and then everyone can own a piece of my property because no useful earn the property everyone owns a piece of an entity that owns the property maybe but useful earn the property the same goes for people who are going on we're gonna decentralize gold ownership by representing the ownership of gold bars on chain know the person who physically has the gold bars in their safe they're the ones who are in the gold bars everyone else are suckers who bought a token that they think might represent that so that's just an that's just it's a think it's important to clarify because people often think of assets as like a property is an asset or you know there's liquid assets and this movable and immovable assets and they've got all these ideas on what an asset is but when we talk about digital assets we mean things that are natively digital or things that can be represented in a natively digital way without the need for a physical component or where the physical component is merely a representation of the digital thing not the other way around so that's that's what tari is all will be or could be so there there are other protocols that are doing something similar crypto canoes I guess it's an obvious example where you have these natively digital assets so how how does Tori differentiate itself from some of the other ones that and you know in the IC o---- craze there were I know a few ICO is that were tackling things like ticket sales so how are you guys different sure so so we're tari is very different is that tori is a is is in this case a like a base layer protocol so it's not just slapping something on top of ethereum and hoping that aetherium is gonna solve all their scalability issues it's not you know doing anything like very narrowly focused technology we were only focused on loyalty points and this is loyalty chain or whatever this is a general-purpose decentralized assets vertical and so that means that it can be used for all of these different types of natively digital assets and it is designed to be fast and it's designed to be scalable and it's designed to really speak to the needs of the digital asset issuer because we're a a cryptocurrency is not issued by a single shouldn't be issued by a single centralized party a digital asset is normally issued by a single centralized party and yet at the same time is advantages to having it decentralized thereafter as an example in this decentralized world you can have an asset issuer that issues that say loyalty points so emirates emirates issues loyalty points and they give me loyalty points because i fly a bunch and I fly with Emirates but I don't really care about my loyalty points there are gigantic waste of money and so I go hmm what I'm gonna do is use my loyalty points for something else so Emirates will let me by I don't know massage or a room at a hotel neither of which is very exciting but what if what if I could sell those loyalty points to somebody else either for money or trade those loyalty points for something else like oh the latest skins for fortnight and now I'm able to put those loyalty points to work in a way that I could never do if I was within emirates world garden at the same time Amrit cystal the issue so you know there's this whole act from Tory's perspective at any rate the protocol needs to be built in such a way that it is advantageous and for the issuer to use the target vertical as opposed to just using a database interesting yeah I really like this idea I hope someday we can do this because I would love to take some assets that I have that I don't particularly care for and trade them for something that I really do want I love that idea so how does tari relate to Manero so tari is merge mind with Manero so what that means is that we inherit my Narrows security model and you know I mean I'm sure you've you've seen a lot of the the the hoo-ha that some of the media have made about Bitcoin is terrible for the environment and you know it's look at all of the trees that it's burning with all of its terrible mining and so one of the things that you get when you inherit maneras security model is you're not ad to that burden so manera already has an a strong stable proof of work Network and there's no reason to spin up an entire another one fitori we're able to just bolt on top of Manero a security model and inherits all of its good security properties without needing to go and recruit - of iron interesting I like that idea I guess because that also means that in the early days of Atari then it will you know be be pretty secure as opposed to needing to to just rely on whoever wants to join in in the early days so I actually want to ask you a little bit more about Manero we have alluded to Manero being used on the dark web or by criminals in a few different ways in the podcast and you've also talked about ways in which it could be used where somebody could maintain their privacy but then you know governments could still be sure that what you're doing is is okay however the fact is right now that I think monaro is at least one of the cryptocurrencies of choice if not the cryptocurrency of choice on the dark web so how do you feel about the fact that something that you are working on and championing could be used to fund crimes that you find reprehensible that's a good question so I guess there's two things the the first thing is when I was in Panama recently I was at the Panama blockchain embassy and I got to meet a lot of people from Venezuela and when I look at the impact that cryptocurrencies like the coin and manera have on the Venezuelan people and and how important a privacy enhancing cryptocurrency like manera might end up being if the Venezuelan government starts to clamp down I am reminded of the good that Manero does but the second thing is Manero is just a tool manera is a tool the same way a kitchen knife is a tool and I can't imagine that a kitchen knife designer who designs an amazing incredibly sharp kitchen knife and produces them in droves lies awake at night worrying about all the murders that are occurring with his kitchen knives it's a tool you know when when a terrorist takes a car and drives into a crowd of people the car manufacturer doesn't release a statement about how sorry they are that they put seatbelts in the car you know it's it's it's just a tool that can be used for good it can be used for bad as a person who works on the tool you want that tool to be as good as it possibly can not to enhance things for people who use it for nefarious reasons but to protect the people who are relying on it because it might mean the difference between life or death for them and those are the people that I constantly think about so I take your point in a lot of ways you know I do agree that I mean I literally the other day I accidentally cut myself with a box cutter which we know that was the tool of choice in 9/11 however I think right now and there's probably no way to know this but I think right now the balance of Manero transactions is more heavily weighted toward dark web activity dark net activity and also it was reported that North Korea was doing things to obtain more Manero North Korea is essentially this huge prison that masquerades as a country like there-there gulags have been compared to the Holocaust so you know I mean while there isn't any way to know exactly for sure how much of mineiro is being used for good versus bad it does seem a lot of the time that Manero is being associated with that activity so even when you think about just the balance of things between good and bad does that make you pause I I guess the the thing is like that what is this I mean is one thing to consider and that is what can I do to stop it you know I mean like like let's approach this from a from the perspective of a of a developer or of a software engineer if I go okay I don't want people to use my tool for bad then there are various thing that steps that I can take from a technical perspective I can build in a process where anyone who is making a transaction above a certain value that transaction is rejected and it has to go through me and I'm the decision maker about whether this person should transact or not and all that really does is it just moves things from a system of law and a system of government and governance to a system of Ricardo's wool which is not ideal and and in the absence of being able to solve this technologically which we will never be able to do because there's no way for a decentralized permissionless system to go into your brain and figure out whether you're doing something that's inherently evil there's really nothing that we can do except make the system permissionless and whilst it whilst the I don't know if this is true you know I mean I let's assume that the balance of manera transsexual the bulk of madero transactions are used by people who are doing the various things I would ask to two questions of you the first is nefarious from whose perspective because nefarious from my perspective might be different to nefarious from your perspective somebody buying cannabis in order to extract CBD oil to treat their cancer in a country where that is illegal might not be something that I find morally reprehensible but somebody living in that country might find it incredibly morally reprehensible somebody from a couple of generations back might find it incredibly morally reprehensible so it becomes it becomes very borderline because I'm sure that there are some things that manera has been used for which we can all agree on outrightly bad there are try to evil but i think for the most part there are lots of things that are either nefarious or evil or not evil but nefarious or reprehensible but only from the perspective of some people not from the perspective of other people and the reason I say this is because I've I got into a big debate with someone the other day he was like taxation is theft and taxation is evil and so from their perspective anyone using manure to to evade taxes is good and now it becomes a little bit like you know like we had used to have done the taxation thing and and how do you judge someone using manure to evade taxes how do you judge someone using manure to evade taxes in China versus someone using manure to evade taxes in the USA it's it is the this is such a it is such a difficult thing to wrap your head around and you know this this idea of morality and relative morality that it is it's better not to even think about it and rather to just consider the fact that Bitcoin in its infancy definitely had more illegal transactions more nefarious transactions then then ones that were used positively but it outgrew that and I am positive that manera will do so there's no way to make this a good transition but I didn't want my last question to you to be why the name fluffy pony yeah it's like on the note of tax evasion well no no my last question was about the gulags in North Korea that's really yes yeah ready so you know like you know why why don't have a proper North Korean name maybe he's not a very North Korean man so so yeah it was given to me many many years ago by two girls that I worked with in one of my first jobs and it was initially it was a big joke and ha but when you know you whenever is using it every day then it eventually just sticks and I carried on using it after that job and hi there was a period of time where I tried to shed it and it did not work and I mean she had just realized I'm stuck with it yeah yeah I would say that you've embraced it but why did they nickname you fluffy pony well because one of them was called fluffy puppy and the other one was called fluffy bunny and so they then I needed a fluffy nickname I guess okay well so I know that you're critical of ICO is but I always I always feel like when I hear that I always imagined also vital X unicorn on t-shirts so in that mind and and now you've got your shoot what is it called magical crypto friends you know we caught we got a fluffy pony and we got a well panda and we've got a lion chicken I mean you can't get away from the farmyard animals I need to come up with something I like one of my my writing mascot basically is a goat so I need to think of a good adjective with goat and that will be me I'll let listeners know with what I've decided on later well this has been a great conversation where can people learn more about you and Minero and tari they can learn more about me on Twitter I'm fluffy pony on Twitter tari is a tari comm ta RI and Manero is that get Mineiro dork like mo in Euro perfect well thank you for coming on Unchained thank you
