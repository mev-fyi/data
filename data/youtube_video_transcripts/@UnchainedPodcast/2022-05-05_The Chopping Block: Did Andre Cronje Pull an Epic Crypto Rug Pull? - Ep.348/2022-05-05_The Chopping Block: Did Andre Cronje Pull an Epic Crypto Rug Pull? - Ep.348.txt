hey everybody welcome to the chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we've got tom the d5 maven and master of memes next up we've got robert crypto connoisseur and captain of compound next we have tarun the gigabrain and grand pub gauntlet and then we have c myself the head hype man at dragonfly of course we today have a special guest joining us the the great and illustrious andre cronier who's coming out of his early retirement to uh grace us with his presence and give us his perspectives hey andre good to have you yeah thanks for that intro i i i think nowadays it's it's more scam dre or rock dre or or rug villain or i i hear those more often than than anything positive so when when you do the little label for the show maybe crypto villain maybe that's a good one to go for i'd be okay with crypto villains scam dre is uh interesting attempt at a nickname i i haven't heard that but yeah crypto twitter can be a bit bit like like recess you know it's it's it's a little brutal but real quick before i start off the show just want to say all four of us i guess five of us in some sense are early stage investors in crypto but i want to copy that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice so andre how how's retirement are you retired it isn't so i retirement not that fortunate or lucky yet at this point in time it's just a different vertical d5 just wasn't for me anymore that's that's that's really the only shift it's an industry that i think is still going to do well and i think it is still going to evolve well i think being an doxed individual there's just more and more and more risk to participate in traditional d5 systems and for that reason originally the plan was to go completely back to traditional finance where where i had originally started from after about doing that for two to three months i realized that i'm i'm also being a little bit of an idiot because i'm neglecting a lot of knowledge that i've built up being in the space so move that to you know what i've now recently started calling regulated crypto which in itself is also a little bit of a misnomer because you know it's more it's more crypto translation i don't think there's an appropriate terminology for it currently but you know it's there's there's this intersection between blockchain language you know and this is language we speak in you know you you go buy an erc20 on an amm um and then you hold that for speculative value or you go deposit that and then borrow against it in a decentralized lender and like you keep that in a non-custodial wallet where you do custodianship of your private keys and this is stuff we and i'm pretty sure everyone on this podcast really takes for granted the amount of knowledge that you know like we just innately have because we do this stuff on a daily basis and then you know when you go talk outside to traditional finance who who the people are excited about these products you know they want to get involved they wanna they wanna start leveraging it but it's not a language they speak so so big focus for me now is just the translation of that language so you know a it's not a erc20 or a native token it's a crypto one to one etf it's not a custodial solution it's a pci dss compliant custody solution you know it's literally taking that knowledge and then packaging it in a framework or language that the rest of the world understands no i think retirement is still very far away i i i actually don't think retirement is ever on the books i think i'll just keep working till my brain dies and then be happy that tends to happen pretty fast in crypto if you stick around long enough if your brain turns into mush it's a very noble uh task to you know try to work in that translation layer between tradify and crypto but it is also a little bit surprising because you are you know to many people in crypto you're like the king of the degens and i think actually uh robert on a previous show i believe he made some comment about how like the way in which you kind of walked out on your d5 empire i think rubbed many people the wrong way yeah if i remember his his words were a epic rug pool uh an epic if i remember the show correctly so yeah so you're a listener then yeah i know i i i like to stay in touch look there's there's basically two podcasts i follow it's this one and all in uh and that's really the only two i really listen to um i i i don't really think there are a lot others that are consistent bring news on a weekly bi-weekly monthly basis so yeah no big fan big follower robert if you'll allow me i would like to to use you as a counterparty to a theoretical experiment if i may i'm all in awesome okay so two things one who here on this podcast know that i built phantom i do i think we all do yeah yeah we're we we're familiar with your experience with phantom okay okay but but so i'm i'm curious because because a big part of that statement and that kind of leads into the next part i want to get into was that that phantom was was a active investor play on my behalf um and i i'd like to unpack that and the reason i'd actually like to unpack that is is specifically there's a lot of rumors that have caused me some reputational damage in terms of like how i left this industry that like there's there's there's a statement of i made i i think a billion dollars and then use that to exit because now i've made my cash and i lift so two parts that you know is important to me there is is part number one is the sort of how do you fight that and now the the reason for fighting it isn't you know like like i don't consider it an insult that's awesome like respect to anyone that's capable of pulling that off but at the same time like there's there's legal there's financial there's a bunch of risks that occur if the public perception is that and so i wanted if i can to actually use this as an opportunity to address that as well because you know number one the the only evidence i've seen towards that was based on a wrecked article that i think was like redacted and ah not redacted what's the word retracted retracted thank you that's the word i was looking for where they retracted that and there was a wallet that for a long time was thoughtling to me that the foundation came out and said look this is their stuff i've given them a lot of guidance on what they should do there and where they should go and where they should deploy funds being innately in the industry but you know they've publicly admitted it's theirs so like that's that's sort of the number one and then number two is the thought experiment around how that happened right because like yearn wi-fi tokens i didn't keep any for myself like that was all given away i farmed some i'll admit but let's say you know there was i mean there's i've had three opportunities basically let four opportunities really to make money in this industry opportunity number one would have been if i took some kind of a location and phantom never had any of that stuff in my wallets never took any allocation and wasn't part of that foundational vouch for that as well but that's a more difficult one to prove because you know that's all over the place yearn opportunity number two where you know i could have had tokens for myself i gave everything away i could have healed farm i could have healed farm a lot and that potentially could have been part of it so let's say i was the the biggest healed farmer bar none and managed to yield farm i don't know like what what was it at its peak i think at its peak at 40k it was probably around two billion three billion dollars max tvl you know so so in that case like the the distribution from day one like top farmers had a max amount there of less than 10 um so so even assuming i was a top farmer you know let's let's let's let's go through the thought experiment and see it's 100 which i don't have close to but let's go through it then number two opportunity was keeper um again everything was released in the pool but i could have been an early buyer i could have brought up a lot as soon as i released it myself by other wallets theoretically speaking its max cap at its highest point was half a bull so like not really a lot of opportunities there but let's say i bought again 25 of 20 of the supply so it gives me another 100 which again not true but still thought experiment last opportunity was solidly which i didn't even participate like since i launched it was meant to be a a completely hands-off immutable primitive i did not participate in any of that stuff so what i'm curious about right is like like on on this podcast there was talk about about me doing active investing and having grown this funds and then being able to escape it and i think that's a large part of a lot of people's disdain for me if i can use that word is you know this this idea that i made a lot of money and then was like okay well screw everyone else i'm now i'm now going to take my toys and go home and like i've been looking for a way how to challenge this because you know it's one of those things where it's almost impossible to prove a negative but i feel like both from a theoretical experiment side it's disproved and from a you know things that people thought were connected to me that other entities have come out and said are connected to them are also proven on that side so you know um i mean i'm open to other suggestions but i'm also keen on hearing any challenges to that robert you know i i don't have any by the way i don't follow like you know addresses or do the accounting i'm just you know seeing what's on you know public channels and public discussion forums so i don't have any special insight here you know one of the things that i think is generally accepted is that you are and this is a good thing you are the driving force behind the adoption of phantom like you know this is kudos right without you phantom i think in a lot of sense would have a fraction a tiny fraction of the user adoption that it has today or that it had today right and so i think there's a you know extremely widespread understanding that you were the you know pretty much the sole driver of all of the value in that ecosystem for a while and you know i think there's an assumption that you know in accordance with that you know you also had a large you know exposure to the projects and activities on phantom now that's an assumption and i think other people on you know the internet have done work to look at addresses and things like that which i have not done but you know there is a widespread understanding that you are the creator of most of the activity there and that's a good thing right that's you know in in some sense you know a fact and then there's an assumption that follows and you know whether that's right or wrong you know the first part i think is certainly true that you are the man behind the ecosystem there in a good way right wouldn't exist without you and that you know many people assume that as that you know occurred that you had exposure you know to that ecosystem the first thing is obviously is that you know nobody on the show knows because we don't sit around trying to figure out who owns what because you know we we have other stuff to do in our lives and to try to speculate on other people's wealth but um the story i'm hearing from you andre is that nope i'm not a billionaire i didn't make a ton of money from all these things that are quote unquote rug pulls obviously you made some money because it's pretty hard to have been in crypto during d5 summer and not have made a lot of money but the assumption i think that many people make about you doesn't sound like it's it's a fair one or a correct one that being said i i mean one thing that i would like to understand is what is it that drives you to i mean okay i can understand why you would rage quit in crypto because crypto sucks like cryptos i understand that too i have a lot of sympathy with a lot of what you say and feel topic what is it what is it that continues to drive you in wanting to continue to build now if not in in defy and not in web 3 in the sort of connective layer between the real world and and the crypto world yeah my maid of mine actually recently asked me this and i didn't have an answer for him it took me like two to three days actually trying to like think through that and and and like trying to get to a conclusion and honestly the conclusion unfortunately is i don't know what else i would be doing if i wasn't doing this you know i i wish it was more than that like like like i wish there was some greater bigger thing happening but it's just like the love of the game and it's everything i'm doing today is still going to happen it might just happen a little bit faster if i nudge it along but like it's it's it's looking at it it's an inevitable puzzle you know it's pieces that have to come together for things to make logically sense but yeah you know like like the main reason is i don't know what else but there's also just a part that it's just really cool like the stuff is really fun it's really exciting and like a big driver for me is also learning as well so you know a big reason why i originally got into blockchains because i didn't understand it and a big reason why i'm sort of enjoying the intersection i'm at now is because it's again a bunch of new stuff that i don't understand and i get to learn from there i mean previously you know my my my previous fintech experience that was heavily in the payday loans area so you know that's not really a wow area and it's also a very basic business so like now all of a sudden playing with you know like like i'm learning of etfs i'm learning about bonds i'm learning about a bunch of instruments that i sort of knew existed but i didn't have any intricacy knowledge on there and so like that's also awesome to be learning all of those kinds of things and um you know like it's also an opportunity just to to speak to a lot of entities that otherwise wouldn't have had the opportunity to totally but yeah you know it's it's you you wake up in the morning and it's the thing you want to do like yeah yeah i'm i'm curious to hear more on your thesis on sort of i don't know if you want kind of a regulated defy or a reg fire or something like that because i think this has been something that people have wanted to see or tried in in krypto for a very long time we had like the security token thing we've had like kyc defy and nothing is really stuck nothing's really gotten traction um but i feel like obviously there's this tension where it's like both players those sort of sides want something to work here how do you sort of think about like what is the product what is sort of the approach that you think is going to succeed where these other things haven't really uh taken off so the approach isn't that different i i think the language has changed a little bit but but so first thing search on the approach right like like this is the same conversations that we've been having since 2017 since about i really got into the space the the difference is and i've told this story a lot of times the difference is in 2017 we'd send an email and we wouldn't even get a response in 2018 we'd get a response but it'll be a cursory uh okay we'll see 2019 all of a sudden they would send the email but that's really only to kind of ask questions 2020 all of a sudden you'd get a meeting and you'd actually be talking to the people now you know 2022 where we're at like these teams have budgets and things where they're actively exploring it but like if if you get to the decision makers 51 of them are interested 49 still aren't sold on it you know so so the thing is it's progressively been changing over the years but now the other thing i've also realized is in my conversations with these same entities a year ago two years ago i i was never trying to speak their language i i was drinking the kool-aid 100 and i was expecting them to you know they're gonna come buy ethan phantom and whatever and use that for gas fees and they're going to install their own wallets and use that stuff and like i wasn't trying to help bridge their language and understanding so so where we're at now we're at a point where these guys are interested they want to engage but they have two barriers barrier number one is solvable that's a technological barrier barrier number two is a regulatory barrier but now the approach is let's solve the technological barrier you know let's help them with custody solutions to understand let's help them with funds etfs whatever it is language that they are used to and then use them to help push on the regulatory side can i ask one quick question how do you feel about the yuga labs other side thing given the given that that was kycd5 we if we in some ways it was like the epitome of that and yet it kind of was horrible in a lot of ways and yet you know good and that's the whole idea before before we jump into that question let me let me let me hold that for a second and basically tell the story because i think this is probably one of the biggest news items of the week so jumping straight into it so yuka labs which is the company behind the board api club empire they raised money they basically did a land sale for other side which is their upcoming metaverse project so they sold 55 000 plots of land and they raked in 317 million dollars in proceeds from selling these plots of land which caused enormous amounts of congestion on it there it's the largest congestion we've ever seen in ethereum history gas fees shot up to eight thousand gway and um there were huge amounts of gas wars that were going on in the mempool trying to compete for winning these these uh these these land parcels and there was over 172 million in fees that were spent in trying to compete to get access to these other side land plots and apparently it crashed ether scan that's how bad the the incredible amount of congestion was so uh there's you go labs in the in the aftermath of this insane land sale um yuca labs declared that uh they apologized for breaking ethereum and that they were going to explore launching their own chain which people are now speculating is going to be called ape chain it's very unclear what exactly that means but it pretends to be some kind of axe infinity style uh side chain or something like that is presumably what they're what they're well one one thing to point out is that they had this pre-registration kyc process and then there was this whole secondary market for for kyc addresses and they basically that caused a lot of like weird behavior prior to the sale and then so i guess the reason i bring up this question is the fact that this like whole kyc thing kind of inevitably caused this extra stampede um into this ecosystem where there was just like a restricted number of kyc addresses those things got sold the people who bought those were just more aggressive and and didn't know what what to how to use a blockchain like how do you feel about that andre is like the future of of crypto personally speaking there there will probably be some kind of a mix and i think that lies in the mix but i i think you know you people people should choose which side of the fence they're on like like you're either fully unchained and then you need to abide by those rules you know and and i wrote this in the one thing it's like maritime law like if you want to be a pirate you can be a pirate but there are rules to be a pirate like it might not be written down it might not be enforced but there are still rules that are respected and like it's honor among thieves and like what what a lot of these things do so so other sides kyc to me is the is like sdos why why why did sdos not become sticky right and like a big reason there is if you went through all the energy and you went through all the tape and you got all of your forms and you eventually got your rig a rig d whatever the hell it is why the hell are you gonna launch a token you can go onto the new york stock exchange or whatever there's a lot more liquidity there's a lot more brokers there's a lot more funds that are going to have access to you eventually like if you get big enough nasdaq s p whatever will you know dump into you as well but if if you're a token on chain and you've already gone through all of that effort why the hell are you doing that that's sort of hey we we heard this kyc thing so now we're going to add this kyc thing we don't really know why we need the kyc thing but just in case we're going to add this kyc thing so so like that's kind of throwing the baby out with the bathwater you know where where like you're you're adding mechanisms not for some specific necessity you're i mean why why did they add kyc you know like like under i actually i actually disagree with this and i've been thinking about this a lot lately about the role of kyc in d5 and in on-chain mechanisms so the story usually is that kyc is about compliance kyc is in order to follow laws and you know enforce ofac restrictions and um you know usually it's it's about uh obeying some particular regulator or some set of financial services requirements and of course that's important and there are some there are some applications that are going to do that but i think for the most part what makes d5 defy is that it's global is that it's not under the jurisdiction of any single regulator um and that you sort of push the compliance requirements onto the individual not onto the platform itself right that's the whole idea of crypto is that as an individual you can interact with crypto in a compliant way but crypto itself does not need to be complying crypto is crypto in the same way that the internet you know is not compliant the internet doesn't follow you know uh a particular set of rules like you know internet doesn't follow gdpr but individual people on the internet can decide to follow gdpr which allows you to have it be this like this bazaar where people can take their own view i think the thing that kyc is going to change within crypto is not compliance but rather marketing and by that what i mean is that um the biggest problem in crypto is quote unquote identity which and by identity what really what we mean is we don't know we don't know who is retail we don't know who is community we don't know who is a customer all we know is an address and there are there are a bunch of janky ways we can try to figure out who real people are by saying okay did you participate in governance did have you been around for this long have you touched these many defy apps so there's a lot of stuff on chain of like this you know uh kyf or know your farmer type things that people started to put into place to identify the difference between real users and just people farming airdrops or people faking addresses but every protocol on defy or every protocol you know whether it's nfts or whatever they want to identify who are real people because if you are a real person you are a member of my community you uh are especially if you're retail right if you're a retail user and you're not just like another address of alameda it's very very important that if i'm liquidity mining if i'm giving out incentives if i'm doing airdrops that i want to make sure it's going to real human beings and i suspect that in the future this is going to be the primary thing that kyc gets used for on chain is that it's not that you have to kyc in order to use this protocol but rather that you have to kyc if you want to get a reward and this reward is you know one person one reward and that's going to be the rule and the only way to enforce that i mean we've had like captures and stuff that people have used in the past which is of course extremely gameable you know i used to work in anti-fraud and i can tell you it is very very cheap to hire you know uh not only can this stuff be neural netted you know out of existence but also it's very very cheap to hire people in their world to just do captions for you uh at scale you know it costs you know like a penny so um it is it is the only real way that we know to disaggregate who are real people is with kyc which is why it's done in every single centralized crypto platform in order to figure out who's a real user counterpoint let's look at other side just a few days ago okay they used kyc to conduct this land sale i know people who bought like 50 kyc addresses and bragged about it on twitter right like this was not a successful mapping of one individual one right it was an absolute fail in some cases there's photos of people in chinese internet cafes with like walls of browsers pulled up right yeah i mean to be clear to be clear you can also do that on binance right you could also do that absolutely but there's like extremely clear evidence that at least just the hugest example of this two days ago was an absolute fail for trying to enforce one person one address right like no doubt no doubt look i i completely agree with that right whenever you're thinking about anything that gives you civil resistance it's a question of what is the cost of breaking the civil resistance right like a a passport is the hardest thing it's the most expensive thing that you can use to fake a person now it's not foolproof right uh it's not the uh like there is some cost to any claim of i am a human being by just getting another human being to do it for you you're not going to get around that with any platform whether it's a web 2 company or a web 3 company but i think kyc is like the gold standard of the best you can do i disagree so i mean just taking your example of a passport is the best way of doing this each passport right could have a public address associated with it and like the private key or the seed is somehow mapped to the user like you know well but you said that you're selling addresses right you could sell the address that's in your passport yeah of course and then you'd be [ __ ] out of luck if that's the global standard of everything and then you can never be a person again or whatever like well of course well there are a lot of people who will never be a part you know if you're if you're living in some village in india and you're like hey i have no use for this like here you go that's what people do today people sell passports andre i i actually wonder if like does this mean that your future is really working on identity i think uh there's some people on the youtube chat who are like is that is that kind of like what you're implying like your future kind of the stuff you're most interested in working on is not just like hey fintech tradify bridging between crypto but actually really this identity problem or or are you actually really focused on on this bridging aspect because at some level this identity thing seems more fundamental than kind of the like how do you get nasdaq to care so so so to me there's there's there's two conversations but they're both solved by the same tool so so allow me to qualify you know know your customer definitely as as you've just described makes sense because you want to as as you originally put it it's from a marketing angle you know you you eventually want to know who should i be talking to how to identify them am i talking to them correctly etc etc that's a whole field of science a separate kyc from a compliance perspective is you know what jurisdiction is this person and what role rules do they fall under how do they need to be treated in that given circumstance and and i do think those are two separate topics even though they use the same tool so that being said this this first part that i am doing with a lot of commercial banks and central banks and traditional institutions is not identity focused because they already have this information so so they already have access they have the pipelines they have the processes in place it is not about trying to solve that on chain yet the the reason i add that qualification is because you know now now now you have to take a few further hops and obviously the the further we go into the future the more unlikely but let's let's let's fast forward five years probably being too optimistic but let's fast forward five years and a lot of what transacting is is happening on chain you know this is these are commercial banks who are issuing commodities derivatives these kinds of things on chain they're trading they're investing they're depositing money into compound they're lending from there you know like like like this is a a forward-looking possibility but now once you start having that kind of amount of data because because you know like at that point you have a lot of payment data you have settlement data and you you have sort of probably at least some kind of on-chain indicator of kyc data you'll probably not have the data but you will at least have a commercial bank a recognizes this address as belonging to this person so that already means you can start looking more into okay you know is this is reoccurring payments this is probably a debit order these people are doing you know stuff like that but but now you with that amount of data all of a sudden you know you can start working towards why are fraud and bank system systems kind of [ __ ] as they are currently it's because they're not sharing data they're not really doing mass scale analytics or predictions or ai or any of this kind of stuff on this and and when i say well they are usually doing it by outsourcing that's like sort of the problem right it's like effectively they have to use like the palantirs of the world to like communicate across banks to be like oh like we can identify this user right that is sort of like i agree there's no standard for communication and sort of data formatting but do you think like a blockchain is the ideal way of doing that that's like sort of sort of it's not it's not totally clear that it is sort of the optimum way to do that type of sharing now again there's a difference between blockchain technology which doesn't necessarily mean a public blockchain blockchain technology even in a consortium sense is definitely a better way to transmit data than you know closed loop currently because if nothing else and even if it's privatized you know there's there's more things you can do that and numerai is a great example you know where all of their data is privatized and you know they they still allow that as public data sets for people to play with and build stuff on and you know experiment with and like there's even though they're a little bit more closed source than my personal liking you know there's there's still more fundamental discovery that can happen there than in a completely closed loop system so eventually i hope that a lot of this is in public open data sets because we've we've also seen you know a lot of breakthroughs open iii is a great example right if we if we want to go down that area because that's that's open share data sets that's hey your stuff everyone please work on it versus hey i think it's not the that's the poor it's definitely not an open data it's an op it's an open it's not even open api right like i i can't even go use gpt3 without like or the future large language models yeah well but i mean you you can't join the group you can't join the subscription like like i'm on most of those that's true you can sign up for the sas service which is better than nothing but it's not exactly open in the way that we think about opening not fair fair it's not where we want to get to but you know you get more discovery when you allow more people to work on it that's that's kind of the baseline i think right um sorry completely tangent but i've been playing a lot with that um i i don't know how to pronounce it the the dale 2 dalai 2 d-a-l-l-e-2 that when they opened that up for nft when when that's public access i i think nft pfp projects are are definitely going to become a lot more prolific that is that is for sure it's a big question what something like dolly 2 is going to do to um to the consumption and generation of art um so dolly too for those who don't know this is not crypto but it's still fascinating dolly 2 is a is a a machine learning model that basically from a text description can generate an image and it can also edit images um purely again from a text description so um it can also use whatever there's a lot of stuff i'm obviously not an expert on any of this so i'm going to butcher the explanation but tldr ai and image generation is getting absolutely crazy and dolly 2 can create some amazing there was actually a twitter thread that somebody from openai posted of basically taking other people's twitter descriptions and generating an image out of it and the images were absolutely incredible and um i was like okay whenever this thing is open i want to i definitely want to do that for my own uh twitter profile image from now on it's uh only uh ai generated profile pictures so you can do it for your new nft collection you know you're gonna put a bunch of uh fiverr contractors out of business yes that's true dolly 2 is really bad for fiverr anyway so but okay rewinding a bit to the actual yuga labs other side landsat how does everyone feel about the land sale right it was it was totally crazy it took down you know basically took down ethereum a lot of people are pissed people are claiming all sorts of conspiracy theories that they did it on purpose to try to get a pretense to launch their own chain uh governance within uh apecoin has been kind of a [ __ ] show how do people feel about the other side landfill i think robert's the only real ape here who actually participated in the landfill i was going to say given given robert's last opinion on on the value of ape and everything i i think definitely you should set the precedence i'm probably the one who's the most in the board ape and yuga ecosystem as well as the crypto punk ecosystem i guess i'll take the mantle of nft guy here i mean obviously i think as a community member the landsat was kind of a mess you know i i think a lot of the narrative of the yuga ecosystem the reason why it's worked so well is that a year ago like one year and a few days ago you know if you minted aboard ape for 0.08 f today or as of a week ago you would have had probably over a million dollars of assets because one board ape turned into mutants turned into dogs turned into apecoin turned into all these things and it's been probably the most successful investment for a retail investor of all time period full stop like in any asset it's like buying bitcoin in 2010 right in a lot of ways like 200 turn into a million dollars which is why their community is so ravenous and like so you know ride or die will speak volumes about them forever right highest roi of any asset in crypto the only thing comparable is bitcoin 2010 right so with that being the context of it i mean the narrative for why it works is because it's made a lot of regular people extremely rich crypto punks were inaccessible even a year ago to people board apes were 250 right that's where the strength comes from and in a lot of ways i think this might be the turning point of that in that this hasn't made a lot of people really rich in fact it's you know started to be the first event in the yuga timeline that's been the opposite and by the way other side is more than just you guys yuga and animoka brands and all of these other things but at this point i think the ratio of them creating value to taking value has finally flipped for the first time and i think that's what's i mean the license is kind of incredible right like we should actually describe what the the license basically says you own nothing yeah literally enough okay it's like okay the reason why even one in the first place yes is because they said you own the art right you have commercial rights to the art as well go have fun these are your assets go own them unlike crypto punks which said larval lab zones all the ips screw you you don't own anything you can't even use the image externally like you have a pointer on a smart contract on a blockchain that's it and so even like the assets around this land sale the ip is not the same you know it's becoming more restrictive not less and i think there have been statements potentially by them that they are looking to change this but as it's currently written the the contracting around what you get is terrible in comparison to previous board 8 ecosystem engagements so in a lot of ways i think the failure of this is that they took in a huge amount of value and the participants in this are barely break even in a lot of cases have lost a lot of value there's people who bought board apes for 160th which was like the floor basically right before this event to get land which is worth 10th and now the floor is 115 you know and so in a lot of ways this event was the first destruction of value in the ecosystem and so that that's where i see it as being a failure a lot of other things are failures like there's a lot of criticism that they went with an intentionally inefficient distribution mechanism which the rules changed frequently in the hours leading up to it to create confusion and inefficiencies and all of these things that led to the blockchain having a gas price of about 6 000 g way for hours which for all of us that were experiencing this this is crazy i mean you know i tweeted like hey black thursday 2020 was 200g when we all thought that was off the charts insanity at the time like now you can have a completely normal saturday where crypto's not down by 40 and the blockchain's at six thousand years away for hours right and because they had inefficient contracts in salinity as well there's been criticism there so i i think all around it's been disappointing i think a lot of people were hoping that this would be the next you know increasingly successful event and it hasn't been where will this go i don't know it could be a wild success right but so i mean the big question though robert is um how many kyc addresses did you buy before the uh zero so zero i was like critical of people buying kyc address because guys rules i had one address you know i i did my thing but robert you're so virtuous that's why that's why that's why we love you yeah andre what would you have done if you were buying land what would you what would have been your strategy well i don't think the kyc addresses was the right approach necessarily so because it was so easily civil attacked like we've seen in every project that tries to go with like a sybil based approach it's easily attacked this one was attacked as well like i know people who bought kyc to addresses and they were like by the way when you buy a kyc address someone already has the private key so like these people were like trusting someone not to completely screw them over to be fair this is the entire ecosystem of people who are morons who post their seed phrases like sport apes are people who are proud of being moronically stupid idiots like it truly is it is obscene that like their entire ecosystem the value creation has generally been taking advantage of you know a lack of wherewithal and that's that in itself should be it's also the strength of it which is you had regular people you had regular people who invested like 200 which are now millionaires right and these are regular people these were not the most crypto savvy these are not people you know who have been like crypto ogs like this the reason why this is a problem is that a huge portion of the community was able to access it without really any capital at all and that was magical look i i agree with robert on this i think the the fact that it's really easy to lose your apes is not an indictment of apes holders but rather of crypto itself that like we don't have better and easier best practices and defaults that make it hard for you to do that yeah and by the way like the amount of like sophisticated attacks not just on like regular people but on institutions on sophisticated people i've been scamming crypts oh like i'll admit that like you know i know a lot of extremely sophisticated people who have in some sense lost money somewhere somehow like this is a vicious ecosystem and it's not easy and like i this is where i agree with andre like you know i do think the structure of accessing it will evolve over time because this is not set up for regular people the fact that like you have like private key open systems is incredible because it means like you have like open apis basically to build on top of but like i truly don't think that in 20 years you're gonna have people managing their own private keys because it's so damn risky like there will be intermediary solutions and the fact that you can is what will give the strength but like i don't think people should be managing their own money in wallets that are constantly being attacked like the lazarus group targeting people like that's crazy i do i do think institutionalizing stupidity is not exactly the place i would like hope a society evolves to which is unfortunately i think what we've seen in in a lot of nft land is that tyrone if i can ask you do you think humanity is getting smarter or dumber from your experience over the last 10 years i think the tales of the distribution are are are driving far from the median and mean the the tail the tails are the tails are evolving and the median is shrinking right we're just like getting this like high skew maybe a point in in andre's you know uh column here is um on the topic of the kyc and license for the other side there's actually another term in the license which is it's against the terms to transfer your other side land to a non-kyc address so if anything this is maybe the first successful implementation of kyc defy where we have uh this nice little kyc ecosystem of uh people who can only you know interact with each other wait that's not informed it's not enforced at the contract level no so it's against the terms which means what you sell out on openc you basically violate the terms what but will will openc enforce that or no they work of course not of course not yeah i mean that that's crazy which what what what actually i mean nothing what can they do to you like do they have the ability to just like snatch the land if you end up selling it to someone else is that kyc assuming theoretically they build some huge metaverse one day then you know they they could just not allow your asset in the game sure but that but that still allows it to circulate on secondary markets like let's you could have a dealer in the middle who like takes it can't use it in the game but could go resell it to somebody else right like that i mean that that seems like the value of the coin address that's on the ofact list yeah it's it's similar to dirty and clean bitcoin you have dirty and clean other other side but if it ends you know again it's a difference between dirty and clean like dirty uh non-kyc it should not be dirty like of list means dirty okay like that's like okay it's been in the hands of north korea dirty in a video game is the same right it's like i just block you from ever use because the game is not on chains so there's no way of sure if the game is on chain you can't like actually have it be like the game engine be trustlessly executing then it's it's just like at the end of the day you're still at the whim of the that is absolutely crazy do we think there's gonna be a game i asked this to andre i asked this to all of us do do we actually think a game is going to realistically ship within this is the game you're playing it right this is the game correct correct correct tom is correct an mmorpg playable game okay and speaking of which speaking of which so there was a there was a piece of news i saw on twitter last night that i thought was very perfect timing is that square enix just sold a bunch of game franchises to like another game developer it sold tomb raider deus ex and like a bunch of other franchises and 1100 game developers in one big bundle for guess how much 300 million dollars which is less than what other side made in its nft sales which uh is absolutely absolutely nuts this is olaf square enix's western brand so you know it's just cause it's uncharted like it's a bunch of like really really good titles uh that's right yeah that's right so um crypto man the other thing that's also striking and i think we can we can end on this is just the efficiency loss that hugo labs made because of their auction design which is one of the first things that you feel like anyone encrypted would have told them is like guys don't do a gasoline oh it's not that they even did that they literally were just like actually dutch auctions are dumb we wrote the code i know they they were gonna do it don't talk [ __ ] and they changed their mind they lost 172 million half of their proceeds they lost to miners in gas wars because they changed their auctions they lost to eath holders they lost its holders yeah yeah people burned a lot of credits that's right that's right we gotta get we gotta give let's take the silver lining with you okay we proved that eip1559 worked not only really well in practice it was able to provide an insane amount of rebates like probably the highest discounted you know set of rebates in history like no centralized nd has ever paid out 100 million dollars in rebates to its users in one hour so let's let's let's give that let's give that some credit that that should be your worst book of world records very very well said very well said always always the uh ever the optimist in uh looking at these situations i just think i think that's kind of cool right like that that's pretty that's no it isn't all right you're absolutely right you're right 100 100 percent they're amazing well hugo labs thanks for giving back in an unexpected way the other interesting news of the weekend we're running low on time so we'll just do we'll just take this so solana on the same day as the yuga labs other side nft sales solana had a massive outage so they were out for about seven hours which was almost as long as i think they had a previous outage that was like 17 hours so this is not not quite to that length but it's basically most of the day solano was down and um this outage was like with hugo labs was caused by nft bots so there's a contract called candy machine which is basically the standard spl uh you know standard library contract for minting nfts and essentially you had i think it was on the order of four million transactions per second or something like that uh that were they were being bombarded and of course you know solana doesn't have a mempool it only has a single leader at any given time and so the single leader is just getting absolutely jackhammered by millions of transactions per second of just all these bots trying to mint nfts for super cheap even before the nft minting is available and so that took down solana um as solano was trying to turn back on uh there was a bunch of controversy because one of the validators that was uh you know so solana has certain number of validators they were trying to coordinate in the discord to try to figure out how to turn things back on one of the thought of validators suggested like hey guys in order to turn things back on we gotta you know we can't the moment we turn the validators back on they just get taken down again right by the swarm of nft bot traffic so here's an instruction you can use if you want to no no pressure but here's an instruction you can use within your ip tables to block incoming traffic that is targeting the candy machine contract and when people saw this they were like oh my god censorship and people were freaking out about what this meant for solana and decentralization blah blah blah and so solana is obviously back up and running and the um the candy machine candy machine github uh introduced a change that should now penalize people who are trying to mint before minting is actually available for that particular contract but it's uh it's again been you know a struggle for solana and everybody in the space to handle what's going on with you know nft bots and nft minting so uh reflections on the solana outage i guess andre we'll start with you given that you are the only one of us who has developed an l1 what's your take on the uh the the solana outage this weekend i think it comes down to you know what what would have happened if they had done nothing even even in a decentralized blockchain that has a leader-based system that has one leader elected every 24 hours theoretically like you know the next 24 hours a new leader should have been elected and they should have gone up and it should have continued from there and then the next and the next and the next so like the fact that a remedial action had to be taken it makes me ask how how well will it perform in an adversarial environment and you know like the answer is not that great so so you know and this is where nomenclature starts becoming fuzzy you know is it a distributed system is it a decentralized system is it really a blockchain solution so you know i i think maybe maybe it needs a a different categorization because you know it's it's not for for what it does and for what it accomplishes it it's fine if it went down you know because this is basically a very lengthy round robin server selection load balancer is what it comes down to so so there's a seven hour latency between leader election is what you're saying that that i would probably make less um i i think that's maybe a little bit bad on the redundancy side but it's going to keep happening unless they start looking at traditional blocking mechanisms you know this this this is a standard ip throttling connectivity so so those same rules that apply in sort of traditional hosting solutions because because i i think they're closer to hosting solution than they are a a you know an ethereum or a bitcoin yeah one one thing i would add um you know a funny a funny little observation and and you know i think is that there there's some people who i have uh observed the last couple years who are who were uh big solana shells who worked at either like alameda or ftx who like left and became analysts and they they've been like posting all these types of things of the following form which is is a mempool in a user space construction of a blockchain like the kernel space is things managed by consensus and you know is the mempool kind of this thing where like users have to manage it themselves and in some sense that distinction actually is a security risk for for blockchains that like people have did not consider especially when they were like chilling like low latency all the time but i do think there's a really good group of people in the solana world who are actually working on fee markets and and sort of mental stuff in in a way that i think is actually quite interesting in that they're because of how many failures i've had they actually have to make a very different mental design again maybe i'm as you pointed out eternally optimistic but i i do actually feel like there's there's some kind of cool design that you have to do for a mempool that's like trying to be low latency but also not put its inject itself into consensus so i at the end of the day yes the system is kind of not really a blockchain in any sort of sense i mean the fact that there's no fees does kind of reflect the fact that there's no ability to respond to demand but it does kind of open up an interesting design space given that you've already bootstrapped yourself to like this much capital is sitting in this thing uh and then selected market like after the yugo labs thing uh the other side nft sales like the tally came out on twitter and basically said like look yes the contracts had been more optimized but like this is what's going to happen when there's a lot of demand and not much supply like this is how blockchains are supposed to work whereas in solana it's exact to your point to when it's the it's the exact opposite it's like oh well salon is supposed to be the nasdaq of crypto and the fact that it can't support 4 million transactions per second is a personal failing that we need to resolve by you know switching over to quick or you know just kind of throwing more juice at it and figuring out how to make sure this time it's not just that it's not just that the the the this idea that like the mempool is a user space construction versus a kernel space so this is sort of like just if you think about like operating system design right like there's certain things that are controlled by the operating system certain things are controlled by the user and their applications right and the hard part is where do you draw the line where do you say like this has to be part of the operating system versus this has to be part of like the user's managed state and i think people did not especially like from a theoretical lens like two years ago when none of these chains existed like live people did not appreciate that that distinction is quite important and the interesting thing about what's happening in solana is that now there's multiple teams multiple people working on memple constructions because it's not part of consensus so there can be multiple mempool implementations that different people agree on and that space is going to be extremely interesting because they still want to like achieve this like latency bound while also kind of aggregating their sort of like mev properties uh into this mempool and so so we're gonna see like i think a bunch of innovation from this failure i mean going back to the um metaplex candy machine fee thing so they basically added this like fixed fee for transactions that meet certain heuristics which are likely to be bought transactions like basically if you try to mint before the minting is open or you you do a couple different things and when they charge you a fixed fee which is so far charged like 400 something sold i think it may be a little bit like a country that doesn't have an army and instead and it says like totally federated and basically every state is required to like implement their own sort of like you know uh security practices and bot mitigation techniques and so it's like and if you don't then like maybe you know validators basically banned transactions that are trying to hit you and so it's like you know maybe there's i i agree like this is very janky but like it seems like you know the meta flex things are sort of a step towards every application basically being responsible for their own uh you know throughput management by implementing some sort of fee market which is you know interesting at the very least it seems clearly so optimal right like that seems like exactly the kind of thing that should be happening at the yeah i mean that's why countries have consensus also the same thing where there's multiple mempools right there's not actually like a single consolidated like a belief in like a single temple first of all there's like there's like the different like obviously flashbacks there's obviously eden uh but there's also this like these like sort of off-chain dark pools that then get aggregated and submit like you know matcha keeper dial whatever all and like at some level they're also doing the same thing it's just that in eth they made that a first class problem they're like this is actually an important part of our network in solana they just kind of like said it wasn't a problem because the goal is to acquire users and capital faster as opposed to like solving this fee market thing and now they're kind of going backwards and and so the question is is there like this like too big to die type of thing in crypto of like apecoin and solano where like at some scale no matter what you're actually going to just you have enough resources to invest in in fixing that thing right i mean look if if solana does create a feed market i think that will solve a lot of these problems like obviously and to tom's point until they do in applications are incentivized to sort of create their own free markets which is awful but can you know in principle can be done or at least you can emulate some of the properties of a fee market by saying hey you know if demand is going really high or if you're doing things that are out of step we're going to charge you more for that the most obvious striking thing is that like solana is the only major blockchain that has had this kind of downtime right like seven hours of downtime that's like no oracles no trading no nfts like you know anybody who is doing anything that's remotely mission critical was frozen in time for seven hours until suddenly things restarted and then you know like the arbitrage happened the trading happened the oracles got back to work like anybody who's on solana now has to like you can't be like oh well they had that one event but now like it's gonna be cool like almost certainly this will happen again at some point and you will have at least multi-hour downtime within solana and that's it's just such a different mental model for what it means to build on a blockchain than for pretty much any other chain that's in existence today even the new emerging layer ones like i've not seen any new emerging layer one have this kind of downtime and stability issues that solana's had and i'll just posit that the biggest risk of downtime is not on the ability to trade an nft it's not on the ability to do anything with the decks like the biggest risk in my opinion is that of liquidations or time-based systems where if you're offline for six hours a system like compound on solana suffers the most risk because if you just turn it on after eight hours you might have positions that are uncollateralized or underwater that jeopardize other users whereas most things just jeopardize yourself well i can't trade an nft i can't dextrade whatever it's just you right the systems that pool user funds that take on risk related to users or the ones that have the most exposure to an outage and are most difficult to build on a system that could face knowledge not not to show but uh there is a there is a october 2021 paper that may have me as an author that does cover this that covers what exactly the like if you have a loss of liveness like what the like expected kind of trade-offs between order book exchanges and and a ms are and these kind of things so you can read tarou's paper after this after this call he's going to tweet out the link for everybody i look forward to that yeah i mean look this kind of stuff obviously does happen in tradify as well where like you know you hit some you hit some uh some sort of stop limit like you know trading goes too far you turn off the exchange for a while turn it back on a couple hours um but usually this happens during times of high volatility now in crypto naturally they tend to coincide right so like solana was down i think 10 the day that the uh the outage happened you know ironically it kind of does maybe end up functioning somewhat similarly except that you know the code for these contracts is not designed to like turn off and turn back on and then like reevaluate things um and so maybe that that just will have to be baked into solana at some point because people just know that look we have to expect that like there will be episodes of downtime and liveness loss in which case we need to have some way for the market to effectively recover assuming that like at any given moment we could have just turned back on after six hours of downtime so it's it's it's interesting it's surprising too you know to andre's point earlier that um almost every single instance that we've seen on salon of downtime has been you know call it honest mistakes right it's been sort of a very genuine like hey i wanted to use an nft i wanted to go you know trade on this platform or whatever we haven't seen anything like the shanghai attacks happen to solana which is which is really surprising um i i sort of expect it to be more adverse like you know somebody takes out a giant short and then decides to like try to go break solana or just spam it with enormous uh massive ddos energy but that hasn't happened it's been all just like you know nft knuckleheads going out and trying to mint stuff before the contracts are open and that takes down salada for the historians i do think a long time ago in the bitcoin network people did try to like sell bitcoin and ddos in and like do all these things i think there was more layer one gamesmanship like a decade ago that did occur there have been instances where you know other l1 you know were 51 attacks let's say like there have been trading activities around layer ones and like attacking them that has occurred in the history of crypto like many times kyc exchange improved kyc exchanges has i think reduced the ability of someone to get away with such an attack yes but a decade ago i think this stuff was more prevalent yeah exactly i feel like before 2017 it was way easier to do this it got much harder from the actual taking the other side shorting type of thing fair enough well let's hope we didn't give anybody any ideas andre it was an absolute pleasure having you on the show i'm glad you were able to exonerate yourself uh we have i say at least for me personally i don't know about robert i know robert has his own feelings i've always i've always liked andre i think you know there's you know some people you know don't like him on twitter but you know you're fine with me andre nothing but love i really appreciate that guys like like for real but but i'm pretty sure i would have said something that dug a new hole for me and i'll find out about that tomorrow when people go out of their way to try and let me know how i [ __ ] up this time oh don't worry we're gonna we're gonna start it we're gonna go on immediately you're gonna go on twitter and start start talking all the all the horrible stuff that you did on the show anyway all about content yeah well it's been great to have you thanks for thanks for gracing us with your present sir and for everybody else until next time thanks for tuning in see everybody
