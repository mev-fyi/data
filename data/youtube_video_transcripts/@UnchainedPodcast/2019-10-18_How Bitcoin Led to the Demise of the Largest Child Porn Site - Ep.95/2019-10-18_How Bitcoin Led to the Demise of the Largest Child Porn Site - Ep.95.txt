find one place where you can trade plan and discuss crypto strategy get started with eToro and the world's number one social trading platform today's guest is jonathan levin co-founder and chief strategy officer of gene alysus welcome Jonathan thanks Laura on Wednesday you tweeted today is my proudest day at chain alysus what news did you share that day so on Wednesday this week the Department of Justice unsealed a indictment against the founder and operator of a website called welcome to video which was one of the largest child pornography websites in the world and they unsealed in diamonds against a lot of the operators or users of the platform and a civil forfeiture against the proceeds from that activity that they're going to then redistribute to victims and really they thanked us for our role in that case of helping them follow the money and make those arrests and also actually rescued 23 children yeah and it's just so people understand the scope of this investigation welcome to video as Jonathan said was the largest ever child porn site and they arrested 337 site users across 38 countries so it's you know quite a big operation dealing with a lot of jurisdictions so Jonathan tell us more about welcome to video and how it worked so welcome to video was a site that was actually operating on tour which is an onion browser which anonymizes both the users and the site's IP addresses so it's similar to like anonymous browsing and the site offered a way for users to actually purchase access to videos that were hosted by the site so that they could download them onto their computers and watch them it also provided a way for people who wanted to contribute child abuse material videos onto the website so that they could they could monetize that content and when you say that a part of that was using bitcoins so how was Bitcoin used on the site so Bitcoin was the only method of payment on the website so an individual could go and actually top-up and buy credits to download videos on welcome to video and would also get distributed payment from the website in Bitcoin if they are creators or uploaders of that content and so at the time of I guess at the time that they arrested the administrator welcome video had at that time set up 1.3 mil Bitcoin addresses so why were there so many because I don't think there were that many users or maybe I'm wrong so that is really the upper bound on the amount of users on the website because the the site would generate Bitcoin addresses for users when they when they logged into the site and and therefore some of those Bitcoin addresses may never have been used and so that's really an upper bound but you can see that the site was being used frequently and that the wallet was very active and so how did the government use the chain Ellis's tools in their investigation so what chain alysus provides is investigation software for law enforcement to really be able to leverage blockchain analysis and follow the money in these investigations and you know it's really through the cooperation between the international law enforcement agencies that are all able to look at the same transactions and say where the proceeds of these funds were being cashed out or where people who were using the site was sourcing their bitcoins from and law enforcement can identify those places and serve legal process in each of the jurisdictions to get information about really who are the customers who are the people behind those transactions and so they were able to identify both the administrator of the site and a lot of the users of that and they they unsealed the claims or arrests and prosecution of many of the users of the site in the in the press release and so as far as I understand and correct me if I'm wrong is the reason that Bitcoin transactions had to be used to determine the various users because the website was using tor and so law enforcement didn't have the normal breadcrumbs available to determine who these people were that we're using the site I think that the accurate well one one interpretation could be that I think in general it is the case though that law enforcement uses whatever tools at their disposal to be able to go after this type of crime and more and more and you see government agencies getting better at leveraging blockchain analysis to be able to actually use that as a starting point in investigations and build bigger cases as a result of it and the IRS Criminal Investigations Division from the United States doesn't investigate this type of crime that goes after the money laundering aspects of any form of criminal activity and all has sort of done for the head of IRS Criminal Investigations said the experts in can follow the money and they they will leverage this type of analysis to be able to prosecute all types of crimes so whether there are breadcrumbs being left through cyber investigations you know cryptocurrency has also become a tool in the toolkit of law enforcement so this is a good example where blockchain analysis really did did help build out this investigation and your blog post had a an interesting graphic where there were kind of like these circles representing different entities and then lines between them so what did that show exactly so what it showed was that welcome to video its own its own wallet and really what chain alysus does is it enables us to look at the Bitcoin transactions that have happened in the past and associate which transactions have been done by the same entity and in this in this case an entity refers to a service like welcome to video or like btc-e or alphabet marker or Bitcoin another Bitcoin fogger mixing service for example and what it does is we're able to say you know which transactions has that service been doing and we are able to attribute those services to real world names so is able to say here are all of the transactions that welcome to video has been involved in and then our Gras or our graphic shows is what are the services that have directly interacted with welcome to video so many of those exchanges that you see on that on that graphic actually helped law enforcement identify the actual users of their of their platform that were sending or receiving money to welcome to video and so yeah in a typical workflow a law enforcement agent would be able to identify what are the transactions of interest that they should ask and exchange about so then where the exchange has the KYC information about those users and law enforcement can then request that information and continue to build on their investigation all right we're gonna discuss more about these Bitcoin exchanges first in a moment but first a quick word from the sponsors

million others and download the crypto comm app today back to my conversation with jonathan Leben so in this case it sounds like you know you're working with the exchanges to identify these users but i imagine you need to gather some evidence before you go to them so how do you do that part and then when you go to them what do you ask for so just to make it clear the people who go to the exchanges are the law enforcement agents who are have the authorities to actually make formal legal requests to these exchanges and ask them for information about specific transactions and so really what's happening is that law enforcement are using chain alice's as the map that helps them find so they know that this activity in the welcome to video wallah is associated with illicit activity related to child pornography they then find direct financial transactions that come from that activity to a cryptocurrency exchange or from a crypto currency exchange and are able with probable cause to request information from those exchanges about who are the users that are responsible for the transactions to or from though services - welcome to video I see yeah and I guess it's one of those things where probably the exchanges wouldn't have known that those transactions were involving this site until after law enforcement came to them um one thing that I was also curious or am I wrong about that actually what we provide as chain alysus is the ability for exchanges to proactively identify this type of activity and report it to law enforcement so we support the internet watch foundation which is a non-profit based out of the UK that monitors for child abuse material online and they provide us with cryptocurrency addresses that they know to be associated with the distribution of child abuse material and we provide that information to exchanges when they might be receiving or sending money to those wallets and they can then proactively report that activity to law enforcement as suspicious activity which can then spark the beginning of these types of investigations oh great oh well okay so I guess for crypto exchanges that are listening this might might be a good thing one thing that I was curious about is based on the screenshots that they released and you know I don't I don't know if I if I'm reading the screen shot correctly but it appears to be a screenshot from 2015 welcome to video recommended specific Bitcoin exchanges and it listed them I'm just gonna name them all here btc-e okay coin bitstamp OB BTC china bit hum cex coinbase it bit bit finex blockchain is there anything to read into this list of recommended sites because to my mind is sort of mixes ones that are known for compliance as well as ones that are not known for compliance yeah I think there's not much to read into it we we see that typically these sites are recommending things that are convenient for people and they might be serving different parts of the customer base so you know as was sort of shown in the press release there were users all over the world and arrests were made in 38 different countries and so the quality administrator was in South Korea clearly this is marketing at people who you know criminals who are interested in this material all over the world yeah and actually so to this point about how some of these exchanges were pretty compliant ones and some of them were known for not being compliant is that why in one of the unsealed documents they list these different accounts at specific exchanges they don't identify the exchanges and they kind of walk through some of the transactions that had to do with welcome video but they only actually named three exchanges or not not named but they they just call them exchanged one two and three but then I just wondered does that mean that like users were not able to use the other exchanges because of some of these controls that you were talking about I think that in general when it comes to these types of documents they're not necessarily complete so there might be more exchanges that the word used and were relevant so I don't mean there's too much to read into the fact that only three exchanges were kind of labeled in the in the indictment all right well you also read that the site received nearly three hundred and fifty three thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin across thousands of individual transactions but I it wasn't clear is that at today's prices so those were prices at the time of transaction so we looked at that as the the Bitcoin we like when particularly when we're investigating or looking when people are looking at transactions to buy materials I think it's good to look at it in dollar pricing because a lot of the time goods can be priced and sort of fiat currency rather than in India Bitcoin okay okay honestly I'm gonna say that makes me feel better that it's based on prices at the time because obviously if there had been payments made in 2015 that were worth $200 or per Bitcoin and then now that's worth a thousand then obviously you would expect this number to be a lot bigger but hopefully this means that they didn't profit too much from from this activity so one thing I was wondering about is also would your investigation have been possible if the site had used Manero or Z cash or a different privacy coin or even the Lightning Network so I think that the the type of graphic that we put up that shows these direct transactions to to the site and really the identification of all of the addresses that the belonging to the site do depend on there being a level of transparency into the underlying blockchain concern yes any form of privacy enhancing technology would have made this investigation more difficult okay well we'll see how these types of investigations go in the future that as these privacy technologies become more advanced Arya's chain Ellis is working on any tools that would enable you to do investigations on crimes that used any of these privacy technologies yes so we announced recently that we will be supporting Z cash and - on their transparent transactions which might have been helpful in this in this particular instance and so we are we are making steps towards help both exchanges and law enforcement managed the risk even in those domains it's still early in the process of how collectively law enforcement and industry can work together to prevent crime in those domains alright one last question which is I did see that Joe Wiesenthal of Bloomberg had tweeted or actually he wrote about this for Bloomberg where he talked about how basically there's two kinds of people who use Bitcoin one is speculators and then the other is these trans actors and he said the trans actors generally want to buy things the law that law enforcement doesn't want them to buy and that made him wonder if like it was if it made sense for Wall Street and other investors to be purchasing Bitcoin if it's if the main use of it really is for illicit transactions do you agree with that so I think that there are many other use cases the vigor between speculation and the the use of cryptocurrency for illicit purposes and you know particularly there are there are also a lot of transactions that exist in that in a much more gray area that is not illegal or you know it doesn't it doesn't actually you know get the attention of law enforcement in the same way that child abuse material does and so I think that the speculation behind cryptocurrency is about a movement of people to create more ways for people to transact globally and that can mean being able to buy you know gray goods it can also mean to be able to transact more efficiently for digital goods that do get sold and bought and it could be to transact in cross-border in ways that weren't actually for possible beforehand so I think that there are the speculation and the investment from Wall Street as around the real value of cryptocurrencies being the expansion of ways that people can transact in general and yes some of those may be for illicit purposes but the investment in the technology to expand those possibilities is definitely something that continues to perk the interests of investors and I think that really it's about and our mission analysis is you know to help continuing to expand the number of ways that people can transact globally and that for us means initially working on making sure that industry and governments can work together to get rid of these types of actors that do actually abuse those new ways to transact great well congratulations again on some fantastic work that is obviously having a really really important and meaningful impact in the world thanks so much Lauren appreciate it thanks for coming on and confirmed all right so don't forget guys next up is the news recap stick around for this week's a news and crypto after this short break will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations cipher trace is working on this vision of the future sign up to stay up to date on the privacy enhanced compliance initiative and receive authoritative crypto AML reports quarterly WWC fruit-trees comm /keep crypto clean hi guys thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap there was a ton of activity in the race to create a global coin from all kinds of actors in this space as a Bloomberg article put it quote when finance ministers and central bankers come to Washington this week the International Monetary Fund has a message for them digital currencies are on your doorstep get involved the FT has a story on where it all went wrong for faceless Libre the story details why some players dropped out plus features a great Libre video explainer by reporter Jemima Kelly at the end but the departure of some members has not stopped Facebook Libre formally signed the Libre Association charter this week making the 21 existing signers the initial members of the Libre Council meanwhile China is racing ahead on its digital currency RBC analysts mark Mahaney and Zachary Schwartzman said in a research note Tuesday quote if US regulators ultimately dismiss Libra and decide not to draft regulation to encourage crypto innovation in the US China's central bank digital currency may be strategically positioned to become the de facto global digital currency in emerging economies largely through a leap a WeChat Union pay and other messaging and payment apps but it does not look like the u.s. is entirely asleep at the wheel a Fed official did say that the central bank is actively debating a digital dollar and former CFTC chair Christopher Giancarlo wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal advocating that the u.s. create a blockchain based digital dollar plus the IRS released a draft of the new ten for a scheduled one which has this question at any time during 2019 did you receive sell send exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency you should definitely check out my past episodes on crypto and taxes so not all forces are pushing forward in this race in the crypto space there are two senators who sent letters to some of the payment companies that had initially signed on to be members of the Libra Association and the letters basically threatened them saying that they would get greater scrutiny over their existing businesses if they stayed in the Libra Association and also that you see filed a restraining order against messaging up telegram for it's not yet launched cryptocurrency avital Garg of electric capital did a great a tldr on the SCC's filing against telegram as he puts it quote the sec went to town on the assertion that telegram actually raised money to benefit telegram messenger telegram controls the ton foundation and the only pealing ton our telegram employees thus it is a common enterprise and profits are driven by efforts of others listeners hopefully you recognize that these last two points are the two are two of the prongs of the Howey test he goes on to say quote some some issues that as you see highlights that other projects will try to avoid in the future a don't have the company and foundation controlled by the same people be don't use funds to finance an existing company see and don't have only company employees committing code next up finance crosses one billion dollars in profit the most popular crypto exchange has its second highest quarterly profit ever larry Cermak of the blog notes that this is despite trading volume being down which indicates that finance is successfully diversifying its revenue next story for those of you looking for more details in the upcoming launch of multi collateral die cyrus Yoon se of maker Dow had a brief tweet storm on this he doesn't give a ton of detail but in particular it looks like governance and security are gonna be big focus areas so it's not just about bringing in different types of collateral next story addresses containing a thousand BTC are growing at a rate not yet not seen since the early years of Bitcoin willy woo posted a fascinating chart showing that the growth in the number of Bitcoin addresses with at least a thousand BTC now matches what it was in the early years of the network as he says quote in the early years gaining a thousand BTC was a matter of being an uber geek knowing how to mine it and some investment in hardware and electricity in 2019 a thousand BTC means an investment of 10 million dollars in my opinion this is Willie's opinion worst likely in a new Renaissance of Bitcoin this one powered by capital influx of high-net-worth investors while the early one was from the tech-savvy who were bootstrapping the network super bullish similarly my crypto noted that the amount of East locked in to defy has hit three million eighth despite all these milestones there are still a number of questions that remain in crypto and Ally Yaya of a 16z wrote up a great distillation of what he says are the 12 questions that really remain to be answered in crypto some examples are when and where decentralisation matters most how many networks will dominate whether it'll just be one or many and where value will be captured I definitely urge you to check out that post and last but not least this week's fun bits is coin jazeera's right up on DEFCON 5 the headline is massive hurricane hits DEFCON 5 as god attempts to rid the world of aetherium community my favorite part of this article is definitely the part where it they referenced how the dinosaurs died quote the only thing preventing God from going biblical on Japan and sending a meteor to scorch the earth was coined as reporter Lee Quinn's hunch controversial article calling aetherium a scam pissing off every bag holder at Def Con this amused God enough to not send us all the way of the dinosaurs
