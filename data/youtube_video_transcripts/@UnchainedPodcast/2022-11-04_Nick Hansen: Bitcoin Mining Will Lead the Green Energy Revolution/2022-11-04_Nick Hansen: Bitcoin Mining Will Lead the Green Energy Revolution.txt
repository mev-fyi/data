I think that Bitcoin mining comes in and makes a really compelling argument as to why it should be used for providing this consistent base load as we continue to progress towards a renewable energy future Our Generation assets become more and more inter intermittent and so there needs to be extra capacity you know to provide uh all of the the energy for all the demand that there is at different times so we also need to uh also also invest in in nuclear energy and we've seen in minors getting co-located with uh with nuclear energy assets as well so lots of reasons why Bitcoin mining will continue to incentivize and lead the green energy Revolution and I think we're just getting started
