i mean it really is just a bad time for for bitcoin right like on one hand the government wants to regulate uh you know from in an esg way um you know this uh the mining stuff and then like ethan's going through this uh merge narrative and then you know on top of that the cox coins are getting released right so like idiosyncratically like normally we like using bitcoin as a beta hedge to crypto space but i think this time around like you know maybe like would have been better or dogecoin would have been better
