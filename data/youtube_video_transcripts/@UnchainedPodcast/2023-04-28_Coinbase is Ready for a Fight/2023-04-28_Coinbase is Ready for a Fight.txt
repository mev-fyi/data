having trouble photographing himself which seems like it should be a good thing however one of the conditions of his bail is that his parents phone is supposed to be able to photograph its users every five minutes players say that his parents are having trouble installing the monitoring software on the phone it's not like there's anyone in that house who's good with technology however if they need someone to convince millions of people that the software is actually capable of doing something it can't do I think that they should have even considered this order until they confirmed that both SBF and his parents can shower in under five minutes the legal workaround right now is that every keystroke on his parents phone gets monitored so basically it's like a regular smartphone last week it was reported that FTX and Taylor Swift were in talks to sell tickets to her concerts as nfts but the Taylor Swift backed out because she thought that they might be on registered Securities her rejection
