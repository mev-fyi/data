crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto earn up to 8.5 percent per year on your bitcoin download the krypto.com app now today's guest is gregory peppin deputy ceo at dell tech bank and trust welcome gregory hi last weekend a medium post by a pseudonymous former bitcoin investor going by the name crypto anonymous made the rounds on crypto twitter and elsewhere it was titled the bit short inside crypto's doomsday machine and it alleged that the stablecoin tether which is supposed to be bagged one-to-one by u.s dollars is a quote highly probable fraud there were a lot of um different strands that crypto anonymous wove together to present his or her hypothesis but the one that most people zoomed in on concerned whether or not tether is fully backed so tether is run by tether limited and tether limited's bank is deltek which is uh where you work and that's a bank based in the bahamas and the part of the piece that people were concerned with was a section where crypto anonymous showed some tables of the foreign liabilities of domestic banks and he or she wrote quote from january 2020 to september 2020 the amount of all foreign currencies had by all the domestic banks in the bahamas increased only by 600 million dollars going from 4.7 billion to 5.3 billion and so the bahamian dollar is pegged to the us dollar 101 so it's the same in u.s dollars then he or she wrote but during the same period total issued tethers increased by almost 5.4 billion going from 4.6 billion to 10 billion so greg can you explain why this discrepancy exists well um i've seen that article actually and i find very interesting that uh there's someone that apparently have time perfectly buying and selling crypto it's actually often the case in this article of so-called expert they usually have time to market like geniuses and then start to claim things that are kind of unbacked especially in that case uh they went to that i think it's the digest of central bank of the bahamas and they became overnight a banker expert which i love that because we always look to recruit but in that case they didn't dig a little bit further about how that report works um first of all they should have known that the bahamas is what they call an offshore jurisdictions so what he means by offshore trading is you have domestic bank and international banks in the domestic bank there is two type of license linked to it you have what they call the authorized dealer license and the authorized agent license deltek do own an authorized agent license which is a license that allowed them to custody bohemian dollars however we don't have what we call an authorized dealer license so when it comes to cash and deposit we cannot hold any bahamian dollars cash and deposit and at the same time because we cannot hold those dollars behind dollars we cannot serve local customers so what we have is we have along with that authorized agent license we have an international bank license or i think it's called restricted license as well so in fact for that report and i'm sorry for that person because i guess he thought he was on to something we are not a domestic bank for the report of deposit and actually if he went and took a little effort to go and dig a little bit about the size of the bahamian market of banking you would have found out that the entire mass of banks have around 200 billion dollars in assets i believe and we are part of that so we are not a domestic bank aside of that authorized agent license but that is an irrelevant business for us and that may be not much must be reported we are an international bank and that is part of the international bank aspect that's why i did answer to some people asking us but you are domestic we say no because we cannot take domestic customer and we cannot hold domestic behavior dollars so that report is actually not relevant and nothing to be seen there and actually so that i can complete okay yeah uh every tether is backed by a reserve their reserve is fully backed in more than uh what is in circulation that i mean we can see it firsthand so i can confirm you that ah okay interesting so then are all the dollars that back tethers pills by delta the the reserves like i said all the tether in circulation they have the reserve matching that and more probably but they are they have the reserve and there is no secret and when you look at the article in the in the reserve like the entire reserve is there they have sufficient uh held by deltek uh held by deltek and probably other institution but to go back to explain a little bit about the uh article because i want to go back to the article because you're right this article went around and created a lot of fun first of all like i said the notion that it's unbacked is incorrect the notion that to able to be able to reference the fact it's unbacked they use that report from central bank of bahamas which actually is incomplete because if they know a little bit how the bahamas bank jurisdiction they would have realized that looking at domestic bank what is inaccurate and then on top of it i believe that aside of the fact that he discovered a tether existed only early 2020 which is kind of weird for someone investing in bitcoin or early 2021 he actually indicated that every time the bitcoin price went up feather printing went up i think there's one thing that surprised me and i've seen that on one of your podcasts where i think it was kind metric people that actually indicated the growth of stablecoin and they mentioned the arbitrage that happened in march 2020 march 202 and that tethers stayed above one dollar i think for two months when the other stablecoin went back to one uh i think that one one element that the person that was there which was a very interesting podcast for cause to mention is that people when they do that kind of arbitrage they don't do the arbitrage directly on the pair tether dollar they do it on the bitcoin usdt bitcoin usd and the reason why again i'm not an expert but based on what i've seen on market flow the reason why the usdt was always a premium is because you had an imbalance of demand and offer between asia and u.s and europe in the btc and since most of the liquidity in asia is done in usdt if you have more seller of btc and usdt the btc price will be below and if you have more buyer btc usd what happens the btc price usd goes up the main currency used in asia being usdt that's why it was the the coin the stable coin that's dead at premium for a long time and if you look into it again this today i believe silvergate announced very impressive earnings congratulations to them and they announced that their uh balance of deposit doubled i think around two 2-3 billion and same for signature which i believe have informed that they have a big growth and that is just reflection that tether you can see the demand in stable coin publicly with tether usd coin etc but this is a shadow of the demand in usd and right now what i've seen me from from the inside and outside you start to see a lot of buying from europe and us using usd based exchange and you see a lot of natural selling coming from asia because a lot of miners are in asia and a lot of historical orders are in asia which is btc usdt and so that's why you see that in balance that's why you see a lot of demand in usdt because for market makers and traders there's a natural arbitrage you can buy btc cheaper in asia because there's more sellers there and you can buy you sell them at a higher price in the us and europe and that's where i'm like nobody realized the simple market force and when people say tether is printed out of thin air basic knowledge of 101 market if you print tether out of scenario they have to buy btc usdt correct if you buy btc usdt what's going to happen that price should shoot up and it should be well above btc usd because you have um let's say unnatural demand going on in despair and it's not the case if you look at the data between coinbase and finance i believe over 70 of the case the price of coinbase was always above the price of binance meaning that the buying was from the us and the arbitrage were taking advantage of it so i just wanted to clarify that because this is not expressed properly in this article because that so-called trading expert didn't look at that aspect and that's where i'm like yeah there's an amendment that elements that seems to indicate that he doesn't have the knowledge of the market action and the same way as they all wanted to know what banking works and i've tried to interact with some of them on internet on twitter but then when i follow what they say outside i realize they don't understand how banking work either they started to ask well why do you wire money through a corresponding map that's how bank works so all of a sudden you have uh overnight experts that have expertise in el area they don't know which i'm okay with it but it creates misunderstanding so i wanted to clarify that because you talk about that article i may as well just indicate everything i saw when i read that article that just proved by itself that it doesn't make any sense okay and just to go back to the banking um so what you're saying is that deltek because you're a smaller bank you um you work primarily through some of the large corresponding banks like city or hsbc or something no no it's not related to that the way banking works is um a european bank to get us dollar need us dollar custodian and corresponding bank a u.s bank that needs euro need a european corresponding bank and european custodian we are based out of the bahamas so our native currency is bahamian dollars because that's the currency where we're licensed so for us to be able to receive or send euro or to receive or send dollars or to custody those we need multiple corresponding bank in europe and us which we do we have multiple of those in both currencies because that's how you pretty much diversify your your uh your counterparties and that is just how banks works if you look in your bank for example if you reach out to your bank in the us and ask for a wire in euro they will tell you to route that wire i mean no they won't they will give you the swift and you will find out if you look at the swift message that the wire was routed through a european-based bank because every euro are held in central bank of europe and every dollars are held at the fed well at the fed and every billion dollars are held in the central bank of bahamas pretty much okay and just quickly before we go to um our ad break so what this has to do with tether it is because since tether uh is backed by us dollars so what do you know how does this relate what you're saying no i mean that's let's put it that way this is one of the other cases where people trying to find issues did not understand how the banking system works so they thought they were onto something by understanding how you can send money to deltek bank and trust when in reality okay so that's how everything started and i explained to those people i said no to send money to a bank you take the swift of the bank and then the swift will give you for those banks where to route it so there's no no thing and that's that's one thing that created us okay so it's not related to tether no it's related to how all right so in a moment we're yeah okay so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about tether and some of the allegations in the article but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per year on your btc download the krypto.com

instantly reserve yours now in the crypto.com app back to my conversation with gregory pepin so can you walk me through the process of how tethers get created at least in terms of the part that concerns deltek sure uh so what happened is uh on our side we see customer that we have clearly the full kyc so we know that are also i believe customer of tether and they just literally uh instruct us or send to us wires and at the same time instruct i believe tether about how much wire tether they want to receive they want to they want to get and we notified them once we have uh been informed by the receipt of the money and that's how a other is issued so one thing i was wondering is in the article as you saw tether at least compared to usdc tends to get issued in these very round number blocks such as 400 million usdt 300 million usdt whereas usdc um gets minted in you know amounts like 9 million 374 13333 which seems like tied to very specific orders so why are all the blocks for tether these huge round numbers so first of all i believe that again this article being very incomplete uh the the big chunk of 400 300 are i think when tether create pre pre-mint or pre-authorized tether so they just create a reserve in their tethered treasury and then what about the size of the orders there is size that can go anywhere within size of your hundred thousand dollars to a few millions tens of millions of or 50 million because again that's what the traders or the otc desk or the funds that buy want so that's their decision of buying and then remember one element that is key there is much more volume in tether trading meaning usd tbtc usdt eth that size of issuance related to tether are naturally bigger from the different customer because of the needs in relation to that because there's more training going on with it but again those sides of order are more dependent to the customer asking for those size but they're not the 400 300 million indicated because those are pre-minted tether i believe in their treasury so that they can reissue them once they can authorize them i believe or release them once there is demand matching that and we can confirm that we have received the wire uh the wire and the fonts in relation to the transaction okay yeah i do see on their transparency page that there are ones that they haven't issued yet but they're um they do keep track of that so that's the way they work that's the way they work operationally that's something that would be up to discuss with them it's probably for a security reason i think you mentioned that in a different podcast uh the team there okay and tether says that it's backed by cash or cash equivalents and you said that you that deltek holds um the dollars in tethers reserve so does deltek also hold the cash equivalents so one thing that is important when it comes to treasury management when you manage that big amount of money them or any other customer you usually do treasury management and so what do we mean what it means by cash equivalent it's assets such as t bills time deposits things like that and obviously that's part of the asset class it's then so yeah that's part of the reserve like they're investing the reserve in treasury management uh and i think they've indicated how they're invested and yep that's what it means by cash and cash equivalent and so it it sounds like you you know what those cash equivalents are um yep i mean i know so we're not involved in the investment but we are a custodian of their cash equivalent yeah and so knowing well based on whatever the knowledge is that you do have of those how do you think that they affect the risk that any crypto investor has when he or she purchases tether they're following i mean again we're not involving their investments but as far as i can tell they're following the regular treasury management you would imagine for managing such reserve nothing nothing beyond what you would expect for treasury management so earlier you very um easily said that deltek is holding the reserves for tether but tether famously hasn't had a true audit of its books why not and does that fact give deltek pause so first of all like i said i said that yeah the uh tether is fully backed by their reserve so but that's not a secret they've been repeating that over and over no i mean but there there definitely was a moment in time when they did lend a huge chunk of their money to bitfinex and that was what led to fair enough but again the question again that's the definition it's a reserve the question is to wonder if the counterparty is insolvent or not which is another debate but it's not for me to discuss but to go back to your initial question um i think it's good to go back to when we started to um work with them or in general when we work with any entity we actually do always an enhanced due diligence especially when it's in relation to that industry digital asset because it's a newly established industry and we didn't really want it to follow any article out there because you know when you're in the bahamas you're used about article painting a very bad picture of yourself even if it's unfair so we started to do an investigation by literally do a deep dive due diligence with them and we were able to apply that very famous rule don't trust verify and we kind of verified and we continue to constantly verify that they are pretty much uh following uh what everybody is expecting them to follow i do agree i do understand that people would like to see an audit and it's up to them to find out if they will do one or not but i do also believe that it was our responsibility to follow the rule of don't trust verify i mean audit is usually very useful but when you see the case of a wire card or the case of an enron audit didn't unveil the fraud that was there and in our case we really did a very enhanced due diligence both in their aml kyc policy because i heard a lot of things around that and we cannot budge for that as a bank we cannot afford taking any risk there and we really didn't enhance you diligence there and we're very pleased with that and the relationship we have with them on that aspect is actually very good and it's good to remember that they are registered fincen so it means that they do report to the same regulators that every other stablecoin report to for kycaml so we've checked that and we are in constant relationship with their compliance team which is pretty big and at the same time we actually always check from time to time to make sure that the reserve in general is properly uh pretty much matching and and we also make sure that there's no crazy things going on as we do with any customer like we don't see any difference for us to treat them or any other customer in terms of due diligence and assessment so that's why we we don't like say we don't trust we verify so amongst the full class of stable coins tether clearly probably falls in what you would call the unregulated camp um you know as opposed to something like usdc which we mentioned earlier and at the you know just in this past year stable coins have become a huge business and as we've also been seeing there's a lot more regulation that's coming to the crypto space and already we have the new york attorney general's office which has been investigating tether and i wondered as we see this regulation grow in crypto how do you think that would affect dell tech in terms of the fact that it's banking the company that issues the biggest unregulated stablecoin uh define unregulated stablecoin and regulatory step on point define mean how do you define one being regulated and the other one being unregulated i'm aware that usdc is registered at the new york financial board i believe which means that it allowed them to do business in new york but is it regulated to the business in france is it regulated to do business in asia there's no regulation there going on so no they are regulated to the business in new york and i think it's the nydfs license which is uh a few others have picked to do that and and so it's important to indicate that for us as a bank what matters is you name a regulator uh foreign uh like i said the regulator related to tether and actually regulate it to paxos and uh and related to usd coin and all of them they're all registered fincen it means that for aml kyc which is what matters the most because if you look at all the comments related like in janet yellen regular recently it's all about it should be a lot about money laundering and terrorism and all those things and in that level they're all regulated the same they are all registered fincen and they all report vincent maybe usdc usdt or paxos they are all regulated under fincen in a sense that they are all registered there and that's something that is that was very important for us because again what is critical and if you look as you said on the environment of regulation related to uh crypto the regulation focus is all about uh money laundering when you talk when you listen to uh yell and janet yellen or when you listen to a miss christine lagarde i believe in europe it's all about money laundering illicit usage of crypto and that's a legitimate concern to always have and always be focused crypto or any other asset class and in that in that aspect they actually are regulated in our fincen they are reporting on their fincen they have a complete investigation risk and and compliance team that we have actually assessed ourselves and that's the same case for usdc and paxos and i believe all the other stable corn out there because that's what you need to do so that's why i was saying defining regulated and unregulated now you are right that usdc and paxos i believe as well can do business in new york because they are regulated under the new york the new york license they had the big license there but the big license only applied to new york it doesn't apply anywhere else and there's other exchanges that actually decided to walk away from new york because they didn't want to apply to the beat license however all of them have a common ground which is money laundering protection or regulation which is fincen and for us that was a critical point so we're not overly concerned about that because we believe that it's a relation of the quality of any uh any cryptocurrency or any digital asset companies compliance program and compliance policy and in the case of tether we've never been really worried about it actually as i said they've been very collaborative and very very good uh on that and are you worried at all about the investigation by the new york attorney general's office we again that investigation concerned them so we're not involved in it so i mean i can't really comment about it we still have a relationship with dan uh right now so we did our due diligence and that's it so we maintain a relationship but that's all i can say so you just have your eye on that and see how it turns out no we have a high on all our customer regardless of that element regarding to them or anything what matters for us is the nature of the relationship we have with any of our customers as long as they continue to fulfill any requirement we're asking them and any requirement that are in line with what the bank role is and the bank role again is to make sure we're not the vehicle of money laundering and other things like that they are doing their job like all the other customers we have at the bank therefore we we have nothing to we don't have an opinion and we should not have an opinion on whatever happens with the ongoing investigation as you said okay and hugo rogers dell tech's chief investment officer said in an end-of-year video end of 2020 video that deltek has a large position in bitcoin he said quote we've maintained a very significant position in the beneficiaries of maximum monetization which includes this large position in bitcoin and he goes on we bought bitcoin for our clients at about 9 300 that worked out very well through 2020 we expect it to work well in 2021 as the printing presses continue to run hot so what was the purchase of the what was the purpose of these bitcoin purchases again that was another route that was really interesting they created a lot of fun a lot of people and a lot of so-called journalists claimed that we bought uh bitcoin for uh tether and i believe tether denied it and rightfully because in our case people need to remember that deltek exists since i think the 50s and we've been established as a well-known private bank we have a lot of customer from asset manager to high net worth people to corporate etc and we have a very competent and well respected investment team and as part of their portfolio allocation for those customers they actually did an allocation in bitcoin on behalf of those customers and that's just an overall strategy and i think it's a it's a pattern that you start to see in many many other investment firms that believe that now crypto and especially bitcoin is a normal asset to hold in a portfolio so it's just an investment decision and again this uh kind of overblue because those so-called experts deducted something that came out of nowhere we try to deny it i've tried to do it myself and it was a waste of my time because they have their own truth and we have ours i guess one of the party have the data the other one don't that's the only difference yeah i said in a recent episode that i think there's an epidemic of this in our society so basically what let me just for people to think if one day tether wants to buy bitcoin do you really think they're going to go to their bank to do that i mean it's it's it doesn't make any sense i mean why would they go to us a bahamian 70 years old bank to purchase bitcoin when they are one of the biggest player in this industry the the thing is they look at every details and we've seen a lot of rumor like apparently tether and iphone x are sure all bitfenix are shareholders of deltek i told them no but yet they still believe it's the case what do you want to do you know what i mean at one point at a time you just let let that happen so and and it was just good to clarify some elements because it's always clear to clarify but at the end you can't convince everyone and if you want to try you're going to waste your time yeah and so but just to uh wrap up that last question so basically your wealth management services was purchasing the bitcoin for private clients exactly in the portfolio management that the client and if you look if people were following deltek for other than flood they would have found out that our cio and the team has been preaching about the massive printing going on with the fed and the ecb and they mentioned that gold and bitcoin was a very interesting play to do and that has been they have been reversing that for many many months and we ended up creating uh because the way they invested in bitcoin is we didn't buy bitcoin straight up in the market we created a structured product that allowed the client to be long bitcoin without having to buy the bitcoin but again nobody listened to that when we explained that but that's what we did we actually allowed them to be exposed to bitcoin without having to worry about the custody by creating a structured product so yeah it's just part of a google strategy and i'm proud to say that our team was advanced because now it seems that it's the new trend and a lot of institution wants to do it or we were good enough to do it before everyone i mean before most that's a that's an honor to them and i upload them for that great all right well thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you for having me don't forget next up is the weekly news recap [Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline blackrock world's largest asset

blackrock funds five and blackrock global allocation fund mentioned illiquidity as a potential risk quote as bitcoin futures are not as heavily traded as other futures given that the bitcoin futures

said he expected the sec would finally approve a bitcoin etf bandman also raises an interesting question whether gensler will seek a mandate from congress for the sec to regulate the spot market for

spend that wasn't wednesday bitmex research tweeted that there was a small double spend of 0.0006 bitcoin which was about 21. however as hasso of darabet explained in a blog post instead of this being the equivalent of someone bouncing a check in bitcoin it was more that a transaction was invalidated but based on the fact that almost an entire day passed between the initial transaction and the first transaction that attempted to replace it it seems unlikely that this was someone trying to cheat a merchant who offers purchases with zero confirmations which was one explanation instead what seems likely is that this spender who hosuh calls alice actually made an additional transaction that assumed her previous transaction with a too low fee had already passed and this time the fee she used was enough to pay for both transactions so they both went through time for fun bits why one million people follow her price calls on tick tock you've probably seen marin altman's tick tock videos in which he uses astrology to make crypto price predictions she correctly called the january 11th down drawdown on bitcoin and in this reuters video she explains that she's quote not an oracle i'm just somebody who studies patterns altman who dollar cost averages her crypto purchases says quote astrology can be thought of like a giant mirror or a symbolic language where certain signifiers of planetary alignments are archetypes and they represent themes in the world like growth or restriction or aggression or peace so when she looks at how the movement of the planets aligns with bitcoin for the next few months she says february and early march are favorable but then there will be a big price correction but then may will be bullish alright well thanks for tuning in to learn more about
