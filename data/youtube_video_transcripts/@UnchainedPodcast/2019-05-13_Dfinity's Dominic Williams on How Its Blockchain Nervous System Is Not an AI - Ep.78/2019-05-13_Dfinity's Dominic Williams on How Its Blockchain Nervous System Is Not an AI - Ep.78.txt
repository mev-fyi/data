o---- this is not legal advice my guest today is dominic williams president and chief scientist of Definity welcome dominic let's start with a simple question what is Definity so infiniti is a project to create a network open public network that will produce something called the internet computer and our ambition is for the internet computer to host the world's next generation of software and data and what does that mean to be a world computer I mean we have computers now that hose software and data sure so um it means a lot of things actually so to begin with it introduces the idea that the internet itself will host software and data as opposed to you know monopolistic cloud hosting providers like Amazon Web Services or Google cloud Microsoft is earth so that's a big change so the idea is that you know rather than building your systems on the back of another company's infrastructure you actually build your systems directly on a public infrastructure on the Internet itself using the internet computer so that's a big change to begin with but the internet computer also brings some new properties as a platform so actually it greatly simplifies the development new software systems this addresses one of the biggest problems with the existing technology stack that it's very very complex and you know if you look at the balance sheet of most most IT systems in use today we which represents the total cost of ownership the vast majority of the cost is actually the human capital involved in developing systems and maintaining an administrator and so we we believe we can greatly reduce that but also of course the internet computer is based on crypto technologies so the internet computer itself is a hacker-proof system you can't hack the internet computer if you write software doesn't have bugs then your software will also be a Caprice so it addresses the need of security it also has a design that ensures that application is running on it always available and never lose their data so answer another big advance i'm systems running on the internet computer are highly intolerable we have mechanisms that enable developers of systems to preserve the privacy of data right that could be anything from private company documents to user data and we enable people to do that in a way that doesn't you know involve them doing anything special having to write cryptography themselves and we also support a new kind of software called the autonomous software that we believe will provide a basis to re-engineer Internet services as we know them today I want to unpack a lot of what you said here you were talking about how this internet computer would provide a lot of services that are now offered by businesses and I know you've talked about something called open decentralized business infrastructures what what is that okay so you know the one hand the internet computer we believe will provide a better way just to build private business infrastructures but we also support a new kind of software that's autonomous and this makes it possible to create systems that don't belong to any individual or company they exist independently and essentially these software systems have an inbuilt governance system which is tokenized that is used to incorporate new updates into the software but effectively you're creating you know you're applying the open-source software development model to a running service okay so sort of open decentralized business infrastructures are one of the applications of this technology so there are many industries that would benefit from sharing a platform yeah commonly talked about application is supply chain optimization as it turns out there are many many applications where you can create a platform that's shared amongst the participants in an industry to deliver efficiencies and new functionality I wonder to ask you also earlier you were saying that Definity can replace some of these human capital processes or functions of businesses one of them that I noticed you mission a block was was R&D how can how can a machine do R&D instead of a human eye I was confused by that oh no no suggesting that the Machine does R&D at all so the with respect to private business systems and thus allowing certain several applications so you've got like private business systems you've got dvis which is really a very corporate application and you have Internet services that we want to reinvent Internet service is anything from like Salesforce through to its aging but with respect to reinventing how people build software systems private software systems Definity if you like strikes the kind of grand bargain okay so the internet computer works by implying advanced cryptography district computing zones virtual machine science all kinds of things right and under the hood of Definity there's a lot more computation going on and there's also a lot more replication of data so with respect to computation as soon as you introduce cryptography you're already going to be doing all this processing and also Definity under the hood is running symmetric replicas and applications right so if you call a function in your application but actually inside the Definity network you know there are multiple instances of your application all running the same function at the same time and if there if it's generating data you know saving the same data to the state and that's how we make sure that applications are always available that don't own this data so as a result of this you know the Definity network will you know cycle for cycle of byte for byte is more CPU or storage in any task okay but you know we think the simplification of the platform is worth it so when you create software and affinity most people I believe will use a new language called ActionScript which has been created by one of our staff engineers who created web assembly wherever web assembly but it's the sort of next generation of the web it's already at all the main web browsers yeah we're gonna talk about that in a bit mm-hmm yeah it's an explorer Chrome Firefox Safari and so on and he was the co-designer that continues to be the Stan's process and he also is an architecture of v8 which is the JavaScript engine inside chrome that also runs a thing called bode which is the most widely used for plant back in platform at the world economy and so you can imagine that you could write this to stretch inside of the web browser you know it runs on the web assembly virtual machine inside the browser and that this actor script would be able to sort of seamlessly call into after script running on the internet computer and the internet computer itself doesn't have any kind of storage API there's no database API there's no file model for file storage and actually everything's just kept in software so the idea is that you know when you're writing the backend of your system you just write the abstract budget and you know you keep your data in data collections in memory and this basically you know represents absolutely colossal the fication when you're developing a new system so today you know when people create systems you know they unless they're you know if you're using you know the software is a service product like Salesforce of course you just connected over the web but if you want to run your own sister will create your own system you know you'll have a database right there needs backing up replicating hot spare and all that kind of stuff y'all have you probably a middleware server with micro services you'll have maybe a memcache server you're gonna have web servers and again its load balancing failover and that's where Definity can replace exactly so you're gonna have business logic that's distributed over that whole system of a multiple component so if you think about it in that that kind of system will be some logic inside that the web server that generates the pages there'll be some logic inside those micro services but we some logic in the database data itself is pretty distributed so on all of these components by the way they'll independently and so is the complex thing to put together and of course it's completely insecure there's no way you can make that secure so what you do is you surround it with a firewall and you hope that the firewall keep everybody away from your insecure system but but sadly you know firewall isn't much good these days and you know I can't afford Qian and put unbanned in a Bitcoin bounty up and you know someone will get me into any company of my choosing if I want you know so follows don't really work that well so you've got a system that it's inherently very difficult to develop and obtain well you know many software engineers will tell you that sometimes they despair of their job because most of their time is not just writing the logic involved in the system and creating a good user creating a great user experience most of their time is involved we're trying to make these different pieces talk to each other and as inherent complexity that's involved in today's IT staff yeah so I wanted to ask you you mentioned your customers who is using Divinity's technology now or who who are your ideal users well I mean affinities you know development I mean there's a test Network I mean people know what's there at the moment it's a complex project so we you know developing multiple technologies Perrineau so for example when you write software runs on webassembly there's a network that performs computations and stores data and there's a test network with some thousands of full nodes running at the moment and you know we pretty clear on what we need to deliver and well you know that fortune 500 companies are using Divinity's technology we're working with several companies that are interested in the technology but I mean know the network's not live yet see it's not possible to you know run a system on it yeah so do you imagine that it's gonna be more enterprise or but like is that your target no I mean so the internet computer is much broader thing so the purpose of the internet computer firstly is just to reinvent the way we create software system and also reinvent the way that they're hosted right so we want the Internet itself to host software own data so that's a big change and the whole world runs on software so you can apply this platform to many different needs so one of the most exciting applications of the internet computer is the reinvention of today's Internet services as open-source businesses okay so I want to get into more details around Definity but before we do that I wanted to ask you about your background what did you do before you start a Definity and how did you come to start it so I'm a serial entrepreneur I've been in a tech industry for a long time my exhaust venture was a computer game mmm owns a massively multiplayer online game it accrues some millions of users and I know they were particularly interested in distributed computing and actually credited or the distributed infrastructure that supported that game and I'd had some prior exposure to crypto yeah back in 1999 night using this library code so plus plus credit by the way died and I'd come across this paper will be money through that so I was kind of interested in the and then in 2013 when Bitcoin went through one of its thematic price rises and my attention was drawn back to it and 339 I switched over to crypto full time then how did you come up with the idea for definitey and started so at the end of 2013 is poking around looking at the internal sort of some of the alt coins that were being created then hoping I could find something they enable me to create a coin for the games industry and I was hoping that you know people could silver some goods in one game for this currency to take into another game and buy new virtual boats and when I was looking at the internals of these coins I sort of saw there are a lot of shortcomings unresolved problems and so in 2014 I created a project called pebble and it was the aim was to create a cryptocurrency that he know was much faster scaled to enormous capacities we wanted to do things like recurring micropayments the idea was that Internet services like Facebook could would turn off advertising exchange for receiving these recurring micro payments so you know I set about trying to solve that problem and initially that I was just touring on traditional 19th or Tauron consensus protocol science and I sort of dug into that and there's a thing called a synchronous need a free presenting photonic consensus protocols and I spent some months additionally just just studying full-time and then eventually began to repurpose them and devise my own and you know by the sort of end of the summer of 2014 and you know I felt that we had pretty good solutions and I teamed up with Bob's here Rumble who's currently chief operating officer of Definity and I as a guide met work at a VC the funded this Pinta game it grew so much and we know he's sort of whoops into raising money for the project and sort of scaling it out at the time I think people were very obsessed with Bitcoin if you sort of proposed alternative centralized network protocols people look to you with great skepticism and the venture community kind of really come to terms with the whole centralization movement at that stage and so you know he's faced a lot of people but probably just educating them very difficult actually raise money so at the end of 2014 we just I just give up on pebble but the beginning of 2015 I devised some new computer science actually found a way of creating random numbers decentralized network for any size in a way that was totally unmanageable on manipulable very very efficient i pretty much unstoppable it's on so once I found this way of doing that it's a technique called fresh I'll relay I realized that well you know I I can actually create a decentralized network that could run much higher speeds anything does today and that could be scaled out and you know I've been kind of close to a theorem project and I realized as well that you know blockchain computers are much more interesting than the cryptocurrency Ledger's okay and you know I pursued that line of thinking I realized that but you know you could create a blockchain computer that is fast implement scalable could host software with fantastic properties in a security availability all these things the connectors that centralized cloud and in an open public cloud computing resource they would also enable people to develop systems that whole new way and the original Ament of energy it was to enable if you like the re-engineering of the internet so that many of the monopolistic Internet services of today could be recreated as open-source what we call open source businesses where the service itself doesn't belong to any company or individual but can update itself and saw a lot of advantages in that and so even if you go back with the wayback machine at the internet archive's just see a early definitive page with a absolutely horrible Definity logo that I created myself it's describing exactly this you know the decentralized cloud and back then you know I used to think about how do you credit a search engine on a decentralized network for example how do you create you know recreate Gmail you know social networks Twitter that that was how it all started and the name of the named affinity of course comes from decentralized infinity mmm I've risen aware of that that's interesting so we're gonna get into more details around some of these technical aspects that you mentioned like threshold relay and we're also going to talk about your governance system the blockchain nervous system but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsors

www.sap.com/learnbi for revolution start earning solar powered money today I'm speaking with Dominic Williams of Definity so let's talk about your consensus mechanism a threshold relay and the decentralized Randleman to speak in in all the other aspects and it described to me how your consensus mechanism differs from the other consensus algorithm well first of all consensus is a difficult branch of computer science and to put it in perspective you know I'm undergraduate level and so on I've got a whole bunch of prizes I've been you know working yeah sort of feel the distributive computing more than twenty years and you know it took me some months of studying to really understand just traditional Byzantium all times that's right so it's I think there's a lot of different protocols out there I think a lot of them skepticism actually but you know the definitive system surprisingly simple we lean on traditional cryptography to make things possible wouldn't be you couldn't do it traditional just really computing techniques so the foundational is known as threshold relay and it works by applying something called unique deterministic threshold signatures to generate a sequence of random numbers but the clever bit is that the sequence of random numbers is completely unmanageable so even if you know you had a network of shooters and they're all controlled by the bad guy right adversary even he couldn't manipulate the sequence of random numbers so that's obviously a valuable property the other great property is that threshold relay works for network of any size so you know we aimed for Definity network to incorporate tens of millions of computers so that's a very important piece and it's super efficient so each successive random number is produced by a broadcast of only 22 kilobytes of data and you can run it extremely quickly if you want to now the marvelous spin about it is through threshold relay we're able to have a network of any size agree upon this sequence of random numbers which is on which is generated in an unstoppable way and is completely unmanageable and without running a consensus protocol so in terms of the difference with Bitcoin Bitcoin also is random but in order to get that randomness you have to waste a lot of we're not waste but you have to use up a lot of electricity is that the difference so proof of work actually performs a number of different products what so the cost of generating a blog is something it provides something called civil resistance it makes it difficult for anniversary to come into the network and achieve 51% of the binding power sort of over you know break the fall balance of the network and take control but but it's also a random number generator right so the idea is that everyone's beaver in a way you know spinning the nonce in that block until the hash which is a number obviously falls beneath a target and because you can you know only find a nonce that brings you're the half of the block beneath the target by brute force you know effectively it's a kind of random number generator you know where your chance of finding a winning nonce is proportional to the amount of computing power you're applying but the penultimate miss around number generator so you know nobody knows who's gonna create the next block and that's very important for a variety of reasons but you you could call it a kind of caveman caveman method producing random numbers is extraordinarily expensive the numbers are produced in something called a press-on distribution so weight just actually I wouldn't ask you something because the Bitcoin mining process has long been credited with giving the Bitcoin network at security so does Definity give up anything in terms of security by using this other method that doesn't require as much computer power or electricity because simply let the investment that you need to make in Bitcoin to do that is I think what people say gives it at security obviously very keen to make the case for proof of word I I personally believe it's not very secure and infinity will be much much more secure I would what makes it secure well I mean I think there's forget the numbers but you know the studies out there to show that you know with an investment of say 100 million dollars you could easily overwhelm you know easily achieve 51% of the hash power of the Bitcoin network right wait just just for the money equipment or including the electricity well that's just in you know once you've got the equipment if you've got you don't have to run the you don't have to run it forever in order to disrupt the network right I mean someone bought the equipment you know got the agreements with the electricity providers and you know turned it on and switched off the Bitcoin network for a day well you know the Bitcoin network is probably toast because you know one of this year's one of the year's piece of any decentralized network wait I'm sorry huh I don't understand how you would turn off the Bitcoin network for a day just by buying mining equipment that doesn't make sense to me well protocol has something called false bounds right so you couldn't continue producing agreement so long as the adversary you know some notional attacker controls less than a sheriff of that work so if you control 51% actually you don't even need that of the hashing power of the Bitcoin network and your anniversary you can turn it off you can break the agreement you know you can break the protocol so the protocol won't produce agreement anymore Oh kind of like wipe out attacks like where you're mining on a different chain and then you wipe out the chain that are that all the non bad actors are on is that what you're talking about spend attack that can be performed if you have 51% that one turns out that you can actually do some attacks with less than that but you know if let's say you've got 51% of the network you can now you could just double spend by continuously building a new longest chain but if you continually fought the tape it wouldn't progress and the system would become unusable okay yeah I mean okay I mean it's different from turning off everybody let's say you have 51% the 49% would still have their mining equipment but you could effectively turn off the network in the sense that it wouldn't be processing transactions anymore okay but so to go back to Definity so I understand that you are able to get the same kind of randomness as proof of work without the expenditure of electricity but then how does the security come in so you know we're using just more advanced computer science so first of all with respect to the sequence of random numbers even if the adversary' controlled a hundred percent of the network they couldn't manipulate that sequence of random numbers it son manipulable by the mathematics involved so that's one example of how yeah we achieve greater security but with respect to but if they are controlling 100 percent of them then once each for each block reward they get that couldn't they you know exclude certain transactions and only include certain ones or you know whatever it might be or no that's another aspect these systems that if the adversary controls that majority can perform censorship but that's just I mean I'm just looking for one particular aspect the generation of random numbers is on the next level so that's a great foundation but with respect to ensuring the adversary doesn't control majority in the network that thing called civil resistance and you know you want to make it as expensive as possible for anniversary to build up that kind of presence in the network he he would have to acquire an enormous amount of divinities so they can if you like in the last presale round the project is two billion dollars and quite possibly the network in production will have even higher token caps so a lot of that will be staked in various ways in the network so you can create a very large capital impediment to the first render and what's more I mean if you were anniversary wanting to attack the Definity network let's say you are some you know James Bond villain you would have to acquire that stake and then use it to break the network but in the process of doing so you would be destroying your own investment yes yeah I mean that this isn't actually that different from Bitcoin because a lot of people say if somebody attacked their network then of course the value of the coin would drop and so the benefit that they would get from attacking the network wouldn't the financial benefit wouldn't be there and it's similar with what's sneaking but actually let's let's talk about the sneaking just just one last piece I mean there's other there's many other differences so I mean it's true the Bitcoin has some nice properties but they're very basic frankly I mean one of the problems is that because of the pooling of my name in in practice you know the network is driven by a relatively small number of participants and by contrast for example word affinity now the network will launch with tens of thousands of individual participants and there isn't you know you don't have this of a handful of points of failure right so if you wanted to have say the you know the software but no critical pieces of software running the network it would be much harder because it's a much more distributed and decentralized network then you see today and that's one of the key features that affinity we were able to combine you know millions of individual participants or some of these participants may be owned by the same entity but nonetheless there are many money or individual nodes of the network all of which were participating and producing blocks so there's a number of different ways what I don't understand is why would you expect that you wouldn't still also end up with mining pools in Definity well because there's no economic advice so energy doesn't work like there's no proof of what so this is first of all you know Bitcoin had etherium work by placing miners into a competition where they try and sold proofs of work if you like and if they're lucky and they sold for current puzzle they get a reward doesn't happen right but what what I'm saying is so with both Bitcoin and etherion with proof of work as far as I understand the reason why people enter mining pools is because the payments that they would receive if they were mining on their own would be spaced out unevenly but if they join a mining pool then the pool will no overtime okay this person has like one percent of all the hash rate obviously nobody I don't know if an individual has that much but but they can say over time we will pay you one percent of the hash rate in an even fashion rather than you know one block reward now and then one six months from now and then one two weeks after that and you know whatever so with two finiti where it's also done randomly then wouldn't the payouts to individual miners be similarly not evenly spaced out and so wouldn't there still be incentive to join a mining pool I mean divinities just generally speaking a much more sophisticated system so it's difficult to draw lessons from a very simple proof of work system and apply them to the definitive network so each node and affinity has an approximately similar hardware specification and each node in the network acts as a replica right for in some shard that stores some number see there's some subset the applications hosted on the internet computer and the protocol has cryptography schemes incorporated into it that enable it to apply sort of service level agreement if you like to each individual node so let's say you were running an affinity node it would look something like a mid to high end server machine it would be required to have a certain amount of storage and a certain amount of processing capacity once that's added to the definitive network the network will fill its storage space where cryptographic junk that's predictable that you have to encrypt in a special way and this enables the network to interrogate you to check that indeed you have performed the role and UV neatly stored this data and economically speaking most efficient way of doing that is with a dedicated machine it's design it's designed in that way so how could you pull it how could you pull that I mean each machine has to exist as a separate economic entity it performs a role and it gets rewarded for providing for performing that role okay you know big coin it's a pretty different thing and so same with aetherium I mean you know everyone's performing the same every node in the network is applying the same transactions to some shared state right because no notion of individual there's no notion of individual nodes that perform some discrete wrong so you know it's let's say if you want to increase your economic presence in the affinity network you have to connect more nodes to the network right so each node has the same role as every other node and you you you know you increase your earnings by installing more nodes all those right because you can't consolidate them where where as you know in Bitcoin or a Syrian people are able to have some hashing hardware and sort of collaborate with other people with hashing hardware in a pool so they get some kind of stream of income with less variants but that's a completely completely different kind of system the halfling has no functional purpose remember what you're doing is just burning as much electricity as you can to try and increase your chances right which has the side benefit of adding security to the network um so let's let's move on to just just a RICO affinity will provide much much better security we don't believe that just you know having a competition to burn electricity which also has hugely a negative impact on the environment provides the best security and there are you know a bunch of you know clear theoretical scientific reasons why that doesn't provide the best security it's just that you know Bitcoin took off it was a mechanism for making early decentralized networks work and you know these tokens got enormous value so all kinds of people around the world sudden you know joining the competition to try and find the next block to get the block reward but you know that doesn't mean that's not scientific evidence or a reason that this design produces the best security for decentralized network it definitely doesn't and it also doesn't produce their performance objective ility and it's very very difficult also just to scan it out and say that you could increase the capacity of those kind of networks you have a system for making protocol upgrades that you call the blockchain nervous system how does that work how does it decide to upgrade the protocol so the blockchain nervous system is actually a much broader system it's what you might describe as an algorithmic governance system and it actually controls all aspects of a network so it can adopt or reject proposals that are submitted to it and those proposals and touch on pretty much anything you can adjust the economic parameter the network it can freeze miss Frances miss current system say for example someone discovered a something terrible like an Isis slave market running on the platform it can help broken systems fix themselves and among other things it can also upgrade the protocol itself and it does that by adopting a proposal to runner installer described by a hash that you know essentially it stores a new version of the full known software on the you know machines back in the protocol that make sense well I actually I have a number of questions about this for you because so one thing that I noticed was when you described it you said that this blogging nervous system could have what you called quote privileged control over token ownership and it could do things like repatriate stolen funds that sounds like centralized control so how does that work so in a sense it's you know decentralized centralized control so they launched a nervous system plays the role of network administrator and in that sense you know it is a central entity that controls the network however you know it's an algorithmic government system that's controlled in a decentralized way the basis of this system are things called neurons that a neurone is a voting unit whose voting power is proportional to the number of definitive locked up inside and these neurons can be configured to follow each other so let's say you wanted to get involved in the governance system for which you get rewarded by the way so every time you on your own votes you receive rewards probably you wouldn't feel qualified to vote on puzzles relating to cryptography so you would configure your neuro to follow other neurons when proposals submitted to the system with cryptography topic so for example you might pick five neurons whose addresses have been published by you know individuals there were sort of experts and filled and her members of the definition so let's say you know you might configure you on your own to follow you know Kimo Hankey initially over had any Yankee manage those kind of people and soon as say there are five of them right so your neurone follows five cryptographers in the community you might configure it so that if three of these other neurons vote to adopt a proposal you're on your own votes to adopt the proposal to if three of those five vote to reject the proposal you're on your own votes to reject the proposal to and if none of those neither of those conditions occur before a timeout then you vote to reject the raposa l-- so you will have states and affinities to create this nero and you can only get those divinities back by dissolving in your own actually the time it takes you to dissolve on your own is configurable and the longer it takes you to dissolve that urine the greater the rewards you receive in relation to the numbered finishes you state each time you vote and the greater the voting power so let's say you want to achieve the maximum possible returns from your affinities you might create a neuron that takes four years to dissolve that will maximize the voting power and the rewards you receive in proportion to the definitive state so you know your objectives and your own holder is for the blockchain nervous system to take decisions that ultimately increase the value of to finish tokens which you know probably as a proxy for network adoption and obviously if you've created a neurone which takes four years to dissolve you know you're very keen that the value of those Definity is locked up within your own increase right and the decisions are adopted that when increase the value of each to finish your token so in a sense the objective of the genome system is just simply to increase the value of two finishes although that's a kind of proxy for adoption but something that I don't understand is you've called the blocking nervous system an AI but when I read how it works it seemed more like delegated proof of stake in what you just described also sounded like delegated proof of stake you've also described the blockchain nervous system as liquid democracy which a lot of people use typically as another term for delegator proof of stake so where does the a I come in I don't understand that well I wouldn't call it an algorithmic governance system first of all but you know it certainly has elements of proof of state although it's nothing to do whatsoever with consensus it's just a governance system and it has elements of you know liquid democracy but there are significant differences right so you know each neurone is an economic entity if you know which wraps and affinities and you know if you're a holder of one of these neurons you can't get them the two finishes inside back without dissolving an out take some time so you're very keen you know the incentive structure set up so you are very keen that this neurone takes votes for proposals that will ultimately increase the value of the network the urines themselves are managed on client devices so you'll configure your phone or your laptop with your own client software so the neurons if you like you know distributed around the edges of the network nobody really knows what the follow relationships are I know sort of Cascades decisions but you know it has some interesting properties with respect to AI in the sense that you know neurons are following other neurons it's not quite like delegated proof of stay for liquid democracy you say hey this person's got my vote I wanted to ask also about how the BNs will learn from market feedback you had given this example in a medium post about how for instance a demagogue neuron might persuade other neuron owners on reddit to follow him and then that could result in a stupid proposal being adopted and you said that then the markets would not be fooled for long and I'm quoting here and react negatively leading people to examine how and if their neurons voted for the proposal the neuron of the demagogue would be removed from follow relationships and over time through such actions the follow relationship she'll tend toward more optimal forms but who would remove the the neuron of the demagogue like you use the passive voice there but who is removing this demagogue neuron well keep its neurone or people will just unfollow it so in the example with cryptography follows let's say that you followed some individual who is a loudmouth on Twitter and you configured your neurone to follow this dude and you know somehow here in the sort of fraud if you like and you got pretty got lots of people to follow him and eventually somehow because lots of people followed him you know he was able to submit a proposal to the blockchain now the system that made some rather dubious technical changes and these these are adopted and because of all the people following in you know the system started using this stuff well you know the consequences could be quite dire and no doubt it would impact the value of Definity tokens right so you know you might look at this and think crikey why enough is minor on following this guy okay but to understand so when you said that the BNs will learn from market feedback it's not really learning right it's just that people are unfollowing that neuron right well I mean if it's an algorithmic government system and it makes proposals as a result of neurons voting and neurons vote for the most part by automatically as a result of their follow relationships so if a proposal is adopted by Blocher nervous system that results in some kind of negative market impact people may look at that you know the follow relationships they've configured it's their neuro and say oh hang on mine your own voted for this Tudor proposal right and voted for this too proposal because I'm following these people or this person I'm gonna reconfigure it to follow someone far more sensible right so it's people learning not the B&S itself right well people people are responding to Marga data effectively and changing the follow relationships between the neurons so that it makes better decisions so in that sense you know in the census now gir government system where where for the most part neurons you know it's completely automatically you know it's kind of learning these former relationships between neurons have been reconfigured so if I'm running a neuron and I have made this error of following the demagogue neuron I don't unfollow it my Noren want unfollow it by itself now you yourself reconfigure on a relationship you know that makes affinity great again dude who's you know got tons of people to configure their neurons to follow his on some topic and maybe some stupid proposals been adopted by the system you know the consequent on transition which you'd expect at least over a sort of medium to on top you'd expect people to reconfigure in neurons so they're not following this guy right so in that sense you know the system is evolving because remember for the most part these neurons vote automatically right okay right there is there's that moment where the change happens manually you know it's a lot of sort of general purpose intelligence this is a hybrid system okay I think there's more I want to ask about this but we're running out of time so I'm gonna just move on I want to ask you we mentioned webassembly before why did you guys choose webassembly as your programming language and why is what will first of all also just if you want to explain it for listeners who don't know and then explain why you close it so webassembly is one of the first open standards for universal software that can run anywhere and it was originally conceived to allow much more sophisticated web applications to be created so you can think of an a bit like Java for the web right but you know it's been designed with benefit of all other kind of learnings of the past twenty twenty-five years or something so it's a really nice specification for a virtual machine for which you can create bytecode right and in principle you can pray that bytecode using any computer language any programming language so that's nice so you know the idea is that you can create like a web assembly outlet using the programming language of your choice and this will run inside the browser near native speeds and does that lead to any sort of imprecision which would be a bad thing if you're obviously dealing with money well so the computations performed on the internet computer have to be completely deterministic so for the most part web assembly is completed termina stick I was one instruction relating to floating-point operations that isn't deterministic okay I don't know what that means floating points like you know a number with a decimal point right and so that particular instruction can't be used in software that runs on the internet computer ok wait for money there's often decimal points yeah so we're talking about a virtual machine right so it's nothing to do with money we're talking about a virtual machine a virtual computer that you can run by bytecode software so yeah it's roughly equivalent to say the java virtual machines you know with you can compile the java programming language down to Java bytecode to run it on a java virtual machine an average from Java Virtual Machine might be implemented in IOT device laptop on a server whatever right lots of different kinds of operating systems so I'm just confused because I think often times these different crypto networks or the different blockchain systems usually are dealing with money so are you saying that Definity is going to not being used as often for financial transactions no no not at all there's just no relationship between the virtual machine and money machine yeah a bunch of machines is like a virtual computer that you can just it's a standard that you can use to create software that runs on any instance of that virtual machine or it may be hosted so you know all of the main web browsers now have implementations of the web assembly virtual machine and that means that you can compile you know webassembly software from some programming language and it will run in any web browser on whatever platform that web browser is running on right so it's just a standard for creating software and it's an important standard because the first time really we've had a you know open spec for a virtual machine that can be implemented absolutely everywhere without any kind of license restrictions and so on so basically the developers will be using this to create different decentralized applications on Definity yeah so we've got a language called ActionScript which we're going to release at some point and we expect that people will use that to script to create web web assembly software that runs inside the web browser and they'll also be able to use the same programming language to create web assembly software that runs on the internet computer ok um all right so um we're gonna have to move super quickly through the last questions but you proposed a crypto Fiat system called the fee system pH I how does that work so Phi is really a DAP that would run on top of Definity although it could also run on top of aetherium and it's a really kind of in a lurid emic implementation of commercial banking so it's a system that produces what we call crypto fiat so it produces tokens that mirror you know local fiat currencies so you have like fire us defy CHF fine GPA GBP and so on and it does that in the same way that commercial banks create money so what a lot of people are so aware of is that you know the money we use in you know the modern economy is traded by commercial banks the government so for example in the US or the UK 98% of the money you know dollars or pounds is actually created by commercial banks when they issue loans so the way it works is let's say I'm a bank and you you're a borrower and you want to borrow a hundred thousand dollars I will simply create the hundred thousand dollars for you and that goes on to my balance sheet as a liability and then I'll make you sign a loan agreement so you will promise to pay me back say 100 110 120 thousand dollars with interest and that legal document loan is an asset of my balance sheet so let's say my crazed a hundred thousand dollars to give to you and now I've made you sign a loan agreement and you've got to pay me back hundred twenty thousand dollars well the some credit default risk so I'll book fat as a house it worth 110 thousand dollars so I've made nominally a 10 thousand dollar profit now the interesting thing is that really that means that fiat money you like dollars and pounds is really an IOU okay so all of the pounds and dollars are collateralized by these you know debt relationships so let's say you know in order to convince me to create this hundred thousand dollars for you you had to sign a loan agreement which gave me a call on your collateral that could be a personal guarantee it could be a house your car or whatever and probably you'll supply more collateral then you've done your borrowing right and there's lots of interesting and properties you know if the value of the economy falls well as the value of those assets that you've provided as collateral fall so does the value of the fiat currency in synchrony right because you know it's backed by collateral you know denominated in the same units same currency units so anyway it's a powerful system because it enables you to create large amounts of Fiat right right it's it's a fractional reserve system yeah so it is a fractional reserve system I think they like if you look at traditional economics textbooks they show kind of you know a rising triangle that's the traditional way of explaining it but in practice you know freeze in a modern economy the banks are less constrained by sort of fractional-reserve aspect of it than by risk so in the UK for example there are no reserve requirements at all the limit the limiting factor is actually risk because if the bank becomes an insolvent because the liabilities are the money that it's created are greater than its assets either of those loans it has to stop operating immediately so when banks are thinking about how much they can lend they're really looking at the risk of insolvency and that that's the limiting factor so as you know something that's fueled the rise of Bitcoin and some of these other cryptocurrencies as the cap on the monetary supply and the fact that you cannot do the fractional reserve system so do you feel like that runs any risks for you and obviously there's this whole flashback to the financial crisis that I think talking about fractional reserve banking banking brings to people so do you have any worries about that and how will you kind of prevent crises like that with this crypto Fiat system you're building you know the motion of Bitcoin is very different Bitcoin in essence is very different to a fiat currency you know essentially you fix the supply and and then the value fluctuates with demand that's why it's so volatile and that was the magic trick that Satoshi pole to create value in cyberspace just said look we're going to create these tokens will only ever be this many and thus you know if demand for these tokens increases the price will rise and that in itself actually creates demands for the tokens but when you're talking about you know more you know standard economic sort of business requirements you really need something like Fiat which is much more stable and where the you know the unit of account matches the value of assets in the economy right or is linked to the value of assets so it's sunny true that if fie system you know made lots of unwise loans the system could brain so the prevalent would be the financial crisis where banks were able to craze all kinds of silly loans to people in subprime housing who had no chance of paying the back and they were able to say right now you want a million dollar mortgage say I'm gonna create the million dollars are you building something into divinity or into this fire system to prevent that yeah sure so the design of fire aims to originate loans in a decentralized manner in a much more rational way such that we you know reduce the risk inherent in the system well creating effectively mirror fear and at much lower cost okay so I wanted to ask you between your presale and your public sale what was the markup on your tokens well between the public seed round and the private round so wouldn't say I think you're afraid to we did this public seed round at the beginning of 2017 it's sort of predated the ico craze and it was a very naive time you know we actually put a soft camp on it of $1,000,000 we said look we just need like 1 million dollars in the foundation of all raises more money later once we've reached or 1 million Swiss francs actually and once we've reached that target and your people could contribute using bitcoin ether also strikes once we've reached that 1 million then we're going to switch the systems or systems off in a few hours and we did that and by the time cities switched off and we plated like 3.9 million Swiss francs but then you know the ICO market exploded and we sort of slightly leery of some of the practices and so we sort of decided to stand back and we raised further money from you know hedge funds and venture capitalists and so on and there's some really big name investors involved in the project so I think between the C round and the last round which is race I'm not going to announce it but it's so like the original target was like ninety million dollars there was oversubscribed and like more than a hundred x marker okay and how do you feel about having such a large markup for the everyday investor well you know i think it's only true you know like four hundred people just paste in that feed round and they've been very well rewarded for their faith in the project no that's that's the nature of you know capitalism sometimes there are big winners and you know certainly true that seed investors have done very very well indeed and i still think there's you know enormous upside in the project so i think it's just the beginning yeah see seed of esters have done very well from a lot of your blog posts and also previous conversations I've had with you it seems that technical innovation is one of the differentiators for Definity if not the main differentiator how do you plan to become the dominant platform on technical strength in an open source environment where any other team can take the technology you've built and add it to their platform when they may already be starting out with a greater network effect yes I think that's investing a huge amount of money into another assertion development of new science and software and so on and has to think about that carefully but first of all you know networks can you know crew network effects okay and you know the to finish network first of all will launch a scale I think that will surprise a lot of people the technology involved will be very complex and we are building a kind of master for decentralisation so the definitive foundation has for example you know research centers in Palo Alto Zurich and people all over the world people in your Germany UK in got three people in Japan and you know one of the factors that people wanting to build on the internet computer or a platform like that will take into consideration is what kind of proof of people are standing behind that network right honestly the technologies become so complex it's very unlikely that you know some team out there they just wants to credit you know quick fall even understand you know that the systems the software are in place right but it could be like really good developers like from aetherium or something look I mean I think well there's to business I first I mean when when the network launches in beta it maybe there's some of its close source and it's sort of progressively reveals weird bounces for people you find bugs and things like that so there will be a window where the network has an opportunity to you know establish itself it's the technology involved is far too complex features to custom dip in and just take some peace at it say to etherium in order to give it some huge boost right and you'd really need to just to take the entire affinity system and use it to credit you get work but then you know if anyone looking to build on the internet computer has to ask the question well look here's the real internet computer with this large network of miners which shouldn't be like fresh for hosting centers running tens of thousands of computers that's got this fantastic massive of centralization that's dedicated to continuing to develop it and help support it in production you know I think most people would choose to build on that network rather than just some network of a few nodes by some people that can't develop their own technology so I think right but what I'm saying is what if it's like a robust network that adopts some of the technology why so I don't think adopting some of the technology is pretty tough so you know the things engineered as a whole and well I think people are gonna see in the coming years is that you know the original simplicity of something like Bitcoin is replaced by things that are vastly more complex and sophisticated so it's not just like you could just take the protocol and run it yourself on your network and prove it right you'd have you just some take the entire to finish a stack and then you know with your own miners create a competing network so that that would be possible it's true but you know people will have to I think people looking to build on the internet computer will have to consider whether they want to build on the sort of imitation their work or they want to build on the network which has vastly more you know computation computational power and also is backed by you know this NASA bit of centralization right okay great well that's all the time we have but this has been a fascinating discussion where can people learn more about you and affinity thanks Lauren um well and we're trying to make as much available information available as possible so I think there's series of peering on YouTube I think is one called inside Definity we're trying to push more and more information onto the website there are social media channels ready telegram and so on we also you know attend a lot of conferences there are even definitive meetups those have been taking place all over the world okay great all right well thanks for coming on unchanged thanks Laura thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about dominic and affinity check
