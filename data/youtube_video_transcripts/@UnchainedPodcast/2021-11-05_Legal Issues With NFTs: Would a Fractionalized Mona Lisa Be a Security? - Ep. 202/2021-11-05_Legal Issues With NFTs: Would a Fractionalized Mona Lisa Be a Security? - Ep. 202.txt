cryptopians that's bit.ly crypto to pre-order today finally today's episode is a panel i moderated at nf castle put on by the czech noble family the lobkovitz family at their palace in prague castle it was a wonderful weekend bringing together 200 artists builders collectors and more for a day of panels and talks tours of the family's art collection and its nft exhibition and it concluded with a gala dinner and live entertainment i'm not gonna lie one of my favorite parts was getting to dress up for the gala especially after being locked in our homes for the pandemic but what i really fell in love with was the fascinating mission of the lobkovitz family and how they're combining old and new in a novel way i'm excited to tell you more about it at a later time but first take a listen to this really engaging panel discussion about legal issues around nfts as i know many people in the space are getting interested in nfts right now or beyond interested obsessed maybe this is a good discussion to give you a heads up about any potential issues enjoy the show wish you could earn crypto but don't want to spend thousands on hardware just download the nodal cache app on your

legal controversies and there are many um from many different sites which is a super fun thing but why don't we quickly have each of you just sort of introduce yourselves and then we will get that discussion started awesome hi nice to meet everyone uh my name is jonathan victor i work on product and bd at protocol labs on things like ipfs falcoin and nft storage um i'm louis i'm part of the product team at monarchs monarchs is a digital property management protocol really helping creators and owners to derive values in a safe from their digital ownership in a safe and compliant way and really two layers to this there is the protocol primitive layer and then there is the trustless legal layer that we are building my name is diana stern i'm a product counsel at stripe which is a global tech company that helps online businesses start and scale and i've been working at the intersection of blockchain and ip for some time now hey everyone uh sean merudian uh i guess i'll start with the views and opinions i share today do not are solely my own opinion and do not express uh the stance or any views of the company that i work for but that being said i run operations at fractional um which is a trustless decentralized community driven fractionalization platform which basically in simpler terms it allows if you own an nft it allows you to democratize the access to that nft and basically uh allow you to turn them into fractions for other collectors to buy who have been you know traditionally priced out of it due to the current market conditions and really provide them access to the communities around the zenith has been a lot of discussion about community today and also even new communities that have we've been seeing form around those specific nfts um and so i don't run operations there and uh yeah it's going to be a great discussion i have to plug in the disclaimer as well oh okay right of course all the disclaimers about um so why don't we just start with a really basic question this kind of goes back to the previous panel you know what is an nft but from a legal perspective when you buy an nft what are you buying and i'm guessing maybe the lawyerly response will be it depends but anyway who wants to start i mean i'll go uh i think the answer is it depends uh so with the nft literally it's just like what is the url that's inside of there and depending on who you're buying the nft from or like what platform is minting there could be a variety of things that they put in there and so i think at the lowest level uh ideally people think and they are buying like a link to at least the asset so that picture that video that 3d rendering and that thing at the very least they own a digital representation that they can move around on like ethereum or whatever blockchain but practically i don't think that necessarily imbues other rights and i think that fuzziness and that greatness leads to open questions where people aren't sure if commercial rights come with those assets or if maybe specifically that's something that's owned by the artist and that needs to be granted separately so i think part of this is because it's a new space there's clarity that just needs to be created and i think standards will emerge and some orgs are already taking steps on that front but yeah really does depend diana did you i have a slightly uh i mean i i think it's true that you are not generally getting you know owning the underlying image but the crazy thing is it usually depends on the terms of service of the marketplace you buy from and all of those marketplace terms require you to go you know read paragraphs and paragraphs of legalese and sometimes you do get a license to the underlying art sometimes you don't and the rights that you may have sometimes you have commercial rights sometimes you don't so it's actually quite complicated to figure out what you own because of course someone can buy on one place one marketplace have certain rights resell on another marketplace and they might not even have the rights that the second marketplace says you're representing that you have so it's a bit of a mess right now and wait so when that happens then is it just whatever the most recent sale was that those are your rights because that was where you bought from or like or i guess these questions need to be worked out yeah i mean that's a really good question i i think probably right now that's the easiest way to think of it but i would be really interested if anyone ever takes this to court and you have to kind of go back and trace i mean we have great providence you could go back and trace sort of okay well what rights did you actually end up having the thing i would add to that too is um i think unpacking what it is you're buying is probably valuable to the audience as well i know i've had a couple conversations with folks like well how do you understand at nft um but before going into that too related to the rights associated with it it's not defined currently right there's no law on record that i know of that uses the term nft anywhere in a document and so it's such a new idea nfts specifically have yet to be officially regulated in some tangible way but in uh related to what you're buying when you're buying an nft as uh john mentioned it's a certificate to something that exists or a digital image however you'll hear the concept of off chain nfts on chain nfts there's also this idea of ipfs which is a decentralized storage system so essentially when you buy an nft ultimately it's a token that's on ethereum or other chains that's non-fungible we've covered that topic but the image associated with it is where it gets it can it can vary so if it's off chain the token itself has metadata within it that links to either a url or some database that's hosting that image and so that just tells you hey i own that image that's hosted on the database but that database essentially managed there's that question of in 100 years what happens if the company managing that database goes down and that image is gone forever now you just own a token that links to something that doesn't exist so that would be off-chain and there are issues there right problems there there's also this idea then okay what if you decentralize that storage right and that's where ipfs comes in which stands for interplanetary file system when you get people on the internet that's those are the names they come up with um and so essentially that ipfs is a way to host that image decentralized way as long as users on network continue to propagate that network it's more likely to be there longer term right and there are storage constraints to ethereum which uh make it difficult to uh store like a large let's say 4k video or high definition piece of art directly on chain and then there's pure on-chain storage which is when the the token itself actually contains metadata written into it in which you can take that code put it into let's say a compiler or some other area where you could run program or run code and it will reproduce that image and so all the things you need to create that image are on chain and always immutable and always stored when you buy that nft and so i think that's an important thing to understand for when we say nft there are different ways in which the data and what you're buying are stored and which could also change the question of what are you buying louie did you want to add anything yeah sure i think there are a lot of different use cases if we take just the basic ownership use case um say laura you're stealing my seed phrase you're stealing my nft code is low but are we gonna say that you're the proud owner of my nft not really are we gonna be able to make the case to like a broader like set of ownership that this is the case probably not so i think we're missing a number of recourse mechanisms around edge cases then there is the cases of yeah i'm i wanna i wanna lend you my nft i want to license my nft i want to sell my nft with specific rights around it like right now we're just signing with the metamask quality in a browser none of this is here but if we're thinking about like what makes a buyer a board or anyone accept something it's not signing a metamask transaction it's uh really like clearly accepting terms around the transaction could it be sell by swap plan licenses anything yeah so one related question that keeps coming up is you know whether or not a creator can imbue certain rights into their work but actually before we get there and i really do want to get there because i was discussing this beforehand with mitchell chan who did something super interesting but why don't we just actually also establish that when you're a creator what rights do you need to have to the original artwork in order to create the nft like do you have to be the copyright owner like what happens when someone just you know takes a photo that's popular on the internet and like creates an nft of it and sells it like does the original creator of that photo or that digital artwork have any recourse like what you know from the creator side um you know what rights are associated with an nft or or need to be anybody can go it's just true if you have a thought speak it yeah i mean i think the cleanest would be if you own the copyright outright so if you register with the copyright office you own the copyright you can do what you want with it but alternatively if someone licensed that work to you or it's licensed under creative commons then you can do you know depending on what creative commons license it is you can use it to create an nft i mean there is kind of a question of how exactly are you using the image when you mint an nft out of it is that a derivative work are you just maybe a distrib form of distribution because there's certain rights that you have under um a copyright act including distribution and then creating copies and derivative works so you kind of have to think about how you are using the art when you are creating an nft but if you and then what happens in the case where let's say i'm some famous photographer or something and i've created a a photo and someone else like you you decide to make an nft event and you sell it and let's say louie buys it then um i say hey that's that's that's my photo so what recourse do i have and what recourse does he have and do you just make off with the money because you know got bought an ethan you don't have to send it back or how does this all work yeah so hopefully the marketplace that's listed on has a notice and take down policy so you could follow that dmc there's a in the in the us anyway the digital millennium copyright act has this process called notice and take down where you give if notice to the marketplace hey someone has my copyrighted work on your website and doesn't have my permission and then the website would like you know there's kind of a back and forth that can happen but generally would remove the work um i actually don't know the answer on what would happen for louis if he because he purchased the nft and also as a practical matter like you might not want to send it back to you know laura so that is a bit tricky because of the permanence issue it also gets a little bit complicated with like so we were just talking about when you create an nft you have this like reference that you're using and if that's something like ipfs it's not like there's a single person who's necessarily holding it and it could also be the case that the same image has the same fingerprint that's used in multiple nfts so a takedown that affects affects this like forgery nft would also affect the real one too so it's not like there's a simple answer of like we take it down i think like it really has to come down to the marketplaces and what sort of standards are there how do they do their vetting of the different artists that are like posting on the platforms how they like have their own potential like recourse maybe like they don't do immediate payouts through ethereum i think this is the question when you have something that's permissionless anyone can do anything which is both part of the beauty of the system but also then the danger of the system and so part of it is coming up with like the social consensus rules around how do we actually want to manage this process how do we want to make sure that the original creators are able to retain the value of their work while also not creating artificial gatekeeper roles that make it difficult for people to create and actually share their work so that's interesting that you said that you wouldn't even know if you would want to send the counterfeit nft back because i assumed that he would be like i've been scammed but you're right they might be like no i i've got what i want and i don't care that the person who got paid wasn't the original creator um which is interesting but then this leads us to the next question about um so if i'm a creator and i want to imbue my nft with certain rights um does that mean that i can't sell on these other platforms that attach their own terms and conditions or like how does it work you know because i mean honestly i think what the promise of nft has brought to a lot of creators is oh i can you know program it to receive royalties in the future from secondary sales and then when i interviewed devin finzer the ceo of opencmy podcast he was like well you know whether or not um that can actually be enforced on second series sales is an open question it has a clear i was like what like you know this is exactly why i'd want to do this and he was kind of questioning whether or not buyers in future resellers will even want to you know send a bit of the royalties back to the original creator um but yeah so how how can creators put rights that they want to put into each work into them in a way that sticks um in my opinion it's an open question for the space if i was the ceo of a pencil it wouldn't be an open question i would just respect the royalty standard which they are not and i if i was a creator i would just not go on ovenc i would try to bring together a bunch of builders in the space that will be able to like build a cross-chain royalty standard that's going to walk across a bunch of primitives and i wouldn't work with the i mean i love openc but i wouldn't work with the vampires of the space uh and i'm saying vampires because they haven't been complying to the royalty standard which is not a good standard but it will at least be like a way to tell creators that they're here for them and if we believe that uh i mean we're all talking about financial inclusions and all of that and if we want to help creators we have to actually implement those types of standards otherwise you're going to have some central focal points that are going to just like swallow the entire value and it makes very little sense given all the very nice visionary sentences that we drop around around financial inclusion and such oh wow so i so are you saying that actually openc really isn't enforcing this because i i didn't know that i think yeah they weren't standards but like they haven't made any efforts and none of the marketplaces it's not just open c it's a bit like in 17 16 15 you had a lot of centralized exchanges that you just couldn't talk to because they were too busy making money right now you have nft marketplaces that are too busy making money to care about those type of things but if we're thinking about like the 10-year vision of what blockchain can bring to creators and to the creators economy like this needs to happen for sure and so i personally would love to have like a i don't know cross company cross block chain cross down initiatives really working on this um if anyone is interested i would love to talk with them [Laughter] and i think the jurisdiction question gets really interesting as well right because the nature of blockchain is its cross-borders it's composable across platforms where the people are buying from right now as long as they're not a fiat on-ramp like open c isn't required to you know collect anybody's information any kyc laws there and so having some sort of open collective to which creators could agree to these are the rights or these are the standards we want to attribute to it and it would in any way go cross-border would be i think really powerful um yeah a lot of complexities and considerations i would say like the short term legal hack that i would use is to put a link to the license that you want in the description field and the metadata of your nft and when you mint it and i have a sample license on my github if you want to use it and yes you would be competing with the terms of service of the marketplace but i think you could put a provision that says you know this license supersedes the terms and marketplaces also might want to consider allowing artists and making room for artists to have their own license that do supersede their terms to just really provide clarity yeah yeah well this goes actually to my conversation with mitchell i don't know where he is mitchell chan who was on a previous panel but he was saying that he did some nfts back in 2017 and that he um put the metadata in the smart contract and he made it so you couldn't just buy it on a platform and you had to mint it yourself um using uh you could use etherscan which is probably the most user-friendly way but he also had people do it directly using the parity client which is funny for those of us in the crypto space because that's not um used widely anymore if at all i don't know um but you know he was like this is how i'm kind of overriding what the terms of service are so i think i don't know if maybe mitchell isn't here but i'm just curious like how the resales are done then can you even resell that on openc or is it just people who are very technically savvy now traded or i think openc has an api that if you create like an nft that meets the specs you'll be able to like interoperate with them uh and so but even if you didn't do that like everything on these open blockchain base layers still gives you the flexibility to like if other people create a marketplace and you're compliant with whatever standards it's just like a technical compatibility thing of like can they interpret that what you've created is an nft and then be able to like process um yeah okay so maybe it's not so challenging but just in general like do you do we feel that traditional regulations cover nfts or are there gaps and if so what are what are the big gaps and questions that need to be resolved i think short term daos are trying to take the lead uh you could definitely take an nft case that have proper uh legal rights around them to court maybe a much longer process than working with a dow provided that the dow is actually taking care of their community so that's short term longer term i think we said it 20 times today any assets is going to be an nft so once every asset is an nft i'm assuming that like different jurisdictions are going to take a very very strong look at it on on start really thinking about it but short term it may take a bit of time to take your nft case to count a better user down or use smart contracts or use other ways yeah i think there's also like interesting questions of like if you think about what is an nft we talked about like the technical implementation but really it's just like a set of standards that people follow and so it could be in the future there's a third standard that comes out that supersedes 721 and 1155 and so even as we think about like what smart regulation like how do we have something that can evolve as the technology evolves because really it's like people coming on social consensus to implement a specific thing and then interpret it a specific way and i think the same is true even for like respecting royalty rights like at the end of the day it's pretty trivial if you wanted to like to get around that like you could send an nft to someone for zero cost and then have them send you the money out of band and so like really it comes down to like how do we build up the right tools and like social culture around these things in order to actually enforce the things that we want to enforce where it would be extremely frowned upon to like intentionally try to subvert an artist and not pay the royalty fee and things like that um yeah and something actually really interesting you mentioned royalties there's also this emerging model of artists wanting to wanting their fans to uh benefit as well from the royalties of their works as well and participate and as fans of that artist also receive royalties as they grow so there's like a platform called royal which enables just that and so there's a question now where i think a gap in regulation could be you know now that if they own an nft for this artist which they love they love their music they were early there they could show people hey i was listening to this guy before he blew up everyone loves being able to say that right they were there first but if they're receiving royalties from that does that turn the nft into a security and there's a question there right and with that what does that mean then for the artist and everything surrounding it right and so those kind of gray area are gray areas that will need to be worked through yeah i think the more exotic nft structures can start to look like financial instruments and so there will probably be gray area but i'm not generally in favor of technology specific laws so i think generally the laws we have today should work i mean earlier there was some talk of consumer protection i mean the ftc regulates unfair and deceptive acts and practices and state attorney general generally have consumer protection authorities so i think that we we have the laws we need it's just going to be a question of how do we apply them and still allow the nft ecosystem to flourish because we want a lot of creative use cases we want to find new ways to use nfts for artists to engage with their fans or other creators so i think hopefully we can not have anything too horrible happen where regulators kind of dive in um and we can sort of let the ecosystem grow someone else had said previously like nfts can be used in many different ways i think the most prominent thing that we see today is like art but in the future it could be like game assets it could be tickets it could be literally anything at the event last night we had popes that were being given out which are like little button nft type things and so really when we start thinking about like how do we create smart regulation i think a lot of it can't be as specific and we have to be thinking about like what are the actual types of harm that we're trying to like protect against yeah well to go back to what sean was saying i mean i to my mind uh not that i'm a lawyer i'm definitely not a lawyer but um it does sound like like a security if it's you know related to somebody's future earnings and you're getting a share of that um but we did see that there was even an issue with a dow that was doing something di similar that turtle is a dow turtle or turtle dough i think it's dow turtle it got delisted from it was open c i think because uh they were you know saying like there are these incentives and you got royalties and stuff like that so i mean are we all just going to agree that that's a security or do you feel like people are going to push the envelope and you know how how because a dow is not an llc it's like not kind of a legal entity so i'm just curious like is that a gray area or is that just settled and done or so i mean it's security's law it's very facts and circumstances based for each individual case and so if i don't i'm not familiar with that one particularly like the facts circumstances around it but you know if they're promising profit and if they're saying we are going to work hard to make sure that the thing you get is going to provide you that profit the facts are the fact that they've communicated that set those expectations and built it that way with the people buying it would make it that right yeah well i mean here we are many of us are american and so we're actually we're talking about this is how in the us it would be decided but true when you have these global marketplaces and you know things that are considered securities in the us are not elsewhere which is why we have things like air drops for everybody but americans um you know i'm curious then for these nfts that maybe would be viewed as securities in the us then is the marketplace just closed off to americans and it's like that those can trade elsewhere but is that how this is going to be resolved or should should there be some kind of global agreement about it or is it just going to be continuing jurisdiction by jurisdiction in my opinion short time if i was to launch such a project i would try to be a bit creative to not fall under sec regulation i think sora is a very good example fantasy game practically you could say it's a security you could say it's gambling the uk laws is now saying it's gambling so i would say for builders i would try to be a bit creative a huge gray area and and i think europe is going to be europe and other jurisdictions are going to be much easier than the acc but yeah marketplaces uh if there are companies there are companies and they have to answer to the acc so it's more you as a builder what do wanna what type of concerns do you wanna deal with really one question that's interesting also is like given how i mean these are permissionless technologies anyone can spin things up like i think the game of whack-a-mole will be much harder and so partially this is going to be like a really interesting question like how do different countries tackle this and like work together because if you can have anyone spin up a project it doesn't take that many people like the number of these projects like even if you just go on twitter you'll see a thousand of them that spring up daily and so like how do we actually think about like reducing the rate at which i don't know things that are harmful for folks uh spread but yeah there's a lot of open questions so i'm gonna bring all the bad stuff but i think one thing that's worrying me from the legal standpoint is uh money laundering with nfts if i want to launder money today it's easier to sell nfts than going on finance or ok x which is already not too hard and so i think this is this is coming and that really makes me worry because regulators are gonna come in they're gonna see that and they're gonna i don't want them to take a just a very like generic approach to this because it's going to limit creativity it's going to limit innovation and that's that's what scares me a bit about nft right now is that as much of a concern when you have full providence on chain and proper regulation at like via rams like so long as at the places where people are able to exit uh is that as much of a concern if you can like with a block explorer and chain analysis like look through and see what was the history of transactions what was the source of this addresses funds and so on well i think that's the problem it's because chain analysis and cypher trace on all those people they are making money off of telling regulators that bad stuff is happening so very soon they're going to tell regulators that bad stuff is happening regulators are going to take a look and they may not have a very subtle approach to it so that's my concern in some countries art laws already require a certain level of kyc so i think it's probably a matter of time until we see that applied in the us in the nft context and probably already kind of a best practice yeah so a couple things first of all disclosure cypher trace is a former sponsor of my shows i just want to get that out there but this issue um actually has already come up where um i think for coinbase's nft platform which they just announced you're going to be able to participate just straight from your own address or wallet and so you don't have to do kyc if you do it that way but i think uh ftx also announced that they were going to launch an nft marketplace or they might have just launched it and you have to do full kyc for that one so um kyc for those of you who don't know us know your customer it's like giving your identity to the bank and it's all you know to kind of monitor uh money or to comply with anti-money laundering compliance rules but what's funny is that you brought this up right now because literally right before i got up on stage g money from the previous panel said to me oh by the way it's so funny you mentioned ether rock because we could have talked about another controversy which is money laundering he said it was people were surmising was going on with ether rocks and so just just to like lay out this process for people i take it you have dirty funds and then you buy an nft with it and so you've kind of like then through that you can swap it into something else and cash out is that a simple yeah i mean if uh if i have a hundred of malicious people that are deciding to assign value to my jpeg on then we're bringing up like some more community that have no idea what we're doing and we're just like minting and selling to them those nfts then we just have london money and yes there is cypher trace and channel ics and such but my only concern is that when we look at the sec regulation when we look at malta that has a lot of good intention but that did really wrong i'm just worried about regulators coming in and taking very like like a very simple approach to things i think especially in permissionless networks it becomes complicated to think about how do you write or get this balance correct where you have things that are completely open and you want to enable people to like be able to participate on the same side you don't want to enable bad things to do bad or bad people to do bad things and so i think especially the kyc problem is not nft specific i think it's also like a d5 problem as well but coming up with the tools that do that in a way that doesn't just compromise everyone's privacy and also like for very good reason if we all imagine that there will be more blockchains and more crypto in the world it becomes much more dangerous if any individual entity can like like effectively docks like any user uh and they just think about who are the worst people in the world they would be able to dox other people that's a bad thing to enable as well um so i think it's going to be a challenging way of like coming up with the right tools the right processes but yeah did you know that exchanges take up to a 25 cut on your staking rewards but you don't need an exchange to stake you can run a validator

the link is in the description i also actually just wanted to shift back to the dow question and relate that maybe to the earlier topic about um ip rights so um i'm just curious so we were talking about how originally you know if you're going to create or if you're going to mint an nft you should be the copyright holder but we have all these dows that are forming and they're creating these different nfts so when endow creates an nft do they does the dow get the copyright or do you have to actually be an entity or like how does that work i think the licensing use case is an interesting one you have few dowels now that are saying whoever has one nft of that collection can either or not build the derivatives collection so pretty much making their own rules with code and some fallback mechanism when code doesn't cover and they can allow or not on we've seen both cases we've also seen people building derivatives collection without being allowed and without the nft coming from a dow either so another gray area we should keep a list of them because it's the longest and when you said that they also create a fallback mechanism is that something that can apply across many jurisdictions or like what does that look like no i think you know you will need to go to the dao if you go to a jurisdiction and say that the dao told you that i i mean i don't see unless there are legal documents for the jurisdiction to look at you're really trusting the dow which i think is extremely powerful uh i just i'm not sure it's gonna scale to all the assets especially the real world assets but for the native native digital assets i think it's it's very powerful that thous are not realizing that they can define their own rules and be their own jurisdictions somehow dana he looked thoughtful i don't know if he wanted to add to that no oh well i said diana but oh sorry um it's interesting i mean i'm trying to think of so i think someone had brought up earlier or when we were talking about that in the us anyway only humans can have um original copyright ownership of something like there was a case where a monkey took a picture of itself and it didn't own the copyright so if we're talking about like an algorithmically created thing that a dow made but but we can go a little bit more simple like let's say there's a picture that someone in the dow community created and the dow wants to own it collectively it's a little easier to imagine that when the dow has an entity type right if it's a corporation or a non-profit or something because then you know our laws are pretty clear around that it can go and register so then how would you do it if you're if you're not trying to to do that maybe you the dow appoints somebody that is sort of their like ip portfolio owner and that person then can register the copyright and um kind of be sort of that's their that's their role in the doubt perhaps that's one way it could work yeah i mean we're working on a contract for mint so for example the dow would say this is the contract where if anyone wants to mint a derivatives project they need to come to this contract and mint it and it's going to come with a bunch of terms that honestly they don't have any jurisdiction right now it's the dow being behind those terms and saying like we we are the entity that's gonna assure those terms are enforced and if the dar is malicious then then it's it's cooked but yeah nfts are also kind of like a brand though so when you think about like board api club for example i saw earlier yugo labs owns the trademark so what does that mean because like they've licensed from a copyright perspective each board ape yacht club owner has commercial rights but they're not the trademark holders so there's actually i think a lot of trust right now happening between the original creators of nfts and the broader communities which start to look like daos that might own them i was going to ask about um i mean when you have these uh different groups and like if there's a conflict then if it's a dao um who who can some like can someone go is it just the jurisdiction or the court of their jurisdiction is that where they go to or how is all this decided like if there's a controversy over the ip that the the dow owns like they want to sue somebody for ip infringement maybe i mean it really could be anything because also i have a question for like the trademark is that would that be like according to the us trademark i guess i'm assuring each of these things even start in a particular jurisdiction right yeah so you can get trademark protection in multiple jurisdictions so you just would go in and in each country and you would get the trademark protection there um and then similarly for copyright i think that there's some ways to get kind of like multiple countries at once with your registrations but yeah you would just go to each jurisdiction and and do it that way and some jurisdictions might i think the difference in protections is some jurisdictions when you are the creator of something that's copyrightable you automatically have the copyright there might be additional protections added if you register like in the us for example if you then register with the copyright office it's easier to defend your copyright in court so um yeah i think it would be a market by market analysis yeah i mean what i'm getting at is these are global things they're global marketplaces and then kind of yeah when when there's a conflict then it's just like where is this decided because you know up until then you can say well we'll work it out with the dow or whatever but then when they can't then where do they go i think there's an interesting question about how do like different like jurisdictions come up with like better anchors that allow for like more of these questions to be answered ahead of time like more recognition of like dao's as corporations or whatever the appropriate structure is in the appropriate jurisdiction but then you have more fallbacks to like existing tools that have already been built and thought up through like case law and then there's something to like hook into where like there's less ambiguity i think whenever there's ambiguity then there will just be as you said there will be inevitably some conflict and then it will just have to be sorted out in the courts and people make a case um but we can create clarity which can make it easier for folks to feel comfortable like moving assets into the space and like operating yeah and i like for areas where there would be kind of a standard real world contract regarding that relationship but then maybe the nft has like something uh conflicting like that's also interesting like how how do you square um laws maybe that have already been established but then the nft or the dow or whatever wants to create something new and they're trying to do something new um and then someone could bring a claim saying oh well you know traditionally this is how this has been resolved do you feel like then the courts will just revert to what's been done or will i mean we're seeing this happen in the um crypto space broadly where it's this question like do we need new regulations or do the old regulations apply to some degree we need new like we were talking about the use case of like imagine you have a dow that owns an nft and that's on ethereum and then during the eth2 upgrade we get two forks we get like the proof of stake fork and then the miners maintain the proof of work fork now you have two separate dowels that exist that have both like ownership over their version of the nfts but like they both point to the same physical asset potentially and so there's a question of like which is the real owner uh and then like is the court gonna decide that like one of these chains is the more legitimate version of ethereum like really i don't think anyone has an answer to that question uh but yeah it's an important one oh could you try and solve that up front though by sort of specifying what happens in the case of a fork like if it's an nft that you're licensing out to other people and you say oh if in case of a fork you know this is the true version or well i i guess what would you be trying to protect from the other well so you could imagine different forks having different like potential problems so like let's say you had written your contract to say or like physical contract that's like the proof of work chain and like you couldn't have guessed that ethereum was going to split to do a proof of stake train then like are you going to be on potentially the lear or less supported chain and then does that like lose the actual authority uh i think some of this speaks to like as the space evolves we also need to have things that can evolve with it so like when you're creating this dao and the structure how do you have a process that's upgradable that can take in new information that may not exist at the time when you created it i mean my feeling is that the dow should be focused on making new rules about what's possible now that was not possible before all the basic stuff about copyrights on royalties on licensing well i personally think that 95 of it should should just be compliant with the the current code the challenge is the cross jurisdiction i think dows should like have some policy or some thoughts about like how they're gonna how things are gonna apply across jurisdiction so example uh dao is minting nfts that are co-created by ten artists they are from 10 different jurisdiction and the dao should do their best so everyone is compliant in each of their jurisdiction and then the dao is probably going to build new experiences that regardless like this is new uncharted territory and they should just do their best to define their own rules there but i think 95 percent of the basics should be should still be respected but if a dow doesn't care about that then it's it's everyone's choice to go interact with that dog to be honest yeah for things like forks what we have seen is that to centralize oh sorry not centralized exchanges will um post notices saying you know this fork is happening here's how we're gonna handle it we're gonna go with this chain or that chain um and so you could see a similar thing with daos where they say oh hey this this is gonna happen if there's a second chain this is what we're going to do and in that point people would have time to like sell their nft or whatever if they didn't want to participate um one other thing is that like earlier when we did our little pre-panel call we talked about um kind of different types of standard licensing or whatever that could be um embedded in into nfts and i wondered like do you see any movements to that like diana when you said that right now you know a good solution is just to link out um then are are those creators just creating their own and and so it's not standardized it's just like there's a bunch of different unique ones or are we seeing that communities are kind of coalescing around certain models that they they would like to follow as standard i haven't seen people adopt it just yet i i think it is a good short-term solution before we have you know more standards around nft licensing but we can also leverage existing standards like creative commons is is quite good and helpful if you're a creator that wants to sort of let a thousand remixes bloom that's a great license for you to consider but yeah it's it's not standardized yet like if i could imagine a world where you have when you go to minton nft there's like an interface that provides you with a drop down of like five licenses with like a quick tldr on what each one is i think that would be awesome but we're just not there yet and there is a basic standard i don't i blank on the number i'm gonna try i think it's two seven eight one but uh it's covering very very narrow types of of transaction it's only sell transactions on all the marketplaces have been uh have been ignoring them i mean we're working on this i don't want to be prescriptive about the solution but what i know for sure is that the solution needs to be nft centric not marketplace-centric because your nft should be able to go anywhere in the space across chains and it's not one marketplace that's gonna ensure that those royalties are paid it's it's a logic that's gonna be nft centric or asset centric so let's also um talk you know since uh we are here for this um you know effort to help restore some of the the works here at this castle um i was also wondering you know when you have kind of this combination of nfts and um maybe like a financial effort does that you know just mean that financial regulations will apply or like does it change the nature of the artwork itself too um because it kind of goes back to what sean was saying earlier it's like you know if i buy a painting from an artist that i like generally i'm just buying it because i like the artwork um but suddenly if it's like oh i could potentially earn more from reselling the night and because i guess the thing is you know you would have that same thought i guess with an artwork but since you don't kind of constantly see the market price somewhere maybe it's a more abstract thought whereas obviously with nfts the financial aspect of it is more front and center so are are we just expecting that a lot of these will be treated uh you know as financial objects yeah no it's a it's a great question and i kick around too the idea of traditional art and you know art houses auction houses i think or art houses i should say in exhibits and exhibitions and galleries you typically do not see the price of the art next to the piece itself because it's about the artist it's about the story it's about the context surrounding that and then so when i think about applying securities laws to traditional art in some way um if nfts were to become if it were to become applicable there with securities laws comes of course the investor protections uh clarity transparency and honesty around it and i think so much about stories around art as well and in terms of how like proving the the accuracy of that story and also what the artist is saying that puts it'd be interesting to see the onus it puts on the artists for investor protections if it were to be considered a security and then how does that impact how art is received or viewed or interpreted um would be interesting i think a little bit about like so nfts again just being broad category of things just because people are speculating on them and making money does that necessarily mean that they are a security or anything else like beanie babies were never really considered securities and so i guess like there's that question as well and especially part of the reason this discussion even happens is because the prices tend to be quite high but like that's partially an artifact of like what are the tools that we have today uh and so yeah especially with ethereum having high gas prices and stuff like that the types of nfts people are willing to tend to be art pieces but like if nfts turn out to be like game assets and like popes and all these other like lower cost things where like yeah you might just get them for free uh like or even like at low cost like 10 cents for an nft then like if we come up with bad rules and like definitions of like what could financial security was or whatever apply like it's going to introduce a ton of complexity for a bunch of use cases that are totally adjacent um yeah well so what if it's something like we're gonna fractionalize uh shares in the mona lisa and then you can buy a share and then and this is how you know museums start funding some of their projects then what would you say i think that might be slightly different and i guess it depends again uh our very like loose definition with howie of like you have to meet this like three-part subjective test uh and so there's a question of like how is that sort of like represented to you as like a buyer um i think this is where some of the complexity will come in um if you are buying purely as a donation and like the only person who can receive it back is like the museum maybe that's like a different thing and the reason that you're doing it is just to be a donor of and like support the museum and get your name on like a plaque if like the goal is that you're planning on like i don't know if it was like being treated as a security with like some promise of future profits or something else that might be different i think the weird edge case i think we were talking about with uh earlier was what happens or we were just talking about like music and like you buy an nft like a fractional nft of your favorite rapper's first album is it a security because you're expecting him to create good future work uh unclear uh i personally would say no but i think it's definitely a fuzzy thing and that's partially just because of how we define a security is a bit of a fuzzy thing there's also the community aspect that comes to it as well right like so if you were to buy a fraction of the mona lisa i would ask you know is there a common forum for all those fraction owners to collaborate and talk about you know the history behind it or any sort of latest news around it right like how does it bring them together because when i think of a security when i think of a share like you know i own stock and apple i don't really care if other people do and i don't have a way of seeing who else owns stock and apple it's not really something transparent to me um that i go out and i like i'm talking with them or communicating with them something about fractions nft especially being a digital thing i mean with traditional art collectors right they typically you like to buy the piece you also like to display it you like to show what you own when it's physical and you own fractions of something physical you can't really do that in a way that is as meaningful as maybe something digital when it's a digital medium and you can show like hey i own this thing and everybody shows it it's a digital medium digital native and it has different properties than something physical does um and there's also that community aspect as well of just you know maybe being having that sense of uh camaraderie with people like in the sense of an album right owning that partaking that music really identifying with it and the values that come with it and just wanting to be a part of that club i think there's also like i mean security i believe is like for securitized interest so like if you were buying the thing what is your securitized interest uh and so in the event where it's something where it's like you're a part of a community and like it's not like you actually own a part of the mona lisa you own like this representation that society is agreeing like gives you some social like link to the uh mona lisa it's like a slightly different thing as well and so then does that go to what you were saying about community that like if it's more community based then it's less of a security is that what the conclusion is or um no conclusions but uh it's a good idea it would definitely if you look at the howie test it would definitely be less likely to be considered one again it's all based on facts and circumstances of every time something is created and how it's treated and so you'd have to look at the individual facts and circumstances of this particular instance it seems like what we're saying with the community part is like the efforts of others prong of the howie test rate so an investment of money with an expectation of profit based on the efforts of others you have to meet all three and if you knock out is it if everyone is contributing to the value of this nfc or this portfolio does that knock out the efforts of others prong but that's a really tricky test like there was a court uh case where i believe there was a company that was breeding chinchillas and even though like part of the way you got your return was that you like contributed to raising the chinchillas it was still determined to be an overall security scheme so even when you're participating in what creates the profit at the end of the day there can still be situations where it ends up being a security that said i don't necessarily think that just because you're raising money with an nft it's a security i mean there's crowdfunding campaigns that are securities but there's also crowdfunding campaigns that aren't securities so i think it goes back to lewis's point of like how do you uh structure what you're trying to do so that it aligns with the legal regime you want to fit in you might want your nft to be a security actually because there's a whole world of you know securities that you might want to play into and you see that having a clear chain of title and prominence might be beneficial yeah and it's actually to add to that point too i mean with the howie test it's right the well originally was this uh led to expect profits solely derived from the efforts of others and that was from 1946 i think and then in 1973 it was actually reinterpreted that solely derived from the effectiveness of others is actually shouldn't be taken literally and it's more of like a mostly derived from the efforts of others but the thing that precedes that is the expectations of profits right so when you talk about community if everyone's saying hey we're going to make this thing more valuable that's that's one thing right but if everyone's just hey i'm really happy i own this thing and i'm like for a crypto punk for example right larva labs the ones who own the copyrights to crypto punks are not going around and saying hey we are going to do x y and z therefore crypto punks will accrue in value and therefore you should buy a crypto punk they're not doing that they simply exist there's 10 000 of them and that's it right and so the market dynamics are as exposure and visibility increases for crypto punks they may go up in value but that's due to market dynamics that are beyond the efforts of others or promises of profit in which case it wouldn't be considered security similar with art right over time what is value but the degree of importance we give to things right and that value may not be realized right now where we are but over time it may be realized in which case it may accrue in value but there's no expectation of profit there or efforts of others related to that other than awareness another unsolicited advice but i think like compared to the fungible space here we're dealing with art creation there is a lot of emotion involved there is much more than just like the financial value and hence there is so much room to avoid any like trouble with the sec frankly like just sell an experience if you monetize the expense i think there's so many room for maneuver to make things not a security that my advice for the builders is just like build an experience that's safe and we really have this room to do it here in the nft space that we don't in the fungible space yeah that's that's really interesting because obviously we're seeing people with tokens kind of wanting to push it and i mean obviously their lawyers are saying like avoid avoid but you know we have even former regulators that leave government and say there just needs to be new regulations this is new technology the old rules don't apply which obviously the regulators do not agree with um but it's just fascinating because i would say a lot of people do want to push the envelope and they they think well it shouldn't be a security or it shouldn't be you know those regulations shouldn't apply and so they want they want to push the envelope but we'll see if somebody actually tries to take it to court anyway okay well we're out of time this has been a fabulous discussion thank you so much thank you there's a new cryptocurrency made for mobile that you can earn by

ethereum hits an all-time high as supply goes negative ethereum set an all-time high price for eth at four thousand six hundred and seventy four dollars and ninety cents on wednesday according to coin gecko that's a bit over ten times its price just a year ago coinciding with the skyrocketing price is a new trend concerning ethereum's monetary policy in august ethereum's issuance was changed due to the implementation of ethereum proposal 1559 during the london hard fork which instituted a policy of burning eth whenever network demand increases over a certain threshold according to the block this change in issuance or the network's monetary policy has resulted in more eve being burned than issued over the past week since october 26 ethereum's net issuance is approximately negative 12 000 each or 54 million dollars ethereum is becoming a deflationary asset making eth more and more scarce with each day of negative issuance also this week cme announced plans to launch micro ether futures

on november 1st the president's working group published its much anticipated report on stablecoins while admitting that stablecoins could if well designed and appropriately regulated offer faster more inclusive and more efficient payment options the pwg spent much of the report outlining their risks these include the loss of peg due to stable coin runs payment system risks associated with blockchains the systemic risk of a single stablecoin issue or failing money laundering and terrorist financing to address the risks the pwg called for congress to implement legislation and appropriate federal oversight specifically regarding stable coins notably the pwg suggested stablecoin issuers be limited to insured depository institutions if congress fails to act the pwg said it would ask the financial stability oversight council or fsoc to designate stablecoins as a systemically important activity which would permit federal agencies to establish risk management criteria concerning stablecoin backing in the interim the pwg urged regulators such as the securities and exchange commission or sec the commodity futures trading commission or cfdc the financial crimes enforcement network or fincen and the consumer financial protection bureau or cfpb to leverage their existing authority while congress works to develop proper measures to regulate the asset class in related news michael sue the acting controller of the currency announced that the crypto sprint between the office of the controller of the currency the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation has concluded and that the results will be communicated shortly sue hinted that the crypto sprint would help build a framework for regulating crypto banking activities get ready for an ens token the ethereum name service the protocol behind dot east domain names announced plans to launch a governance token this week transforming the organization into a dow it first asked community members to step forward as governance delegates in charge of the dao and then released the tokenomics of ens users who registered and held an ens domain before october 31st may claim ens tokens starting november 8th 50 of ens tokens will be reserved for community treasury 25 will go to a community airdrop and 25 will be reserved for core contributors however on wednesday nick johnson the lead developer of ens informed the community that the airdrop hit an obstacle in the form of airdrop farming despite the company writing a lengthy ethics policy for the core team about keeping airdrop information quiet it seems information about the ens token drop leaked allowing certain addresses to purchase and register a multitude of dot east domains ahead of the announcement adversely affecting the distribution of tokens said johnson quote we kept it need to know but you'd be surprised how many people need to know ahead of the announcement all it would take is one person chatting to a less scrupulous friend about vague details to give them a hint that this is worth trying johnson said that ens will be manually blacklisting 784 addresses from the token air drop in light of the farming

transactions over ten thousand dollars amongst other information will be passed in the house today november 5th the provision which coin center describes as unworkable and unconstitutional would make not reporting on such an event a criminal felony according to abe sutherland in his appearance on unchained in october jake travinsky a lawyer and strategic advisor at variant fund tweeted it's out of

of the market price and not for m a they also say it was made without independent oversight as would be required under swiss law the legal action comes as consensus is coming out of a few years of
