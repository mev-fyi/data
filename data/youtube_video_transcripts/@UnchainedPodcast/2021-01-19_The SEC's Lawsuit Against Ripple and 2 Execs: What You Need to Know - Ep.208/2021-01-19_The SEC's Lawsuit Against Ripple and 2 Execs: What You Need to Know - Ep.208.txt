the sec lawsuit against ripple and two of its executives here to discuss are stephen palley partner at anderson kill and gabriel shapiro partner at bsb law welcome stephen and gabriel hey laura nice to be here thank you so let's set the baseline for listeners on december 22nd the sec announced a lawsuit against ripple and chris larson who is the former ceo and current chairman and brad garlinghouse the current ceo stephen why don't we start with you do you want to give a brief summary of what the sec is suing them for and why this lawsuit is a big deal sure and actually the sec does a very nice job summarizing it itself in the beginning of the lawsuit it was filed in federal court in new york in the southern district of new york which is in that courthouse is in lower manhattan uh and the sec alleges that from about 2013 to the present the defendants which you correctly identified as ripple labs bradley garlinghouse and christian larson sold over 14.6 billion units of a digital asset security that's the sec's words called xrp in return for cash or other consideration worth over 1.4 billion dollars to fund ripple's operations and this is i think important and according to the sec to personally enrich larson and garlinghouse who later in the lawsuit the sec alleges uh took in about 600 million dollars from their sales and this was problematic according to the sec's complaint because allegedly uh and as discussed in detail xrp is actually security and under u.s securities laws in order to sell security you either have to register it or it has to be subject to exemption and the sec says neither of those things uh were the case so they sued um ripple for violating the uh registration requirements of the of the securities of u.s securities laws and they also sued uh lauren garlinghouse and larson personally um as uh there are two counts for the complaint the first is violation of the registration requirements from the securities act the second is for um aiding and abetting that violation under something called a control person theory which basically says that people in an organization who have sufficient control over the organization can be personally liable for securities laws violations that's it uh in a nutshell and gabriel would you like to add to that what do you think is the significance of the lawsuit and also of the fact that it named two executives yeah well i think the you know this is the first time in one of these suits there have been a number of these token actions this is the first time when the sec has gone personally after the founders it didn't do that in the kick case relating to the kin cryptocurrency uh it didn't do that in the telegram case it didn't name the durov brothers as defendants so i think that speaks to what they feel is the level of egregiousness of the violations yeah um and i do think it's noteworthy in that regard and it's not a fraud case either so there have been there have been uh token related cases where individuals are named personally but those are securities fraud cases what's really interesting about this is to use gabe's words there's a certain level of egregiousness that's wound through this but it's not a fraud case but in order to make a control person claim against people involved in a securities act registration violation you have to show intent and that i mean i think the gabe hits it exactly hits the nail on the head the sec i think sees the the egregiousness that uh they describe is that these guys they made 600 million dollars and there was a sort of an information asymmetry right they knew things about this asset that you know people regular people who are buying consumer buyers wouldn't know and if this had been registered as a security you'd have reporting uh requirements which uh were not followed here yeah and actually stephen you did tweet the ripple case is the most fraud-like non-fraud filing i think i've seen and you said it's full of evidence about market manipulation and control all to the benefit of the issuer and execs and to the potential detriment of the buying public and then you said so where i come down is not will it be delisted and will the thing die you wrote good chance of both but are there other more serious charges waiting in the wings so like why do you think the sec didn't just pursue this as a fraud case and you know what makes you think that potentially they could still so i i'm not suggesting that there was fraud here um i think what i pointed to earlier if you look at the complaint and you see it took me a minute it took me a few minutes when i read it to understand why they did this the reason why there are allegations of um trading on inside information or information asymmetry or suggestion of of um willfulness is because that's what you need to do in order to satisfy the the proof requirements for a control person claim and i think the reason why they brought that claim is because i mean if you want to recover money these guys according to the sec they personally made 600 million dollars so if you're going to try and claw back money to distribute to um smaller investors you have to go after them because they have they have the cash they have nearly half of proceeds and it's um they're entitled to uh you know a presumption that uh you know the sec the government has to prove its case but if all of these allegations are true this was not about freedom it was not about changing commerce or you know liberty it was about personal uh profit for a couple of people who made a huge amount of money and there's nothing wrong with making a lot of money uh i'm not suggesting that there is but that's i think why the sec went after these people personally and you know i think it might have felt personal to them in part two because this was basically filed on christmas eve right yeah brad garlinghouse noted that in his you know in his twitter uh you know response right he was as like a particularly egregious factor to show how heartless the sec is yeah merry christmas right here's your gift um but but so why do you think that the sec didn't just pursue um fraud charges i mean we have so you know as you also tweeted you said that there was a very bad fact and that fact is that as early as 2012 ripple got advice that xrp could very well be a security and even advice to consult with the sec about it and they didn't do that and then instead can you know went on to make 1.38 billion dollars in sales fraud is very very hard to prove yeah uh because it requires what's called sienter uh the sienter standard under securities law fraud is a little weaker than under common law fraud but there is still this element of an intention to deceive uh and there is in the you know there's also a class action securities lawsuit against ripple going on concurrently with this and in that suit there is a fraud there were a number of fraud causes of action uh and a couple of them survived uh the initial motion for dismissal or why at least one did um so so there was some possibility of bringing a fraud claim but it's just much harder and i think you know the sec has close to a slam dunk on the registration claims so why would it muddy the waters uh by bringing a weaker claim when it doesn't really have to yeah and it can achieve the same thing uh by making a control person claim you still have to prove i think it's clear and convincing evidence so you still have to prove some intent uh but you know one of the things getting back to the the most uh the most fraud-like non-fraud claim according this is these are all allegations i just want to remind people who are watching or listening but the sec alleges that garlinghouse repeatedly said that he was quote very long xrp meaning he had significant positions expected to rise in value without disclosing the fact that he was selling and gabe can speak more to how this works in the public securities context but typically there are some restrictions on what you can do in terms of selling uh securities if you are uh management and you have inside information and um i think that's where it's all about it's about information asymmetry go ahead gabe that's right yeah in the you know if if ripple labs was a public company you know uh that is if it was complying with the exchange act uh and if xrp was a security then whenever brad garlinghouse sold at his own xrp there would have to be something called a section 16b report sorry a section 16 report filed uh with the sec for the entire public to see that reports those transactions and that's the case whenever you know if tim cook of apple sells this apple stock he's filing those and so on and that's a very important piece of disclosure because it puts the market on notice uh you know that that the executives are selling which could impact the market or could indicate that they have some extra information that the market doesn't have now in addition to that they're also blackout periods where they're not allowed to sell right um so so they have a limited window to sell when they ought to have the same information as the public basically because the company has just recently filed one of its periodic reports and they have to do the disclosure on top of that um you know and and there are other limits as well uh and so all of those protections uh that a typical investor in a typical security would have uh xrp holders were deprived of uh and so if xrp is a security uh you can see how they really lose out relatively speaking by by not having this disclosure because they did have the disclosure they could time their own bison cells in a more advantageous way unless a very tangible example of how that might or might not be important so sec investigations are confidential i don't believe that it was publicly disclosed that there was an ongoing investigation um towards the close of an investigation um there's uh you have the ability in uh something called a wells act response you have the ability to persuade the sec in a letter that you know the svc will come to you and say we've finished our investigation we think we're going to chart we're going to charge you you can let us know why we shouldn't so that all happened behind the scenes um ripple and the executives knew that was going on at around the time they were drafting their wells letter their response to the sec xrp went up to i think 70 cents in price so there was a huge spike in price and then uh when the information came about the sec lawsuit so basically ripple said the day before uh the lawsuit was filed they said you know they were going to be sued the price tanked so they knew for the last two years that they were under investigation they also knew that they had been told by i think in two different memos by law firms that xrp was probably security and the general public did not know about that now if i had bought xrp at 60 or 70 cents it's trading now at 27 cents which is peculiar to me i'm not sure why i think i'd be kind of pissed off as opposed to zero yeah exactly so you know yes yeah well i mean speaking about a kind of like uh asymmetry of information there i mean so okay first of all people really should read the sec's lawsuit because yes i understand it's 70 pages but you can like skim that you know you can kind of figure out which parts you can skip and which parts you can read so it's not actually 70 pages um but the point is so there's just so much in here it's literally like a 70 page list of all the ways in which ripple itself kind of like made itself guilty and yeah i mean it's really a doozy frankly but one of the many many anecdotes that they have in here is one in which ripple was having conversations with a big market maker and um ripple was like freely talking about how it wanted to sell xrp timed to some of ripple's big announcements and so ripple's vp of finance told the market maker and so here i'm going to quote from the sec lawsuit ripple would like to go to sales at one percent of trading volume and ask the market maker to quote be thoughtful slash opportunistic around the timing of implementing one percent because rebel did not want to quote depress the rally but rather capitalize on the additional volume so it's like literally they're literally saying like we want to make money when the news hits so be sure to sell when all the retail people are going to be buying on our news and so it was pretty um there's so many eye-opening moments like that um also example of paying for listings on exchanges so yeah it's um it's hard to see i mean they have very very fine lawyers uh who are defending them ripple yeah ripple does uh they're represented by really good lawyers who specialize in defending securities lawsuits and enforcement actions and class actions but i just don't see how you honestly how you win i mean i guess what is their game there's a limitations argument perhaps what are the arguments that that can be made i know that one of the things that they said and i think the arg i think the arguments they'll have to focus on are things relating to cryptocurrency and you know you know the fact that the you know the the howie precedents don't squarely address so i think their arguments will be very policy based yeah that's right one of the things they've argued that for example that um xrp is currency and therefore it can't be a security which is i don't think is is accurate that was an argument that was raised in either the kick or i think that was the the same argument was made in the kid case and the judge um found that that was um was not persuaded so there's that i know they argue that they were going to go to the supreme court and there would be the ripple case instead of the howie case i think that that's uh someone's uh huffing their own supply it seems unlikely i'm sorry go ahead all right well let's um actually just because maybe not all listeners will know how a security is defined um especially if there are new people because as we all know crypto is coming up so let's just talk about how is the security defined in the us and then if you could walk through how you think or or how the sec makes its case that ripple's actions with xrp do fit that definition gabe why don't you take this sure uh so yeah the term security is actually defined under a few different laws but aside from very subtle variations they're mostly the same so under the securities act of 1933 which was the first major federal securities law uh you know the it includes a long list of things such as stock such as evidences of indebtedness and so on among those things is the term investment contract and investment contract is the one among that list that the sec and others have most focused on as a theory for uh how tokens or token transactions or token offerings uh can constitute securities or securities offerings or securities transactions and the uh the principal test for whether an investment contract exists is called the howie test it's uh the name of a supreme court case involving orange groves and the test is quite simple it basically says that uh an investment contract is a contract transaction or scheme uh in which there is an investment of money with the reasonable ex in a common enterprise with the reasonable expectation of profits from others so they're essentially four elements um and that test has been further interpreted over time so for example investment of money doesn't just mean giving money it can also mean other forms of value or benefit that someone contributes uh to the issuer you know so essentially what the sec is saying is ripple created this in effect or in any event they had a lot of it they were selling it and when people were buying it the re they were buying it because this company ripple exists the company was saying hey we have all these great products that we're going to put in place with banks for commercial deals and those products are going to use xrp uh the cryptocurrency and the and that blockchain and uh as a result of that there's going to be a lot of demand for xrp and therefore the price will go up because this will essentially become the new de facto universal interbank uh uh settlement method um which is a great thesis but the problem with that thesis is that without ripple there to supply these other technologies and do the deals with the banks that xrp wouldn't have that value proposition and probably a lot less people would buy it and they would spend a lot less money on it and so that's that's the basic thesis of the sec's arguments in addition to that the sec didn't really get into this heavily in the complaint although it's hinted at shortly before the um the lawsuit was filed there was a report from several computer scientists at the university of bern where they basically analyze that the blockchain itself the technology is centralized uh because although you know ripple labs claims that its list of trusted nodes is just sort of optional it turns out if you don't follow exactly that list you know the blockchain just wouldn't be secure or it wouldn't be live and so it's also centralized in that way and that's another distinction from you know cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether yeah i mean you know the sec really hammers home that uh ripple was the one that was responsible for whether or not xrp was successful and that they themselves uh kind of made that case for the sec i mean there's just so many choice quotes here what are some of the good ones you know oh and not only that but like ripple keeps talking about how they're so they have this asset but then after having the asset then they try to develop a use for it um which again it's like that's if it were uh the tail whacking the dog yes exactly one of the i mean the problem with twitter i mean i say this is a litigator it's a benefit if you're if you handle disputes is that it's like it's such easy evidence everything is there so paragraph 47 of the complaint uh the sec says is cryptographer number one who i believe actually somebody um it's a schwartz i actually think he made his david schwartz david schwartz actually changed his twitter handle to cryptographer number one so as cryptographer number one a well well respected and known ripple spokesperson stated in a recent tweet on twitter uh quote the people who created xrp are pretty much the same as the people who created ripple and they created ripple originally too among other things distribute xrp i mean you have to like you have to back up from a second to think about how this is going to be resolved just imagine a federal judge who's got a big dock and it handles all kinds of cases criminal and civil commercial disputes whatever this is not a person who's like deep in the weeds in crypto they're not like the universe closes it becomes more narrow when you're in litigation i think if you read that if that proves to be true it's very difficult to take statements like that and that that statement is probably there's um an evidentiary theory basically that that that statement is probably attributable to ripple as what's known as a party opponent's statement uh in other words it probably can be said that that statement made by the the sec will argue that that statement made by somebody very high up in ripple is attributable to them so if that's if that's a statement that ripple made statement after statement like that from uh being read by a federal judge it makes it very hard to see how this wasn't something other than a centralized money-making proposition now being a centralized money-making proposition doesn't make you a security necessarily it doesn't make you an investment contract necessarily but it's sort of it becomes uh evidence of that it's sort of indicia of that because you have to look through this and ask what was the purpose of this thing other than to be a speculative asset it doesn't really add up yeah there's a number of these choice quotes i'm not going to listen but there was another one again it's cryptographer one who explained in xrp chat in response to the question if ripple failed uh would xrp die and he said that he didn't think he didn't quote think it's likely xrp would succeed without us though it's possible so um yeah then there's just so many but so one thing then i also wanted to break down is so we did talk a little bit about um the cases against chris larson and brad garlinghouse but in this case you know what what do you think of the sec's evidence and how likely is it that they'll you know be held responsible in some way as well so this is a prediction and i guess i could be wrong i have to hedge because i'm a lawyer uh ripple's gonna lose carlinghouse and larson are gonna lose this will they'll monkey around they'll file motions to dismiss they'll be denied it probably gets they probably do some discovery maybe they take some depositions presumably in the enforcement action uh they took depositions so that depositions for people not familiar with uh the way uh litigation works in the united states those are statements under oath the examinations of witnesses and um they will probably uh file cross motions for summary judgment um and they're gonna lose i'm i am unless there is a limitations argument or unless the judge unless they get a sympathetic judge who reads through this and is convinced that this was not an ongoing securities offering they lose and they probably settle now obviously if i had inside information about the litigation i wouldn't be talking to you but it seems like a reasonable way for this to be resolved is you i don't know they got 600 million so maybe they pay 550 to the government they keep 50 um and if something called a fair fund is set up and people can basically get uh reimbursed uh for the cost of their xrp it's the case should it's it sounds like it was they were talking settlement you can kind of see that um you you have there's that um i think they actually talked about that publicly on twitter i think the case ultimately has to be settled i don't see it going up to the supreme court if they take it up to the ninth circuit they probably lose i don't see the supreme court taking cert on this because think about it too like does anybody really care about these guys who made 600 million dollars selling this digital asset it's not like if i were going to take a case to change the law and to change how we look at um at digital assets um this isn't the one that i would take because they're not sympathetic now we haven't seen their answer their motion to dismiss but what about the remedy yeah go ahead kid what about the remedy though stephen i mean what about what about the interests of the xrp holders i do i do wonder about this and sort of worry about it sure um grundfest uh you know who's a former actor that's right uh who's a former sec commissioner himself and now teaches law at stanford has talked a lot about uh token stuff and is no no pro token guy you know you can find his videos on youtube at one point arguing that bitcoin is a security you know which is the one thing that everyone now agrees is not a security he wrote a letter to the sec you know now he's an advisor to the unpaid advisor to ripple but he's a credible guy he doesn't you know just do things and and he expressed a concern like well this is really really harming xrp holders um you know who are supposedly the victims in all this and so part of me does wonder i mean it's a satisfactory remedy here to just destroy all of this and and and compensate people how could you ever compensate people so many people have bought and sold this you know and you know many won't want to kyc themselves so personally you know what i would think is a much more reasonable remedy uh is that ripple becomes an exchange act reporter um you know i'm sorry an exchange way an exchange act reporter basically an sec reporting reporting like apple or like any other public company um and then xrp holders would get the disclosure that investors would be able to right so if that happened but then i think that kills xrp right it might yeah i mean that might still but they might be able to find ways to generate value for it but yeah it's it's stuff it kills the utility of it also where would you trade it i know that coinbase has a they've got a broker dealer but i don't think they've been given the green light to use it none of the exchanges broker dealers are these things are going to emerge these things right these things are going to emerge i mean i think it's inevitable that many of these tokens will be securities right so this issue has to be happen you know it has to be faced at some point anyway right you're right you know there will be challenges to keeping it valuable or maybe finding some new utility for it as a potential security but is it is completely destroying it for sure really better than giving it some fighting chance i mean most of the xrp holders you see them on twitter they're actually not mad i mean they have every right to be mad but they're the only thing they're mad at is the sec right and they see ripple as the victim so they clearly want this to go on um so maybe let it go on and just make ripple labs over an exchange act reporting company would that really be so bad i don't know yeah i mean i think then you know ripple the company like so the sec really makes a strong case that ripple didn't really have much by way of revenue except from selling xrp and so their big cash cow would be killed and so i have a feeling ripple wouldn't be super excited about making xrp a security because then they you know it's like then they they cut off their um big flow of cash that uh has been coming their way 1.38 billion dollars worth um but one other thing actually before we go to a break that i just want to ask quickly stephen when you said you thought what was most likely is that they would have to discourage 550 million and they keep 50 million why would they even keep 50 million like that's a huge well i'm not i don't know if that's likely or not what i'm what i'm thinking is if i were the defendants in the end if you are pushed to settle so fine maybe once you have that much money 50 million dollars doesn't seem like very much but right if there's a way i know of other cases where people disgorged a significant amount but we're also able to keep a significant amount keep it keep in mind as well you know ripple's fighting a multi-front battle yeah that's right because it has the class action yeah it has this case against the sec and now it's equity investment yeah that's what's doing it arguing that you know they're they're allowed to that ripple's required to redeem their stock now at the investment amount um and so some of the and it probably has creditors it probably has commercial partners yeah it has employees right they wrote salaries so yeah i mean there are a lot of going to be a lot of people with their hands out here and most likely this will be a total disaster yeah okay i don't know maybe we should explain what that lawsuit is by their investors gabe do you want to talk about that well let's do that right after this break so we're first we're going to take a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible one inch is a decentralized

saying we're going to talk about the tetragon case against um ripple they were the lead investor in ripple's most recent fundraising round so what is going on there yeah so there's not a lot of detail because the complaint has been filed confidentially in the delaware court of chancery which is the biggest corporate law court in the world the most prestigious the best all those things because ripple labs is a delaware corporation uh but what one can infer from the press reports uh is that ripple has in its certificate of incorporation uh and other investment documents from its last preferred stock financing a provision that says that if xrp says something like if xrp is found to be a security then ripple is required to redeem uh the preferred stock at presumably its original investment amount or something very close basically they've got to pay the money back that they're investing that's right exactly exactly and what uh what ripple said was well there hasn't actually been a finding that xrp is a security and we don't have the investment docs we don't know what they say uh but that's what they're fighting about and to gabe's point they're probably other people out there too i mean it's interesting i don't know how typical is a covenant like that in a in financing documents game i i guess you'd only have that that that's well i have redemption i mean redemption provisions are common sure but not tied to some regulatory finding and it shows that everyone knew for a long time that's a real tangible risk yeah so i know even just knowing that that clause was in there i was like if i were an investor and i was able to sign a contract with this class in it i would be like ding ding ding maybe i shouldn't sign this contract maybe this is not a good investment to make that was just my opinion but maybe i would be a very conservative well i was going to say a bad investor but maybe i'd actually be a good investor people people wanted big returns and uh you know they were willing to it's actually the opposite i mean if you can if you can get that deal yeah you and and you know it's ripple ripple has a lot of money ripple had a lot of money back then you know it's going to keep selling these things it's almost like a risk-free investment um you know so far from being a red flag i i bet the investors were more like going katrin you know you know as we win tails we until they lose you know what i mean so yeah i see yeah that is true um but it is kind of funny everybody seemed to know well so um just while we're also talking about you know kind of like other entities that are affected by this i was just curious because you know as you're reading through the lawsuit um the sec just keeps mentioning all these other entities and um you know i mentioned earlier this market maker that uh you know they were emailing about the timing of this the selling to you know time it to announcements so they could make uh the most money from from those announcements um but i was just wondering like do you think would any of these other actors that are named in it be affected in any way like would the sec you know i don't know go after them or i'm not sure how this works but could it affect any of them or any of the exchanges that are now delisting xrp or anything like that well i mean one you know that just to your last point right one interesting factor here is that coinbase you know just filed for its ipo uh a week or two before this uh xrp lawsuit and one wonders a little bit about the timing of that of that of the of the lawsuit in light of that and you know coinbase has suspended xrp from trading but the the sec has a lot of leverage over a company that is looking to ipo because in order for a company to ipo the sec has to approve its s1 or also called its registration statement that registers the shares the sec is very broad discretion in the reasons why it can deny that approval and so the sec can use that process as leverage against coinbase either to get coinbase to atone for its past sins or to have tighter controls that it won't repeat them and so on and you know obviously if xrp is found to be a security uh you know that'll that'll make it even easier for the sec to do that on the other hand in all these past cases like the telegram case for example was really all about underwriting concerns uh you know that the investors were acting as underwriters and none of those investors were registered as underwriters and yet doesn't seem like the sec is going after any of the investors under underwriting theories so what they do tend to do is they tend to rack up a win and once they've won they they tend to move on to other things uh one might call that unfair uh in some ways um or you know and perhaps it's not even a smart enforcement strategy because if if the money is sort of you know never suffering the consequences it'll just keep flowing into the same types of schemes but in the past they haven't really gone after these ancillary players yeah i mean there is that lawsuit against coinbase although i did see stephen you tweeted that you didn't think it was serious or well done um but it is true that there are a lot of companies that made money off of trading xrp even as like i would say you know some huge percentage of people in the industry thought xrp was a security we've thought that for years um you know like i remember when i first learned about the howie test it just as i really learned about i kept thinking how is so if if all these things are what makes a security then how is xrp not a security um and you know there have been like a ton of articles you know people have written about this forever so given that most people were of that opinion um how like do you think that the sec is just gonna be like oh well it's just too much to go after all these people that were making money off of what they knew was probably you know just gonna be a short fun free ride um i can't speak to um who else the sec might or might not go after but i think you know that as far as i know there's only one exchange in the united states where xrp can still be bought and sold i guess i'd be surprised if they went after exchanges so the issue is if something is a security you need to either be a registered as a broker dealer you need to be a national exchange or um you have to have appropriate registration and none of these exchanges did and presumably i mean i i know that some companies um looked at the lawsuit and just immediately said no and delisted but others may have been in touch with the sec i'd be surprised if there was um if there was there were follow-on enforcement actions by the sec against exchanges i don't know gabe what do you think uh other other than maybe this coinbase thing where would be very easy for them to do something because coinbase is at their mercy for the ipo yeah i agree i agree yeah i think what was interesting to me was that so coinbase is suspending trading in xrp the day that this episode comes out tuesday january 19th and so i actually thought because their reputation is of or it used to be at least of being kind of the conservative exchange and very regulatory compliant and because of the fact that it's going public i would have thought that they would have delisted much sooner um so yeah i i found that a little curious it's complicated because um when you you have to give people time to get their assets off the exchange i don't know if they're still doing buy sell but uh if they are maybe you have to give people the opportunity to did they shut off the money so tuesday is when that yeah it seems like you have to balance between you've got to bounce between uh skill and and charibitus basically you sort of damned if you do damned if you don't but i i think it's it's fair and reasonable to give retail consumers the ability to cash out or move their stuff and you know maybe somebody hasn't logged in for a while they don't check their email right away there are plenty of people who don't check this on a daily basis having a couple of weeks to give people the opportunity to move their assets off of the exchange i think makes sense and i'm not sure i mean i don't know that the sec would be too upset about that so one thing that i want to go back to is so we talked at a few points about ripples wells submission so can one of you describe um what ripple's arguments were in the well submission i think one argument was i i to be candid i haven't looked at i actually haven't looked at the wall submission in a little while but uh one was the argument that kik made which was that uh it's uh it's currency uh and therefore can't be security uh they also argued that uh they've been selling it for a long time and the sec never complained and there's almost like in a stop sort of a regulatory estoppel argument but you know the parallel argument to that is look i've been going into like i've been robbing the bank every day i've been ripping off this atm every day for the last you know five years and the police car drives by and they never say anything i'm not sure that that's a terribly it's not a really persuasive argument there is this there is a theory in law called regulatory estoppel by which you can uh yeah i don't even know what that means is scuffle estoppel it's an equitable theory it's basically the notion that you can prevent someone from taking a position because you relied on uh them doing something else or saying something else it's nearly impossible to make that argument in the united states that are because of because a regulator did or didn't do something um and you relied on them that uh they're stopped or basically stopped prevent it from taking action going forward so yeah there was nothing in their letter that i was terribly persuaded by but it's been a while since i've read it and i don't i don't know that the full letter was actually published i think they probably just said it's like that's right they publish an outline summary that's correct that's right that's yeah and they you know there were a lot of uh i'm just you know refreshing my memory now a lot of it was about how useful xrp is you know without without ripple and stuff which is just not true right because again ripple pays almost every node on its trusted list they're almost all paid by ripple they're a bunch of universities ripple commercial partners companies that ripple have invested in there's only one that claims to be independent right and so i i think if ripple goes away i just don't know how this even even the technology itself would safely function going back to the well submission um the one part of the summary that um i saw some people tweeting about and that really struck me as a really bad argument frankly was that if the s if the sec finds xrp to be a security then quote innovation in the cryptocurrency industry will be fully seated to china i mean yes i remember that that's just that's a crazy crazy argument but let me finish the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains are highly susceptible to chinese control because both are subject to simple majority rule who's a little bit like okay if this is your argument i'm not sure especially considering the caliber of lawyers they have it's it's shocking that you know that that would be their argument yeah and especially because the sec has already deemed that bitcoin and ether are not securities so to rely on that it just was like okay if you're gonna you know try like can make a good attempt here like why did you go down this path um because but anyway okay when the uh you just like there's a saying that the lawyers have which you've probably heard uh when you have bad when you uh the facts aren't on your side you pound on the law when the law is not on your side you pound on the facts when neither the law or the facts are on your side you pound on the table so that's basically what they're doing here the law and the facts are bad and uh the best warriors in the world people have a mistaken understanding of what lawyers can do um gabe and i are both very good i would say among the best but you know like if you caught on video robbing a liquor store you know i couldn't argue that you you had a troubled childhood i actually had a case that reminds me when i was in law school i i clerked for the i cleared for the public defender this was a pd case uh and we actually had a client who was in fact caught on video robbing a liquor store and he wanted to go to trial and we were like but the video shows you that's you he's like it's not me it's like it's you so it's kind of like so we actually we tried that case and he lost but he got to be out of out of jail for a couple days so it's kind of like sometimes people there's an epidemic of this type of behavior in our society right now i feel like well i i actually i think that they may believe this right i think they may have like oh wait ripple yeah no i i don't i i think that ripple and uh mr garlingham they believe that china will control the i think they believe that they have created some sort of revolutionary technology i think they probably believe at this point that it's not a security and that they're being unfairly targeted and the law should change so like i i think that they um i think that they actually probably believe this so just it's preposterous and but if you tell yourself a story for long enough you know sometimes you believe it that's i'm just a simple country lawyer yeah no there definitely was a lot of cognitive dissonance in the sec's uh lawsuit like just i mean like i said it's literally just quote after quote you know i mean it's yeah it's it's a pretty damning document but it's very interesting because even while brad was saying things like oh i'm extremely long xrp i mean he was selling it but not disclosing it making tons of money off of retail investors so you know i don't know him personally i've never met him but for him to keep saying that he's extremely long xrp meanwhile he's doing all these sales uh behind you know people's back i mean it's a little bit like okay either you you know just sort of lived with that cognitive dissonance and didn't recognize it as such or you you know i mean i'm not going to speculate what was going on in his head but i think i would also say so just to be devil's advocate here somebody else pointed this out uh cameron was talking to but um one uh you know one of the allegations is that okay one of the things that the svc puts out there is being problematic is that ripple was paying people to use xrp and it is true that that is a that is not an unusual silicon valley play to get adoption paypal did that i think stripe did that so paying people to use your product or use your service is something that other companies have done so maybe that's something that we'll hear them come back with so for example in paragraph 123. but yeah i mean like well just but to use paypal or to you know use stripe or whatever like that doing that isn't engaging in um some kind of unregistered securities offerings yeah yeah so right when you used i i can't i can't remember what it was but i think when paypal first came into use i think people were paid was it five dollars i think it was ten dollars if they got so we did also reference a little bit some of the other big sec enforcement actions in the cryptocurrency industry i think the ones probably that are most relevant for this case are kik kin as we mentioned maybe eos simply because that was one that a lot of people were you know thought it was pretty egregious because it was a year-long ico um they i think they claimed to block u.s investors but then they had that big advertisement in times square and then and then of course telegram so when you look at those like if you were to read the tea leaves how do you think i mean i know stephen you want to give your opinion but but just in that context oh this is like uh this is more like kick or telegram oh it is yeah yeah so like with eos whatever you think about the technology or the company the folks involved they settled and also it according to the i think it's the consent agreement the consent order they really actually did try and block u.s persons i know they had that sign in times square it was stupid uh but they did do some form of geo-blocking they did actually try and block people neos they paid 24 million dollars and they uh you know they they settled and um you know they they took it i think the other difference is that kik and telegram were companies that existed before they tried to um do this token and ripple in a way so ripple was actually wait how does it go it was a little bit different where the company was incorporated after but the it's similar in that the company was just so closely associated with the cryptocurrency and obviously they he have you know what is that 55 percent of yeah right i mean kik had a social media app right um and i i and you know telegram um is used by uh 500 million people to communicate i mean they're real they are real enterprises um that have real users that do real things and you know here it's it i'm sure ripple would say look we have enterprise software that's used by you know oscars at banks i'm not sure that i'm not sure how much traction they're going to get it does seem like at least if you read this complaint the principal purpose of the company was to get people to buy and sell xrp and to create market value great liquidity and that that was not the principal purpose of of of telegram or of cake they didn't come into existence to uh sell a cryptocurrency right um so stephen you did talk about how you think this case well go gabriel do you have any um you know thoughts on what you think yeah i basically agree with stephen i i mean i think ripple will lose i'm a little bit i would say i'm less certain that garling house uh um you know that the founders will will have first end up having personal liability we'll have to see about that yeah but certainly ripple ripple will lose in my mind um and i'm more just curious about what the remedy will end up being because you know in the case of kick and kin right they lost but they really it you know now like ken is still out there and actually like kind holders were very happy with the outcome right no one was forced to become an sec reporting company they did you know they had to pay a fine right but they were left with some money like steven was talking about and you know it's gone up it's actually gone up since the lawsuit uh you know it's gone up in price since the lawsuit because no longer has this cloud hanging over it that the you know worried that that kin itself is a security for telegram on the other hand it was completely disastrous right i mean telegram has as steven was saying it has a real app and so it'll be fine you know it has money but it had to give all the investment back now it's raising a debt financing round and all of the value and time and opportunity cost that it put into this technology was a complete loss they were just enjoined from doing it flat out um and so that's a huge loss uh that's like a total wipeout you know of of that part of their business history um and and and then with with block one you know it's kind of interesting right they're a little bit of a combination right you know they had much better lawyers i would say much better deal lawyers yeah um you know because they the way they documented their thing just gave them much stronger arguments that they were producing software that they walked away from it once it was done and eos is kind of a self-sustaining thing you could say it's a bad blockchain because it has collusion and all that stuff but it's not block one doing the collusion if anything you could fault you know morally fault block one because it's just not doing anything to like increase the value of that ecosystem or not doing that much um so they're they're all very different um you know and i think the real thing that they all have in common is that a lot of ordinary people bought the token hoping to get rich um uh and in circumstances where they don't have all the information and where they're highly dependent and vulnerable upon other people who also are trying to get rich off of it but in a different asymmetrical way and and that's what all these things have in common despite the apparent differences and that's why the howie test is kind of a genius test because it's it's very functionalistic and it's designed to capture this dynamic where people are vulnerable with their money and investment expectations in a particular way and they all have that in common and that again i mean going back to what we said at the beginning that information asymmetry is one of the principal reasons for our securities laws to make sure that investors are if not on parity or equal terms with insiders they at least get they have a guarantee of some quality information so that they're not taken advantage of and you can tell that that's that's one of the principal purposes or one of the principal themes in this lawsuit by the sec yeah i mean and they really make that case that you know the insiders knew certain things and were making money off of the fact that uh the people they were selling to didn't know those things um so gabriel something that interested me about what you just said is that you thought that there was a chance that like xrp survives and then that would be good for xrp holders and i did see like you know for instance japan's uh financial authority i think said that xrp is not a security so i did wonder like so what happens in that case if the us does so either one either that um you know like you said somehow something happens to ripple but xrp survives or if the us just determines that x that xrp is a security but other countries make a judgment like different judgment how would that affect xrp well in the in the second set of facts you mentioned i mean i'm just speculating here right but you know people are pretty creative right especially if they have a fair amount of money right uh or the ability to get more money and certainly ripple has a lot of fans uh the you know one thing they could do is just try to it's already you know in my opinion a centralized chain they can just add kyc to it right uh you know and they could just really try hard to exclude us persons get cozy with some other regulator that says it's not a security and keep trying to do their thing with the us just almost totally blacked out that's a possibility i suppose if they have enough money left over and so on um you know another thing that maybe they could do although you know i i agree that this is probably might be more even more challenging you know is to embrace that xrp as a security or embrace that certain transactions in xrp are securities uh and and to kind of keep doing their thing maybe find some alternative uses for xrp that don't involve banks because banks aren't going to want to settle all their ordinary transfers in a security but maybe they could come up with some stuff i mean tokens people are good at coming up with ideas of stuff to do with tokens that sound good to people and maybe they could become an exchange act reporter and they could just openly put forth efforts to drive value to this token right um one of the ongoing metaphysical issues right and i've had debates with another lawyer named lewis cohen about this is what is the security right is it this token uh is it always a security or is it only certain transactions in it which are security and so on and um you know the sec's complaint fudges that a little bit you know it does call xrp a security but on the other hand you know it's really talking about these times when ripple or garlic house sold it right um and so it's possible that a judge could craft a remedy that you know says well this is a security or transactions in it are securities in certain circumstances and not others and you know ripple you become an exchange act reporter so everyone has the information but you know and and when you sell it it's a securities transaction but when it's in the secondary market it's not something like that is possible um so we have to see you know i i'd be interested to see what the remedy ends up being because the judge ought to care about the xrp holders you know in my opinion right and he ought to try to do the least harm to them possible so the question there is who is who's going to make i guess the people who will make that argument will be uh ripple's lawyers um yeah at the remedy stage at the remedy stage but i mean obviously out of self-interest in minimizing harm to their own so the sec response will be yeah right you you don't care about them you're just you're you're arguing out of self-interest but yeah no i think that's a fair point interesting i yeah i don't it strikes me as like incredibly complicated to say oh it's a security in certain transactions but not in others it's incredibly complicated but but does that exist is there another a digital or any other asset that security for certain transactions but there are other tokens i mean this flavor of thing is something that's been embraced by some securities lawyers and to a certain extent by the uh by the sec itself uh this this more functionalistic interpretation um you know where a given thing could be a security and out of that i talked about gruntfest earlier uh i would take him to be sort of the leading proponent of this in the way that he talks about tokens that certain transactions in bitcoin the argument is that it's not so we have to parse security and say we're talking about an investment contract and well that's lewis is that's lewis's thing right there is an example right because uh one token the stacks token from block stack they did an actual reg a plus offering for their token um and that means that they qualified it as a securities offering um and they the sec asked them a lot of questions as part of that one of the questions they asked for example is well does the fact that you're holding a bunch of stacks tokens um that you're later gonna sell right does that mean you're an investment company or something like that or does the fact that you are um that some of the tokens are being burned right um at the same time as you're selling them right does that mean you're buying and selling your own securities at the same time which can be a violation of regulations and they made a lot of nuanced arguments that are very functionalistic about well when it's here when we hold it in this circumstance it's not a security when it's being burned that's not a securities transaction for this other reason even though the issuance is being treated as a securities transaction and and personally although yes it's complex and nuanced i actually think that type of thing makes a heck of a lot of sense um so uh the you know because sometimes the securities laws just aren't implicated in a particular transaction and you don't need to be so essentialist and literal about it but we'll see yeah no i mean and i think uh the argument that i think you were going to say that lewis makes is that and this is lewis cohen who is a very fine securities lawyer uh in new york practices a firm called dlx law the argument is in order for these tokens to fall within the definition of security we have to consider whether or not they are part of an investment contract and i think he would distinguish between the transaction which involves a contract and the asset itself so he would say sure like when ripple buys and sells it it is part of an investment that transaction is an investment contract that covers this asset but the asset itself is not an investment contract and so therefore it's not a security i mean whether or not a judge buys that argument there's maybe something to that that it's um from the standpoint of kind of getting a good result for uh retail investors you can see that argument uh having some suition well i i mean i think it's just where i disagree with louis though right is that when the retail investors are buying it that's the time it's most like a security right you know he thinks that's when it's least like us but for example if banks were trading it amongst themselves right as a form of settlement i mean the reason why they're doing it is actually not why the banks are would be trading no there's nothing to invest in it and so maybe you could treat the retail ones as a securities transaction make ripple labs a securities reporter but when the banks are trading it that's not a securities transaction because they're just using it as like a monetary equivalent i don't you know i probably won't go there but i'm just saying that if someone were inclined to be creative and fashionable they're they're pa doctrinally coherent possibilities yeah even just listening to that right now i'm a little bit like implementing that is going to be such a headache nobody's i can't imagine somebody actually like this is what should happen it's like way too complicated right you know so um all right well so we've covered a lot of things here um but i guess just so to sum up both of you think what's most likely to happen is there's gonna be some kind of settlement and ripple and the executives will disgorge but maybe not everything because there are other sharks circling the waters and they need to be paid to is that kind of what you think is most likely to happen i think i think they monkey around with this litigation for a year maybe uh they have some motion practice i think ripple um and i i actually agree with gabe it's um so the the securities act violation is uh strict liability there's no santa requirement uh if the security have to register it has to be exempt there is an intent requirement for garlinghouse and larson for the control act claims so those are harder to prove i i think it's more likely than not they lose on motion practice there too just based on this very detailed complaint and then maybe it goes up to the ninth grade they lose meaning meaning chris him for at least as you see i i think so it may go up to the ninth circuit uh but it settles at some point i doubt that um i doubt that the supreme court takes it on cert so it's just a matter of time and expense and these things like the litigation cost to get through a year of litigation complex discovery and motion practice five to ten million dollars probably uh is a good it's a good estimate okay so the last question before we um say goodbye on this super fascinating case is you know xrb has been um around like the third or fourth largest cryptocurrency for quite a long time and um you know it's it's quite well known especially when there's a bubble you know i think a lot of us in the industry hear from like people outside the crypto world like what about xrp um so obviously this case is going to have huge implications like you know as big as eos or kik or telegram we're like they're just not anywhere near the level of something like xrp because of where xrp has been in the crypto uh rankings for such a long time so once this case uh is decided however it's decided what do you think the implications are for the wider crypto world um you know to what ripple ripple effects do you think it will have you're not good fair enough that's a you know it's a tough question that's i think that's why any of us i i think it's very hard to say i mean in many way the way it has worked so far this is what i'll say is that every time one of these cases gets decided everyone in the ecosystem seems to very quickly become confident that the distinctions between their circumstances and the decided circumstance are just very very different and the case means nothing yeah um i i struggle with this a lot as a transactional lawyer because you know part of my job in negotiating some of these deals is convincing people to do certain things in order to have a better regulatory treatment of a token and you know i will do something like point to the telegram case and you know what i found is that in many cases some of the people around the table are just very very convinced that it is completely different right and that it has no implications to the current circumstance and i i just think the power of the industry to engage in self-denial and also to engage in proactive things you know what some call decentralization theater or these maneuverings to try to make each new circumstance look as different as possible from the last it's just part of the culture at this point and so i don't think it will immediately have some big dramatic effect that changes a lot of people's behavior i think there would have to be a lot more blood in the water uh before something like that happens i kind of tend to agree i mean i find the same thing somebody will propose something and you know we'll point out telegram and kick and they'll tell us all the reasons why it's different um and unfortunately there are lawyers out there who will um give people the advice uh give people the opinions that they want to hear that uh that perpetuates this sometimes one of the really interesting things actually about this complaint one of the most interesting things to me is that it cites the opinions that the lawyers gave uh back in the day i'm really curious how they got that yeah i tend to agree with game i don't think it will be um it's just another case you know we've seen over and over again um you know the law is pretty clear and this is another case where i think the conclusion is somewhat inevitable and i think people will continue to believe what they want to believe but their own peril yeah actually just ask one last question about what you were saying about how did they get that information about the uh opinions given by the lawyers back in hall the way in 2012 you know you were saying that they've been under investigation for two years so i'm assuming is that where most of the information came from in the lawsuit so but you know legal opinions the lawyers provider are confidential and privileged and they would not typically be something that you have to disclose now it could be that they relied on an advice of council defense which seems silly given the fact that this advice um was contrary to um what they ended up doing but unless there was a waiver of some kind or unless like a third party turn it over typically no you wouldn't get those you would not get a privileged legal memorandum i don't think you could hold it back interesting well i have my own theories but um anyway they're just theories okay well where can people learn more about each of you and your work uh you can follow me on twitter stephen depaly and i am uh bestpaliedandersonkill.com and i've got a very fancy and impressive buy on my law firm website that i don't know who wrote abraham i'm i'm lex node lex underscore n-o-d-e on twitter uh and i have a website uh i think it's called deal ninja.law anyway it's like it's linked on my twitter bio i have like all my writings and stuff up there and i have a sub stack um so yeah yeah i i i never stopped talking so you could definitely you have a subscribe man you're very cool i try i'm a little tardy on it to be honest with you about that i think i'm too late i think sub stack is kind of like tick tock for me i just don't think i'm cool enough steven i
