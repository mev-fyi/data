regulation and to monitor compliance today's guest is Rebecca Redick partner at Fisher boyle's welcome Rebecca thanks so much for having me Laura so there was kind of big news this week on an ongoing saga that a lot of people are watching which is the SEC versus kik case what happened so this week kik filed what's called an answer to the FCC's complaint where they set out not only their responses to what the SEC alleged but in sort of unusual move they also took the opportunity to really lay out their version of the facts and their side of the story this approach while pretty unconventional and traditional education isn't really a surprise here because when the SEC originally filed their complaint kick said this isn't the full story and we want to have our chance to get it out there and so with this answer they really have tried to do that and what were the main points have Kix answers so I think they had a few different themes I think that their first theme was obviously there was a big distinction between their saff sale and their TDE as they called it or their sale to the public I think other people have referred to their TV as an ICO as everyone was calling them back in 2017 and 2018 yeah and TD e stands for token distribution event for exactly I don't know that yeah and the other big theme they really impressed was that the SEC was taking a lot of their statements and other statements whether it be from their consultants their board members other individuals who were involved with kik at the time they were taking those statements out of context and cherry-picking the worst part of the statements and putting them in the complaint really tried to up how bad kicked conduct was and they took this opportunity to give the full context for those statements and really try to put them in context and they also I think in the process really tried to take the SEC to task they had said the SEC conducted this very long investigation prior to filing the complaint in federal court against kik and that base should have been able to do a better job given how much testimony they had how many documents they collected so this was really a pretty aggressive move on their part and the SEC practically was goaded into suing kick because kik first published their wills response to them and then set up that crypto defend crypto Touareg website and basically just you know announced that they intended to fly any enforcement action in court so as you mentioned earlier they this week did respond pretty much point-by-point like literally to every single sentence that the SEC had previously but and they they wrote kind of like a rebuttal or or an answer to everything um I had heard though that other lawyers in this piece predicted that they would make a different choice and actually I heard a fan from somebody that you would actually predicted that they would do what they did so can you describe what other choices they could have made and what it signifies that they decided to answer this and give the full context for everything sure so when a complaint is filed against you you typically have one of two choices you can file what's called a motion to dismiss that's a much lengthier paper and it's a it's what everyone sort of thinks of as a brief or a memo typical you know memorandum of law and what you say in a motion to dismiss if as the defendant is that the complaint as its pled does not state a claim under the applicable law so here kick could have filed a motion that said the SE C's allegations in the complaint don't meet the various elements of section 5 they didn't allege that we sold unregistered securities so what happens in a motion to dismiss process is that kick would file their motion to dismiss after a certain period of time 30 to 60 days the SEC would file an opposition explaining why they thought their complaint did state a claim and then kick would have an opportunity to reply and then after the reply there'd be a period of time where the court would consider the motion and decide whether the case should go forward or not and in the period of time after the reply before the judge filed his opinion on the motion there may be oral argument from the parties what that takes a long time kick would have filed the motion there have been 30 60 days for the opposition maybe another 15 30 for the reply and then maybe even six months before the opinion so we could be a year out from the complaint before we even get to really move the case forward my understanding or my thought and prediction at the time when the complaint was filed with that because kik said we don't think that how he tested the right test and we want to have a new regime applied to how we analyze tokens and make some new law the only real way to do that is to get out of the district court quickly so the only way you can get out of the district court quickly is to get to trial really fast so I thought they would file an answer because they've now filed their answer they're gonna be done with discovery which is where people take depositions they give documents over by November 2019 from what's been publicly reported about the discovery cutoff and so this will move them to trial quickly and after the trial somebody will likely what's called appeal so they'll say we don't like that either depending whoever loses will appeal is is the right answer so either the sec or kick if they lose will likely take the case up to the Second Circuit to say whatever the jury's decision was was wrong here's the legal reasons for it and keep going because the Supreme Court is really the only court in the land that can quote make new law oh well okay so it sounds like with strategically what kick was trying to do and or or is doing is just kind of hasten the process in order to try to get to that point where we can make new law or where they can make new law or this case could help me law is that yep that's exactly right the interesting thing about what so what an answer typically looks like in in any case in federal court is they do go point by point paragraph one paragraph 2 paragraph 3 and answer the complaint but they don't tell their story what they know what what litigants normally do in filing an answer is say we admit the first sentence of paragraph 1 and deny the second sentence of paragraph 1 or we don't have enough information to be able to admit or deny he and sometimes people use a motion to dismiss even if they think they're gonna lose or they don't have a good chance of winning to frame their case for the court and tell their story and so and an answer usually doesn't like to tell your story so what I thought was a very strategic and very interesting move here is that kick and kicks lawyers used an answer to tell their story as they would with a motion to dismiss except they still got the benefit of filing an answer and getting to lose the case along quickly oh wow okay and so what do you think is the significance of that like does it help them to have done done that like is that I'm assuming they must think that were so I think they definitely want their story out there I think you know they said when they SEC filed a complaint this doesn't tell the whole story and I think they felt that public opinion turned against I don't know but you know public opinion sort of turned against their position after the SEC filed its complaint and I think they wanted to have the opportunity to get a little Redemption very early in the case because the SEC is not going to have a chance to respond to an answer one thing I'll say is they put a lot of information in here and they've now filed it with the court and certified essentially that it's true and correct so you know this can be used throughout the rest of litigation and that is also I think you know something that they really had to give consideration to given how much information they really included in their answer I think for me the point that really really stood out was this allegation around the Hail Mary pass where the SEC said that a board member called creating that can token a Hail Mary pass and then kick show that actually the board member was saying the exact opposite the full quote here is the more I think about it I think this is a great idea people call it a Hail Mary but to me that is a long shot and I really do not think it is a long shot unquote so that's basically the opposite of what the SEC claimed what's your take on how they construed that phrase Hail Mary to say the exact opposite what the board member was saying so I have two points one is that lawyers whether for the government or for private litigants always try to take the evidence and have it support their case in some way so taking the evidence and and trying to use it to support your point is a typical lawyer tactic the other part that's really interesting is kicks mindset isn't actually important for the claim that is being made here the SEC has asserted only a section 5 claim and the Securities Act which says you sold unregistered securities I'm the biggest question there is was whatever you sold this instrument or in the case of kik was kin a security and that's the only question here so unlike a traditional fraud claim what's called a ten do a 10 B 5 claim where somebody says you were saying fraudulent things to get me to buy in there's no state of mind requirement here for kick to be liable for yeah for kick to be liable for selling kin and so what's super interesting to me both within the SE C's complaint and then again and Kix answer is everyone is trying to talk about what kick state of mind was no we weren't really um financially strapped that didn't matter and the SEC said they were financially strapped so they were really trying to raise money and that's pretty irrelevant to whether they actually sold unregistered securities or not oh wow okay so we're gonna keep discussing some of the other claims that were made in the answer that kick published this week but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer-to-peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create

going back to in its response in their very first answer they make this distinction between the saft portion of their sale which was to accredited investors versus the token distribution event and I was wondering I mean we talked about this briefly a little bit earlier but I was wondering so is this a legal argument that they're making or a factual argument and how will this affect the case because they this is something that they seem to rely on a lot in their answer right it is a very big theme for them and I think they're also relying on the fact that they registered the SAS sale with an exemption but the question here isn't whether the shaft itself is a security right that's why they they made the registration because shafts are unregistered securities and if you're selling them to accredited investors you can file for an exemption under the securities laws to say we don't have to register the offering of the staff but what the ICC's point is doesn't matter that you registered yourself kin itself at the time wasn't unregistered security so it'll be interesting to see how the distinction plays out throughout the rest of the case and and whether it actually is important or not to the point that Ken was the unregistered security that has been sold yeah I I feel like another theme that I see throughout the answer is maybe almost like a difference in interpretation or understanding of what kin is between the SEC and kick and what I mean by that is that there are different points where the SE c--'s a complaint said or it's cited instances where kick had talked about investors or I guess there was some presentation where compound annual growth was mentioned not actually in relation to kin but which they had to point out in their context but but just as kind of a general statement about crypto assets and as it was reading it sort of felt like the SEC was saying anytime that kik mentioned to any investment aspect at all that that shows or proves that it was a secure and unregistered securities offering whereas kik seemed to be saying oh this is a utility token and yeah okay utility tokens have you know multiple facets one of which is the fact that if the token gets widely adopted then the price will go up so how much of that kind of like difference in interpretation or understanding of what the token is also affects the the case here so a lot of it I think kick even takes it one step further than saying it's a utility token and says this is just a digital currency it's really a means of exchange and you know they gave the example of the sunglass retailer who was accepting kin for the sales of their sunglasses today this is really a digital currency and I think the between the two is what the entire case hinges on because it really goes to the nature of whether this is an investment contract and thus a security under the Howey test and you know regardless of whether kik is looking to quote-unquote make new law that the district court is gonna have to apply the Howey test to determine what Kim really is and so there's one thing that I was wondering here about the Howey test and this kind of difference between making a case on facts versus law so first of all actually can you just distinguish between you know what those two legal arguments are the two legal arguments between whether something like did trying to yeah trying to argue on the law versus on the facts oh so I don't think you can do one or the other there's a funny lawyer saying that says if facts aren't in your favor or you go law and if the law isn't in your favor argue the facts and if neither is in your favor just pound the table but any real case has to be won on the facts under the law and here they're gonna both sides are gonna make their case to say you know we've talked about in the crypto space what the hell test is ad infinitum but it is you know there's a multi-factor test that someone made an investment of money in a common enterprise with the reasonable expectation of profits with such profits to be derived from the efforts of third parties or the efforts of others and so every both the SEC and kick are gonna take the best facts they can find in the evidence and the evidence here is the documents that were produced the testimony given and try to really show at trial both by showing the documents and then by putting witnesses up on the stand in front of a jury and asking questions whether kin is an investment contract under the Howey test so here it really is a fax and a law question so that's how we'll get new law essentially because I did wonder so you know obviously because I'm not a lawyer and I had heard different people talking about facts versus law I was thinking well if they're arguing on the facts then like does that limit the scope of any judgement meaning like would it only apply you know to this one case and then but anyway so it sounds like even though it is like you're you're basically kind of trying to analyze the law through this one case and then from that you can make conclusions that would apply to other token sales that's right the district court opinion or whatever the jury finds isn't necessarily what's called quote-unquote legal precedent you can't take it from the Southern District of New York where the kid case is and bring it to the Northern District of California where there are a number of crypto cases pending including the repple case where the unregistered securities question is up again and say look they found the jury found this in the kick case and so you have to apply the same thing here but it will have some value to say look these tokens and you could say whether they're the same or different that would be you know a fact argument under the law it will have some interest for other courts but the only thing that you have to follow is if you're a district court you have to follow what the Second Circuit says and you have to follow what the Supreme Court says so that's what's gonna make a precedent I don't know if I think whatever happens in the district court will want to quote make new law it will certainly be you know this if this hasn't been decided before in front of a jury so all the way through judgment there have obviously been motion to dismiss opinions on this but the new law that I understood kik wanting to make was to have something totally different than the Howey test applied to digital tokens and so going forward like like do you think that is likely and what are you looking for basically as this continues to unfold so I think actually put forward a number of arguments now to show that they at least want to unravel the types of the SEC is gonna make in their answer at one point you know they said pretty aggressively that the concept of decentralization mattering in how we analysis is made up out of whole cloth that there's really no precedent to do that and the SEC just decided that the centralization was the test without really having anything to back it up so I think we're gonna see a number of different arguments like that to which which to your point earlier will give us guidance as we look at other tokens or other cases to think you know is decentralization the test or is something else really the test all right well I guess we'll see how this plays out as things go forward I know the whole crypto world is watching so thanks so much for coming undone confirmed thanks so much for having me I appreciate it thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about the topics we
