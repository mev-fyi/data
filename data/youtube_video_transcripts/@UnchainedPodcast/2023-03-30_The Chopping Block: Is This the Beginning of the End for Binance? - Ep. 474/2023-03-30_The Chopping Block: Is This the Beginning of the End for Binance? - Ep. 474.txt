not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first up we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert crypto connoisseur and captain of compound then we've got to ruin the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and finally you've got myself a massive the head height Mana dragonfly four of us are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block.xyz for more disclosures and this week especially not legal advice yeah this super super not legal advice although there's a lot of legal [ __ ] that's going on that we have to talk about so providing legal advice but you might need legal advice after listening apparently apparently so I I always say it's been a crazy week in crypto and it's just never not been true I I don't know what it is but this year has just been an avalanche of crazy crazy things going on it's the first thing that just dropped a couple days ago was the the cftc lawsuit against binance so this is the big one this is the thing that everybody's been waiting for for a very very long time binance although they've had lots of little kind of pot shots at them by individual Regulators individual countries nobody's ever actually tried to go after the king and that's basically what the cftc did in this lawsuit they instead of saying like oh you're operating without a license or you're doing this oh you're kind of like skirting some of the rules they're like no no your entire business is skirting all of the rules everywhere and it all is going straight at not only binance the company not just binance.com but also CZ himself so the complaint is 70 plus pages long it's a lot I actually read through the whole thing and I'm gonna I'm gonna give through the audience some of the highlights to understand what the case is that the cftc is laying out so the broad shape of the case is basically that unsurprisingly that they're offering Financial derivatives and commodities products to us customers without having a license so that's the basic obvious thing the cftc is responsible for that they are you know binance is not doing um so now here's here's some of the interesting details that we learned from this very very extensive complaint there's a lot of information in here that is surprising how much data they have and how many chat logs they have from inside of binance so the first thing is is the chief compliance officer Samuel Lim this guy we have so much so many of the chat logs from this guy he sort of painted as like this Iago like figure this sort of Gremlin who's just like hahaha we're evading compliance and it's okay so he so internally they knew that they had a huge portion of their user base from the US which of course they should not have because they are not licensed in the US to to offer derivatives to us customers um and so when when bitmex was taken down in 2019 they decided to change the way that they uh reported and label their U.S customers as unknown on their us on their internal analytics so CZ and everybody internally knew that they had a huge amount of U.S customer base but they instructed their user customers to use vpns and they had this uh you know article that they listed of here's how to use a VPN if websites don't allow you to log in for the US you can use a VPN wink wink you know I don't know if you might have this problem so they started IP blocking there was a there was a really good tidbit in there where they claim to be IP blocking and you get pop-up you're using from the US and you can just X Out the pop-up and then keep using the site so they weren't actually IP blocking with the cftc can play paints is that binance was always kind of wink wink doing compliance stuff where basically they were like oh you know we're kind of blocking the us but if a US client comes to us they're like hey we're now getting blocked they would basically advise them to say hey just you know use a [ __ ] VPN and once it uses VPN they'd be like okay great this is the same customer let's continue letting them use their own same account continue with their you know VIP points and their reputation and their trading limits and all that stuff so not only were they allowing lots and lots of us customers use the platform at one point they had something on the order of 20 of their volume was from the US until they onboarded binance Us in which case once they had binance us they pushed the customers from the US to binance US unless they were doing a lot of volume if they were doing a lot of volume then they would advise them and say hey you guys get to level up from binance binance is kind of the kiddie pool we're going to bring you on to binance.com in order to do that you will need to have some kind of offshore account and so they would sort of basically nudge nudge advise them into hey set up an offshore account we won't look through to the beneficial owners or we'll do like some kind of magic or will allow you to transfer your kyc if your kyc doesn't work to basically massage this as best we can to get you onto binance.com where the real money is made and where the most you know lucrative products are also are also going to be tradable now not only were they allowing lots and lots of us customers to trade on binance but also they were basically their entire kyc program was kind of a sham so for one they they knew that they were allowing a lot of black market activity on the platform to the point where there are references to Hamas as being a customer of of finance and so you know this is in direct violation of sanctions knowing violations of sanctions there were a lot of examples of dark net markets you know basically people engaged in strictly legal activity a bunch of Russian Mobsters or something like that that were using the platform and they were basically like yeah this is almost certainly a legal activity let's just let's just all agree to look the other way if they have chat logs where they basically acknowledge that hey we know that this is a legal activity uh let's just let's just kind of look the other way these chat logs are like reminiscent of you know the FX chat logs from the financial crisis if you remember all of those uh very funny but like almost so comical that someone actually wrote that level of chat log so I highly recommend if you're a listener and you haven't read some of these you should read them not only for the legal understanding but also for entertainment purposes because it's def definitely worth reading for that reason yeah if you just scan through for like the different spacing on the chat logs I think it's if you're not going to read the whole thing just read the chat logs because you'll get you'll get a sense very quickly of how bad this is the the other element of this is that there was basically a 300 accounts that were internally used by binance and CZ to trade directly on binance itself so you know there was also um uh indications that big Prop Shops were given special latency Fast Lanes so they're they're the same thing that has happened with FTX is that certain people were getting faster API access than others and uh the other thing was that all this activity was obviously willful they were they were denying all this stuff publicly and they were doing this over and over and over again in all of their public statements um and internally everything was rolling up to CZ CZ was basically making all these decisions directly about the compliance program about the strategy with the us about you know all the shell companies that they used and everything was happening over signal with auto deleting messages and so it was intentionally designed so that nothing was going to leave a Trace there were a couple of choice quotes that I thought were very interesting that I wanted to share directly uh well so actually one other thing I should mention before I go into the quotes uh the cftc directly in it ironically uh in this complaint they claim that ether Bitcoin Litecoin usct and USC Royal commodities sort of indirect contradiction to the SEC with the SC just claimed like a week ago and uh the other interesting thing is that in order to establish jurisdiction and so they they made a bunch of claims to establish jurisdiction obviously one of them just being that there were a ton of us customers on the platform so it's not a hard place to establish jurisdiction but one of the added points they made was that they used U.S services for binance such as AWS and Google which basically means that the whole world is U.S jurisdiction now because I don't know you know almost every company has something that depends on AWS or Google the two quotes that I thought were fantastic the first one was talking about Lim the the CCO they claim Lim displayed a nuanced understanding of applicable regulatory requirements and the potential liability that may accompany a failure to comply with U.S law for example he chatted to a colleague in October 2020. U.S users equals cftc equals civil case can pay a fine go settle no kyc equals BSA the bank secrecy act equals criminal case have to go to jail interestingly a lot of what they've detailed here in this complaint is not just civil it's not just cftc stuff all this stuff is about sanctions violations is about intentionally facilitating money laundering lots of stuff that looks a lot like the latter part of this statement which is BSA act criminal case have to go to jail and so a lot of people are now speculating that the cftc lawsuit this was so big usually cftc losses don't look like this there's not this much other stuff about potential criminal Behavior that's going on here and so a lot of people are speculating that there's going to be another drop fairly soon whether it be from the SEC whether it be from the doj we know that the CC and the doj have been investigating binance for years and with all this data now out there from the cftc there's probably going to be some collaboration with some of the other U.S agencies that most likely my guess would be that something criminal is coming because this stuff very very clearly Rises to you know we have in this example alone there's just clear sanctions violations which are strict terminal liability and then lastly the last really interesting thing the question when you when you read this thing you're like how do they have all this surely buying us did not give this to them when they ask them for documents and the cftc explicitly States particular things they ask for that binance refuse to provide them and so in in one of the uh one of the same is just somewhere in there it says you know CZ communicate over signal with the audit delete functionality enabled with numerous binance officers employees and agents for example the following signal text chains or group chats collected from cz's telephone were among those set to Auto delete implying that maybe the cftc may have leaked unintentionally In this passage that they had access to cz's phone so I'm gonna stop there what are you guys reaction to seeing the cfdc lawsuit I mean that was actually the first thing I want to point out is like everyone needs to come up with some conspiracy theory for why how the cftc obtained those they were a little imprecise in their language in other places too so I I could totally imagine that it's actually like someone else who is a whistleblower was in the same chat and it was on auto delete mode and you know the cftc is not exactly being quite precise about where they got it from like they know that if the group chat was on auditory it must have been deleted on Cece's phone but like they this stuff goes back to like 2020. so whoever was recording this right so there's somebody in the Inner Circle if it's a league it was somebody who was persisting these messages for years yeah it was in the Inner Circle like that seems unlikely to me I mean there's a lot of different plausible explanations assuming it wasn't like a grammatical error so one is that at some point the investigation was friendlier you know he did say that they had been talking them for two years it's possible he turned over from like a subpoena or something like that his phone voluntarily at some point either like an image of it or whatever that's you know it's not likely but it's a possibility is that he provided that information the second was that you know it was accessed through unscrupulous means in one way or another it's possible you know someone just imaged it you know walking past his computer or something like that who knows but the third possibility in my mind is that you know it is just a grammatical error and it's not actually from his phone it's implied to be from his phone and they're just picking up other information they have and piecing it together to say here's what we know about him but how could they've done all these chat logs like this is over years of chats I just want to point out I don't think this is a NSA chose uh bad parameters for signal and Signal use a nist curve and somehow they backdoored it I I feel like I've read some you know the the I've read people online be like oh Signal's now broken whatever I I just want to like the reason I was bringing up the conspiracy theories is I've seen things like that and I would say I highly doubt that that's true yeah I highly have to reveal that fact through this lawsuit as well this is not seem maybe like the best use I mean I I agree I think maybe it's multiple collaborators over multiple periods of time or like you know is more like you have a compromised you know client on a bad phone or bad computer versus like something wrong with the protocol so yeah I think there's multiple angles of attack here but I I guess when I was reading this I think like the last big like exchange lawsuit that was not fraud or collapse was bitmex and thinking about kind of the simulators there but also the differences being not so intentionally flouting you know BSA uh compliance which it seems like uh Finance was pretty actively doing yeah I mean bitmex was just such a different scale right bitmex was like oh you had some percent of us customers on there it's like the doj shows for bitmax was that there was some Americans right they didn't even say how much if I recall it was like a very small number this is like a multi-year very willful it's not like oh you were negligent and you didn't Implement a kyc program it's that you basically like lied over many years about the extent to which you were doing this and even like you know like a year to two years ago they were openly flouting the stuff and and it's also like you know the the with the doj they never had anything on on Arthur about like terrorist financing or you know facilitating like binance is operating at such a bigger scale than bitmax ever was as well and that's I think it's important for people to understand that like Finance at the height of the market binance is probably worth like 200 300 billion dollars it was making so much money it was so massive as a business I'm obviously I mean Equity price in general are much higher at the height of the market but uh they just have such a huge footprint globally that it is it is basically one of the it was basically one of the biggest companies in the world and they were effectively open for business for almost anybody that's that's what the complaint is effectively alleging and that just means that the volume of you know uh criminal activity and black market uh Behavior that's that's flowing the platform now obviously a lot of it is too small and it's like not worth it their time to bank it but for some of this stuff like clearly the policy you can you can see it from the interaction with CZ CC's like look as long as we don't get caught and as long as we can sort of claim publicly that we're kind of paying lip service to compliance do whatever that's basically what almost every child with CC looks like well let me push back on that statement just now so yes there's a lot of stuff that was too small for them to care about it because it wouldn't be profitable but like some of the logs that were presented were transactions that were too small and they were talking about it and it was extremely bad the best example is like talking about how they were aware that Hamas was laundering 600 at a time through their platform and they were joking like oh is that even enough to buy an AK-47 like haha like that's the crazy thing to me is that it is such a small amount of money that there's no way it was profitable for them it's a business and they still acknowledged it and like moved forward with it over like a small dollar amount it's not like this was like billions of dollars this was six hundred dollars of like terrorist financing that they laughed about so seems extremely illogical the other thing you know we saw what happened to Arthur and you know with Arthur that was at a time when crypto was much less villainized in the US than it is today and there was a lot less there was a lot less bloodlust in you know the the sort of uh the executive branch than there is today so I think what happens to CZ here almost certainly is going to be really ugly you know we already have enough in here for them to bring criminal charges as far as I can tell and the kind of criminal charges that you would bring to CZ are not like a hey you know you you could you slap on the wrist like oh you sort of you didn't put a good enough compliance program in the the stuff here seems much bigger than that now that being said we know the doj has been investigating them for years although it seems like however the cftc got this information whether it be from you know because so many of these conversations involved the CCO my assumption is that if there's if there is a cooperator it's probably the CCO because the CCO is probably you know the CCO is named as a defendant though which I thought was kind of interesting if it was like a plea Arrangement that's usually like they do like a separate arraignment right like yeah if you look at the FTX ones um the the Carolyn plea for instance is like a separate chart it's like not not sure so there's I mean I'm not lawyers so don't don't quote me on that I do know that that was different that was that was something I know this was different Samuel and was like explicitly one of the defendants right so I started to tell what happens from here but this does feel very substantively different you know what happened with bitmax it does seem though yeah I was just talking to somebody about this yesterday that like being the biggest Exchange in the world is kind of like being the Emperor of China in that like eventually you're gonna somebody's gonna come after you somebody's gonna kill you your lifespan is going to be very limited um but there's really no way to be the king of the world without getting some blood on your hands that seems to be in some way the moral of the story here like the only way binance could grow this big and become this dominant is by cutting more corners than everybody else and you can see very clearly that's what they were doing I don't know if it's by cutting Corners I mean amongst all of the bad behavior and they're like the most shocking part to me as a reader and it's like an industry participant was reading that they had 300 house accounts that they were using to trade against users on their exchange right that's not cutting a corner right they could have built the hugest exchange of all time without having any accounts trading against their customers right they could have built probably the hugest care of all time while being serious about like blocking terrorist financing right like none of those things I think helped them build the hugest exchange of all time so allowing us customers definitely help them and they pointed out the business case for like knowingly allowing us customers with like a massaged VPN whole situation I think the hammer is going to come down on them extremely hard and as you said there's a lot of bloodlust right now combine bloodlust plus very bad behavior plus this like quasi-xenophobia around like binance as a Chinese exchange I think the Venn diagram of that is going to lead to you know the hammer of Thor coming down on them you know Tick Tock is the target of Vengeance right now I'm serious Tick Tock oh yeah and they honestly have really done very little wrong okay and they're still like in the Maelstrom because like there's this like pseudos xenophobia around tick tock as a Chinese company and like the hammer of Thor is coming down on Tick Tock and it's not like actual bad behavior and like actual like terrorist financing and actually like trying to rip off your users so if that's what's happening to tick tock I can only imagine you know what they're going to try to do to finance to be fair I think the binance trading against their customers thing I think I've heard that for years and I've always just assumed it was true based on every single person I've ever talked to who worked at binance like it's it was not let's put it this way that was not a dark deep secret first of all the identity of Merit point which also ironic that the name of the trading on your own platform thing has the word merit in it like kind of like unreal that entity has been well known for a long time and there have been a bunch of articles that have listed it so it's definitely not there's been like cz's uh only an investor in this trading firm that happens to be 20 of Finance volume that that sort of has been some of the older articles so I'd say that was actually one of the least surprising things the Hamas thing was the most surprising to me for sure I was like whoa like for such a low value thing the idea of writing what they wrote is just I don't even have words for it I I'd have to assume that we're getting you know sort of the the very just like tip of the iceberg like there's probably a lot more black market activity that they were aware of it that was very profitable for them to facilitate because otherwise like why would you just let me know obviously nobody's gonna have 600 transactions from okay cool that's fine unless they understand that there's a broader part of their business that depends on that um yeah for sure I I think like another interesting fact is um if we not just look at the binance side but like let's actually look at the U.S trading firm side because that was you know yes they were like oh 30 of our usages from the US but it was like 10 10 firms so like it's not like it's like 30 is coming from like retail users punting no no no a lot of their volume was coming from the so they talked about like the two Bitcoin withdrawal per day accounts and a lot of their volume was coming from these sort of non-kyc two Bitcoin accounts one of the reasons why they really did not want to turn this off until after they had binance us up was that it was a huge portion of their of their retail uh volume was coming from these two Bitcoin accounts the market makers ones were like still in violation post Finance us and that that was where it was kind of interesting the question to me is like whether whether the cftc is going to go after the US companies which you know in order are trading from a is Radix blander Ben blender is one of the How would put it highest ego people I've ever interacted with in algorithmic trading in my time he he's does not he thinks maybe so highly of himself that he didn't say no comment to the Wall Street Journal when he should have today because like the article doc where he docks himself is kind of funny SO trading from a is Radix which is like if you're a really small trading firm in 2018 before I started Gauntlet I was like debating Gunk staying in algo trading I interviewed a few places and everyone told me Radix was gonna die so I was like okay well I'm not gonna go talk to them uh so I guess they must have survived off this binance thing that was like one interesting fact I learned about this was like a bunch of trading firms that were almost dead in like normal Futures and equities they're like a path to survival was like Finance Market making trading for Infinity were much more larger okay I'd be very surprised if they go after the trading firms right I mean in general they in general that's like not the way that these guys like to operate is going after the Traders as opposed to going after the exchange operators uh so sort of uh training from B was Jane Street training from C's Tower research but uh trading firm a was interesting because they like explicitly logged in from a US account when they're registered as a Jersey entity and then like tried to be like oh no sorry sorry that that computer happened to be owned by the Jersey entity there's a bunch of stuff like that which is actually like you can get a lot of penalties or your license you can get like licenses suspended so like you can't trade CME fcm type of things I I could I could see some some blowback for the trading firms I'm more curious what the the US penalties are from the perspective of like I still believe that like there's a ton of volume on violence that's American it's not like even with post kyc doing things like yeah making Jersey entities so I'm just more kind of curious if like if any of them get prosecuted I actually suspect that then you'll see a ton of U.S volume leave binance permanently because people will be like we can't take this risk of like our offer entity not being good enough cover for us yeah certainly possible no binance a digital response I think uh uh soon after yes so they're they're respond well the first response was four which is uh cz's code word for like ignore the fud but then he was going okay [ __ ] like we were getting a bunch of withdrawals I should probably actually say something so um he uh typically the withdrawals are relatively small so I think it's like a billion out of like 60 billion plus in in total deposits they have so a binance issued a statement basically first rebutting a few of the claims it was honestly not it was not very substantive they basically said like one we have a big compliance program we have like 70 plus people who are on compliance full time which is I don't know how that what you know I don't know what that has to do with anything um we work really hard on compliance we have great kyc we have a lot of licenses uh and then they they also said look the internal accounts are because we take our profits in crypto and we have to divest that in order to pay our people and so you know I have accounts that own binance as well because I get paid in crypto and I sometimes need to turn it into Cash because I need to you know pay my rent um so kind you know very like uh sympathetic slant to the way he's trying to portray the uh the 300 internal accounts that they use and then I think the chief strategy officer of Finance stated that on Twitter that the reason why they use these internal trading accounts was only to provide liquidity and to make my slippage not to you know actively you know hunt orders or try to you know adversarially attack some of the people on their exchange as FTX was once accused of so I don't know how much their response really addressed much of of note in there so I guess the question is like okay what happens from here okay let's assume I think at this point it seems pretty obvious that there's this is not the end it's not just going to be a cfdc complaint there's gonna be more that comes whether it's the SEC whether it's a doj what do you think is the net result of this like obviously this stuff takes time to work out in the courts do you think that CZ is still going to be running binance in two years do you think binance still going to be Top Dog in two years three years five years what would you guys predict Robert you're up first you're making you're making a face so you're up first I I think I mean as I said before I think this fits into like the Venn diagram of like Target number one um I think it's gonna be bad I think they're gonna potentially bring criminal charges you know I think they're going to try to shut down binance you know we'll talk about the wells knows against coinbase you know coming up after this but like I don't think coinbase is on the like for execution you know this is in the Public's interest strategy like shutting down coinbase is not in the Public's interest I think there's probably enough people within the administration that that truly believe that shutting down binance is in the Public's best interest period full stop and will make that the goal and are smart enough to know that shutting down coinbase is a terrible idea and against the Public's interest so how long do you think it takes for binance to to get shut down you know I'm probably taking a much more conservative view or aggressive view I don't know which one that is but honestly I think within 18 months there's a play like totally shutting down Finance total shutdown within 18 months okay Tyrone what do you think I would compare my time scale to like whether the trading firms get people go after them because if binance actually lose starts losing its liquidity advantage and say like other exchanges like the buy bits of the world start taking all the market makers I'm getting Titan really tight spreads like I could see it being happening faster because like they'll both be weaker and the government's going after them versus not but if they somehow are able to not have that happen then then it'll be very different so I I guess like because of that I give a pretty wide confidence interval I'm not sure it will totally shut down like bitmex didn't totally shut down right like I'm more of the mindset that it'll be crimped in some ways and things like CZ steps down who he steps up something like that yeah I know it was interesting she wasn't mentioned at all in the complaint I I thought that that made me think she was the informant but that was just maybe my my conspiratorial like you know that you know they've dated so it's like uh that's actually very conspiratorial uh yeah I mean the whole their whole the whole story of how that happened was was kind of wild but wasn't she like a news anchor in China like before she was like a I thought she was like a kind of famous music I don't know she was they were both at okx before but like her absence of her name com in that doc was like very apparent perhaps so much so that maybe she is actually the informant I just kind of think I don't know how the US really goes after them like I'm sure Finance us if you ask me when that's dead I could totally be like that's dead in 12 months I mean think about how many times the CEO of binance us has changed first of all the first CEO of Finance us disappeared for a couple years although I think I saw her in Denver so like I think she's she's back in the world the second CEO binance us who is the former OCC head left after three months and then like it's just been this like kind of like Ring Around the Rosie type of like management since then the binance US I feel like you could see getting immediately being sent to the slaughterhouse as like a appeasement and also it has the most U.S liability the you know binance us was trying to acquire the assets of Voyager it was it was so interesting because it was just a week ago that a judge excoriated the SEC for claiming that like oh no you can't let a bind answer allow to take the stuff because we think they're a violation of a bunch of laws and the judge was like okay yeah what laws and yes he was like well we can't quite say and there's like okay shut the [ __ ] up get out of my court like you know this acquisition is going through and then the judge just stayed the order and said never mind Finance us cannot acquire voyager's asset so it seems like you're absolutely right the pressure on binance us which is much easier to get to is gonna get turned up really quickly CZ being a Canadian citizen also makes is different than Arthur who is a US citizen if I'm remembering correctly yeah uh so like I feel like that and yeah Arthur if you're listening apologies if I get that wrong and you you change your citizenship but I I I I I'm pretty sure it's very different with CZ because like I'm not sure how you would how you would actually find him I mean he's pretty well known he's in he's in the UAE right now sure yeah I am well I mean he takes pictures there it's not like it's not like it's just pretty well known it's like you can just go to his Twitter and click media and get get a good sign of that but I guess the the question is more like what would what would like a guy what would the US actually be able to get him extradited and if they did it doesn't matter I think the bigger thing is more that they just crimp them in like all these like it's Death By A Thousand Cuts Like cut off the banking system stuff first then suddenly like add binance some sanctions list or something so that like other countries residents can't you know use them as much so it's I I suspect it's going to be that but then at the end it might not be totally dead because it has a lot of brand value I mean the doj Playbook is like just seize the.com and then once the.com is like this big doj logo that's like hey binance us or binance.com is no longer uh no longer operating how does that work like did they just tell I can the doj has jurisdiction over I can yeah or like yeah I thought the i in icann says it's like a un thing that's hot that's ridiculous that's so sweet limo that's the news [Laughter] yeah okay so so my prediction is I don't think it dies I think it just has this like very slow tapering demise if that would be okay which is kind of what happened to bitmex right that makes it die that's sort of you know slowly declined to sound like a top 20 something exchange yeah I could kind of see that happening it's kind of like the emperor the Chinese Emperors who go live in Exile you know they're not killed yeah but they just you know they're given this little corner of the world that they have to stay in finance us though 100 I think will die like in in Robert's time frame or less like I I think that that's the sacrificial lamb that like will just be killed immediately all right Tom what's your take yeah I'm inclined to agree with Turin here I mean it was actually interesting after um I think it was immediately after they uh uh put out their sort of rebuttal um and CZ tweeted it out he also just read out this article I think uh about sort of the htma warming up to crypto and you said something like oh there's you know a world outside the US or something something to the effect of hey Asia is actually opening up to crypto if the us is going to shut it out and I think it's easy has the resources to you know avoid uh uh uh jurisdictions that have estrogen with the U.S and so I mean I would not be expected if there's like a rest foreign imminently but like physically getting him and trying to put him on trial seems very tricky but I agree with tarun it seems like more um hey just making it very difficult to deal with Finance um and just making kind of difficult for them to do business overall yeah I I hear you although you know I I don't think CZ is uh that interested in going to China either like he was chased out of China as well for all I mean they had a ton of market share in China when yeah uh running in exchange is even more illegal than it is in the U.S for the sake of our industry please do not write things like this anymore what was the the quote that was related to like the block wrote this article that like binance still have this office in Shanghai and then CZ replied with this tweet that's like became memed forever which was like recommend no more news like this yeah yeah it's like for the sake of our industry recommend new words like and you're a company there was a little subtle threat in there as well I believe yeah yeah but it was it was like I think that thing became just like this like huge meme um you know uh was around about this China thing that in case anyone's ever in case you were wondering the provenance of that Meme it has to do with the the like Hey we're kicked out of China but we're actually not uh I I don't see a way that this thing doesn't turn criminal I mean with everything that's in there especially about sanctions and terrorist financing um I think and and you know like uh Robert was uh like Robert was saying like there's just so much appetite to go after this like sort of Chinese overseas like runs up to a thousand shell companies takes over the world you know and and after Sam like Sam just kind of you know he took a giant dump in the punch bowl and now everyone is like huh this punch sucks like who else is who else is making punch out there turns out CZ has the biggest punch bowl of anybody I don't know I'm not gonna lie I've never heard I've never heard that metaphor and it's extremely disgusting to like think about it wait is it isn't that the metaphor that's a metaphor right sure I'm pretty sure it is I think I actually just to be accurate I think is who peed in the punch bowl hold on it's still disgusting let's feel disgusting yeah yeah it's more disgusting all right thanks guys thank you thank you for the fact check in real time that's why uh I can always count on you guys um anyway all right sorry please please unhear that long story short I think I agree with you all let's move on because uh We've okay that's that's enough about binance although speaking of extradition we did also just get uh notice a couple days ago the doquan was just arrested so it turns out dokwan uh he was in Montenegro of all places with some faked past like some forged documents and uh he got caught just for having I guess forged documents also there was an Interpol notice out for him as well you know I don't know if if Joe can get out um I don't know that CZ is going to do that much better um although you know I don't know what doe is doing in in Europe there's always some damn thing in the Balkans you know yeah I I think the thing that's most hilarious to me about the timing was vitalik is running this two-month social experiment in Montenegro in the same city that Doe was caught in that started March 25th is that why he was caught on 23rd no no no I don't think it has to do with like but he was like there's no way that's the cuts it is the Joe was flying to the calyx conference to poach a bunch of ethereum Engineers to rebuild Terra too is that what you're alluding to Tyrone you know I I I know no of No Such conspiracy theories the only part of the show that is investment advised no no I just think it was like funny it was like the same city I can't pronounce it or something like that yeah like like yeah there's this thing called zuzalu you mentioned eth limousine Scythe uh website for it but if anyone can figure out how to spell that good luck it which is which is sort of this thing that ethereum really ethereum insiders I don't know what else I would call it but like they're having this conference that's like part crypto stuff part like AI safety part some other stuff conference I don't know if I call it conference it's like um yeah it's like effective altruism meets Eastern European Vibes yeah I don't know how to and then there's no polycule thrown in there for good measure I I feel like there is I feel like it's a mix of also a little bit of Burning Man Vibes I feel like there's kind of a little everything in there yeah there's all the people I know who are really excited about going are definitely like exactly the type people who are like excited about going to the Bahamas there's there's a strong overlap like I know people who are in The Bahamas who are going to Montenegro is a lot more innocuous than what was happening in the Bahamas so just just just to be clear get a clear that Association not that way I meant more about the non crypto related activities like longevity and like psychedelics and whatever right like like all the other stuff like right now that sounds so wholesome to me I don't know after talking about all this like sanctions violations money laundering stuff I'm like oh that sounds so that sounds so sweet like the Joe was caught at the eve of this event that's what I'm saying it's like that was the funny part yeah yeah it's like yeah I just hang out here they can't kick me out of here right and they're like no no you're not invited like we're gonna you're kicking you're we're getting you out and then you got caught well no no I did Montenegro has some type of like there's a reason people keep going there for crypto things right like their their government wants to use crypto as a current like accept crypto as a national tender or something the hackathon at the end of zuzolo is actually like how to build government services for Montenegro in smart contracts so it's like it's definitely there's definitely something about Montenegro and like their legal system being very favorable to weird crypto experiments that's cool so I think that's the reason that they're both there it's just the timing was amazing I don't think that's why do quad is there to offer services it was very coincidental but he was flying to the UAE right so he was trying to get out of there uh there's too many too many crypto nerds true also did he have like a Costa Rican passport like that yeah no offense like if if this if doklan came up to me and was like yeah I'm from Costa Rica I would I too would also look twice at the passport like five times Maybe if you're in Montenegro maybe you just all accidents kind of sound vaguely weird to you you know I don't know did that clearly it didn't it was it was at a private airport it wasn't even that commercial we've got a lot of other content to discover so it's been uh so beyond just the cftc action and do Quan getting arrested hero of the show we also got a Wells notice by the SEC issued against coinbase so for those who don't know a whale's notice is basically an indication of like Hey we're gonna sue you give us a response in case that we decide not to sue you at the last minute but probably we're gonna see you so appointments issue to Wells notice um come easy enough to share all the details of the wells notice but basically from what they indicated the whales notice addresses the staking business which we already know Kraken uh was sued by the SEC and they settled over crack and staking business potentially being a security um and uh sustaking business and also some of them uh some of the assets listed on coinbase also being unregistered securities so that's the indication we've gotten from coinbase now coinbase issued a pretty scathing response on Twitter and in a blog post basically saying that they met with the SEC more than 30 times in the last nine months gave them zero feedback directly on what to change or how to register uh they asked coinbase to give proposals on what registration would look like coinbase wrote up like you know they put a lot of time and energy into writing out proposals at the sec's request about what a path for crypto exchange registration might look like and the SEC basically ignored them canceled their last meeting and then popped them with the wells notice without giving them any indication over all of their conversations which of course you know coinbase is known as being the most compliant most kind of uh compliance first Exchange in the US besides maybe Gemini which likes to yell that they're very compliant but as you know coinbase is obviously the biggest and and the brightest living in the industry this kind of rocked a lot of people because it sort of shows that the SEC at this point is going after everyone doesn't matter how good or bad of an actor you are um there's basically a full core WordPress from the administration at this point to go after crypto uh so what were your guys thoughts seeing the wells notice at this point it kind of feels like you know this happened months ago but this was just this was just last week uh since our last show it it feels pretty momentous now coinbase has this very belligerent attitude about it which is great to see and coinbase as far as I can tell they have such a good case against the SEC given all the facts of their engagement with the SEC and all the attempts that they've made uh in good faith to try to get the SEC to give them some kind of positive indication of what they should be doing but you know if gensor said publicly he thinks everything besides Bitcoin is Security in which case you know compliance would basically mean you know become a Bitcoin only exchange which would just be an obvious you know hey it's not just bitmex your margin was always in Bitcoin right well the derivatives that would be the problem there right is you know they don't well point this out if you haven't seen you know I logged into my coinbase account today and there's actually a new derivative stamp so oh yeah oh yeah yeah I think coinbase is actually like for non-us like London or something that like they they they're London or Singapore or something like that they're going to offer like three to 10x leverage I'm not sure but it's like capped a lot lower than everywhere else it's not binance tier I see I say wait Robert are you using your jersey account in order to get access only to read only I see I see okay got it got it got it but but now you're see you made fun of the are you doing using the Jersey accounting but I I'm telling you if any of these fcm licensed people lose their fcm license over this binance thing you will see all the liquidity providers who are vaguely American just like leave crypto exchanges right and so like to me that's the way to kill Finance would probably take a higher hit I mean I I think a lot of these trading firms like that what they're creating these offshore entities like they are pretty clean there's a lot of money in making sure that those things are airtight so I would be I'd be surprised I mean maybe somebody's gonna get hit but I think the people who did it right will look at those people and be like okay those guys are idiots yeah I'm just saying that cftc's description of the bumblings of you know two firms that are extremely large too right and like extremely well capitalized still made these kind of like logged in from the US mistakes I I think like there's the the especially because it seems like Regulators want to like go for the guillotine someone is going to get me an example of and the question is like who are they going to make the example of and and I think like that will scare scare people a lot more than even more than like the loss of banking in my mind so I mean okay so we've gotten from a bunch of different angles now right so like SEC going after coinbase cftc going after binance the other the other big news from the CFT Professor from the SEC as well this week was them going after Tron so the SEC file lawsuit against just the Sun for unregistered Securities violations Market manipulation of just tons of wash rating of Tron I think they they had like a bunch of employees just repeatedly watched selling on different exchanges um as well as paying celebrities to endorse Tron and not disclosing payments as well as the celebrities themselves so uh who do we have on the list is Lindsay Lohan Jake Paul Soldier Boy Neo acon and of course Lil yachty who we all know and love all of them were hit by the SEC for basically endorsing I think Tron I think it was mostly Tron that they were endorsing or electron ecosystem tokens on the whole it looks like basically every angle now is coming down like this feels one very coordinated obviously you also have FDIC doing the debanking you have the SEC going after celebrities you have uh cfdc and the SEC going after exchanges you've got you know do Quan getting arrested in Montenegro which you know maybe coincidental but like it sort of fills in the passage that this now feels like a full court press uh particularly within the us but uh also the moment that doquan was arrested by the way there were also uh charges unsealed by uh New York prosecutors against okuan basically jockeying to get an extraded to New York for um uh trial so at this point it's very hard to say that this is not coming straight from the executive of saying Hey I want heads let's go after everything in crypto because everything in this industry needs to go yeah it is hardened to see it being uh coordinated I guess I think the the more cynical take here is that like you know some of these some of these suits are like extremely unsurprising uh like Tron for example but some of them such as coinbase it seems like they're going to fight pretty hard and clear what the you know basis of the of the case would be but you know genzer is out in two years anyway and so it's like the suit is more of the point versus actually like winning the suit and I think there's also rumors coming out that like this Ripple lawsuit they might be able to settle and that's why you've seen xrp kind of pumping lately and so I don't know if it's like all of these things are going to have sort of the same outcome I guess or it's going to be sort of this one you know sort of Monolithic act across all these different crypto companies but it does somehow feel that hey in the past two months we've seen more action than we've seen in the past two years effectively um it's hard not to think that like there is there's something going on behind the scenes yeah this this feels like probably one of the most important questions over the next year is what's going to happen with the U.S regulatory action against crypto um I agree with you that actually a lot of these things so I think if you sort of look at them um separately right the debanking stuff it feels like already there's been a lot of public attention on this debate of crypto that I think they thought was going to be more quiet um because they were kind of pushing through back channels like there was no real there's no real transparency around how they were doing it and now you know there's like op-eds in the Wall Street Journal like this this stuff is now getting very public that hey FDIC is kind of you know putting the elbow on the scales and trying to push Banks to uh not work with crypto companies and people are pissed off about this I think this is perceived as being a sort of extra legal Crossing of a boundary that FTS you really should not be doing the same thing I think with the SEC action against coinbase I think people mostly perceive this as being excessive and in the at least in court of public opinion it looks really bad for the SEC if in fact they do bring a lawsuit they might not so to be clear a wealth service doesn't mean that there's a lawsuit filed um they might decide not to file the lawsuit just upon seeing the responsible coinbase we're also just seeing that like hey this is gonna be super unpopular and we're not going to win uh so let's not even bother bringing the the lawsuit but the stuff with binance definitely is going to play there's just no no way that we're not going to see this as being one of the most important stories of the year is the cfdc lawsuit against binance or whatever else comes from it and it does kind of feel like this is this is kind of the way that the cycle will truly come to an end right like in some ways the the 2017-2018 cycle the biggest exchange was bitmex and the cycle in a way was not really over until like the until the the full kind of Dana Moi of Arthur finally finding himself you know under indictment and not that I wanted him to but that in some way like that was the resolution of the cycle and in some way you know binance has been the overwhelming winner of this cycle and seeing them finally fall um whether it be one from just a death by a Thousand Cuts of like you know customers having to basically abandon them because it's just too dicey to deal with Finance or two just because you know CZ is literally forced to step down and over the reins you know they have to divest a lot of their businesses and you know things just become chaos over there and people just naturally be like okay [ __ ] this exchange is a mess I don't want to trade her anymore um if binance loses the throne it's going to be painful in the short term because so much of the market so much of the global market for crypto is on binance they're like 60 of the global market is just on that single exchange so it is it is the market today um if Finance goes under it's gonna be super painful a lot of things are going to get hurt a lot of people are going to get hurt a lot of startups are gonna get hurt but ultimately the industry is going to reorganize around whatever the new exchanges are at the end of the day the the industry is really about the technology it's about the assets about Bitcoin and ether and all the stuff that's getting built not about who happens to be the biggest exchange today I agree I think if Finance goes down it's potentially going to reinvent everything and we might actually see more self-custody more defy more things that are long-term good and healthy grow in its way yeah I think another thing that's sort of curious is that yeah crypto exchanges don't have a very long Half-Life historically or like at least their ranking their ability to stay at the top for a long time has not has been sort of never been high for anyone other than coinbase which has kind of been like consistent if it's not anything else but I I'm kind of I'm not so I don't I don't know if the the end of binance is sort of the at the end of of the world in some ways um I I but like I I still think that people do want Perpetual futures in general are an innovation that's not going away like people people like them and their reasons that they're really hard to do with real Commodities because your physical delivery you have all these settlement risk stuff like look at look at like the the London Mercantile Exchange recently found that like point eight percent of the nickel in their warehouses was actually Stone you know like stuff like that completely changes your contract specs and product and then like in some sense and and I hope genzler is listening to this crypto is the most pure commodity as a commodity it like has immediate delivery properties and has like all the properties that all the Commodities trading on CME lme whatever your ex JP um JS jsx whatever all of those things are all like these like approximate contracts right it's like oh we're like we're selling you hog Futures and the Hogs are between like 45 pounds and 65 pounds like sometimes you might have like you might not get that many of the 65 pound ones and there's some sense in which crypto is actually the most pure quality that you know your delivery is like exactly a particular thing and you can build these cleaner Financial products like Perpetual Futures on them so the real question is like will defy ever be able to stand up Alternatives that you know are compelling enough to these users uh and hopefully this is a good push to push us in that direction I mean I as much as I love defy I think you know people were saying this after the Colossal FTX as well as they're like oh this is going to prove the need for defy and D5 is gonna you know step up to the mantle and you know defy had like this this uh kind of rebound immediately after the collapse FTX but then things kind of went back to trend line which is that D5 is cool it's great people like it but like ultimately people most people are going to be using C5 because they don't know how to use metamask they don't know how to self-custody they don't know how to do any of this stuff and of course a lot of what binance does and this is where I have to give a lot of credit to buy dance binance is operating in so many countries where nobody else is operating they're doing so much for consumers in places where almost nobody else even bothers to offer consumer services aside from just trade Bitcoin right most people most exchanges they're they're not nearly as deeply entrenched into people's lives as binance was and that's part of the reason why they created such incredible business and why they're so beloved by their consumers so it would be great to see a world where binance can survive because like the Enterprise value of what they've built is so massive My worry is just that so much of it has just been tainted by the way in which it was built that we're going to have to go through the painful process of somebody else stepping up to that mantle or just going into a world that is that is just more quote unquote decentralized in that there is not going to be any single player that a 60 market share and therefore operates in every single nook and cranny of these small countries where nobody else can afford to have a ground game besides binance binance is incredibly efficient company you know they they're obviously incredibly profitable they're very very good at what they do um and it's a testament to what cze is built but unfortunately he just was driving too fast and he's caught too many tickets along the way that I don't know if he's going to be able to keep driving this car into the next decade I keep taking these metaphors and trying to pulling them along with me better than the punch bowl at least I I guess I guess I I the the thing that's weird to me is like it's like they are a little hard to kill they're actually in some sense already a little bit decentralized in to your point you know like Finance Latin America is like completely different from binance Turkey which is sort of completely different from you know bias U.S or China or whatever so I kind of could imagine that maybe they actually fracture into like these like Splinter Cell companies that serve the regions and like they they just end up being like Regional exchanges I could see that I mean it's like it's like it's yeah it's like it's like Ma Bell breaking up except it's a crypto Exchange yeah because a lot of these are franchises right so it's like there's they're totally different exchanges that basically were bought by binance or partner with binance Finance operates the tech and like change The Branding and helps them with marketing and go to market and whatever but I mean the one thing that became very clear especially from that cfdc lawsuit is that everything was just controlled by CZ same way that we saw with FTX right everything was controlled by Sam so most these exchanges are very very very centralized in the leader and you know of all these companies and all these little shells and all this stuff CC was always at the center of it or it continues to be at the center of it and so I do think it'll be painful if CZ is suddenly pulled out and binance somehow has to continue operating but I agree with you I think it's likely that um you know in some of these places like binance us I think I think you're right binance us is probably not viable without The binance Branding um but in most of these jurisdictions like binance has just built such an incredibly um like such a committed user base and there's they're just so good at what they do that their user base loves binance because of busd and if busd suddenly is non-existent I would be I would say that the busd in usdt Access are extremely important and there's somehow binance is unable to continue that that flow of exporting dollars from the US to all these places even if they're no longer yeah for sure but I I do think the the busd growth in Latin America was actually you know a huge part of their success in the last year so I'm kind of I'm kind of a little bit this is why I think they're the separate franchise thing is actually maybe the the Dark Horse theory that like the Latin American one will just be like sorry we didn't we didn't know that CZ controlled everything like guess what we're now binance Laden like we're our own entity because like it's it they all have you're right that they all have too much Enterprise Value that's like tied to their local regions ironically for because it's crypto you think that there shouldn't be that much but but you know they do yeah so okay I think most likely over this next week if I had to guess we're going to see more stuff drop because anybody who is working on anything just feels like oh [ __ ] we got scooped cftc has a lot more than we do we should get something out we whatever we have that's original we should get it out the door and my guess is it's not just gonna be the us it's going to be other countries too that we're working on something so I think that this next week is going to be chaotic that'd be my guess although I don't know I don't have any inside information I don't know anything and uh but but obviously there's a lot of rumors flying around um Every Which Way about what what's coming next on this CZ thing so everyone keeps talking about this like Asia is opening up type of thing I don't know enough to understand that I did speak with someone who who who was like what used to be a regulator who said something like this too what's the actual story is there is that like some like opium story that people have made up or is there like actually some like real laws in Hong Kong or whatever that are being no it's definitely it's definitely real so there's been rumors that Hong Kong is going to allow Hong Kong residents to start buying Bitcoin and ether uh within a couple months so I don't know if that's been confirmed to be true but it's very very clear Hong Kong is now positioning themselves to open back up to digital assets and China itself Beijing kind of behind closed doors is basically silently nodding and saying okay great this is this is going to be the sandbox through which we allow digital assets to start coming back into the region Hong Kong is basically a way I mean Hong Kong is like very you know it's basically rich people people and then people have been native Hong kongers and it's essentially a way of saying okay if we allow it in Hong Kong that essentially allows High net worth to get access to it uh without allowing Chinese retail you know the law Beijing the the sort of ordinary people in China to potentially get fleeced by you know nft scams and icos and all this other nonsense so you know from China's perspective it's funny because China bans crypto basically every bull cycle right this is a 2020 was actually the third time they banned crypto which kind of tells you like their bands are a little bit watery if they keep having to re-ban it but that's kind of the way China operates is that like if China you know they banned something and then they kind of let it come back in the corners and they don't quite enforce this thing and they sort of they oh this little loophole people are using we'll kind of let them keep doing that and watch and see how it develops because I think what China dislikes about crypto is not crypto per se but what they don't like is disorder and bull markets and crypto are really [ __ ] disorderly right they are you know crazy people scamming pyramid schemes you know nft fraud all this like things just go totally nuts in China every time there's a crypto bull market and that's what China Tams down on um but once things are calm which right now they're very calm in a way it also does feel like the thing I was saying earlier that this is kind of the natural evolution of the cycle right the same thing happened you know trying to banned icos in 2017 they were like oh this is all crazy it's not you know you guys aren't allowed to do this they tamped out down on everything and then slowly but surely started to come back and people started to do crypto startups again and exchanges started to offer stuff to Chinese people again and uh RMB started to get traded for ustt again and it started to come back and this feels like oh this is we're at that point in the handing off of this cycle to the next one where the big exchange founder gets gets hit you know the the all coins pull back and like the hype Cycle's gone away China reopens again uh like new new licensing regulatory regime start figuring out how they're gonna start operating the stuff it feels like I've seen the story before that a very strong Deja Vu my Dark Horse candidate and this again I don't know why today I'm indulging in so much extreme speculative you know thought is is actually that a lot of Chinese companies are like making these kind of like announcements that like Hey we're not flat-footed we also will have large language models like Baidu like every two days is like oh no no we're gonna build Baidu Ai and it's going to be open ai's competitor like like there was like some some like and there are U.S public companies and they have to report this so it's like you can see this stuff there's definitely this thing of like you know in the self-driving car and sort of like visual like tag tagging image tagging video tagging stuff there was always this idea that like China was way ahead of the US in AI but then the language stuff it's like clear that the US is basically steamrolled everyone and you're starting to see this kind of like National angst like Britain Britain was like we're going to build our own open Ai and like we're gonna like fund it with government money like and call it Brit GPT like literally the Prime Minister yes it was like hilarious uh so there's a lot of this like weird like national pride stuff and I actually think someone is going to be like hey look we lost the whole the race in AI but you know where we can we can actually win is crypto and like that's going to be kind of like that's my sort of like one year Dark Horse specular theory that like China might be that place look I think China understands that right if you remember 2019 they announced the blockchain plus initiative and this idea that like blockchain was super strategically important for China as a technology um like that came straight from Xi Jinping and they started you know doing a bunch of stuff at the government level to integrate blockchain um and actually that was the first time that I think in the people's daily which is like the big Chinese uh you know state-owned newspaper um they wrote this piece basically saying Bitcoin and ether are fantastic Innovations they're wonderful for society blah blah blah which is like unheard of that China would have would say something like that and then of course they backpedaled after they banned crypto they say oh and actually no these things are bad they're speculative um so everything I think in China particularly is very like China understands that crypto is really important they don't necessarily know what to do with it but they know that it's really important and they know they see the US is now giving up the lead and they see that other countries are not right other countries are not doing the same thing Japan is not doing that Korea is not doing that uh Europe is not doing that like pretty much at this point the U.S is the odd man out when it comes to countries reaction to crypto the U.S is now the most punitive of almost any country besides you know basically like you know Iran or something uh in its attitude towards crypto even China is actually being friendlier to crypto than the US is at this point so yeah and I think a lot of this this uh this like National Security over building new technologies thing I think the US suddenly like turning around from like 2017 where people are like oh yeah AI companies in China are way ahead to the us being like the dominant place will will kind of Drive some interest into this alternative technology National interest but again this is very speculative and it's just not it's an opinion not a definitely I think also we're like us is the only G7 country that's not considering doing a cbdc but that's like affirmatively not gonna do a cbdc so I think it's on it's on multiple levels but although that's for a different reason admitted I will I will say the following uh I won't name the person but someone who is a in the US uh regulatory regime you know I I was like hey do you think fed now is fed now which is like this thing for doing Bank transfers 24 7 is going to work and do all they have all those guarantees because like it seems like they're kind of rushing it in response to crypto or something or like the banking crisis and um the uh the person replied said now you mean fed later right uh you don't think they don't think it's gonna actually like launch correctly and do all the things that's I think it'll watch it's not yeah they just got laundry within a few months and yeah no yeah no no that that it's going to be very very restricted it's not going to be the like hey we actually have everything working because there's like white list only sort of test net yeah exactly exactly exactly exactly it's it's it's gonna it's gonna be the biggest sequencer roll up okay nice nice nice okay I think I take a take a page from the crypto Playbook I I think that that like I'm not not surprised but like I think that there's kind of this interesting thing of like the US has been like oh yeah like we're not gonna do CDC because we have fed now but if fed now fails I bet you it might change their mind well also I mean cbdc the point of CBC is not just uh real-time settlement among commercial Banks but it's also you know retail access to the the central Ledger and uh for sure anyway that I mean there's a lot more that we can talk about there we're already over time so we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and call it but maybe next time we can talk about some of the FED now cptc stuff if nothing else important happens but my guess is that other important things will happen if you're a listener and you like you actually like talking about that stuff given that I'm not sure if we're the most qualified audience please somehow uh tweet at us or please like listening to us talk about cbdc's I think I might reset the show no I know I'm just saying like I would love to get them okay well I might there you go I might have to resign and disgrace for the show if that's what we become anyway all right nothing against cbcs are great I love cbdc's but you know I don't know I don't that's not what I got it I don't I definitely don't but I do think it's worth talking about okay fine all right well until next time thanks everybody
