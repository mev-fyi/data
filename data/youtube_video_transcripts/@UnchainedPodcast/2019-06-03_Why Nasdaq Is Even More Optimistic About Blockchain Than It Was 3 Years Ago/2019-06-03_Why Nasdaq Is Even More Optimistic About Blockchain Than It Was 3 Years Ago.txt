the leaders among financial services companies working on incorporating blockchain technology into their products Nasdaq was the first incumbent to launch a blockchain based product Nasdaq link spelled linq which is used to manage shares in private companies it has also launched an effort in Estonia to create an electronic shareholder voting system that uses blockchain technology and last year the company unveiled a financial framework for clients who want to incorporate blockchain into their products and services welcome Fredrik thank you Lauren thanks for having me so tell us what you do at Nasdaq yes so my contribution to an asset Xbox chain innovation project is I work with the c-suite on what our corporate objectives should be across the entire Nasdaq proposing strategies for achieving those objectives and I do also get involved if we have you know investment opportunities in in this place okay such as for example one that I know of is an investment that you made in chain which is onto your partner absolutely that's correct and what are some others that Nasdaq has made well actually in the blockchain space Chinese so far I think there will be more but so far our only investment in sort of parallel financial innovation tracks that we're working on like machine intelligence we have done other investments for example in a company called digital reasoning but in blockchain so far it's been changed and what was your background before this role why background is really in the commodity derivatives space of being involved in exchange and Clearing House operations for commodity derivatives since since the mid 90s actually and how did you end up learning about blockchain technology yeah so my previous role as Co heading our European commodities business I had that role for four six years and it was sort of time to do something else and at that stage this was early 2015 Nasdaq was looking to expand its you know blockchain innovation initiative and was looking for a person with some you know commercial background in in the space in the capital market space and you know I got the question if I was interested in the role and that's the way it went and had you heard about Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies or blockchain generally when they approached you about that yeah I thought about Bitcoin I cannot say I knew a lot about it and then particularly I wasn't familiar with sort of the technology upon which Bitcoin operated so that was new new to me actually when I took up the role one was two years ago then why did other you know other than wanting a change of I guess a change in your work why did you decide to take the role well I've always been interested in intrigued by the way capital markets functions so you know aspects of liquidity market structure capital markets for the good of society and and reform and change of capital markets I for example been involved in various projects you know closing trading floors going electronic instead and and I found it intriguing that while the front-end the trading part of Capital Markets had gone through a fantastic amount of innovation over the last let's say twenty years or more the post trade part is very much unchanged and and this this is the technology that has the potential to be contributed to a reform and enhancement of on that part of capital a financial market so that that was intriguing to me so let's talk about now Sachs main blockchain initiatives I briefly described them at the beginning of the call but can you go into more detail around around what they are yeah I mean first of all there are three areas that are of interest to us when we when we think about blockchain in capital markets that is not because those three are exclusively interesting but they are the ones where we have started and that our keen interest to us and they are you know as I mentioned the post trade plumbing on capital markets its regulatory transparency it's the relationship between issuers of an asset and the investor of the asset and when we look at our projects ideas initiatives pocs etcetera we typically validate them against those three buckets of interest and we have a we have a pretty large portfolio actually or project so far we only publicly announced two of them and they're you know as you mentioned the private company link solution and the devoting project in Estonia but we do have other projects initiatives that we're working on as well some are very you know rnd a laboratory oriented and they will probably never be assessed and some are more commercial in nature and we will you know see at some point we will go public with them okay well let's dive into some detail on link for instance how would you say how does that work yeah no I think you can't really conclude on that yet it is still a solution in in in evolution we are looking to expand the capabilities of the Lync solution in actually in many dimension we are looking to expand the user base we are looking to expand the feature set possibly geographically as well so it's by no means a done deal but actually can you just start with what it is you know how it works like what the product is yeah so it is a blockchain based solution that allows a private company to issue shares transfer those shares to its investors and if there is a secondary market trade transfer of those shares between the investors and the intriguing part is that this is done electronically using blockchain technology and with no trusted third party like a depository in the middle so it's an electronic version of the current sort of peer-to-peer basis upon which that market operates so it really not only validates the technology it actually validates the alternative market structure or you know transfer of ownership of digital shares in an in a peer-to-peer network and that is that's sort of the key part of the Linc initiative as it stands right now and how does it compare to previous systems for managing those types of services I mean in and this varies of course from country to country and market to market but if we talk about the US market that that historically has been basically paper-based when I come private company issue shares it typically does that you know in a paper certificate those paper certificates are then transferred to to investors in those companies and then between investors if there is a secondary market to trade so this is this is making that market more efficient making it more electronic less prone to errors and of course in in other markets around the world even private shares or sort of electronic and the certified but in those markets you typically have a trusted sort of database in the middle a depository or a registry and of course link demonstrates that you don't have to have that you can continue to operate this on a peer-to-peer network basis and so in terms of the ways that blockchain in this case improves upon the existing software is that it probably eliminates some of the problems that you might have with a paper-based system such as if let's say an investor or an employee receives more shares in the company or something like that you know then you know you don't have sort of like these invalid previous paper certificates that are floating around or you know or in just the fact that you don't have to deal with paper in general means that it's just much more efficient is is that a correct characterization that is a very accurate characterization basically it helps the company to better keep track of its capitalization table basically who owns what in the in the company you will see much fewer errors you will also see faster processing of these transaction so it is both reducing errors but actually enhancing you know let's call it operation on productivity in that in that ecosystem and what about the electronic shareholder voting system how does that work yeah so the sort of the technology stack is very similar we leverage the the chain a core blockchain ledger protocol for for both these cases we do have a middleware the financial framework that you alluded to and then we build sort of some unique applications in each of these cases so the applications for the voting solution looks a bit different from the applications for the private company application but so this tonight the technology stack is very similar in the voting case it is a slightly different use case of course in that the key things we wanted to verify there was we had wanted to force ourselves to work with issue of identity how do you identify a person on the blockchain how do you identify a person representing a company how do you work with delegation of rights on the blockchain if you want to delegate your your voting rights from yourself to a through a proxy for example and so we wanted to challenge ourselves on a different with some different challenges in in the voting case and you know that's why we took on that specific project and so in general for this electronic shareholder voting system what problems exist in the current method that you feel watching can resolve I mean first of all this implementation allows the companies in Estonia to participate remotely in the in the ATMs for example in the shareholder meetings which hasn't been possible before but more importantly it allows the casting of votes remotely as well and it allows the delegation of those votes so if you own shares in the company you will be you'll be given basically proxy amazed tokens equaling to the number of shares your own but then you can you can transfer those on the network and you can for example give them to me and I can vote on your behalf and the course of the the strong capabilities of blockchain technology to keep track of you know provenance of a digitized asset in this case a vote we can follow the whereabouts of these votes and one problem that souls is for for example if you're a proxy today it is very difficult to demonstrate to your to that the person who delegated its votes to you that you actually voted in accordance with the instructions if you leverage the foundational capabilities of blockchain technology that is very easy you can basically see that the voting token was you know cast in either the yes or the no ballot and and that is a also a problem that the technology helps solving in a in a very good way in both these cases is you know Nasdaq link as well as the electronic shareholder voting system what would you say is the benefit of using blockchain here like how did you decide to use blockchain as a solution to improve these systems as opposed to some other technology I mean first of all when we set out on these projects and they were both started in you know I think 2015 or early 2016 the the key objective of this project was actually learning we wanted to acquire learning on the technology but also around legal and regulatory aspects also around you know business model questions and about integration and transition questions so the the key objectives for us were actually learning they were in in in that early stage not intended to the you know sort of highly profitable product as we now are three years down the line of our blockchain project we're sort of shifting the objective somewhat it is going to be less about learning and actually more about you know genuine commercialization going forward and that also means that we will sort of a little bit tweak the nature of our project and become more focused on on the satisfying needs that clients in these use cases are willing to you know you know they pay for us to to sort of solve their problems and aside from the commercialization aspect how else do you evaluate whether a product or service could benefit from blockchain because you hear a lot of kind of joking in the industry or I think their view have even been comics that have gone around that have you know said like oh you have this problem let's put a blockchain on it and you know there's this perception that everybody thinks now that it's going to solve everything when of course that's not the case so you know aside from and just like business model considerations how do you figure out whether or not a certain problem or service is is actually going to be improved by blockchain yeah I mean first of all I think it is it's worth putting it into context on our overall innovation portfolio sort of hour-long use of technologies for solving problems in capital and financial markets and and you know we we use and investigate machine intelligence will work with cloud computers we work with Intel computing with augmented reality cryptography in general so we we we don't think that we have a hammer here a box chain hammer and everything that we see is nails we think we can be pretty focused and selective on the uses of the relevant technology for the relevant problem but it all goes back to the the problem and the market need that we're trying to solve and identifying you know does that problem lend itself to a peer-to-peer structure for example does it does it have the need for you know provenance in the in the workflow for example at you that it's important that you keep track of where the asset has been throughout its life history which is very important for example in a private company example and when we are you know when we are satisfied that you know we understand what is the what is the need here what is a good market structure look like what is it what is the good market business model look like and then we sort of map them across all our available technologies and if we see that well for this particular case the you know the blockchain based solution seems to be the best best fit that is one way then that's when we try to sort of you know deploy that technology we will not trying to sort of bend the the problem to fit the technology because we have a very broad toolbox or many different technologies and and we're trying to to find the best fit for the problem and when we see that you know a distributed ledger infrastructure is what this problems needs to solve that is when we're looking to use it and I like you know how you are thinking about this in terms of this much broader toolbox of technologies and yet I know also that you launch this financial framework that enables companies to use blockchain in many different ways so can you first describe what the financial framework is yeah the financial framework is a framework that that allows strategically it allows the user to future-proof its techno tech Nicole roadmap so it is it allows you to come back to combine different kinds of data stores it for example allows you to combine a a blockchain with the traditional database it allows you to combine different kind of block chains it allows you to move from one data store to another so maybe today you want to use the traditional data base with a traditional market model but you may want to move to a new model and a distributed ledger database and then the way this all fits together on a modular basis allows you to do those changes and do those sort of transfers from one technology to another without you having to change the whole stack you can basically keep your application layer constant and vice versa if you want to move your applications or change your applications for various reasons you know you want to change the collateral management application or a settlement application or payment application you can swap those out without having to change the underlying data store so it is a modular framework that allows the company to yes I said future proves its technical roadmap for the future by having this modular structure so I am not familiar enough with the technology at least you know kind of like in this sort of deep back-end way to to fully understand exactly what some of this means in terms of future proofing but can you walk me through like you gave some examples of different types of services that companies might offer where they might use this framework like you mentioned collateral management or payments what would be an example of you know how a client might use this financial framework yeah so it can actually be used by almost any type of capital market participant I think what is closest to us is of course our supply or solutions to exchanges to clearing houses to depositories for market surveillance purposes for you know regulatory transparency so if you are a Central Depository for example this will allow you to use this framework maybe unchanged today but as the technology evolves as your business evolve it will allow you to continue to sort of adapt and transform your business models without having to do significant changes you to your technology even as your business changes and I think that is the key value of the Nasdaq financial framework then of course if you are a broker you could possibly use it as well or if you're a bank I can say use cases for it as well but you know an aspect the background has been in sort of exchange and an CCP business and I think that's where it that's where it sort of starts in terms of the use of the technology and what makes this possible is it is it launching technology no I mean it is integrated with blockchain technology and blockchain technology is a potential key component of it but it is it is it is technology independent you can use it with box chain technology or you can use it with you know traditional databases as well and that is what makes it so flexible that it's not tied to a particular kind of data storage and also it is not sort of tied to any particular applications either so it's a framework for capital markets use that allows the user to be sort of flexible in its use of it now and for the future and who is currently using it yeah so this is something we announced earlier this year we actually use it for our estonia initiative on the voting side our technology business that that you know sell and provide solutions to to our clients around the world or in discussion with a couple of clients about the about the use of it but it's a relatively new framework that we are continuously enhancing that we are you know looking to to the you know increasingly deploy over the coming years and is the business model for that software as a service you can you can deploy the nastic financial framework either way in your owns and data centers but it can also be deployed in a cloud definitely well that's a great thought I just want to pause things right here to bring in an important word from our sponsor on-ramp the best companies in the world obsess about branding killer branding will transcend your company and strategically and competitively position you in the market done well a remarkable brand will affect buyers and their purchase decisions and give your organization a voice that sets you up for long-term success on-ramp is a full-service creative agency that helps its clients maximize brand awareness gain market momentum and accelerate growth whether it's branding and identity for a new startup redesigning an existing website to generate traffic and leads or executing a custom design project or marketing strategy on-ramp will get your organization strategically poised for the future you can learn more and see examples of its work at think on-ramp com I'm speaking with Frederick Voss vice president of blockchain innovation at Nasdaq so we briefly touched on this but now that we have kind of a bigger overview of of what you are doing at Nasdaq well how would you characterize no-sex overall blockchain strategy yeah so I mentioned the three areas that are key interest to us post-trade plumbing regulatory transparency and relationship between a issuer of an asset and the holder of that asset and to to to sort of serve those areas we we our strategy is basically based upon we develop applications that leverage the inherent capabilities of distributed ledger protocols we actually don't develop those protocols ourselves we've been working and are working closely with chain as a as a protocol provider to to us we leverage the fact that we are both the technology supplier to capital markets around the world but we're also a service provider you know we run our own exchanges their own clearing houses our own depositories and that sort of gives us a unique insight in how these markets could potentially use the technology so I think our strategic approach is one of you know developing and having history developing high-quality applications to to these markets and actually leveraging the fact that we that we use those products ourselves and that gave gives a sort of a unique insight and understanding and capabilities of serving the needs of capital market service providers basically regardless of technology but it's definitely very helpful when you are embarking on looking at a new kind of technology like blockchain technology how do you see this technology helping the requirements you have you know for showing certain transactions to regulators well one of the strengths of the blockchain technology is of course it's very very good at keeping track or possession of a digitized asset especially in a peer-to-peer network environment and of course with the technology we think it's possible that you give a sort of like a special set of goggles to two regulators you know you can give them a special kind of node in the in the blockchain ledger networks that allows them to basically see what's going on on a broader scale and and with more transparency than today and that that is of course helpful that that could potentially allow regulators to faster and in more detail see where you have potentially concentration risks in a in a market ecosystem or systemic risks involving in a market now of course this all remains to be proven it looks to us like the technology could potentially have a lot to to offer on that front and you mentioned earlier that if things have evolved for Nasdaq in terms of the way that it's approaching blockchain you know three years ago as opposed to now what were the company's thoughts back then around what the technology would mean for Nasdaq I mean NASA I guess being a technology in the technology company in the financial space for over for over 20 years I mean you know as I said we investigate and explore all kinds of new technology so for us you know blockchain is more of a you know an ordinary workday than Christmas morning so we take upon us but you know the benefit of our clients ourselves and actually we are shareholders to to understand and explore or technologies and I think the common theme all new technologies I think the common theme for all of this is the quest for increased productivity increased efficiencies but also new potentially new business models and new alternative market structures and three years ago it was an idea it was a desire to better understand the potential of the technology in capital markets and now we see that there is you know good hope that the the technology has a potential in the future for a you know largest scale adoption in in capital markets so our understanding is better we understand that there is a long way to go before we see a very wide scale adoption of this technology in capital markets but we think now it looks more promising now than we thought three years ago I think is a good way of characterizing the situation oh well well that's interesting to me because you know as I mentioned the cartoon where every solution its it the joke is that every solution can every solution can be applied through a blockchain but because of that sort of like derisive attitude that people are abusing it or you know or don't know what to do with it or overusing it I'm actually surprised to hear that you are more optimistic about the potential what do you feel like you've learned over the last three years I mean first of all it won't be useful for all kinds of problems and you know in all kinds of market structures but we certainly see that there are cases and situations where a technology that is strong on keeping track of ownership of digitized securities on a peer-to-peer basis could play a significant role I think but ultimately this comes down to the market participants and the choice or their market structure so today many markets or or using a trusted third party in the middle like a CCP or a CSD you know you know they were happy with that and one should not try to squeeze in a technology that is not fit for that purpose but on the other hand we see markets like for example the private company market in the US that lends itself very well to this kind of structure actually already has that kind of structure but a blockchain based solution could be superior to the technology that is currently at hand so we we think it has the role to play but not for every kind or problem I think I want to sort of nuance that reply a little bit but why are you more optimistic now than you were even three years ago yeah first of all I think it's because of the general better understanding and of course the technology evolves we see that the protocols that are being worked on how they evolve in a in a constructive and positive way some of the problems that were identified with the technology so many of them remains to be solved but it looks promising that they could be solved I think we also have a better understanding of the you know how does the hardest solutions build on this technology fit into League in a regulatory framework so it's a it's it's a better understanding of the technology and it's a better understanding the potential role it could play and and and therefore it looks to us like you know it could have a role to play on the capital markets in the future and when you say that there are still ways that the technology needs to evolve or develop in order to you know really be useful you know in all the ways that you can imagine what are some of those things that you feel still need to happen it's still very much sort of a hope and a belief many of these things remains to be proven in production and on a large scale so you of course have issues around the poor man's scalability security how it fits into legal and regulatory frameworks for example so it is it is more about battle testing the the technology and figuring out and identifying what works well what doesn't work so well what needs to be changed and you know a couple of these issues are already being addressed I mean we if we talk about performance we talk about scalability what's available now is is much more performant and scalable protocols than we had like only two years ago so so we see how things evolve we understand that it still needs to be work that needs to be done but it looks quite promising to us so as you mention at the beginning of the call chain has been your partner for much of your blockchain work why did you choose chain and how does the division of labor break down between the two companies when you collaborate on something together yeah no we think they have they're a great team first and foremost they have great technology and that's of course two key to key parameters when choosing a partner you know or you know joint products of course we come with a vast experience of building applications for for use in capital markets we contribute that they are very good on the distributed ledger technology part we they have a great protocol and and we when we sort of sit down together and work on our joint projects you know I think we help them understand how their technology fits in capital market and they'll they help us to provide a you know high-performing let the protocol for what we need doing going forward for our bullying for example and for Estonian for some of the other projects we are working on so I think that's a very constructive match that we have with a with the guys with link chain army yeah when you talk about how you think they're a great team I actually also had Adam Lud when the the CEO of chain on the podcast earlier and you know he's always a very kind of insightful person to talk with about about this technology so something that's interesting to me is that I had spoken to you earlier and you talked with me a little bit about some of like the more mundane aspects of adopting this technology that are just important to consider like from a practical perspective can you talk a little bit about that you know like when you really get down to the nuts and bolts of trying to incorporate blockchain into an existing product or service what are some of the obstacles that you come up against first of all the we talked about that a couple of minutes ago about you know technology the technology is not the finished product so that will of course evolve over time but actually when we consider what are the biggest challenges to the adoption of the technology in capital markets on a large scale we think that the technology will evolve faster than than some of these other how some of these other mundane aspects will be addressed and one area I touched upon and that is of course the the legal or regulatory landscape many of these new alternative market models and ideas and and proposals for products and solutions that emanate from location technology they are so innovative that they are simply not contemplated by existing rules and regulations so the issue is not so much that regulation prohibiting the these new ideas it is more that they were not contemplated and therefore you have a legal void and legal uncertainty and when you have legal uncertainty it is difficult for market participant to allocate a lot of assets to those kinds of solutions so in parallel to technical innovation we think there is in many areas and need for legal and regulatory innovation and that is of course not a showstopper but you know we change laws and regulations all the time but it has an impact on the timeline because it's you know it's labor intensive work that needs some time to to to happen so that's one example another one is you know going from vision to to blueprints and the implementation of those blueprints is also not a showstopper but it's time consuming and has an impact on the timeline I mean we all hear about faster settlement less need for collateral cheaper solution so I think there is a common there is a lot of people that subscribe to the visions of what can blockchain bring but you need to go from those visions to to a blueprint of how do you want it to work and and many of the benefits of the technology is is is relying upon there being a network in the ecosystem or market participating adopting these new solutions based on the technology but then you need to find an agreement across these parties of how do you actually want it to work yeah we may have fast a settlement but how fast are we talking t + 0 what we talking t + a couple of hours are we talking optional settlement speeds and and just takes two take one example of one aspect that needs to be agreed upon and and agreeing on these blueprints also will we'll take take some a time and impact the timeline by which we see this technology being adopted and thirdly any any implementation of an adoption of a new technology it doesn't happen in a vacuum I mean it needs to fit into an ecosystem or already existing infrastructure so there is they need or integration of the technology and again we do integrate the capital market participants do integrate new technologies and systems all the time but it takes you know it is work and it takes time and also of course if we're talking about replacing old technology there also needs to be credible transition plans in in place before the market embarks on these big transitions you want to know that you are looking at a potentially successful transition before you invest in a new technology so I think those three areas legal regulation provisions blueprint and integration and transitions or three examples of sort of norm technical aspects that will be critical for the people we see the implementation on of the technology on a large scale in existing capital markets and can you walk me through what that would look like applied to for instance Nasdaq private market you know how long do you think it would take because as far as I understand there's currently five clients they are using the blockchain based solution and then all the others are still on the the previous version of the software that you had so what are all the steps that need to happen in order to get everybody on board with link yeah so I mean first of all if for the sake of argument saying that we are right in in what are the challenges to the wide scale adoption of the technology then of course we think that the commercial opportunities in the early stages will be those where you don't have a lot of those challenges so we think that iam early commercial opportunities will be in sort of regulatory light environment and in markets with relatively low technical complexity and that is actually one of the reasons why we pick the private market as one of our first markets it is actually a lower level of legal or regulatory complexity than if you're talking about public markets for example and also the level of technical sophistication in that market is relatively low compared again - for example topically listed market so so for some opportunities these three mundane obstacles to adoption are less prevalent and of course in those markets we will we think we will see an earlier adoption of the technology light for example in the private market but that will serve as a great you know testbed and data point for decisions on whether to deploy the technology for more complex and larger markets as well so not all markets have the same level of that complexity but even for link I thought that it would still take a while to roll out link to all of Nasdaq private market this was referenced in an earlier conversation that I had with you and at that time I you know you did say it will take a long long time and so I understand that this might have been the first application that you guys pursued because of these ideal conditions but even then I think it seems at least that's what you seem to be saying and their previous interview is that there's still hurdles yeah I think what I hope I said was that it'll take a long time before every every company every private company and every investor in private companies uses their technology of course it's all of sort of a traditional adaptation and adoption curve that you know some some participants in these markets will be earlier adopters than than others and one of the good things is that you don't have to do a big bag and cross the entire market you can sort of adopt adopt this on a on a let's say company by company basis but of course if you if you're a large private company with maybe hundreds of shareholders and you want to switch from a traditional technology to - to - to this kind of technology obviously it is more complex than if you were a to do that and if you're a new startup with maybe a handful of of investors because you really do not probably don't want to have different technologies running in parallel for the same for the same purpose so you know adoption of the technology will not be uniform it'll be it'll be sort of happening over time and and and depending upon the size and the need etcetera of the various companies who want to leverage the leverage disillusion so because I at least I consider Nasdaq further along than most other companies in incorporating blockchain technology into its business I have two questions for you based on your experience what is the biggest or what has been the biggest surprise to you in terms of what impact you expected blockchain technology would have on financial services and what impact it's actually having almost a little bit too early to to answer in terms of biggest surprises I mean so far I think compared to our experience from from looking at you know other technologies and and they're using a potential using capital markets we're sort of following the same curve in a way so so no surprises there I think it I don't know if it's a surprise but the very positive thing has been that even though even if it were to be that blockchain doesn't actually have a role in capital markets on a wide scale in the long term it has generated a debate about how do we structure a part of our ecosystem and it is also forced market participants or encouraged market participants to to talk to each other about some of the sort of collective utilities you know are we happy with how the post played plumbing work are we happy about the level of transparency we provide regulators and so on so maybe that has been a little bit surprising that the the energy with which the the community has engaged in this space and actually sort of encouraged the technology has sort of encouraged the financial markets to sort of look at some of its problems with fresh eyes I think that has been positive and then as I said in the beginning of the call that you know all innovation for over twenty years was focused on the front end finally we have sort of innovation focusing on the on the post rate plumbing of our capital markets so I think those are those are positive experiences over the last couple of years sort of regardless of what happens in the future in a way and based on your experience what advice would you give to other companies also looking to incorporate blotching into some of their products and services yeah I mean first really be thorough in in understanding what the the technology really is and what it can contribute avoid falling falling into the trap of doing POCs and projects just for the sake of doing it as you as you to your point before that it you know it is not a solution to all to all problems I would also say that because the technology potentially labels you know new business models and alternative market structures it is not just a faster engine it has potentially more fundamental more fundamental impact on on markets than that I think it's important to very early on engage your business side and your you know supporting functions like your compliance regulatory people in the process this is not just an affair for engineers and developers and technologists and what new products and services do you imagine that blockchain could help nasdaq offer in the future so you know first of all some of those will of course announce when we when we get there but I think it has definitely a role to play in the in the issuance and the sort of settlement processes of transactions in in in capital markets and I I can certainly see how it will allow us provide new services to to to markets link is an example of that and as a technology supplier it is interesting to see that now we're starting to get encouraging signs of people who want to sort of address new market opportunities coming coming to us and looking for technology so I think it potentially could lead us to sort of create new technical solutions building on the Gnostic financial frameworks to to satisfy some of the needs of the of the clients that have a DSN approaches with them so I think we will see some new services from from Nasdaq based on this and I think you could also see some new technical solutions and products coming out from Nasdaq as a consequence of this great well where can people learn more
