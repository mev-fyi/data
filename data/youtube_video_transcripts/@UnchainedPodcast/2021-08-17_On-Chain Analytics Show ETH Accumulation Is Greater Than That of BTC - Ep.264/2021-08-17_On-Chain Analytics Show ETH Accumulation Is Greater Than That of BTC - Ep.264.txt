partner at crypto venture fund one confirmation and frederick hogga co-founder and ceo at dune analytics welcome richard and frederick great to be here good to be here thanks when i first had the idea for this show it was when crypto had kind of broadly been moving sideways for a while and at least for bitcoin the on-chain analytics actually showed clear movement from weak hands to strong hands or long-term holders or hodlers depending on your terminology and i got curious about what on-chain analytics were showing for eth and related assets however since then actually eve has been on an upswing and to my mind largely that's been driven by the adoption of eip 1559 which had an effect on the monetary policy which we will describe later in the show and also driven by nft activity so at the time of this recording which is friday august 13th the price of eth is roughly three thousand dollars up from the low of two thousand dollar range a month ago and that's somewhat remarkable because at the moment the current language for crypto tax regulation in the us does not bode well for developers in the us however um i think you know as we'll see in the show the on-chain analytics really um you know maybe are kind of like divorced from from all that activity so richard and frederick why don't you each start with where you think the market is when it comes to eve and why the price has risen in this last month and um why don't we start with richard yeah um so first i'll caveat by saying i'm not a trader so i'm not making any short-term price predictions um but i will say that a lot of people have undervalued 1559 um there's just kind of a general lack of knowledge on how that affects the monetary policy of eth um versus like compared to like the bitcoin having uh where people uh i guess institutions and people outside of crypto generally knew what the having was and how that was going to affect bitcoin um so there was sort of like uh if an information asymmetry that i've seen uh from talking to like both institutions and like even like people in crypto um which i i think explains uh part of the recent price action and frederick what about you yeah i think i i pretty much agree it seems like you still get kind of these ketchup type of effects uh on the information uh on some of these or less accessible things going on then suddenly everybody's all over it and and then you get these huge uh run-ups uh because suddenly there's headlines everywhere about this new change uh while most of retail investors don't necessarily understand or see it coming even though in theory that information has been public for a long time yeah yeah and probably you know the ethereum community um you know there's kind of like that hardcore group um but you're right i think the institutions are the ones um that really move the needle when it comes to price well also whales but all right so before we get into the meat of the show um we want to just highlight for the listeners what it is about on-chain metrics that make this space different from traditional finance so richard and frederick can you explain why it is that you like to look at on-chain metrics and how you view that as being different from traditional finance i think it's worth thinking about for just for a moment how through traditional finance works and and data and essentially what happens there is you have kind of real-time data on trading of assets on exchanges right um but beyond that all the other stuff the economic activity that goes on in companies and so forth that's siloed in a company sits on their like proprietary servers and systems and then way later like three months or four months or whatever after it happens it goes into like this pdf and a public company will disclose sort of their numbers and the actual financial activity that that happened to them um and then sort of that is there's a whole industry in on like wall street and what not around analyzing this and understanding what's going on and there's like people paying or hedge funds for instance paying tons of money to get like a slight information advantage by figuring out something from like you know earth photos or whatever it might be um and then on sort of in the crypto world you have these financial products that's obviously built on the blockchain which is like a shared public backend for the world and anyone can look into it and this is like profound implications for like just how information works around what's going on so it's interesting because you essentially then can with something like doing or some other analytics tool you can you know go in and analyze and dissect this data the way you want from the activity that happens and you have then kind of financial products and that actual financial activity that would usually go in like a pdf three months later is occurring right there and then like there's actual revenues or you know financial value being moved around um and that means that you could directly publicly understand what's happening um in this financial system which is just absolutely radically different from from the existing world and and uh super duper exciting and i think still very much underutilized and they're appreciated by by a lot of folks um and i think you can even think of it as like the public in crypto has for free access to better data tools about what's going on in these systems than probably any bank ceo or regulator in the traditional world like if you're the ceo of a big bank like what assets do you hold then what's the exposure and all that and like you probably have a pretty good dashboard for that but it's highly likely that it's actually not as good and as uh comprehensive as what you can find on on chain metrics because anyone in the role can go and analyze this live um so i think that's incredibly exciting and and like one of the second order effects of crypto that's still uh kind of not quite um proliferated um into the marketing world yet but it's um super super interesting and i also want to add like the people who recognize this the most are actually the founders like the d5 founders who came from the traditional finance world and like saw both worlds um so a good example is uh hugh cart from nexus mutual for where before he started nexus uh for 15 years he was the csc uh cfo of munich a large insurance company and then whenever uh he shows uh nexus's uh kpis and dashboards to his friends in nutritional world they're all like blown away because like those people like can never find a dashboard um for their traditional insurer about kpis such as like active premiums in force um like price to book um like all these like fundamental kpis which are just like hidden in like quarterly pdfs whereas uh because nexus mutual is on chain on ethereum you can get all that data in real time and it's just um it just like amazes them like how much transparency there is uh for d5 yeah and one other thing i would add to it is it's not even just the on-chain metrics but even just being able to see how the community is talking in the forums because normally for a company or whatever the decision makers whatever their thoughts are would be um hidden they wouldn't be something that would be just available to any random uh shareholder but in a crypto community you can kind of see like what is a community saying where is sentiment going like that kind of thing and so that also is another difference um all right so let's dive now into these metrics and i actually so even though you know the topic is kind of like if broadly which is composed of a few different topics i really want to start with nfts because that's where the action is nowadays and when i was doing research for this episode my mind was just kind of blown because um you know if you've been listening my show i haven't really done much on nfts except for axiomfinity and so i was just like whoa um but anyway all right so what are the notable aspects you're seeing in the nft market right now especially when it comes to on-chain metrics well first um like open seas like uh there are kpis that like completely exploded in like monthly volume i i saw the other day that uh there's like only 30 something uh companies in the world that have like over a billion in uh gmv um and like open c is like on pace uh to be like one of those um and like they've the company's only been around for like about three years so i guess a lot of the volume growth has been driven by like pfps which are like these avatar projects um that i know people like to trade and speculate on and also like use as their avatars and like open seas like been benefiting from just being the marketplace for a search and discovery um for these avatars uh so that's been like one of the big trends in nfts in the last few weeks and what is a pfp uh a profile picture oh okay i think what crazy to see with the the openc volume is how it it showed up to i guess around 100 million in in trading volume a month in uh like earlier this year and it felt like that was like really an explosive moment and then came a little bit down in in like april or something and then now it's like 700 million so far in august so it's it's like it's insane when you see some of these hockey sticks sort of play out where you you think that oh that that was like the peak and then that just absolutely dwarfed um a couple months uh later wow wait so it's already 700 billion for august million uh yes yes 765 million in august which it's only been about uh half the month so far that's crazy because the volume in july was 325 million so yep yeah okay so it's already more than doubled uh july and it's only been uh less than half of the month okay wow yeah and i did also see a glass node report that said that 63 000 addresses interacted with openc in july but that in the first three days of august alone already 28 000 addresses had interacted with openc so at that point and like now it's up to 92 000 uh well with the first half of august wow okay so like all their kpis have like uh dwarfed um like all of august like kpis have dwarf julys and like it's not uh been the end of the month yet yeah we're not even halfway through uh and just also in case people don't know kpi stands for key performance indicator you can see it in richard's public viewing dashboard it's all out there oh oh yeah yeah yeah uh which we'll put we'll put that in the show notes um so when you see all that like you know do you would you get a sense of what is driving this interest in nfts or who's getting into the space or like why it's growing so exponentially yeah i had this mental model that defy is crypto for elites and like nfts is a crypto for normies and like the reason i say that is like for d5 uh there's just kind of a higher barrier to entry like one gas fees a price out a lot of people and like two uh there's a lot of like financial vocabulary you need to know like you need to know like what derivatives are like what's a perpetual swap like how options work um there's like a lot of trading terminology which is why a lot of the d5 activity has been driven by whales and traders and like more sophisticated people um whereas nfts um like when i explained fts to my parents like they understood it immediately uh just because it's something very relatable uh to like most like everyday people um because you're you're just like buying a culture and like you know investing in like athletes art music entertainment um and like that's just something that uh retail people like understand better uh which is why if you look at like kind of mainstream media coverage um you saw like nfts cross the chasm to like mainstream attention like much faster than uh d5 and can you tell us how it was that you explained nfts to your parents because yeah i'm just curious to hear how you would explain it to a non-crypto person yeah i i think like the best analogy is like collectibles uh like things like sports cards beanie babies um like just assets that you find like have like sentimental value with to um and like it could also have like monetary value except uh rather than like kind of like a physical asset it's just um like a digital like file um on the blockchain and i'd say also conceptually i think it's pretty easy for most people to to get to the conclusion that a lot of art is just sort of scarcity and uh like a claim on something that's scarce um that that would matter not sort of per se the physical object or whatever um and i think there's this interesting analogy where it's like if you perfectly manage to recreate like uh davinci painting like two down to the atom would you want the original that's like done by uh darwin's or do you want like the perfect replica which is the exact same physical thing like obviously you want the original um but there's nothing physical that's that's separating those two right um and i feel like that's even though like you can send a jpeg file wherever who to whoever um that's not sort of uh the scarcity in art it's not about distribution and production first and foremost it's about authenticity and knowing that you have something that others can't have um and i think that's why nfts are actually not that hard to grasp um because it's kind of hard to dispute the claims i just made i think yeah and i think also when you have that kind of emotional response to something then for whoever that person is that has that response it could be what to them as like a priceless object and so in a way that um means that like the prices of these might seem outrageous to other people but to that person it's it's worth it and that's really all that matters um so you know as we were talking about these open c metrics really really show that it's uh ramping up very very quickly um and i just wondered do you think that this level of interest is sustainable or do you think that we're kind of in the beginning of a bubble or at maybe at the peak of a bubble i don't know um what's your sense of where this market activity is going um well the last time like uh open seas kpis like when kind of hockey stick was in march and then you know people thought that was bubble and then it went down for a little bit uh but it was like the shortest bubble ever and like like two months later then like it's like reached new all-time highs so i i think like like this is like a huge um new market that's like uniquely enabled and like open c has like the upside to be like the next ebay or even like have a higher like market cap than ebay um just like how coinbase has like a higher market cap than like traditional brokerages so i i think there's still a lot of upside potential for nfts and openc broadly so i'll take a little bit of a counter position and say that i think that on the long time horizon i think uh what richard is saying is makes sense and is indeed true but um i do get some sort of the same feelings as like 2017 icos where it's like there's a lot of opportunistic folks um hopping on right now and i it seems like there's some like relatively low effort projects that sort of end up turning into money for people uh that might not be around for the long term but uh anyway i also think that like there's some really proper uh long-term stuff being created and eventually i think like these metrics will be dwarfed again but but my sense is that uh the current sort of hype might will probably sort of cool off a little bit uh for for some time as well yeah and i yeah generally like the volume like graphs it's like it goes up and then it goes down a little bit but like each new all-time high like dwarfs like the previous all-time highs so um it's not like a perfectly uh up into the right hockey stick graph but like it kind of has like mini bubbles where like the long-term cycle uh is still um like up into the right yeah and what i would say here is that there's probably a difference between like a bubble for open sea meaning that the the market for open seat could continue to grow and grow and grow but for individual nft drops it might be that the prices for those are inflated um you know whereas like you know the the total addressable market for nfts may be probably we've barely scratched the surface for it yet um but i actually did then want to ask you about that uh for the individual nfts um can you talk a little bit about what you believe it is that makes these nfts or or or do you believe that these entities will keep their value over time or do you think that right now what's happening is that the prices are popping now but that over the long term they'll kind of deflate like do you feel like this is sort of a situation where people are like like a gold rush and they're just kind of trying to flip these nfts i say 99 of nfts won't keep their value long-term um i think it's uh going to like consolidate into like a winner take all market and like that's generally true of like the traditional world where like lebron james like cards are like worth orders of magnitude more than like some random nba player or like a painting by picasso is worth more than like some random artist like the blue chip nfts um i'd say right now are like one of one crypto art on super rare by artists like uh x copy pack hackathon and others and then uh for collectibles i think the big three are crypto punks me bits and board apes um and like uh the like the long tail collectibles like what i've seen is like mostly uh traitors and like flipping right now yeah what do you think of this ether rock thing uh i haven't heard of that one oh the the rocks that they're just different shades that they're all the same rock oh yeah there's a bunch of these uh avatars projects there's like addition of 10 000 uh each has like different attributes uh and then people pay like 2 000 way to like mint them like when it drops so uh yeah very 2017. well but but actually the ether rug thing was from 2017 and then like people recently rediscovered the smart contract and then they finished out minting the rest of the rocks that's what happened um so i think that there's in terms of the the value maintaining i think also and and i think like richard is correct in the sense that like a lot of art just like you get this winner takes all lasting a lot of culture but um i think that's also an aspect of this like a thousand two true fans thing uh that like if you have a thousand pounds on the internet you can probably make a living of what you do because like if you get ten dollars from each then suddenly it sort of matters um and i think that could be the case for a lot of the creators that are not necessarily uh you know huge or gonna be huge for the next next drake or whatever but they could still now actually issue something and and and have if they have a fan base or thousand fans um they could like actually sell something scarce to them and and have them as part of their community and actually make money of it um and i think that's pretty exciting um and just the fact that like any creator can issue some authentic or work like previously in music typically you you kind of have to do merch or you have to do concerts right because that's the only thing that's actually scarce um but now that you can say like you have this gold version of a song or or whatever it might be you can actually or financially tap into your audience globally without having to sort of do the physical thing and i think that makes a lot of sense and and the large extent a lot of merch and whatnot is just a proxy for uh you know scarce uh thing and that the artist created um and that's especially true for video artists uh visual artists um whereas uh before like the primary uh revenue stream for visual artists was commissions like they would do um an ad for a fortune 500 company i kind of do the visuals for that and like that's how they made a living um because like these uh digital artists uh don't uh do sell paintings or physical um like works of art but now with nfts they can actually sell like basically the digital equivalent of paintings and like that's a more like one-to-one uh like translation of like value like their creative activity and like how much like value they're getting out of it rather than having to rely on like commissions or like some of these like other proxies uh for making a living so like that's huge for these artists just to have like a new uh business model for them yeah so you know what we were saying earlier about how 99 of these may not retain their value in a way you know that's just for the consumer or the investor or whatever you want to call them but when it comes to the creator actually they're gaining a lot more value than they would through traditional routes so um as a creator myself i would kind of applaud that model um so um now let's kind of talk about you know how this activity is affecting the different blockchains um richard i did see your partner nick tomeno a tweet quote nba top shots 350 million dollars plus in venture funding is an awesome product but there's now six nft projects with roughly zero in venture funding doing consistently more volume why ethereum and then i saw that fred wilson of union square ventures and rohm gary gosliw of zepperlabs which created nba top shot uh kind of got into a little tweet discussion with him about it and you know fred said oh it's because it's not nba season and flo has new offerings in store and roham said quote none of us would be talking about nfts if topshop was on ethereum it would have failed out of the gate with impossibly poor ux so when you look at these metrics i was curious um what do you think is the future of these different blockchains that support nfts like do you guys think that ethereum will continue to remain in the lead or do you think other chains will take market share or maybe even overtake ethereum i think at the end of the day it comes down to like scalability and like how much gas price like prices out like retail users uh so i see ethereum as great for like high dollar value low throughput use cases so like one of one crypto where you're gonna spend five six figures on a piece of art it doesn't matter if you're paying twenty 20 to bid on the artwork because like you're and you end up paying like way more um before these like in-game assets and like these maybe like five ten dollar uh nfts uh then it makes more sense to be on a scalable blockchain and we've actually seen a big explosion of usage on a polygon which is an ethereum side chain so like open c recently a few months ago they uh deployed their contracts to polygons so now um creatives can like create like mint new nfts on polygon and like the gas fees there are maybe like one two cents so it's it's negligible uh so there's actually a game called uh zed run on polygon that's been uh taking off and it's like these like horses that you race um and like they've been driving a lot of the nft activity and volume on polygon um so overall i'd say there's definitely room uh for other chains uh that enable like scalability and like new use cases of nfts and i think like polygon is one um axia infinity has their own layer two uh called ronin um and there's also flow um but those tend to be the big chains i can think of i think i think there's like a lot of the same problems as with other ethereum alternatives uh in the sense like for instance you you would need like funds to buy this stuff like if you want to buy an nft on on ethereum like there's a high likelihood that you actually have like some heat or stable coins in the wallet that you could use to to fund that um and then so in in this other world of a new chain then it's it's kind of hard to get started um but also i guess some of these are kind of taking a different route and trying to reach audiences that don't currently have an ethereum wallet and then that could make a lot of sense so i think it's uh still very early i'm very excited to see so what their metrics look like by the end of this year on these new layer twos on ethereum and see what the usage actually look like it's still very so preliminary uh and then kind of hard to understand exactly how much usage they're actually getting um and see that across all the different systems and that's also something we're working on um to see just like stack up against each other uh all the layer twos and the different layer ones and see where the activity is actually moving to okay yeah i do have some questions about layer twos um but we'll we'll kind of cover that a little bit later in the show i actually did want to ask one other thing about kind of like nfts from the buyer perspective um you know i did notice that like in the last 30 days nft secondary sales have doubled it was about 15 000 a month ago it's more than 30 000 as of wednesday um you know what do you think accounts for that and maybe it's just the fact that there's more nfts but um do you see that secondary sales will continue to be a big part of the nft activity on an ongoing basis or do you think it's just now because we may be in this kind of hype cycle and people are sort of like flipping them i think secondary sales are healthy and like this is really pronounced in like crypto arts so uh august is actually the first month uh that's like secondary sales eclipse primary sales for super air which is uh the largest crypto or marketplace and i think the reason is because like the og artists like x copy cole the hackathon and others uh their floor prices all like rose dramatically uh so like kind of the nft community is like kind of coming to consensus that these are like the og one of one crypto art that are going to be good source of value and that's why there's been a lot of big secondary sales like if if a platform doesn't have a lot of secondary sales then it's mostly just like artists doing drops um but like those nfts aren't going to have don't have much value if they're not being um resold at like significant uh markups because uh people don't think of them as like og artworks okay yeah so i guess we'll sort of have to see over time um how this plays out for for some of the other names that aren't the ogs all right so um in a moment we're going to now switch topics and touch on d5 which i know a lot of people are interested in but first a quick word from the

little bit of a lull down from some of the highs in may uh but over the last month it's actually risen steadily so what's your take on what's happening now with c5 so i think it's it's kind of established itself at a pretty solid position if you will if you look at for instance uh dex trading volumes that absolutely exploded like over essentially in the last year um started from and then it peaked in may but now we see so essentially in may it was 170 billion dollars traded on decentralized exchanges and essentially all the months before may and now after may were at around 80 billion dollars um so it's not even though it's sort of down from that peak it's still like a very substantial amount to just put it in perspective if you look at like the main numbers cherry picking a little bit but in 2019 it was 250 million um in 2020 it was 1 billion so up up 4x and then now in 2021 it was 170 billion which is like up 170x uh over the last year right so you've had this absolutely undeniable rise in these metrics where where all of this went from you know a promising toy to actually showing volumes that you know uni swap was over coinbase on certain days um and essentially it's managed to establish itself on that position where this is something that's been very actively used and the trading volumes are significant on all months and all days um despite some fluctuations and that's frankly also what happens in uh for traditional financial markets when when there's uh price volatility the volumes go up and that the same thing is is playing out in in the deck space to me that only sort of tells us that that this is actually sort of being used as as any other financial markets right um which is pretty amazing it's really only two years since it was just like this tiny thing with a few hundred uh million dollars in trading volume um and now it's it's undeniably here and staying so that's uh i think that's at least uh really telling um of sort of the d5 space even though it's still you know up up and down richard do you want to add anything yeah i think like d5 activity largely just follows like price action so uh you know when uh there was a lot of trading activity like when prices were high in like april and may and then it's it's pretty uh correlated with that and out and loans i think outstanding loans now are like around 21 billion and that's up about 3x over the last year so a year ago it was around 7 billion um so it's like significant decrease but but kind of less exponential than the dex side um but it's like keeps growing and kind of same with stable coins i think the issuance now is around 80 billion in in-state stable coins on ethereum and it's like consistently i think around 100 billion a day that's being transferred let me double check that i'm saying this correctly yeah no sorry it's about 20 billion uh in like daily trading like transfer volume of uh stable coins um so i'd say sort of all of these things are going up and to the right even even though at various pace yeah one other thing that i want to ask about was so richard i know that your june analytics board has this like a dashboard i guess for a number of defy users but i have to quibble with the phrasing there because is it really users it's like wallets right because it's yeah unique addresses yeah which i have a disclaimer at the top of the dashboard because like that's always the best you can never post these stats without getting that one right but why don't you yeah why don't you just make sure you always get like twitter and magazines because why don't you just make the language more accurate just say you need to just it's already named like if i use like it's the link uh for the gosh but can't you change the title anyway even though the link the url is the old link yeah well i have the disclaimer already in the title okay well yeah i i would actually just change the language but but you you do whatever you want um but i did wonder so you know i don't know what we can glean from that but like do you actually think that the number of users has increased or do you think it's just the same kind of core group of people that are you know kind of being good with their opsec and you know using different wallets or what's going on there i mean like number of users has definitely increased i mean you can discount it by um maybe like a factor of five for like however um like what you think the average number of uh wallets that a user uses um i think like mainly because uh you know during d5 summer when you had like yield farming all these crazy interest rates that brought a lot of new people into d5 that was like responsible for like the first uh part of the exponential growth uh so like a number of uh users like in d5 is still like increased significantly over the last year and right now would you say that the d5 space is still attracting new users and if so what's bringing them in i think yield is a big thing just because like you know we're in a zero interest rate environment uh and like when you can earn like 10 to 15 percent uh apys on stable coins uh in d5 uh right now um that's just attractive to a lot of people um so i i know of like friends personally outside of crypto who have like started to move money into crypto to like earn those yields um i expect that to that trend to like continue over time in uh one inches uh tune dashboard they track uh how many addresses that they have as users that are new or old and i think that so they have basically the second most users after unisport so uniswap is at like around 130 000 addresses per week and i think one inch does about 30 000. um and looking at their stats they have about about 40 are are existing and 60 are actually new so whether that means that people getting new addresses or it's actually new users of course you you can never exactly know it's at least not just the same addresses you know interacting all the time okay so yeah it's hard to to conclude anything and well one other thing that i wanted to ask about so we did talk about dexes and frederick you did make a few comments about lending but i did want to ask like are there any other trends that you are seeing there learning is interesting because in one way it moves a little bit slower you know because you need to have collateral and and you can have sort of uh you need to be more careful with risks and volatility than than in sort of the the trading space right so um i think that in that sense it's like fewer assets and and can just not the same extent sort of uh shift around uh super quickly um one thing that i can mention it's pretty cool i i mentioned you know how these this open data enables new cases and and one thing maker has been doing recently it's like building a dune dashboard with their actual financial statement uh like you kind of would see for a bank so they have a balance sheet they have profit and loss and you can see this live from the from the blockchain and one interesting thing you can see is that in may they did like 30 million in revenues and i think 20ish of that was lending income and then 10 million on top of that was liquidation income um and then it went back to uh you know just being lending income and not that much liquidations um so that's like a fascinating thing you can now actually see uh in the data how sort of these systems uh revenues uh in addition to kind of their exposure risks actually are affected by by events all right yeah this is uh clearly as we were talking about earlier something that's new and different um so then now just a general question so you know obviously we started discussing nfts because that's at the moment where all this activities all this activity is um but you know i did think last year that oh maybe defy will be one of the drivers of the next bull market um but at the moment i'm kind of like oh maybe it's going to be nfts so what's your sense of where defy is headed for the rest of the year and what role it will play in this bull market uh i think the next thing in d5 is uh derivatives um because i i think a lot of the spot markets and like fundamental building blocks and d5 have already been laid down so you have like lending and borrowing like compound ave you have spot markets like unit swap um but there are still like spaces and derivatives in like d5 are still wide open like for example options is still like a wide open problem and like no uh project to date has like uh and defy has like captured significant market sharing options uh just because it's a very hard problem to solve and you can't map traditional finance options like how those are designed one to one on d5 um so um we also we just invested in a project called uh primitive uh which is launching in a few months uh and like they're uh going to be like the unit swap of options in terms of like creating um like a very zero to one amm in terms of how these are priced um outside of options there's also structured products um just ways to make it easier for a retail to earn yield or get like a exposure to like an etf like product so like one very successful structured product is uh the d5 pulse index is basically like one token where you own like a basket of blue chip uh defy coins like comp uni ave mkr and others um and then you also have you can also have structured products like leverage products so like 2x uh bitcoin and 2x eth products where you don't have to go on compound and like manage your margin accounts you can also have inverse tokens so if you look at like all the top most widely traded products um in traditional finance on like nasdaq and new york stock exchange like a lot of them are structured products like qqq spy and others and i think um that space is going to continue to grow in d5 i i very much agree on on the like index products for instance i think it's super exciting and it's a way for people that are less immersed in in the space to get exposure to what's going on like if you you know you maybe have some bitcoin you may have some eats but then like getting on to like the crazy world of all of these various tokens and coins can be really hard and then if you can just take exposure to then like it's kind of the same dynamic that most people have with the stock market right where they they don't necessarily care about stock picking or sort of what they want to invest in they just want to sort of have exposure to the whole thing um and that is really really cool to have that for the token economy as well like you mentioned like d5 pulse index they've been growing really really nicely um and they also for instance have like really cool charts on incent device versus an incentivized supply of light users so they track and you can see like the share of um an incentivized supply like really taking over uh over time so they started out with like 90 percent incentivized where people get tokens to to be part of the system right and then eventually it turns into all organic um which is which is really cool to see all right so one uh thing i want to ask about this is um maybe less about on chain metrics than just sort of where all this is headed but i did see this tweet by chao wang formerly of masari and he said the final form of the most interesting crypto apps will be those lying at the intersection of finance gaming social networking and community engagement there will no longer be any dichotomy between these verticals every app will be nothing and everything at once i wondered what you thought of that statement and if you even could think of any examples like it sounds super interesting to me but i was like what does that even look like and and i didn't even know if it was just something that sounded cool or you know other people thought there was something to it i think it sounds very buzz buzzwordy and something that could get a lot of retweets uh but i i can't really think of an app um well or maybe it's just like way too early to like think of like new use cases uh enabled by all these different uh trends and like lie at the intersection of all these trends what's your take i guess i kind of agree but i think that there's definitely like something very deep to the fact that you can sort of program scarcity and value into sort of any type of application and obviously i guess furthermore there's been this like metaverse uh word that suddenly is everywhere uh because zuckerberg mentioned it and what not um and i think it like seems likely that sort of nfts will will play a role in in like a more internet kind of native world uh and ownership around that um and then obviously the tradability of these things are kind of inherent in what's happening on on the blockchain so um i think sort of yes uh there's there's a high probability that some of this stuff will sort of meet uh in ways that it couldn't and wouldn't uh previously but uh i guess also like this uh you know you need to build a nice experience for users and and do something novel that people actually care about um and that's kind of yeah not trivial and and it can take a long time and i don't think it's gonna change everything overnight um yeah the only example that i could think of that sort of seemed you know to to be a description or to to be an example of this description was actually infinity because so obviously at its core it's a game but then because um the axes are scarce now you know there are these teams that are um loading out their axes for people that want to get in and so in that regard that is you know these elements of social networking and community engagement uh i guess actually infinity may be still listening missing the finance piece although i guess you could say like later earned or just the fact that you earn money from it is finance so i don't know anyway that was like the only example i could think of but all right um so now let's talk about ethereum because that's kind of uh where you know most of this activity is happening and obviously we did talk about how eip159 was this big change that happened on ethereum and so for people who may have missed the episodes i did on eip1559 and on ethan's ultrasound money um so essentially now with this london hard fork upgrade the transaction fees are now broken out into base fees for transactions which end up getting burned and then priority fees which are tips that go to the miners so in this first week after the london hard fork a hundred million dollars worth of eth was burned and glaston reports that that's about 35 of the issuance so um i'm curious to hear richard and frederick what were your expectations with this upgrade and how has the reality compared yeah 1559 uh solves the big problem like the big question that people always ask is like how does eath capture value and like now with 1559 like directly captures value from all the economic activity that are happening on chain so you can actually now apply you know real world the traditional finance like valuation models to ethereum based on fees and like how much transaction volume economic economic activity is happening um i actually just created a dune dashboard yesterday uh looking at our portfolio companies and like how much they contribute uh to like eth being burned um it's interesting that open seas um is like leading by far they've burned uh over 4 600 eats uh since um 1559 launched which is um about 13 million i think fourteen uh so openc is like one of the largest um like sources of revenue for ethereum yeah um it's been really cool to see uh it play out and i think also it's a kind of an important data point in the evolution of ethereum in general like it it's only so often that there's actually an hard fork um and uh throughout that these like relatively radical changes can be done i guess like a lot of bitcoin folks will think that this is a really bad thing but but sort of given the the trajectory and sort of social contract uh where this project is headed um it's i think it's encouraging to see that something like this can actually be figured out uh in a open way and decided upon even though it's kind of controversial and then um actually implemented pretty smoothly um so that's also i think a big takeaway and maybe also a lot of why the sort of the price action beyond of course the news or issues um but the fact that this project can actually coordinate um and and upgrade itself uh over time yeah one thing i will say is you know about how openc is um the top burner of eve since the upgrade um you know i was looking at the times when the net issuance on ethereum turned negative in this past week and it was basically during nft drops and um you know it's funny because in one of the episodes that they recorded like i hadn't even heard of one at the end of t try well actually for so for the research for this episode i actually hadn't heard of any of these until having to do research for these episodes um one was called covet punks the other was art blocks the last one was fluff world nfts and they're it's like digital rabbits um but uh the point is that it's so similar to the ico craze when during the icos the usage on the blockchain would be so um congested that you know all these transactions were failing and um like even if you had some other transaction that you were trying to do that was not even related to the ico it wouldn't you know go through and during that time you know it was just that ethereum wasn't really usable um but here it is now that um so i'm not sure how it's affecting usage but um but regardless like the demand for eth at that moment for usage of these this based on these ethereum blocks is helping then add value to eth by making the net issuance negative so um so at least you know i agree that eip1559 is like a a change that should be beneficial to the ethereum price in that regard um so one other thing i want to ask about was you know times with bitcoin when looking on chain metrics you can kind of see when uh bitcoin is moving to offline cold wallets and um this is often a proxy for like institutions or whales that are buying bitcoin basically and the blocks frank chaparro recently reported that institutions are demanding eth and it's actually causing firms like naidig and fidelity to expand into eth and as we know uh in coinbase the second quarter eath trading volumes did top bitcoin volumes for the first time so um frank reported that his sources were saying that the reason these institutions are having to expand into is or wanting to expand in east is that they're looking for yield so i wondered does on-chain activity show that ethan is moving to offline cold wallets or what are you seeing in that regard i'm not sure about the offline cold wallets but like one metric that we track internally at one confirmation is a number of uh unique addresses that hold more than like zero that hold more than uh one each so it's kind of a proxy for like how many users believe in eth um as um a digital currency on our and are holding um like that metric has been like going up into the right over like the past year so more so than bitcoin like the growth rate is much more pronounced than bitcoin uh so that does support the narrative that uh there's like more people whether or not institutions or retail that are buying eth okay yeah i guess like the one thing is obviously ethan is so much cheaper than bitcoin so um the fact that it slowed down for bitcoin but not eth probably i don't know well so for bitcoin uh we actually tracked uh 0.01 so like the dollar value is like still like roughly oh wow you can't you can't compare like one each to like one bit right oh okay so even when you make that comparison then the accumulation of ethos still uh yeah if you take like roughly the the same uh dollar value of ethan bitcoin the accumulation of eth is growing at a faster pace than big oh wow oh interesting and i guess also in one way there's a difference here where sorry the best thing for bitcoin uh is kind of if just the supply disappears right that no one sort of touches their bitcoin if you will uh and then that's just like their scarcity uh but kind of ethereum also want to be used it's a computer right that has a bunch of applications that people uh it's a good thing if they use it so so i think it's in one way of course it's good if people sort of invest and believe in in the currency but you also sort of if we didn't have all of this like on-chain activity that we've been talking about now for the last hour um that would be really bad right you want addresses to engage and use these protocols and spend their heat on gas and and be engaged with the system as well and i think that's just as important as uh how many are are holding it um and i think i guess so sort of those data points together is what really tells you it's like there's interesting stuff going on with it right because then eth at least for two of the three characteristics of money um is displaying those characteristics one would be as historic value and the other is as a medium of exchange so all right so now let's we're running out of time so let's touch on layer twos which came up earlier um what are you seeing in terms of the layer two race i did happen to look at a website called l2 beat and the top two projects by value locked or dydx and loop ring both of which use zk roll up technology um you know fourth is optimism which uses optimistic roll-ups um after that the value locked was kind of a steep drop so i just was curious like what are you guys seeing in terms of metrics when it comes to layer twos where do you think that composition competition is going yeah optimistic roll-ups are like just around the corner it's like right now both arbitrage and optimism have like kind of private uh like quote-unquote soft launches so like developers can move their dapps over although there's still like trading limits uh just to like work out the bugs uh so like it hasn't gotten it's like full user activity like once those launch uh then there's gonna be a lot of activity on layer two a lot of volume as well as um like a lot of money that's like moving between layer one and layer two um and like there's actually a project called a hop exchange that's uh making uh creating like a fast a nice uh ux bridge between layer one and layer two and like between layer two and layer two um in a non-custodial way because uh kind of the current solutions are all relying on multi-sigs uh but uh those are pretty insecure yeah so for optimism for instance the number of transactions has been trending upwards uh it's currently like 30 000 a day um but i guess that's like still not that much actually it seems like it's still even though these things are kind of alive uh it's still too early to judge if they're actually getting adoption or like they they need to actually fully release it and and then you need to look at the metrics and see are people actually embracing this um and i think that's going to be one of the key questions for the rest of this year to understand um what what that activity actually looks like on the chain and not just like these concept concepts of how we can scale this but obviously blueprint has been uh around for a long time and is doing really well as far as i can see yeah and i i did also see 0x labs reported that um although the so it because zero exit gas is on polygon in addition on ethereum and it said that the polygon transaction count exceeds the one on ethereum but it said the average trade size on polygon is about 750 well sorry this was back in july so but this may be old data but um so the average trade size on polygon was 750 but on ethereum it was 19 000. so i wonder you know do you think um we are seeing that the layer twos are able to kind of draw in a different user and and enable new behaviors that are sort of prohibited due to the cost of gas on ethereum yeah absolutely like that supports the thesis that like layer twos uh and side chains are good for uh the low dollar value high throughput use cases if like transaction count is so high but like the average dollar value being transacted is like also low okay and at the moment do you feel like there's any layer two that you kind of would put your money on uh well polygon isn't quite a layer two it's it's a side chain but uh polygon is like one that's like probably the only player two side chain that's like has like a decent amount of traction i i think uh i forgot was a curve of a uh one of the blue chip d5 projects actually has like more tvl uh on polygon than layer one um so that there is actually like a real usage uh on polygon okay that's for layer two i think blue frame is like the most time tested if you wanted to do trades um it's been battle tested um and and they've done a couple of billions at least in billion in volume in trading volumes so yeah all right so we'll just have to see how that plays out um earlier this year there was a lot of hand wringing about competitors like binance smart chain and solana you know hand-wringing amongst the ethereum set so what would you say the metrics show in terms of that does ethereum still need to worry about losing market share to these other chains uh with binance smart chain like a lot of the use cases were around like the d-gen yield farming uh so it kind of like ethereum d5 somewhere back in like july august uh and like when that cooled down then like all that activity just like shifted over to binance smart chain uh so it's a lot of like short-term uh trading activity uh but like i haven't really seen any long-term serious projects uh being built on buying smart chain i think a big reason is like credible neutrality is because if the thesis is that institutions are going to adopt uh blockchain tech cryptocurrencies in a meaningful way they want to do on a credible neutral platform like ethereum not like cz or binance's pet project um which is why like ethereum has uh that advantage for more institutional adoption of d5 so now but a question for you because i you may have seen that on twitter the the week that we are recording this i released some clips of my last show in which justin drake of the ethereum foundation you know was saying things about bitcoin and um i saw a lot of people you know discussing some of the things he said like you know he was bringing up whether or not uh bitcoin could safely transition to a model in which it was being secured uh simply by transaction fees and then but he also said that he thought ethereum was satoshi's vision um so uh one thing is that i noticed that a lot of bitcoiners were saying to me that they thought that you know ethereum was basically centralized and um even things like they thought that it was a security but uh the sec did already come out and say that it wasn't a security so i'm not sure why they were saying that um but i think they were just trying to apply it like they think it's centralized so what's the difference between why you know you the way that you phrased it you seem to think that ethereum is not even though it has like an identifiable creator whereas you think binance smart chain might be well biased marching has only 21 validators and they're all run by uh binance and also i think a major component of decentralization is like how easy it is for anyone to spin up on their own node and like for binance smart chain uh because they increase the uh the blocks limit uh so high you need to have like a really dedicated hardware setup in order to run a binance uh smart chain node in order to sync uh to the latest block whereas for ethereum uh you could even run a ethereum node on a raspberry pi um just because the uh the sync is a lot um more friendly for like uh retail like hardware and two you mentioned also like solana and i think that i guess there's a little bit of a difference there where uh balance chain when the smart chain so anyone can in theory kind of pretty easily move ethereum stuff over while solana is like a whole different setup and stack and then programming language and all of that and that means that like they they're kind of taking a harder route but it also probably makes them more resilient right and then like they're building up a ecosystem more from the ground up um which i think makes them like uh more potentially like powerful longer term uh competition to to ethereum um and i think that's like just super healthy that there's something else that also pushing it and trying to make from a a slightly different version of like the future of finance uh in parallel and then sort of the pressure is on on ethereum to develop and realize its vision as soon as possible and do you think so now we're kind of like talking about the the merge which is when um all the activity on ethereum 1.0 actually finally shifts over to uh the so-called beacon chain on ethereum two i do so how do you think that's going to go and do you think ethereum um you know like i said earlier does it still need to worry about losing market share to chains like solana probably hopefully they should always sort of worry about that i think it's like kind of you know any ecosystem sort of is healthy if there's some competitive competition going on um so i think that if if uh sort of ethereum developers and the ethereum ecosystem just thinks that they've sort of gotten to this unbeatable position that's probably not a healthy thing for that project so but are you seeing anything on chain that that makes you think you know this is happening yeah so currently no i'd say it's like still too early um and uh these new systems even though they have like project building on them and and there are some users it still seems like it it's very early um and the the key question is like can they actually obtain sort of other traffic i think or like other usage that's not just like directly forks or kind of copies of what's happening on ethereum but something that's like actually theirs and like organically or like by then driven um and and then that can get momentum and then eventually maybe some someone will sort of move over um but i think it's still too early to tell uh it feels like it's maybe like ethereum 2015-16 um kind of in face of development where it's still just very experimental uh what's being built it seems like they're they're doing something interesting in my mind all right so yeah richard did you want to add anything about this transition to ethereum 2.0 proof of stake has been like on the roadmap for like many many years and um it's good that it's like just around the corner and it's like finally about to launch okay all right so to wrap up why don't we each why don't you each summarize where you think the market will go for the rest of the year uh when it comes to eth defy and nfts as always the predictions are really hard in in crypto um but i think the fire has to establish itself as uh something that's here to stay and and uh it might grow you know might double in in activity or might not but i think it's undeniably here at a really solid level then nfts i think are likely to cool off um somewhat but uh with a lot of interesting activity and attention uh established that's gonna stay there and and be very interesting over time and i guess for for e all of this activity is is great so and eip one five five nine is great so i think uh in general there i i don't see any reason why it should cool off yeah i would agree with all those points and i guess in general uh with 1559 uh now ethereum is like this kind of an index bet on like all the economic activity that's happening so whether uh we have another d5 summer and like suddenly like eath is a lot of ethan's being burned from like transaction volume or if you have like all these avatar projects that are being dropped and like people are paying ridiculous ridiculous amounts of gas and eath is also capturing value from that so um it's a good um way for eth um to capture value from like economic activity regardless of where it comes from all right great so where can people learn more about each of you your respective companies and also different on-chain metrics that they might be interested in for each d5 and nfts so uh yeah we're at and june analytics on twitter and we have a few thousand dashboards out there that you can look at and um i am at haga haga etc on twitter it's not actually ethereum classic reference it's etc but uh i i took that before before uh etc was a thing um yeah and one of our top creators is richard yeah yeah yeah i'm top creator on june so i'm our channel on dune if you want to search for all my uh dune dashboards and also uh richard1039 on twitter okay perfect all right well thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you for sure thanks laura thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about frederick and richard and also doing analytics and one confirmation plus also all the different on-chain metrics you might be interested in check out the show notes for this episode unchained it's produced by me laura shin with help from anthony yoon
