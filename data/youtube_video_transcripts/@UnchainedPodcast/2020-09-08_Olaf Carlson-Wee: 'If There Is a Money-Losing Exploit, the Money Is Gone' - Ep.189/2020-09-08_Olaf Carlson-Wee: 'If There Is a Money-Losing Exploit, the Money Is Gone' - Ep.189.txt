hey everyone just a heads up about this episode which is a fascinating conversation with olaf carlson we of poly chain capital mostly about things happening in d5 because as i'm sure you all know things in d5 change very quickly some key events occurred after we recorded and so are not discussed in this episode namely what's missing is that the creator of sushi swap chef nomi cashed out causing a firestorm in the community and prompting the anonymous developer to hand over the admin keys to sushi swap to sam bankman freed the ceo of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange ftx which is building the serum project on the salon and blockchain it was a stunning sequence of events and each step of it is probably worth unpacking however that will have to wait for another time despite these events not being covered here there is still so much meat to dive into in this episode especially since i think we are all wondering whether sushi swap being a fast follower fork or uniswap would have prevailed had chef nomi not cashed out early and that is just one of many juicy topics that olaf and i dive into without further ado here is my conversation with olof carlson we of poly chain capital hi everyone welcome to unchained your no-hype resource for all things crypto i'm your host laura shin a journalist with over two decades of experience i started covering crypto five years ago and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time subscribe to unchained on youtube where you can watch the videos of me and my guests go to youtube.com c unchained podcast and subscribe today crypto.com is waiving the 3.5 credit card fee for all crypto purchases until the end of september download the crypto.com app today today's guest is olaf carlson we founder and ceo of poly teen capital welcome olaf hey laura thanks for having me and good to see you again you've been on the show before so i think a lot of listeners will know your background but i'll just briefly recap you were the first employee at coinbase you worked your way up to head of risk and then left to found the crypto fund polychain capital for those who aren't familiar with olaf's background i urge you to listen to my previous interviews with him which i've put in the show notes so i want to dive into the big topics of the day in the crypto world to get your take on some of the really big developments that everyone is talking about let's start with d phi and the yield farming craze which has totally exploded this summer i know poly chain thinks a lot about token design so i wanted to get your take what is yield farming good for when does it make sense for a team to introduce a liquidity mining scheme and what does it not make sense for them to do so yeah so um this concept of yield farming or what i sometimes call network mining i think is a very interesting mechanism to sort of bootstrap network effects in an underlying system primarily in this case it's bootstrapping liquidity in some sort of lending marketplace or or trade volume in a dex marketplace or something like that and in doing both the bootstrapping of of the liquidity you're simultaneously then distributing ownership um and control of that system to the underlying users so you're sort of accomplishing two things one is the capital formation and human coordination around what is effectively distributing what look and feel a little bit like shares of a corporation but it's not a business entity or legal entity that's based in a specific geography or jurisdiction it's rather just a pure software system that allows those people to coordinate around capital and coordinate decision making so you're you're both sort of distributing ownership of that underlying system while simultaneously bootstrapping the network effects of that system and so today yeah that's trading that's lending but i think this is a very very useful structure potentially to bootstrap really theoretically any sort of platform that has network effects and so these kind of financial service applications i think make a lot of sense as a first use case but i think over time these types of liquidity mining type schemes will actually be used to bootstrap you know massively multiplayer online games uh bootstrap social media services you know any sort of e-commerce marketplace really any sort of business model that has strong network effects where the user's you know kind of primary benefit is from the activity of other users so when i go on facebook right i don't go on that website in order to interact with facebook or some sort of service facebook provides i go on there because of the content that's being produced by the other users of that service and so any sort of application where those network effects exist in theory you could bootstrap those network effects and distribute ownership of the underlying service using the same mechanism which is this sort of network mining and so to me there's really two paths of innovation happening in the cryptocurrency landscape that sort of feed on each other and are a very powerful feedback loop between the two of them one is these actual d5 products and protocols and just sort of thinking of them as a product right where i can trade a token for another token or i can get you know yield on an underlying asset or i can borrow assets um you're sort of kind of seeing very very fast iteration on that product development side but simultaneously um you're seeing incredible experimentation in the capital formation and human coordination side which sort of props up these corporations which are sort of sovereign to the internet rather than registered nurse specific geography and so i think that you know you have these two separate structures like the the dow or the decentralized organization and the d5 product and protocol um and both of these are you know we're just going through a massive step function change where the pace of iteration and experimentation is hard for anyone to keep up with so let's talk about some specific projects you poly chain is an investor in compound which started the liquidity mining or yield farming craze this summer did you help with the design of comp the governance token and if so how did you think about how to structure that token and what were compounds goals and then what design choices did you make to help achieve them yeah so we've been thinking about this concept of network mining for a really long time um even you know we first invested in maker dow in january 2017 and even um around their launch we're talking about if mkr uh distribution should be made to the early people that made collateralized debt positions to issue die in that system so that would have in a sense been sort of like the compound liquidity mine whereby the more people that add capital to the underlying contract the more comp tokens they earn so we've been thinking about this structure for you know frankly many years um we were definitely involved in the high level design of the entire compound token system i mean robert and his team really you know obviously did all the heavy lifting and and came up with um all the specific parameters and i think did an excellent job with that the ceo yes exactly and um but yeah we've we've kind of thought this was a really really interesting way to bootstrap liquidity while simultaneously uh distributing future ownership um so i i think that the whole mechanism is pretty fantastic and i think it can be applied to many more types of models than people realize right now and in terms of that goal for the users to govern compound uh you know what design choices did you make to help achieve that we we've always been interested in this idea of a group of token holders that have basically a multi-sig ability to upgrade or change the underlying contract and potentially can at some point attempt to extract revenues from that contract in some manner and basically apply what we would traditionally think of as like a business model to an underlying smart contract system um and so those you know early examples of this were systems like mkr and maker dow um zrx and the xerox trading protocol and now compound right where there's sort of a set of token holders attached to an underlying smart contract system and i do think that that a smart contract system benefits distribution of ownership so you just have more stakeholders that are community participants and you have more people with more ideas about how you could potentially upgrade or change these contracts and you can do lots of really interesting sort of exotic things when you have a group of incentive alliance token holders all voting on how to change the system in theory you could for example issue new tokens um and put them into some sort of pool which can be sent as funding to effectively anything um so you could fund marketing of the underlying project by you know engaging with a marketing firm and just paying them a set of tokens and as long as everyone can agree with the dilution that you're taking on from that issuance you know those types of decisions can be highly rational so you know if you have a group of token holders around a smart contract and you say let's take on a quarter of one percent dilution in order to pay um five developers to build the next version of this protocol you know that's likely going to improve the price of that system by much more than a quarter of one percent which in crypto terms is very small and so taking on those bits of dilution in order to raise capital in order to improve the value of the system is something that traditional corporations have been doing forever right they issue new shares in order to sell them to raise capital to make all the shares more valuable so even though you're getting diluted as an existing owner um you're doing that to raise capital so that net net after it's all done you actually have more value that you're holding and i think that crypto systems are just in the early days of executing that same sort of logic which is actually let's let's accept a certain certain amount of inflation in order to fund development fund marketing fund user acquisition fund partnerships whatever it might be right it can literally be arbitrary and um use that funding in order to improve the value of the token beyond the dilution that we took on and so that sort of yeah issuance of of tokens for capital raising in order to put that capital work to support the network i i think we're in the very early days of so a lot of these ideas i feel like are ideas that i have heard you talk about for years particularly back in the ico craze days um or even before so what is different about yield farming versus the ico period when people were buying these tokens to ostensibly you know participate in these networks how is why is yield farming different so yield fire farming has more positive externalities so if i want to contribute capital to a compound pool in order to farm the compound token it's actually improving the cost of borrow for other users in that platform it's not just in the way an ico was sending capital to some group or party um and then you know who knows basically how they will use that capital um so the other difference is with yield farming you know again with the caveat being that the smart contract itself needs to be secure um you know you're also going to get your capital back right this isn't a transfer of money from one participant to another in in kind of a trade so to speak a lot of the ico craze was basically trading ether for some sort of erc20 token um and oftentimes when that was taken advantage of um by projects that maybe didn't have super strong value propositions or really strong roadmap or were just sort of outright a bit malicious um you're basically trading like a good version of money for our worst version of money right um you're trading your ether for like a worse asset in this case you can kind of put your ether to work um that will generate a positive externality for the underlying product um and also gain ownership stake over that the future you know revenues and governance of that underlying product and you're free to um hold on to that or sell it as as you see fit right sort of like a bitcoin miner right but i do think like bitcoin mining there's positive externalities bitcoin miners act selfishly right they're not altruists but in their selfish actions they actually secure the network for everyone who's using it and everyone who's holding coins in that system so i do think there's significantly more positive externalities you really are bootstrapping liquidity in these underlying services um and there's a bit of a flywheel effect where um you sort of work on bootstrapping the underlying service during that sort of liquidity mine period but over time hopefully that liquidity becomes sort of a positive network effect in itself and you no longer need the liquidity mine in order for the system to keep perpetuating itself so these liquidity mining and network mining type systems do not replace useful products right if the underlying product is not useful the liquidity mine will only last for a little while and then it will crash when that issuance schedule stops however um if you do have a useful product with real product market fit it's sort of like gasoline on those network effects right it just allows you to bootstrap um the network effects significantly more rapidly than you would have been able to otherwise and you know there's lots of precedence for this you know outside of crypto so for example just user referrals in many web services are sort of you know if you sign your friend up to paypal we'll pay you 10 right um this is a very similar mechanism actually where they're giving out cash instead of equity in the business uh but you know for a growth corporation those are pretty equivalent right because you can always sell equities you know issue new shares and sell them in order to get cash right so um this concept of sort of distributing um ownership or capital in one firm or another in order to accelerate network effects of the underlying platform has a lot of precedence in different areas outside of cryptocurrency the amazing thing though with crypto is that we can formalize them in pure code um and so with that you get incredible scale and just sort of a an elegance to the entire mechanism design comp was listed on coinbase extremely early on within days of being released which is i think unusual for coinbase because it has a reputation for being relatively conservative particularly when it comes to regulatory issues do you find that having been coinbiz his first employee is yet another advantage that polychain can offer its portfolio companies um we don't really have any influence over what any exchange does when it comes to token listing there's a lot of different factors at play when it comes to what exchanges decide to list so in the case of something like compound one of the useful um features is that it's an erc20 token so the technical integration is very very easy um relative to like a new layer one system with block rewards and different signature schemes and you know so then there's different cryptographic schemes they need to support different curves different signature types so i think that um you know it's it's not surprising to me that it's a lot easier to get an erc20 listed on coinbase than a new blockchain um but i i think that i'm not really involved in the whole internal decision making process there the success of comp then set off a wave of yield farming schemes with for instance bal tokens from the automated market maker balancer ample tokens from the price elastic cryptocurrency ample fourth mta tokens from stable coins aggregator and stable among a number of others and then came wifi or yfi a coin that had no pre-mine no pre-sale it was not listed on uniswap and it could only be earned in the y earned protocol and this is what we now call a fair launch when you saw yfi what were your thoughts yeah i think it's a super interesting project um this idea of um pure distribution to the underlying owners i think is really compelling or rather to the underlying users right um now a lot of times the reason teams raise capital is because they they literally need the money in order to deploy the system um in the case of wi-fi i think what's really interesting is that um this was built really without any significant capital resources up front it was just sort of launched um and in that case i think that this sort of um even distribution based on users in the underlying system is quite a rational way to distribute ownership over the future of that contract system and i think that you know what you're seeing is bootstrapping like a corporation from zero right outside of any jurisdiction without really any sort of management or concept of management right wi-fi has more of an inventor than a ceo much in the way that satoshi invented bitcoin but is is you know by no means the ceo of bitcoin and has no outsize ability to manipulate bitcoin and so in that way you know it's remarkable that something like wi-fi can bootstrap itself to being worth a billion dollars over the course of just a couple months i think it's completely unprecedented and i do think it looks more like you know a corporation in the traditional sense of coordinating a pool of capital and humans than it looks like a pure quote cryptocurrency uh the way we think of say bitcoin or ethereum um where the value is not really in ownership over an underlying um contract but rather sort of a pure money system that where the value is totally speculative okay we're gonna maybe uh dive into that a little bit more later but i wanted to just keep sort of moving through what happened this summer after wi-fi was the yam debacle which was another fair launch coin that within days had amassed 600 million dollars of total log value but it was unaudited and so within a few days the yam team did discover a bug that they thought initially could uh be or that they thought yam could be rescued by getting some whales to lend them enough tokens so they could have a quorum to make a governance change but later on they realized that it was actually impossible to make any changes and at that point the market cap crashed what was your take on yam both on the token itself when it launched but then also what happened with the bugs yeah i mean um again i thought the yam product and concept was really really interesting um i think that a lot of participants in this market have never been through a really big hack um for those of us who have been around for a while you know i remember way back you know um bitcoinica bit floor mount gox you know i just i you know the dow like i've really been through this stuff right um and i think that a lot of market participants today don't realize that if there truly is a money losing exploit the money is gone like right away overnight instantly and irreversibly so i think that there's an amazing tolerance in my mind for putting capital in contracts that are unaudited or created by pseudonymous developers where there's not even like a reputational recourse um if something were malicious or just misconfigured or whatever you know it can be hard to tell sometimes so i think that um i thought that you know i continue to think the project and concept is great um i do think it scares me a little bit how much capital is being dumped into contracts that are unaudited um i think that getting security audits is overall an important part of maturing any one of these systems now that said though it does it's a testament to how much market demand there is um the other thing that's a major bottleneck in my mind to all of this is just basic ux and usability um you have to go out and get ether you have to download this third-party software usually metamask you have to um actually go interact with these smart contracts and and sign transactions and everything um gas fees on ethereum are extremely high right now it's remarkable to me that that much capital is available to put into something like that but it shows how much demand there is and if we are able to abstract away a lot of the underlying complexity so there is a better user experience and get to more scalable systems where there's fewer fees i think we will see an order of magnitude increase in the amount of capital available for these types of things so um yeah i mean i love watching all these experiments i do get scared a little bit that at the current pace at some point money is going to be lost um in in a bad way um not like because of a poor investment per se but because of like an exploit and so you know that is a bit concerning to me but um overall like i just think that the the enthusiasm is great and what do you think of the fact that yams still lives in the sense that the community decided to just fork the project and migrate and i think they're going to do that very soon yeah i mean it's it's awesome all these projects are open source and forkable um you know we got multiple versions of bitcoin as some of the most valuable crypto assets and um it would be surprising to me if we didn't have multiple versions of smart contracts um that were you know acted in a similar map so the fact that these are all forkable and remixable um is just a remarkable feature of these systems and you know i kind of love all of the various fork attempts and and ones that are executed correctly and um you know where they can split liquidity and migrate i just think it's all part of the sort of hyper competitive uh very meritocratic and global competition that is on ethereum today and it was polite one of the whales that planned to help yam before the final bug was discovered uh no we were not okay just curious all right so let's now talk about uniswap and automated market makers one of the big enablers of the yield farming craze this summer has been that automated market makers such as unisua balancer and curve they've risen very quickly doing more than 11 billion dollars in trading volume in august as opposed to less than one billion dollars in january why do you think ammms have garnered market shares so quickly when or why do you think traders prefer to use these over centralized exchanges yep so amms have um have like in my head three very neat advantages um one is that they can cover a really long tail of assets so we were talking about the listing process and centralized exchanges that doesn't really exist in the context of ams um you know these things can get listed very rapidly and easily and um you know so there's liquidity for a massive massive basically infinite long tail of assets um the second advantage is that it's very gas efficient in the context of ethereum these open order book models struggle because market makers in general need to place and cancel many many bids for every one bid that actually gets filled so in general as a market maker it's hard to interact with open order books in a gas constrained context and with automated market makers you don't really have that problem of of placing asks and bids that need to be cancelled so automated market makers are more gas efficient and then the third thing is that there's just this really easy user experience where once you're set up with metamask and ethereum there's no user login so you don't need to make an account no email address no password reset you know you you can just interact straight with the system without having to log in or anything like that you know it's sort of a coin based like experience in that you don't have to interact with an order book you just hit buy or sell um and it's sort of all uh market asks market bids right it's all sort of this very simple interaction mechanism from a ux perspective so all three of those things to me are the tailwinds behind the growth of these amps yeah and as we've seen in recent days uniswop has already now overtaken coinbase pro in terms of 24 hour trading volume although there's a pretty specific reason for that which i want to discuss right now so this is a very quickly moving situation so i just want to give the caveat to the audience that by the time this episode comes out this might seem outdated because this happened to me last week with the episode but right now the dominant ammunit swab is facing a challenge from a forked version called sushi swap and sushi swap introduced a token with a yield farming scheme on top of it but otherwise it's essentially uniswap so uniswap hasn't yet introduced its own token but is later going to come out with a version three perhaps by year's end it's not clear exactly when so olaf i just want to ask you what would you do if you were uniswap um i mean it's tricky it's it's you know hilarious to me how the conversation has changed from forking out tokens to forking in tokens but i think that the market has accepted that these sort of internet sovereign corporate share type of tokens um really can be quite valuable and objectively today are quite valuable um just as a subset of the larger cryptocurrency market so um i think it's a tricky situation um i don't think anybody quite knows what's going to happen um but you know i'm watching it very closely because it has a huge impact on the future of defy and like web 3 beyond just financial applications in that if you don't have this sort of tokenized ownership unit it could actually hurt your ability to defend or build a moat around that system it's also possible that certain types of systems you simply can't have emote and extract value the way we would think about a traditional business sort of building a moat and extracting value based on the services that it provides a lot of open source software is never effectively monetized so i think that we are um in this you know rapidly emerging experiment trying to figure out what types of systems are defensible what types of systems need governance what types don't where is there an ability for there to be underlying owners that extract some sort of value but not in a way that is you know so negative for the end users that they actually fork out those those sort of underlying governors of that system um so i think there's a lot of unanswered questions you know it's all moving very rapidly but i think in about a year we will know a lot more empirically about what what works and what doesn't does this flip on its head or could it potentially flip on its head the old model of a company just investing in building up a company getting new users and growing the network and then later trying to extract value from it and instead is it more now that because the users are the ones who are extracting value that you have to introduce that element much more quickly well so um one of the ways i think about these um governance tokens that sort of manages the smart contract and this is a a crude metaphor but i think somewhat useful is that shareholders and businesses often don't expect there to be any sort of profits in fact a lot of businesses operate at a loss uh for a long time before turning a profit and even when businesses do turn a profit it's quite common to reinvest that in the growth of the business rather than actually uh distributing that to shareholders especially when the business is sort of early stage and growing right so a lot of these um you know coins that manage an underlying smart contract there isn't sort of any revenue extraction um but i think it looks a little bit like owning a share and a growth business where you're not expecting any sort of dividends or profits you're really investing in growth and user acquisition and market expansion much more than you're thinking about how to extract revenue all right in a moment we're going to finish out this conversation about sushi swap but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible how much in fees are you paying for your crypto purchases crypto.com is waiving the 3.5 credit card

king papa john's and dominos download the crypto.com app today and enjoy these offers till the end of september back to my conversation with olaf carlson we of poly chain between uniswap and sushi swap which project do you hope wins i think in a way it would be really interesting if they can uh both succeed and so we see both models go head-to-head um and see how that dynamic plays out okay and but when you say that i mean most likely uniswap will will introduce a token so when you say go head-to-head do you mean like that it'll be interesting to see if like a fast follower succeeds as opposed to the original project because like ultimately i think maybe the projects will actually look quite similar um well i'm not so confident that uniswap will ship a token in the short term um so i think it would be interesting to see sort of the token owned version of uniswap versus the you know legal entity in a specific geography sponsored version of uniswap and kind of watch what happens between those two wait i'm sorry are you saying that sushi swap is a an entity that's uh no i'm saying uniswap is like uniswap has raised venture capital it's a legal entity in a specific jurisdiction whereas sushi swap my assumption is that it will just be uh token holders governing an underlying smart contract that's basically a fork of you as well so we'll see that like th this is where again the d5 product you know in in a code sense is essentially identical right but the capital formation and sort of quote management or or human coordination around um control and ownership of that product is is quite different and so we will see the competition play out not in terms of the product but in terms of the underlying sort of capital structure that sort of sponsors the development of that product so maybe my next question you might just disagree with the premise of it but i was going to ask you because i was assuming that uniswap would introduce a token like i feel like even before the sushi swap thing happened a lot of people were saying that it would simply because you know if all the other yield farming stuff that had been going on but i wondered um because another thing i've seen people chatting about is whether or not uniswap should make any token that it does introduce retrospective meaning that the token should reward the liquidity providers who were on unit swap even before the token was introduced so do you think that should happen or do you just not even agree that there should be a token um yeah i think that's definitely an interesting component of the design to sort of retrospectively reward people that said it's optimizing a bit more for some sort of perception of fairness instead of maximizing growth in the future um so if you instead took all those rewards and instead of giving them retrospectively just gave them to future liquidity providers um you would probably see more explosive growth in the size of the liquidity pools but it might be perceived as less fair so there's just trade-offs i don't think there's a clear right answer at this stage in the market okay yeah let's keep talking about this notion of fairness because as we talked about so in general there's been this trend towards tokens like sushi that are considered so-called fair launch and by that you know it means they were launched without vc money without anyone including even the founders having any allocation set aside for them ian lee managing director at ideo collab ventures wrote a post saying quote if fair launches become more common sophisticated and successful they should scare the out of crypto vcs given the number of new fair launch coins as well as the creation of an organization called fair launch capital or organization maybe is even too strong of a word uh but they do intend to give some coins the money necessary for expensive audits before launch and also there's you know as we talked about this sort of general sentiment against so-called vc coins do you worry about quality's ability to invest in crypto projects as it's been doing so far or about the success of any of your portfolio projects because of this trend uh no i'm i'm a huge fan of fair launches when it makes sense i think that what people are underestimating is just you know in reality when you launch a really complicated system um you need more than one or two engineers sort of working together pro bono and then you need to raise capital and so i i think that if you move to a world that's solely fair launch i think you limit the scope and scale the types of things that can be deployed um in the crypto space um and i i want people to be building sort of the veritable rocket ships of crypto which just take a lot of capital coordinate a team of 50 or 100 you know really sophisticated developers and and eventually ship but that sort of thing is very hard to do with a fair launch mechanism um now that said for simpler projects if they don't need the capital don't raise any capital um and just do a fair launch um now that said i think a lot of vc funds um in the crypto space are you know you know large holders of a lot of cryptocurrency assets so our ability to participate like for polychain um in these sort of fear launch distributions is pretty significant if we wanted to and it's possible that in the future that would be one of the primary mechanisms through which we enter positions rather than sort of private contracts the way that traditional vc is structured and i'm very open to however the market goes we are going to shift with it so the way that you phrase that you said you're open to doing that in the future so does that mean that you know aside from comp which i know you guys are investors in that polychain did not yield farm those other yield farming tokens that came out like bal or ample or a wi-fi or anything i'll just say that we don't put money in unaudited contracts and okay so but some of the others probably were audited because some of them do we have put money in audited contracts but so we we're not sort of yellowing into the newest food coin um but um you know we are you know open to putting large amounts of capital into smart contracts if we get confident that they're secure and i it's kind of like trading on exchanges right um you know we will trade on exchanges that have been around a long time would i put money and into an exchange and start trading on it if it was a week old no um because we need to see some security track record and especially for the scale that we're operating at you know we we need to be able to do these things at scale right we can't anything with you know one million dollars doesn't really make sense for us it needs to be larger ian lee also wrote another post where he talked about how he expected yield farming to change in such a way where whales will be disadvantaged slightly or at least just not kind of linearly expect the same rewards as other yield farmers and i just wonder do you think that funds and vcs buying or earning fair launch coins contradicts the spirit of a fair launch and are you you know down with the idea of kind of bigger players maybe not earning the same proportion of rewards for their work um well so first off i don't think it's possible um to in a pseudonymous environment prevent whales um because you can always split your coins into multiple addresses and look like you're a bunch of smaller um investors rather than one whale it's not really possible to prevent that type of behavior unless you have a central party collecting identifying information or something like that which of course is never going to happen in a fair launch sort of distributed bootstrap mechanism i think fairer to me means that anyone can participate it doesn't mean to me um anti-whale that's actually unfair or there's there's some sort of you know there's a sort of design that is trying to get a certain type of participant and that's fine but i would put that in a different category um to me you know i think the reality is that bootstrapping these systems with huge pools of capital is actually a good thing a lot of the time and an important part of getting these systems off the ground the reality is most of these yield farming systems have a lot of really really large investors in them um they're not like you know a million people each contributing ten dollars right it's just not really what it looks like today and so i think that um the people who take the most risk should you know gain the reward much in the way that people who take less risk should not take as much of the reward so i i like the like i said i like this idea of fair launches um this idea that you could in a pseudonymous environment prevent whales from participating i don't think is possible and going back to automated market makers i also now want to talk about the crv token launch as i'm sure you know and some of my audience may remember crv is the token for the curve amm when the token was going to launch an anonymous person allegedly paid the 8 000 gas fee to launch the token contract and the team eventually ended up accepting that as the legitimate contract for the crv token however afterward a number of people speculated that the person who launched the contract was either affiliated with the team or worked with them in some secret manner to launch the token so let's leave aside for a moment what you think happened you know whether or not they launched it secretly um but if they did so let's just say they did why wouldn't they do so like what would be the motivation for that um likely some sort of fear that from a regulatory perspective if they ship the contract that they're somehow kind of the sponsors of the contract whereas if somebody else ships it um you know they maybe wrote the code but they didn't ship it um that would be my guess and so what do you think actually happened do you think that was the case or i i have no idea i think the beauty of these systems is that it doesn't matter yeah it's like the ultimate mystery but we're not gonna figure it out probably although some somebody may if if you do let me know like slide into my dms people i mean it gets it gets into the same question of you know who is satoshi nakamoto and i think the appropriate answer is it doesn't matter all right so the week that we're recording um and as i said this might be all outdated by the time this comes out which is only a few days before the episode comes out but anyway at this time what's all the rage is the why eath vault in wyon which is sort of like this one-stop shop for yield farming and you can also now yield farm just holding east you don't need to get like these other stable coins or tokens or whatever and crucially it also then allows you to stay exposed to the price changes in each so for me it looks sort of like some kind of like betterment for yield farming and olaf i wondered what you thought of why eath what is it saying to you about where the defy space is going yeah i would actually agree with that description that it's sort of a wealth front or betterment um for yield and um we're getting into a zone where you're seeing like programmatic automated fund management sort of is a loose way of putting it where people instead of contributing capital as a limited partner to a fund manager who allocates that capital on their behalf and charges a fee you're contributing capital as a liquidity provider to basically an on-chain algorithm which contributes that capital and takes a fee um so i think it's really exciting conceptually and i think we will see many many more systems like this launched and compete with one another and let's also talk about rebasing which is becoming more common and i'm going to attempt to describe it i don't know if i fully understand it so please correct me if i'm wrong but it looks like it's a concept that well so it comes from it's usually associated with the animal fourth token um but basically the percentage of the total supply that a person owns will not change unless you sell or buy but the number of tokens you have in your wallet could change based on the price every day and this ensures that that one amble will always have the same purchasing power did i get that right yeah i i effectively um i'm really impressed laura with how deep you are in this whole agriculture space yeah well i'm obsessed i mean it's um it's really fascinating so i wondered what do you think of rebasing like what are the pros and cons of having this feature in a cryptocurrency you know i think it's conceptually interesting but ultimately not that useful um you know for any real kind of use case in my mind so i you know i think it's like a fun science experiment i'm surprised that it's being merged into so many different projects okay okay yeah i i have to admit i just kept thinking if i'm holding this in my wallet and the number of changes every day i'm going to want to get rid of it like that is my that's my thought i i will i have a call actually scheduled with the ample fourth people so maybe i will change my mind um but all right so now let's just keep talking about the agricultural aspect or the food coins um this trend with the food coins started with yam and after that we got spaghetti and kimchi and sushi and hot dog and so many others and i wondered why do you think this is becoming a trend and in general what role do you think memes will play in d5 yeah i mean i think that it's these things are treated and look like toys kind of but i think when you actually step back and examine what they are and sort of look beyond the meme or look through the meme we are seeing like hundreds of millions of dollars be coordinated by strangers across the internet to sort of prop up this sovereign corporate structure that manages a financial product that's enforced solely with code or software it's really sci-fi and it's honestly mind-boggling um and yet it's wrapped around like a spaghetti um and so that that to me is is really fascinating because a lot of early tech breakthroughs i think look or feel sort of like games or toys or they're the work of tinkerers it's not you know taking itself too seriously even though i think conceptually what's happening is like a massive paradigm shift um both for financial services as well as for like literally corporate structures which are just huge arenas um to be taking off and is that why you said earlier that wi-fi looked to you like a corporation can you expound on what you meant by that yeah i mean um you know one could argue that um you know every cryptocurrency sort of has this feature but it's this ability for a group of people to coordinate around a set of rules and coordinate capital together which is basically what a corporation is right you have a pool of capital you have turnover of management so it doesn't rely on any specific individual um you have secondary markets where the shares which represent an interest in that capital um can trade and then you have a governance process where the underlying shareholders can vote on how to allocate that capital in order to improve the value of their shares right and um conceptually that's what a lot of these kind of internet sovereign corporations or dow like structures look like right they're actually replacing the corporate entity itself all of the legal documents um that are enforced in geographic jurisdictions and are regis you know a corporation is like registered with the state that's kind of how you get it into existence you replace that entire system with pure software and so it's it's to me conceptually a really big deal um but again yeah it looks a little bit like a toy or a meme right now and yeah i think that's a really effective mechanism for bootstrapping and managing certain types of products and it turns out specifically products that are um based on smart contracts and so over time though i think you'll see this sort of bootstrapping mechanism and capital coordination and sort of taking the corporate structure and putting it on the internet replacing it with software i think you will see that type of model applied to like social media networks for example or massively multiplayer online game environments and i think we're um still a ways out from those things but in theory i see no reason why this structure couldn't take on you know many many different types of businesses yeah and honestly i i've been thinking i think the disruption will come so fast because we have the internet now whereas in the first internet revolution there was a lot of kind of hardware that needed to the lines that needed to be laid and everything but yeah i feel like because business itself the structure of business is what's being disrupted it's going to happen so fast and it's going to hit so many industries and i'm a little bit like whoa we're in for a roller coaster ride so let's now talk um a little bit about the fee issue on ethereum at the moment a simple trade on uniswap can cost something like 40 and more complex transactions for yield farming are even more expensive do you think ethereum will scale in time to retain all its market market share and defy considering that the explosion is already here and already pushing ethereum's limits in short i don't think it will be able to scale fast enough whether that just slows down the market or whether uh aspects of the market go to other chains um it's too early to say though it's just defy you know is very exciting for ethereum but in a weird way um is actually really really abolish in my mind for systems like polka dot um or dfinity right that are you know i think from an engineering perspective just candidly far ahead of ethereum um they don't have the network effects users wallet installs or anything that ethereum has but they're you know polka dot is live and working and scalable right now today and so to me um i do think you will see a lot of d5 migrate from ethereum to polka dot um in in maybe the short ish term um i'm long term i'm hopeful that ethereum will be able to scale and upgrade and change but that all said what's much more exciting to me about these new systems launching that have you know either better scalability features or um like web assembly or wasm-based virtual machine compatibility so you can write programs in many different programming languages all of these sorts of features are exciting not just to narrowly sort of compete on d5 it's exciting to me because i think it will enable new types of applications that simply aren't possible on ethereum today um much in the way that ethereum enabled all sorts of applications that weren't possible on bitcoin and you know today we know that what's exciting about ethereum is not that it narrowly competes with bitcoins bitcoin's value proposition but rather expanded the scope of what was possible for the entire sort of crypto universe and we got things like stable coins things like lending contracts icos all of d5 right and i think that systems like polka dot are going to once again expand the universe of what is possible um it's not a zero-sum game where it's narrowly like which chain is going to win d5 i think it's a very myopic view and it it shows a lack of imagination about how many different types of applications these smart contract type structures will affect so i i'm very you know optimistic about scalability across the entire ecosystem um i'm less confident about like the short-term timeline of ethereum um i just think that d5 is moving way faster like by over 10 times at least maybe closer to 50 or 100 times faster ethereum core protocol development and i see no reason for that to change like i don't i don't think ethereum core protocol development has ever been fast and i don't see any reason to think that it will get faster and d5 has always been fast and i don't see any reason to think it will get slower so you know you add that combination of factors together and yeah i do think that you will see applications migrating to more scalable chains i mean we're already seeing this you know when you see major applications announced that they're going to be launched on different chains outside are you talking about for instance serum on solana are there any others that come to mind yeah serum i mean a lot of stuff is being built in the cosmos kind of tendermint framework um so there's a lot of different chains now that are sort of um compatible with the tendermint consensus mechanism that cosmos uses and once the ibc protocol and cosmos ships they will all be sort of interoperable with one another so i think you have a pretty strong ecosystem growing there as i said i think there are a lot of teams building um polka dot substrate chains so these are substrate being the programming framework that allows you to ship um systems on top of polka dot uh we are seeing a lot of sort of grassroots development activity using that substrate framework so i yeah i think that and i mean i'm even having conversations now with teams that have yet to launch on ethereum that are saying you know should we launch on ethereum or should we launch in another chain like they're they because the fee situation means completely it's really bad like it's i i don't think um it's not like this is a bump in the road it is existential for the entire landscape of applications we're talking about you know right now you have to be transacting at least i would say at the very minimum a thousand dollars per transaction for any of this to make that sense from a fee perspective um and i would say that's the absolute baseline um because that's assuming you're willing to pay like a ten dollar fee is one percent right and i i would consider one percent to be a pretty high transaction cost um but that's why i say a thousand is to in my mind the absolute uh more realistically i think you have to be using five or ten thousand dollars um to really accept the kind of fees we're talking about and so a lot of people are using five or ten thousand dollars but you know obviously that's pricing a huge number of people out of this market um you know if you're a teenager who wants to tinker with these systems i don't think a lot of teenagers have 10 grand lying around to throw into yield farming systems um you know and i wish that those people weren't excluded from these systems i also think that it massively limits types of applications that can be deployed to ethereum um when you reduce the fees by say 100 times you open up the suite of applications that make sense to run on a smart contract by a huge amount um and it moves into things that i think are hard for us to imagine much in the way that you know the whole agricultural revolution here was hard to imagine you know by people in the ethereum ecosystem i think there will be many many other types of experiments that are um hard for us to imagine run on these new more highly scalable chains like polka dots and i just want to flag for listeners that paulie chain has invested in dfinity cosmos and polka dot which all i've just mentioned and olef i wanted to ask you so vc firms as far as i understand typically don't um invest in category competitors but um you know you're you're invested in dfinity tasos and cosmos uh potentially you i think you own eth uh polychain owns teeth and um and obviously did i mention polka dot that that also is in there and those seem like category competitors so are you just betting on multiple horses in each category or do you not view them as competitors no i i there's overlap for sure um but these systems are really different and i don't really view them as competitors i i think it like when i go back in time when ethereum launched everyone said this is competing with bitcoin why do we need another crypto coin and i think in hindsight that was a really myopic view in reality ethereum doesn't really compete with bitcoin it just expanded the market and it sort of enables all this functionality that bitcoin just simply cannot do um it's not like we would have all this stuff if it was all bitcoin you know we wouldn't have the just these basic things like stable coins um i think you wouldn't have the same robust universe of stablecoin models that you have on ethereum if we only had bitcoin i think we would still only have tether built on like the master coin omni protocol right and um so i think that you know these systems genuinely enable new behavior it's just that because we don't know what that new behavior will be it's hard to point to what you know it's hard to imagine it um just in the way that after ethereum launched i don't think people really realized how big stable coins icos defy i don't think anybody realized how big this stuff would be or that those types of applications would be the ones that took off and it turns out all these other types of applications people have talked about never took off token curated registries you know never really took off right and i i remember getting a dozen pitches for this whole category and so you know i just think that it's hard to predict the future um especially when you're talking about open source um flexible programmable platforms where anybody in the world has permission to build anything and then once that thing's live it's open source so anyone else in the world can fork it iterate on it remix it add it to their application and so because this is all software too the pace of development is just really really rapid so all this said um i just don't think that it the the right view is to view this all as a zero-sum game with every coin i mean the firm the name of our firm is polychain and it's it's because i really do believe in a future where there are multiple different chains that can carve out their own you know their own sort of valid reason for existing and so i yeah anyway i know that's a long answer but i do think that it's it's important to realize that these different systems really do enable different types and earlier when you said that you're seeing already that some teams are saying hey should we launch on a different blockchain than ethereum what are they typically considering when they ask that um you know it depends on their timeline to launch um so the you know the only two systems live today um or the only three rather sorry are are cosmos polka dot and salon i would say that are sort of live and have some scalability characteristics that make them um you know just cheaper and then than ethereum uh they also haven't been tested to the you know um extent that ethereum has so there's open questions about scale there and there's open questions about the economic design you know it's not to say that these are as robust as ethereum today but i would say those are the main three that are live today that people are looking at and in terms of the transition to ethereum 2.0 and proof-of-stake what do you think will happen uh with proof-of-stake do you think that the yield farming rage right now on d5 kind of shows that this model works or do you think that it basically will make people less interested in sticking on ethereum because they can get higher yields elsewhere yeah so um this is actually a really complicated question because it gets into some um serious sort of game theory considerations for the security of a proof of stake chain that also has a defy ecosystem on it because these two things do compete for yield but at the same time the defy application security depends on the proof of stake um yield being high enough that at least some people stake i think you're going to see you know pretty rapid movements from staking to you know things like yield farming and back to staking um in general the staking reward curves rapidly go up as the percentage of coin state goes down um so there is like a market mechanism that will reach equilibrium at some point now given the types of yields we're seeing in the short term on ethereum um you we're gonna see if proof of stake we're live today i think you would see a very small number of people staking relative to certain yield farming mechanisms but that said staking um is much more reliable and steady right than a lot of these yield farming games which you know may or may not have the same sort of returns in two weeks right um so i do think that you know there are going to be people who will go for a worse short-term outcome for just the ease of use of you know that stake in return being somewhat predictable um relative to the whole yield farming phrase but i it's a very serious security question for any chain that has smart contract compatibility and also proof of stake and then one thing i wanted to ask about was when you said that you think people will kind of switch in and out of staking on ethereum 2.0 and c5 projects or yield farming um i thought that you had to lock up your ethereum for some time period i forgot what the amount was yeah in general proof of stake protocols have an unbonding period so if you want to unwind your stake there's a delay so i mean will that just discourage people from sticking more because they'll want to keep their um you know have the opportunity to engage in yield charming i mean it's two sides of the of the same coin in that one it does trap capital in staking and it also inhibits new capital from coming at mistake so i think it's not strictly bad for attracting capital in that it also those lock-ups do prevent people from running to the exit so to speak in a short time horizon all right let's talk a little bit about security when polychain puts its own tokens into d5 protocols you know you talked about how you don't um invest in unaudited contracts but obviously in d5 there is just so much smart contract risk even for contracts that have been audited and i saw that a couple months ago nexus mutual which is the d5 insurance protocol said that had it had maxed out its insurance offering and that a lot of the demand was due to crypto funds does polychain use defy insurance such as nexus mutual um we we don't today so how do you do i mean do you just you know kind of trust or try to invest in protocol smart contracts that you trust or how do you account for that risk yeah i mean it's a risk-reward weighted decision um so we would only put any money in smart contract if we felt the risk-adjusted performance was worth it and so speaking about all the different hacks and bugs you know this year we've seen uh a couple of attacks on bzx there was a drain on balancer there was an attack on hedgic um lenovo there was the yam bug in general what do you think defy teams should do to improve security um you know i i hate to say it but maybe move a little slower more eyes on the code do engage with an auditor and start with smaller amounts of capital and work your way up um so unfortunately that's the opposite of everything that's happening in the market today um but you know everyone it's a free market everyone's free to do whatever they'd like and i like it that way you know i don't want there to be rules about auditing or something like that i just think that as a market participant it's i do ascribe by sort of the do your own research mentality and i do think it's my opinion that you should be conscious of if the contracts you're interacting with have been audited or not and i also wanted to talk about just one last trend involving d5 which is bitcoin on ethereum there are several versions of bitcoin on ethereum though some of them are centralized meaning they have a single point of failure there are other teams that are working on versions that are decentralized and trustless do you think that we could see bitcoin being moved onto ethereum in a big way and if so what effect do you think that would have on defy or do you think that bitcoiners are content to just huddle yeah i think we will see a lot of bitcoin move on to smart contract chains uh what effect do you think that will have you know i just think that bitcoin will become a really popular collateral type in a lot of these smart contract systems let's talk about your um first employer coinbase there's been a lot of chatter that the company will go public in the next year or so with some people speculating that there might be a token offering what do you think would be a creative way for coinbase to go public while also showcasing the capabilities of blockchain technology so i think it would be really cool if coinbase went public in a traditional manner on on as sort of a stock exchange right and you know traditional institutional capital had access to to interact in those markets right i think that it would be very interesting though if they also issued um basically a tokenized version of that coinbase share and allowed that to trade on coinbase pro you know and so then coinbase shares if it was like a defy asset and i don't think they need to do anything super fancy this could be like a tether style system where they sort of own shares in a vault and they issue an erc20 that represents that share and you're free to come back and redeem that for like a quote real share if you want to um so from a tech perspective right it's not very complicated then though you could have those coinbase shares you'd and used in the default universe um so you could imagine coinbase shares being used as collateral and again the security properties here aren't super robust it's not trustless it's not decentralized it's it's really just um a custodial system like tether you know but for coinbase shares and operated by coinbase but i do think that would be a really interesting twist on a public offer all right well what's up next for you and polychain we are continuing to just partner with um really really you know smart entrepreneurs who are insanely ambitious and you know want to change multiple different paradigms of the world through crypto so um it's just a joy for me every day to hear all the radical ideas from different entrepreneurs we talk to um and that's kind of continuing to be what we're focused on you know we're also getting more and more involved in on-chain participation in the systems that we're investing in so one of the big ways we do this today is staking in proof-of-stake protocols um so today i'm pretty confident that we are among the very largest stakers in the world just as far as the amount of capital we have at stake in proof-of-stake systems it's deep into the hundreds of millions of dollars and very excited to be able to basically support in an on-chain way all the various systems we're invested in over time i think we're going to expand you know that the way that we're participating so we are participating in on-chain governance in many of these systems and i think that involvement is only going to expand um as time goes on and i think that in general when it comes to for sort of the d5 landscape our participation in those systems will also expand as time goes on um so very excited to sort of roll up our sleeves and get more hands-on in these on-chain mechanisms and also just continue to partner uh with world-class entrepreneurs great well where can people learn more about you and polychain um you can learn quite a lot on our website which is a joke yeah that's yes um however that is how you can contact us also okay polychain.capital yeah all right yeah find a way to get in touch with us we're all uh very online great well thank you so
