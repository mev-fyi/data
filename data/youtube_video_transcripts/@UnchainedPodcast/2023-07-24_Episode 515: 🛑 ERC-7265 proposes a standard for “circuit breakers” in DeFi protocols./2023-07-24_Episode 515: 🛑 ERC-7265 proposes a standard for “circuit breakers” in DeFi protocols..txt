basically what it does is it adds this layer around your protocol through which all funds flow and what this allows you to do is that before any assets leave the protocol it gives you some time to basically evaluate evaluate that withdrawal essentially from the protocol and basically do some added analysis on it whether it's malicious or not so this can be done on chain or off chain but basically it gives you time to intervene in case you realize that the code allows somebody to maliciously withdraw some amount so I on the proposal that it would limit the withdrawals by these time periods like you mentioned as was done on the traditional Exchange so if that were to happen then who would get notified in the event of this like large withdrawal that trips the circuit breaker yeah so it would be the team in charge of essentially controlling and monitoring the protocol so this would likely be the devs and the core team of the protocol
