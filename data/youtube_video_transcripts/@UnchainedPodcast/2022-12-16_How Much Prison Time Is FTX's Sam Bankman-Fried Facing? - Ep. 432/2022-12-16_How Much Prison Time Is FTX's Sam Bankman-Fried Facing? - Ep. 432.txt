so much for having me looking forward to the conversation this was a dramatic week in the FTX slash Alameda Saga Monday night Sam bankman freed the former CEO of FTX was arrested by Bahamian authorities at the behest of the United States Tuesday morning which was the time when SBF was supposed to testify in front of the house committee on Financial Services the Securities and Exchange Commission the commodity Futures Trading commission and the department of Justice's southern district of New York all either unsealed or published their charges against svf can you walk us through all of these charges yeah no and to Echo your sentiment this has really been a truly extraordinary week I mean normally we see one of the types of things that you just mentioned right we have multiple Regulators taking action and you mentioned the cftc which really is talking more about Market manipulation you know the activities that SBF undertook at um at FTX uh you know what what impact did they have on what what the cftc calls the Commodities market right more sort of the Bitcoin ethereum ecosystem uh then you have the SEC uh which is slightly different right the SEC is the Securities regulator so what they're talking about is potential Securities fraud what representations did he make that ultimately um defrauded investors and manipulated the Securities market and finally and and in my opinion you know having spent a lot of time at doj sort of the most interesting is the criminal indictment that was unsealed this week that includes eight charges of wire fraud Securities fraud uh that talks about actually campaign Finance fraud and really sort of lay starts to lay out what a case here will look like and one of the reasons I say sort of most interesting is is a lot of people are sort of wondering well how do all these cases happen at one time and how do we deal with this and the reality is that those those regulatory cases the the Civil actions those are about money they're ultimately enforcement actions about sort of trying to you know get restitution for victims or ultimately a fine those will take a back seat to the doj criminal prosecution because that case involves you know potential incarceration deprivation of Liberty the types of things that sort of go first and and SPF has constitutional rights one of those rights is sort of not to necessarily testify but that would mean that he couldn't do depositions and couldn't provide interrogatories in the civil cases so those will take a back seat uh as these criminal charges progress and there's still a lot to happen with those and we can talk about those sort of as we go through oh that's interesting so because some I was going to ask you this later but I'll ask you this now representative Maxine Waters who's the chair of the house Financial Services committee expressed dismay that Sam's arrest meant that he would not be able to testify at that scheduled hearing so do you think that that timing was intentional like you know because of what you said about how according to the Constitution he can't testify uh or I don't remember the phrasing that you use but like would his testimony in front of Congress have kind of imperiled that situation you know it could have and I'm not sure I I I know the answer to why the timing why the sort of day before he was going to testify before Congress I think from my time as a prosecutor um I I can tell you the criminal cases sometimes take on a life of its own and prosecutors make decisions about when to charge based on your when they have the indictment you know if he had come to the U.S potentially there would have been arrest earlier because there would have been potentially an arrest warrant they made decisions to arrest him in the Bahamas when they did for whatever those reasons were but I will say it may very very difficult for him to testify before Congress he has a right to remain silent and not incriminate himself you know he's made decisions sort of unlike most criminal defendants quite frankly to be relatively outspoken over the last few weeks to the media in kinds of conversations which is very very different than what you typically see and very very different what lawyers than what what your defense lawyers typically advise all of that said he you know the cftc case the SEC case will likely be stayed pending the completion of a criminal investigation I'll also say if this case ultimately resolves itself in a guilty plea which it may and again we can talk about that more in a moment those other civil or regulatory cases could potentially be kind of wound into any kind of ultimate settlement of the charges here okay but so I feel like uh just one thing that I need to ask is so if he had testified in front of Congress are you are you saying that that would have complicated the doj's case like it would have been harder for them to charge him or no I don't think so in fact he could have potentially made false or misleading statements that would have resulted in other charges uh I think the reality is I don't believe that it mattered in this instance to doj I don't have sort of the inside baseball on that other than to say sort of the timing was the timing here um but no I don't I don't think so at all um you know what one doj is really is the is the um the executive branch agency that would bring charges if someone perjured themselves before Congress for example okay and so given the eight uh criminal charges based on all of those if he's convicted what is Sam potentially looking at in terms of prison time yeah I know it sounds like a simple question but it is uh it's pretty complicated what we have in the United States today or what they call the federal sentencing guidelines and they used to actually be mandatory but the Supreme Court ruled that that was actually unconstitutional and that each judge should be able to make up their own decision on what sentences should be however most judges uh across the country rely on them for uh for sort of help crafting a sentence I admittedly have not done a very close calculation of the federal sentencing guidelines but it's really important in this case to talk about them so for example if you commit fraud one of the major drivers of your federal sentencing guidelines is the amount involved in the fraud they've even updated this these since I was a prosecutor I noticed when I looked at this earlier to try to understand this a little bit better that now the top number caps out at about 550 million dollars in terms of the fraud that's the top number you get to here we're talking about arguably more so he is capped out at that number so if you put all and and I did this calculation really only for one charge and again I don't have the charges I don't know exactly what doj's case is but I think that he's probably looking at something based on the federal sentencing guidelines like life in prison and that is really truly extraordinary in this type of case I will say that one thing that's really important there are also mitigating factors right the things we're talking about now are what get your federal guidelines sentenced up there are also things that get them down like did he cooperate you know did he waive A detention hearing right is he going to waive his extradition hearing right he's reserved his right to have one but that doesn't mean he will he could eventually waive that right we can talk about an extradition and what that will look like in a moment but there are also mitigating factors does he cooperate here does he help the government get money back does he help in the bank sort of proceeding to get you know users made whole there are things he can do to cooperate to potentially get that sentence down all right yeah I do believe I saw CNN reported that potentially when you add it all up it could be like 116 years so given that that's you know well beyond the normal lifespan and he's like 30 or something uh clearly yeah look I mean you also you also there are multiple charges here really the quick calculation I did quite frankly was for one uh so so like you know he's looking at you know very very significant sentences but judges also have some latitude you know we'll ultimately see what a judge determines but oftentimes when you see a fraud this large it really all often results in a plea of some kind and that's because someone is sort of staring down the barrel of a life in in prison uh they want to do whatever they can to kind of get that those numbers down and when we talk about sort of cooperation and again I don't know what he's going to do in this case or what his ultimately his options will be people say well how can he cooperate because they assume that it means cooperating against someone higher than you right and he is the the chief executive of this company but the reality is there are other things he can do when I was a prosecutor we were very focused on trying to make the victims whole in whatever the case was you know can he help recover funds is there any other information that he has that could be helpful as uh prosecutors are looking into this case more deeply so there are certainly things that can be done here but again this is going to take some serious raise time also to play out we're on I mean we're literally still in the Bahamas we've had one extradition hearing and the next I'm sorry we've had one essentially detention hearing and there's an extradition hearing Set for February one thing that I actually wanted to ask before we get into things like you know whether or not there's a plea is I just you know was curious because this all happened a lot more quickly than I think most people expected and I noticed that the Enron Scandal was um just on a much different timeline like for instance I noticed the first indictment it took almost a year before and that was for enron's Chief Financial Officer and then it was actually two and a half years before the former CEO was indicted so why do you think it took only a little over a month for SPF to be indicted I think it's a great question for a number of reasons first I think it's really astute to compare this to Enron for example I was a I'll age myself a little bit here I was a young associate at a law firm during that sort of age of what I'd call like accounting fraud at Enron Worldcom and it is really the same kind of case where investigators and agents are really wading through a mountain of evidence essentially trying to create something that's understandable for a grand jury they ultimately present that case to the grand jury and that takes a lot of time this case is extraordinary the FDX case is extraordinary for a number of reasons but to me the number one reason is the speed of that indictment you know you know we forget Laura because you and I are so you know we we don't sleep anymore but uh it was only a month ago that that we saw the collapse of FTX and we're already talking about indictments and detention hearings and extradition that is really unprecedented so I think there's a couple reasons one I think the strength of the evidence um I think there was already been essentially admissions it seems like publicly that funds were co-mingled I think that you probably have a lot of cooperation now happening from with the current leadership of FTX as they're sort of working through the bankruptcy but I also really credit you know teams of agents and investigators I think people have been working around the clock 24 7 looking at millions of transactions thousands of documents interviewing you know Myriad witnesses to get us to this point but it's I'm not sure I have the best answer for you other than to say it's really it is extraordinary and it's great that you sort of I you know identify that all right I'm going to ask you a few other questions about potentially how uh the prosecutors might have done this work so quickly but first we're going to take a quick word from the sponsors to make the show possible join over 50

conversation with Arie I'm sure you probably saw on crypto Twitter that people have been speculating that the speed of the charges indicates that a lot of the other kind of high-level executives are probably cooperating and giving information to the prosecutors would you say that's a fair assessment yeah no I too have been getting my information from crypto Twitter I uh the short answer is I don't know I will tell you from my experience as a prosecutor you know for a long time you know the first thing you do is going to try to talk to Witnesses who who will know and you know one thing those Witnesses particularly the the senior Executives will be doing is you know hiring lawyers who understand that the sooner you cooperate with the government the sort of better ultimately your sentence will will likely be because if you are a defense attorney with a cooperating witness you always want to sort of sort of help the prosecutor almost build the best case for you when ultimately you go to sentencing want to be able to tell that judge hey this person came in on day one started cooperating so sometimes there's a little bit of a rush to actually start cooperating we may have seen that here I I don't know but certainly cooperating Witnesses plus you know a mountain of evidence that is frankly controlled by people who are likely cooperating right the current leadership of the company who have access to these records I think move things along um much much more quickly but again like it's it's I do have to give credit to the agents and prosecutors involved here because you know there are cases with lots of evidence with lots of great Cooperators and they still don't move this quickly you know Enron Worldcom those cases all had cooperating Witnesses none of them moved this quickly yeah I guess the reason why I'm confused when you talk about how even the bankruptcy team could be helping us because Enron filed for bankruptcy I think was like the end of 2001 and then yet still it took another year for that CFO to be indicted another I guess it was what did I see another year and a half or something for the CEO so it's it's things that things are moving very very quickly and that's why at the end of the day it's like it really comes down to the work that that's being done here to to some extent and um just and having access to records again you know there also maybe a handful of cooperating Witnesses okay so whether or not you know they are cooperating assuming that they are is it the case that either they won't be punished or that their punishment will be more lenient or you know how does that factor in it's an excellent question and essentially usually what happens is sort of when you have someone who is susceptible to criminal charges right they will come in maybe they've been charged already maybe there's a sealed indictment maybe they're sealed seal charges uh maybe not uh but when they start cooperating it's not that you sort of get away or move away scot-free in fact quite the opposite if you're a cooperating witness almost all the time you're ultimately going to plead to a criminal charge and the reason I say it really becomes important because at trial okay you you don't want to sort of have that bias or if you're a prosecutor you don't want to have a witness with having had the bias of cooperating with you to get out of certain criminal charges so oftentimes that cooperating witness will have to eat for lack of a better description the lead charge a big charge maybe here it would be wire fraud but what's really important we talked about the federal sentencing guidelines earlier one of the ways that a judge essentially does a doubt what they call a downward departure from those Federal sentencing guidelines is for substantial assistance to the government and what the the sort of golden ticket for a cooperating witness or defendant in a case is for the government to go to a judge and say I'd like to make a motion for substantial assistance and that allows the judge to essentially go off those Federal sentencing guidelines entirely and and depart dramatically we've seen that in a number of cases recently so whenever you're sort of thinking about why is the case taking so long to plead a lot of times you see cooperation here and and this could certainly happen okay yeah so I don't know if you want to speculate on for instance um if it's true as reported that Caroline Ellison nashat Singh and Gary Wang were the three others that knew about how customer funds at FTX were being used at Alameda then if let's say that all three of them are cooperating what what would you say that would mean for their prison time as a prosecutor for for over 11 years at doj one thing I learned is never to speculate on what a potential sentence would be like so no I I I don't know other than to say that cooperation is one way to get a significant downward departure from the sentencing guidelines and that's what every cooperating witness defendant always hoped for in one of these kinds of cases okay so as we talked about earlier SPF is being held in the Bahamas pending extradition tell us what that process looks like and how long it could take yeah it's a really important question now because it's going to dictate sort of a lot of what we see over the next coming weeks and months basically what happened this week is that essentially they held a detention hearing and the real question was should you stay or should he be released well the extradition treaty with the U.S essentially asks the court to hold a defendant under these circumstances but even so there were arguments made he needed access to Medicine he needed access to different types of food he has real estate in the Bahamas and the reason that was relevant is when someone has sort of a a Nexus or a connection to a place they're less likely to flee to be a Flight Risk well the judge decided that none of that was enough that he was going to be held that he's likely a Flight Risk and another thing the court often considers is the strength of the evidence right is this a strong case is this likely going to result in a conviction so he's held now his lawyers did not waive the right to an extradition hearing but that also doesn't mean they're going to have one you know I've read some some articles about sort of what the conditions are in the the the in the jail in which he's being held today doesn't seem like a great does it doesn't seem like a place you would want to be uh oftentimes when a defend is held anywhere no matter how nice or not nice a hold or or um often has a defendant start to think about should I just wave uh extradition should I should I move as quickly as possible with the case and we may very much see that here if there is an extradition hearing and this is sort of I think an important Point it'll kind of almost take on a life of like a preliminary hearing you're going to learn more facts about the case because the strength of the evidence will be important and and SBF lawyers will likely challenge the charges and one thing that's really interesting in an extradition hearing is most extradition treaties require that the charges in the case are applicable in both jurisdictions so essentially when U.S prosecutors crafted this indictment they had to be sure that these types of charges were also punishable by jail time essentially or really severe penalties also in the Bahamas and when he gets brought back to the United States when the defendant gets brought to back the United States they cannot change those charges at all what you are doing is you're essentially promising the Bahamas that these are the charges that you like him extradited on and those charges will not change so what SPF lawyers will do when I was a prosecutor I had this done to me they will they will challenge the charges here saying no no there's not a corollary here that makes sense uh from being under Bahamian law that could be potentially one of the ways you challenge this I think in this case that's going to be very very difficult because these are pretty straightforward serious fraud charges but those are the types of arguments lawyers will make against extradition he will likely be extradited but it will ultimately be up to him as sort of how long it takes and how much you fight it and maybe there's a world you just want to move on with the case come to the U.S and sort of face the charges but that'll ultimately be up to the defendant and his legal team and so if they decide to hold an extradition hearing it's because they're saying we want to fight this extradition here's our reasons for why either this case or SPF himself should stay in the Bahamas is that the purpose of that how did you just say that so much more succinctly than than I did yes that's uh that is uh that that's exactly right okay but if he if he attempts to do that then because I don't know if you have been following also well we we I'm just going to ask you a direct question about this because this is the other thing that is like a little bit of a sideshow and it's a little bit like what's going on there there's this jurisdictional battle between the American legal team and then the Liquidators that were appointed by a Bahamian court and the us-based bankruptcy lawyers are refusing to give access to the Bahamian base Liquidators to um some of the computer systems saying that they colluded with SPF to fraudulently fraudulently mint hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new tokens they also say that before the bankruptcy when the Bahamian citizens were allowed to withdraw what ended up being 100 million dollars worth of crypto from FTX that that was you know kind of in collusion again with Bohemian authorities so what are you kind of watching out for when it comes to this jurisdictional battle how could that affect things yeah I think the short answer is I don't know I think there's sort of more nuanced answers that or sort of how we even kicked off the show today is the the criminal case is always going to take priority particularly sort of for for the defendant himself his lawyers will have to have access what they need to mount his defense and the criminal lawyers will likely be very different than the people involved in the bankruptcy hearing so as I said sort of the short answer is I don't really know how the impact will be but I think the focus here will be on his detention extradition and then ultimately how to sort of fight these charges in the U.S what is so unique and extraordinary about this case is there's so much that's going to be going on in the background in terms of the bankruptcy proceedings regulatory action you're going to see civil cases from plaintiffs you know users customers of of of all this and and the bankruptcy case people are going to line up and that's going to be sort of that piece but from a pure criminal standpoint you know that case is going to proceed first so even SPF his Focus will be on the criminal part and you know it sounds like what you are saying is that if he tries to fight extradition then that means he could end up getting a more severe punishment once you know it's it's hard to say exactly how fighting extradition will sort of impact the case um but but certainly it will delay the case if there's a you know weeks or potentially months and extradition hearings that are that are you know aggressively fought can take time and well that but that will mean that he will be it'll be delay in the extradition which will delay the criminal case for moving forward which will ultimately delay any kind of resolution so it will and then it will delay resolution of all those civil cases so a a prolonged uh extradition hearing will definitely set the case back and it's a case that is already going to likely take a long time just based on the facts of it all right and as for the plea deal isn't that something that could kind of shorten the timeline it can absolutely shorten the timeline I mean it um but but a plea will like would likely have to result in some type of cooperation again this is me sort of speculating just based on experience and cooperation especially in in complicated cases can take time what cooperation means is not sort of sitting down and and chatting through sort of what happened once it really means a series of meetings over the course of months where you're debriefing with teams of agents and investigators and prosecutors on sort of what happened so a they can maybe try to find the funds and B so they can ensure this doesn't happen again really sort of like what do prosecutors and agents and investigators and even Regulators need to know here to ensure that there's not another FTX those are sort of the ways that he can probably provide the most information but that takes time so essentially like his bargaining chips if he does a plea deal is he like kind of helps them come up with guidelines to prevent this from happening again is that because he can't turn on other people right that like it seems like right that that that's kind of the interesting thing so people ask well how can you cooperate if you can't turn on other people well you know hey there's always the potential to turn on other people and I think we'd have to figure out maybe those people are within FTX maybe they're not but I think more interestingly his chip is hey I can help you recover the funds for the victims here you know I know where X amount of money is that could potentially make victims whole so that's probably where more of his sort of real real knowledge here lies and and we'll see how it plays out I I oftentimes when you get this high it's hard to get a plea because it's hard to have cooperation but we'll see how it ultimately plays out all right well is there anything else that I didn't ask you about this case that you think my listener should know you know it's it it is it is extraordinary on so many levels I think you really got to the heart of it when you talked about the speed of the of the indictment here and sort of the work that's gone into it um but I think it's I think it's important to be patient and let the justice system at this point play itself out and For Better or Worse that that often takes time but um but but I I think that that now we're sort of have a better road map just based on experience of sort of how this is going to play out from extradition uh ultimately to a what that will be a preliminary hearing or a tension hearing when he arrives in the U.S then ultimately to either it's a period of negotiation or it's a period of litigation getting ready for trial and this would be a a pretty interesting trial so we're now sort of understanding what the roadmap is going to look like but we are literally pre-first inning when it comes to sort of what what ultimately this the the ball game will look like okay if you were to put onto on a plea deal versus a trial what would those be you know it is very very hard to go to trial when you're looking at a guideline range of life in prison um and and that typically is sort of the biggest hammer that the government has the government is is really the the way if you if you cooperate if you you know help you could potentially get down from that type of range so I I would say you know I'm not a betting man um and and wouldn't put a number on it but um it's really hard to go to trial when you're staring down the barrel of life in prison all right well thanks so much Arie this has been a really great conversation I appreciate that you came Unchained thank you so much for having me always don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap while Arie and I spoke a lot about Sam Pinkman freed and FTX during the interview there are a few other things that happened this week that we didn't get to cover a committee has been established to represent unsecured creditors of FTX and more than 100 Affiliated companies in the U.S bankruptcy proceedings the committee will serve as a voice for FTX customers in court and allow the proceedings to move forward the White House declined to comment on whether it would return campaign donations by bankman freed to President Joe Biden or whether other elected officials should return similar donations financial institutions are looking to buy claims from FDX customers who would then be able to receive payouts now rather than in years investors such as Apollo Global Management and a tester have shown interest and 507 Capital has already purchased claims from hedge funds
