den hun a freelance journalist and contributor to the block who has been researching the BitFenix tether situation for over a year welcome Robert yon hi hi thanks for having me I was in Berlin when all this news about Pitt Phoenix and tether broke and I have barely had time to keep up on all the developments since and there's been a ton why don't you start with a high-level overview of what has happened starting with kind of like setting the scene from early 2017 when BitFenix lost its banking relationship with Wells Fargo right well I think we can fill an entire podcast with that one by itself but yeah so so in in in March of 2017 Bates Phoenix was using banks in in Taiwan and they have been using those for quite a while but at that point Wells Fargo stop being or stopped offering his services to be a correspondent bank to them and that really got them into a jam like they had no access to stable banking and basically the way out of that was first to buy time by suing Wells Fargo where they tried ads that they reach were lawsuits but then secondly died by starting to work with with this third-party payment processors and then particularly a crypto capital if we fast forward a little bit to what's happening now is we now know that BitFenix is is down 850 million dollars or not necessarily down but it's missing them and it's they're inaccessible because they're apparently with kids who have the crypto capital but they have been seized by authorities at least that's what they have been told they're sort of contesting this story from crypto capital but at the end of the day at this moment they're missing this money and the way to solve that because they had troubles yeah processing their withdrawals for their customers was to drawn a line of credits from Tedder and the disabled coin that is directly associated with bit snacks or basically it's the same people behind them so that's sort of the very quick of what happened in 2017 and with a fast forward like right now bit snacks as a serious issue basically and so everybody in the crypto community or not everybody but you know most people are familiar with it Phoenix and tether but it really sounds like the loss of this money starts with this other company that most people are not familiar with crypto capital so what happened there exactly so what happened there is basically if you look at how this cup company was operating it seems that they were like getting in companies in different different countries either incorporating on or buying them over buying them up and then they used those companies to open accounts at various banks so we know about bank accounts in Poland's in Portugal in the US and a few few other ones but those are the very important countries to remember and whenever like at some point those accounts stopped working either Bank shuttin down or in fact they were seized by authorities so basically they were playing this cat-and-mouse game to use accounts for as long as possible but at some point yeah the music stopped playing and then they moved on to new accounts so that was the way that they were getting bank accounts and then for bits and X specifically they were providing these accounts as directly to be like the deposit address for people to deposit fiat currency into bits for next platform so for the 850 million when it comes to that you know that is the amount that I guess was lost through crypto capital but what is the current status of that money or at least the portion that we have information about yeah basically we know that from what business is told in New York State Attorney's general's office said is 850 million that is yeah basically tied up with creative capital so what we know is that they're there they're part of our day have been seized or at least part of it has been seized in three countries than the country just names being Poland Portugal and the US and all we can confirm is that there was an entomology laundering operation impotant linked to the subsidiary of crypto capital right so this happened in early in 12 2017 and I've I can almost so simply did get you to date but it's really like the end of January around then that's the was the initial move that led to the seizure of 202 companies and then later on a follow up company so a third company was then involved in the investigation and so one is if said subsidiary cryptic Capital One is connected to crypto capital through the same people and the third one was used by crypto capital for its own customers also to obtain bank accounts so that's that what we is what we can confirm and in that light it was related to around freedom on the 50 million dollars or equivalent of that but we do not know for sure if that full amount is also part of the 850 million that is that bit snacks is missing and then import ago we know more or less that something happened there as well but it's not really clear whether or not we're really talking about a seizure by authorities or not and we do also know now with wit news breaking a few day a few days later where Reginald Fowler and Ravi Joseph were indicted for among others bank fraud and conspiracy to do so that there's also money seized in the u.s. nether there was in this indictment it was related to that they were saying a we want to have bank accounts we're opening bank accounts for real estate business but in fact is what these were indeed accounts to process transactions for crypto currency exchanges and we know that it was one of them was bit snacks through crypto capital like these accounts were used for them one of the accounts League even named the number of it in that indictment matches an account that was used by bit snacks so we also know that money has been seized there we don't know the amount dough and all of these actions they may not all deal with the exact same entities but the people behind those entities are are roughly the same is that correct meaning like cryptic Capital global trade solutions global trading solutions which are actually two different companies one in one in Switzerland one in the US and so can you kind of describe yeah how all those are related yeah so so cryptic capital was originally from from Panama but now it's operating indeed from a company in Switzerland it's called global a global trade solutions and then there's another company and that's linked to the to the mr. Fowler that's now been indicted here in the US this which is called global trading Solutions LLC but they're from whether you can tell they're they're separate companies but it's it's yeah for more it's been described to me as this the map that the American companies like an agent of crypto capital but from what it looks like is that it's what sort of the u.s. branch of it's like on paper it's separates in practice it was it was only dealing them with each other and then if you look at the people we then well the mr. Reginald Fowler was he's not part of crypto capital as far as we can tell but oh we have some like wire details that we could look at which were through companies owned by him in Portugal that was sending out fields withdrawals from BitFenix process through crypto capital so there's multiple links with the same people get with money going one way or the other which we encrypt a capital and this American company and then we also have these two different moves by the New York regulators do those moves seem coordinated yeah so if we look at the need so we have the New York attorneys-general offers in relation to BitFenix and then we need this indictment by the Southern District of New York for mr. Fowler and var beat yourself yes they seem very much related so one for of course there are only five days apart like of course it was an unsealed indictment we now learned just now that the initial indictment which issued on the 11th of April so a little bit earlier but considering that it's unsealed now it does look like there was on purpose I'm perfectly done until this other file was issued and if you think about it if you if you look at that yeah that they're trying to find the the money that's missing or at least bits for Nexus I would hope then it would make all the much sense that they're actually cooperating on this if they suspect that script of capital is telling them a false story right they would have every incentive to try to get that money back and cooperate with in this case then the New York Attorney General's Office yeah to see where this money actually is or and try to get it back I think we can yeah we can just assume that that the different offices in New York communicate with each other so yeah they're they're connected yeah and I would say that also makes sense although you know we're not really sure right now but it just seems like obviously if that Phoenix hadn't trusted crypto capital with its money crypto capital wasn't returning the money and now the regulator are going after cryptic capital and the finnex things that that could help them get the money back of course you know the incentives would line up you know but but I would definitely say one detail that stuck out of course which a lot of people have been talking about is the fact that BitFenix engaged crypto capital but they did not drop a contract with them which you know probably another source of their woes all right so we're gonna discuss yes so the moment the moment I read that my jaw dropped like I mean I sign a contract for just to publish a story or do I mean come on millions of dollars yeah all right so we're gonna discuss some recent more recent developments and also bit for Nexus initial exchange offering in a moment but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors did you know that if money-laundering were an economy its GDP would be the size of Canada's large volumes of tainted crypto assets move through financial networks often below the radar of banks cyber criminals use unregulated crypto exchanges to avoid detection no wonder governments around the world are rolling out tough new anti money laundering laws for crypto currencies complying with those laws isn't easy banks and exchanges need the best cryptocurrency intelligence available to avoid penalties now you can use the same powerful AML and compliance monitoring tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy to learn more visit cipher trace comm slash Unchained at consensus 2019 hear from trailblazers like neil ferguson christine Moy head of JP Morgan's blockchain program Bryan Armstrong the CEO of coinbase and others leading the way in blockchain and crypto technology participate in a hackathon at Microsoft's Tech Center where developers will compete for $30,000 in prizes and network with executives developers founders regulators investors governmental x' and more get your tickets now as this event is getting close to selling out go to www.hsn sis 2019 com2 register don't forget to use code unconfirmed three hundred so they know we sent you back to my conversation with Robert yon den hun so on Thursday which is actually the day you and I are recording there was a yet another development involving Reginald feller so what happened there yeah so today another court filing was made in this case by the district of Arizona and it was related to the plaintiff being a flight risk so they asked that he remains detained until the trial and this was published or at least the document I found it's just minutes before we started recording it so I've quickly gone over it I might if I missed something we'll send some tweets out but it looks like that the document itself it's it really specifies like what they were doing and one of the key things to look at is that basically the prosecutors they found sort of an email exchange where they were talking about the sort of I believe it's called a US workbook or something and they were in and it's sort of shows that they were contemplating or perhaps even executing already that they were going to take like ten percent of the money that they were running which would mean or indicate that ten percent of the money they were being proud they were processing for crypto capital and that they were trying to sort of embezzle it I suppose and the other thing related to that is that one of the main reasons why they think he's a flight risk is that mr. Fowler has a lot of money in accounts abroad overseas so to the point where and I'm quoting for the document is that he could live indefinitely abroad from the funds that he has basically so that means that there's still a lot of money missing perhaps not seized we don't know exactly how that all lines up but clearly there's more going on here than just money being seized from crypto capital itself Wow all right yeah and there's one other this well this isn't a development but but or I mean it is a development but it's more kind of news that something will happen on Monday I read a coin desk article that had been updated to say quote on Tuesday New York Supreme Court Justice Joel Cohen ordered that New York Attorney General's Office to demonstrate to the court why the Attorney General's initial ex parte order should not be cancelled outright or at least modified to allow BitFenix and tethers employees to access a line of credit offered by tether to BitFenix the NY AG must submit a response detailing its reasoning by May 6 2019 and that's Monday so what is the significance of that to be honest I'm not a hundred percent sure because I wouldn't say I'm particularly familiar or at least not familiar enough with US law how that would work out but what for my what I do know from well actually mostly having followed what's been going on with mr. Muller in in the u.s. is that usually yeah you start reading a lot of things about law from what I understand is that usually the chords really puts a high level of a high burden on being able to prove that a move is necessary on the government's like usually the government has mostly resources to to prove something so make sure that it's really necessary so for me this is not a positive or negative in a sense like that it's good for bid for next or bad so basically this is just sort of something that has to be done what the outcome of that is I I don't know okay so let's now move on to the fact that BitFenix is now apparently planning an initial exchange offering of 1 billion dollars what's your take on why they're doing this and whether or not it's a good move yeah so basically I wrote earlier this week and in one of the articles about this about these developments like maybe BitFenix is realizing that it needs a plan B so they were first there were some rumors from apparently a share would saying like hey we expect his money to become available within just a few weeks well that seems very unlikely if you look at that's all we know for example that that the Polish investigation has been ongoing for a year and I can also I know also that it's still ongoing so matter of weeks is not very realistic I wouldn't say near future is very realistic so maybe they're looking into a way to to close the gap in a different way like if you think about it and an initial exchange offering for 1 billion dollars would cover the whole the 850 million that they currently have so that's that's take one whether or not that's a good thing or to be honest I would expect that they have communicated this also with an attorney the attorney general's office in New York then again having read the the filing button I didn't buy that office again they're seen some we've been a breakdown in a communication when this tether line of credit started to happen like postponing that they had to produce documents and then once this line of credit was really closed then all of a sudden things were were produced for the for the office so I don't know first I was thinking they must have at least communicated this plan right but I'm not so sure anymore it's so whether or not that's it's a good idea from that perspective I would hope so if they've communicated and and they're they've been given green light to do so then probably it's a good thing otherwise not for sure how that how that officers gonna respond to that plan if executed yeah there's something about this that reminds me a little bit of back when they had the hack and then they socialize the losses with that token where you know I just and I think this is what a lot of people's complaint is with fit for necks and tether that it appears in it you know whether or not that is actually the case I think remains to be seen but it appears that they are really smart with the different ways that you can use magic internet money and so indeed what I'm saying so there is something that appears a little bit like Oh like you're in a pickle just create a token so we'll see yeah whether or not this is something that has there has a regulators blessing I guess yeah I can't I can't add though that from what I've been told by a source very just also not too long ago is that so I guess this is sort of a mini school but I wouldn't stress that this is a rumor I cannot confirm this but apparently there there is a launch scheduled for invited investors with BitFenix in Hong Kong on the 14th of May so that could indicate that this initial exchange offering is indeed yeah going to happen but I cannot confirm this so take a bit of grain of salt but otherwise you've heard it here first okay okay well I guess we will you know a fence are moving quickly so we find out soon enough whether or not that can be verified well the last couple questions I went ask why do you think it is that the market hasn't reacted much yeah there's a good question I thought I saw a tweet by Alex Kruger he's a trader and he was actually listening some some some reasons why it might be quickly good getting getting it back up but so he was just like one shortening is expensive and as well as arbiters might profit from it from it from when tighter prices TVI between different exchanges at the same time other stable coins are are less liquid than USD tea so maybe there is a it's still functioning in that regard yeah so they're they're multiple reason he lists a few more so there's multiple reasons why that could be that it's it hasn't really been been fluctuating that much or going down as much I think the pre means like only 1% at the moment but the premium on bits next though is much higher yeah yeah I think you know there are people I think for Bitcoin on BitFenix it is there it is trading on a premium one thing I would recommend people do is you guys should listen to the most recent episode of what grinds my gears which is Melton's and Jill Carlson's podcast because it's all it's all about the tether situation but Melton made some really insightful remarks about the usefulness of tether and also just commented on the fact that there are a lot of people outside of the US who traded on secondary markets and they you know they're not they're not really following like what's going on with the New York Attorney General's Office and and in general she was saying that like it's almost like there are two markets for tether there's the one where you know you need to withdraw and make deposits and you know obtain the tether and then like it has this second life right where there are many markets where it trades but not you know it's not like you're gonna withdraw a dollar suits just trading against Bitcoin or wherever and so in that regard like it's serving a useful you know purpose there and and that could be another factor for why you know the price hasn't plummeted despite the fact that it's only 74% bagged at the moment yeah I mean last question what are you you know what questions are you looking at going forward huh well I'm mostly looking forward to learn about where is the money basically follow the money is always a good good thing to for a investigative journalist so where is that is it all there all the eight under fifty million in this case for bid for next is that still there or is part of it well now or or maybe not retrievable so to say and then if we if we do find it and is it going to be returned in that sense like in that case that usually if an if money is seized and especially if it's in this case seized by by a company that also assets for another person or company then you would as BitFenix would have to make claim to to the amount but yeah that might be tricky to prove especially with all these commingling of source I don't know how that would work out but you could also have competing claims that somebody else is claiming part of the money as well and and from my understanding at least here in the Netherlands those kinds of situations can last a long long time before being resolved yeah so we will see what happens with that one last thing I would urge listeners to do is I will put a link in the show notes to this satiric article by coin Jazeera that had me like laughing out loud it was so funny it's skiiers pretty much everybody in this story and because if you've been following the commentary encrypted Twitter suddenly all these people that would always be shouting proof of reserves whenever there was any indication that any exchange might be running a fractional reserve now they're suddenly defending and exit being only 74 presenta there so it was making fun of you like that than it was making fun of the actual fractional reserve banking system that we have in the US and the fact that the regulator's are going after tether when actually the normal banking system is even less less fully backed in anyway so the whole thing is just hilarious I just was dying reading it but anyway well thank you so much Robert yawn it's been great having you an unconfirmed yeah thank you very much
