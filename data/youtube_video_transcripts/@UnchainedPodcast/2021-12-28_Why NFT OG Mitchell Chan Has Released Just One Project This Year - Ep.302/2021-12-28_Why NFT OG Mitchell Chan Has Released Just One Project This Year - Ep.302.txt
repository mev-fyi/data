io unchained to start earning nodal cash today's guest is artist mitchell f chan welcome mitchell hi laura so you created your first nft art in 2017 and in that process i guess i would say and you can correct me that you discovered an artwork that you could well argue was the first nft ever and that that existed long before blockchains existed um but before we get into all of those details why don't we just fill people in on your background before your career as an artist before you even got into crypto sure so my career as an artist i probably begins in 2006 um when i began you know working and exhibiting professionally and i began as many artists do as a mediocre painter um but i was sort of just just mediocre enough to be scraping by and as time went on i started incorporating more and more technology into my work i started learning about technology as an art medium and the history of techno of technology based art largely just through you know workshops at artists run centers here in toronto particularly at interaccess media arts center and then began incorporating more of it into my work with the idea that i was interested in making work that is about the society that we live in and the society that we live in is very much technology driven and so if you want to make work about a technology driven society you ought to understand technology pretty well and if you want to be really clever about it maybe even use technology um in your artwork and so that's what i did i continued my studies at the art institute of chicago and eventually you know sort of had a career exhibiting work sort of around north america and creating public artworks large-scale installations architectural scale projects you know big 12-foot tall sculptures that would sit in a park and never move and never be resold um i was you know most of my career was creating the complete opposite of nfts very big physical artworks um and that was uh that was most of my career but sort of as i was doing that and i was also creating these projects for art galleries for exhibitions that were about parts of our society that are invisible right structures um these things that affect us very profoundly but have no physical form and realizing that when you understand some of these invisible technologies um you can make art out of them and you can you can give them form and that's sort of where i was and then of course you start thinking about well you know there's this economic system around us that is you know everywhere and that it seems to inform every aspect of our lives but it's very difficult to make a mark inside that system it's very difficult to mold it into an artwork and i discovered that you know well but but actually there's this new money and it exists on the internet and it's programmable i know a thing or two about programming and if i can program money then i can make a sculpture out of this currency and to do that but i probably want to think very deeply about what it means and what it's all about and that's how i ended up in in crypto i ended up in crypto literally looking for an art material i saw it as something that could be molded and sculpted and before we actually get into that i do want to tell people about one of your artworks and why don't you actually because i'm sure you'll do a better job explaining it than i will but it involved water vapor and i'm just curious yeah if you could describe that and tell people what that artwork was about yeah so so this was me on the precipice of discovering crypto all right and and cryptoskeptics will have no difficulty here uh uh seeing how one led into the other because prior to crypto i was making sculptures about as close to nothing at all as possible or at least i was making sculptures with as close to nothing as all uh as close to nothing as possible so the sculpture i made right before i created my first crypto artwork it was it took up an entire room and the room was largely empty save for two holes in facing walls and out of these holes in the walls would come two clouds of water vapor and they were almost invisible except for some very dramatic lighting that i'd installed in the room each of these clouds of water vapor was maybe three feet in diameter and they would move slowly they were shot out of the wall and they would move towards each other until finally in the middle of the room in the center of this ring of lights they would collide poof and they would dissipate into nothingness and this would happen every 12 seconds there'd be new clouds and a new confrontation and a new collision and then new dissipation and nothingness and all this would happen over an algorithmically generated score that i'd produced i'd written a program out of code that was pulling headlines from the new york times in real time and it was kind of putting them through a vocoder and setting them to this algorithmically generated cello score and so it was just reading the news and it was this really incredible time it kind of feels like they've all been incredible times when it comes to reading the news but this was right around the time it was right after trump had been elected and right before his inauguration and you know and so there would just be these words that would repeat over and over again you know and they would just go alternative facts boof and these clouds would dissipate into nothingness there's like kellyanne conway and boof nothingness um and this what i was the and this was what i was making and it's probably the best way to summarize the type of art that i was interested in which is that we had this system of discourse and this way of presenting ideas and all of it seemed to be spectacular but none of it seemed to have any substance at its core right and yet that it was insubstantive did not like that did not preclude the possibility of it having a dramatic effect on the world you know um and so it's just like this is my frustration as an artist from like like my goal how do you it's it's fine to criticize and say that there's nothing there right there's no substance but you may be missing the fact that it still has a dramatic effect just being set up as a spectacle means that the nothingness bleeds out into real somethingness you know and this was my aim of what to represent as an artist that threshold between nothingness and definitely definitely somethingness okay so i feel like this is the perfect segue to discussing your first nft art because you know there are a lot of themes around the actual artwork and then the either experience of that artwork or the commodity value of it that you played with in that first artwork and it's so incredibly fascinating um so yeah why don't you describe how you came to create that first nft art and what it was sure so i'm i'm coming like i'm coming fresh to crypto from 2017. i have a ve like it's 2017. i have you know some awareness of i know a little bit about bitcoin but i'm sort of just discovering ethereum for the first time and so i'm sympathetic to a lot of the you know criticisms or shall i say skepticism about crypto um you know there's nothing there it's insubstantial it's not tethered to anything it is free-floating uh it doesn't represent a uh um a certain quantity of gold um in in in a vault somewhere but i'm a conceptual artist so that doesn't bother me in fact i understand that in fact it's untetheredness and its free floatiness is what could give it power right and of course i'm an artist i'm also most interested in yeah what does this mean for art um not that at this point does it seem like ever you know there's going to be a significant amount of art that is created on blockchain or transacted on blockchain that's a preposterous idea in 2017 but i mean yeah what if what if this will be a fun little thought exercise and so i lear i learn a little bit about the technology i teach myself a little bit of solidity i read about you know read the bitcoin white paper and the ethereum white paper etc begin to understand the ideas behind it it becomes clear to me that you cannot create an artwork on the blockchain as as i understand it right i can't put an image on there it's simply too um too too big there's too much data of course there were other people who had figured out some things about you know representing art on blockchain and pointing to artworks through blockchain but i'm not in deep enough to recognize yet the work of you know ria myers who had been who had been talking about that um and even crypto punks hasn't yet come out when i when i begin this right so i'm like all you can do really is have a pointer like a pointer to something you can suggest you know ownership of a thing and you can trust that the thing which is pointed to does in fact exist and have merit and have you know um artistic sensibility to it and i think well has this ever been done in art right and i research and i research artists who have worked with markets and artists who have you know turned finance into their medium but really the interesting conversation is the artists who tried to work with nothingness as their medium and there's one story in particular that sticks out to me as being so perfectly representative of what art on blockchain would be and that was the story of eve klein and his zones of immaterial pictorial sensibility as they came to become known so this was a crazy story and it happened and it started in 1958 so i'm looking at something that's like 60 years old at the time and this artist was best known for creating these blue monochrome paintings all right they were this incredible dazzling hypnotic blue it was a blue that he'd actually patented and he was an artist who he um eventually critics would call him and the artists who are like him new realists because they weren't trying to abstract things normally when we think of extreme minimalism like we think of abstraction but he was trying to create something that was even more real than a representation of like you know you you you you paint a house on a hillside and that's not really a house on a lan on a hillside right but he wants to create a real feeling and he's very famous even at this point in his life for doing this but he's really frustrated by the fact that as long as it's paint on canvas there's always this expectation that the paint on canvas is supposed to represent something if it's supposed to represent something that can't be real at all right so he creates this exhibition in 1958 it premieres in a small gallery in paris and there is apparently a lineup of like 3 000 people waiting to see this because as i said eve klein is very famous at this time he is like you know star art boy and they enter the room after waiting in line and they walk through this blue curtain and they get into the room and there's nothing in the gallery at all it's completely empty and what klein insists and look this at this point in the year 2017 in the year 2022 whatever this sounds like a bad joke it sounds like a really low effort first year art project and now it is because there's a very low barrier to entry to copying this but we have to believe that klein does this with the utmost of sincerity and that it fits in the career trajectory that he's on and his pattern it fits right what he insists is that he insisted he has quote overcome the problematics of art that what is in the gallery there with you is the pure sensibility of the color blue just the feeling of that he is imbued by the power vested in him he has imbued this space with the color blue but it requires no material indicator no material referent right it is just pure belief and so this kind of resonates with me in blockchain all right you can think about this in a positive way or you can think about this if you want to lean into the critique of blockchain it is true that there is nothing there and that can make it a scam or can make it extremely profound right i mean the fact that there is nothing there but a promise if you believe in the promise in the case of bitcoin the promise of a set issuance schedule all right or the promise of the ideologies that inform the technology um that can be more powerful to a lot of people than the promise of being tethered to gold bars in a vault right or the promise of a centralized government um in some ways that lack of direct referent is very empowering but it doesn't end there it's not just that this guy says that there's something there and there's nothing and ooh that's just like blockchain that's only kind of one layer of the story the other layer is that he sells these things right and he's very interested in just as i was as you know as a young artist the idea that actually the immaterial is more powerful than the material okay the promise is more powerful than the gold bar in the vault he says you can buy these things but you will have to give up a quantity of pure gold all right you have to pay for these things in pure gold so he knows what he's doing he knows that he's playing with ideas of material durability and the real durability which is an immaterial and very spiritual promise you can buy these things for pure gold if you give him a certain amount of gold you get an exchange this paper token all right a paper receipt it indicates exactly which invisible artwork you have which artwork you own that has no physical aspect it's just an empty amount of space imbued with an idea you get this this piece of paper right and i'm like okay if i'm gonna sell artwork on blockchain like that's what i'm doing right i can make these cr i can make these currencies i can make you know a currency very easily i just have to imbue faith and view a sense of myself into it and essentially make a promise that there is something here right and klein's project eve klein's project went further right because again he's really playing with art as a promise versus art like art as a profound promise versus art is a financial promise okay and so you have this ticket this receipt this what is in every way a paper version of a non-fungible token and he says that now that means that you legally have ownership over it and indeed if you had one of these things today if you got them i'm sure you could get a pretty penny putting it up for auction i'm sure museums would be happy to have it it's a very important artwork in the history of the 20th century but it says to really really own a piece of art that means that it becomes a part of you it becomes inextricably linked to you so if you meet me at the river sun we'll perform this ritual together and we'll burn your paper token the only physical proof you have that you just handed over a certain amount of gold to me for an invisible artwork but you're going to burn it and i'll throw half that gold in the river and then only then after this sort of like spiritual journey that we've taken together do you become the proper owner of this artwork which is pure sensibility and it is and and then it it can't be resold it can't be a financial commodity anymore uh it is simply a part of you it is an experience that we have shared right and that is imparted onto you and that was the thing and i'm like holy smokes like i mean holy smoke like i'm not like i'm reading this and i'm learning about this i'm going through all his journals right i'm finding all the old papers i can and i'm like this is what art on blockchain is right we are like i know that i can make these tokens i know that i can make a currency but it is going to be like like that is going to represent the separation of like an arts commodity form which now on blockchain would be super duper liquid super duper transferable it would not just be a commodity form of art it would be the uber commodity form of art right versus the immaterial idea the concept is behind an artwork and now it is supe it is the uber like immaterial artwork right and i'm like this is it so i guess i'm just gonna do this and i am going and uh i wrote a 33-page essay that i cheekily called the blue paper that sort of juxtaposed these histories the history of bitcoin and ethereum and the history of conceptual art and eve klein and just so that readers could kind of make that connection themselves and i uh made a you know i i made a smart contract for a modified erc20 token and it was different in the sense that you know it had you know there were specific tokens that were identifiable and it ended up being essentially a non-fungible token and all i was doing was really trying to translate these ideas from conceptual art that were 60 years ago into solidity and and that's what happened yeah i i love so many bits of this story um by the way uh the one commentary that i absolutely have to make is i love how the people who wanted the kind of like the apotheosis of this artistic experience had to burn their entire receipt and he only had to give up half of his gold i think that's hilarious i love it too and i i mean i've been i've actually been uncomfortable with that element of the story for so long until like now i i my uncomfortableness with it delights me because you know i think that you know surely like you've been in this space long enough to know that it's really difficult ever to understand how pure everybody's motives are right and even those with the purest of motives they can't totally extricate themselves with the context of some sort of showiness or even if you want it to be ungenerous scammingness you know like it's part of it you're always buying like like you're always prone to the possibility that you just got duped you know yeah yeah but i mean well do you think that people did i mean so first of all out of all the people who bought the eve klein works the only three of them burned them as far as i understand yeah um and so why don't we before we keep going why don't we fill in people on what you did because you essentially kind of like copied the receipt um but you know put your own spin on it and so when people were buying your nft just explain what it was that they were getting exactly sure so my piece it was like very much a derivative work right that is a stream of art that i've been on for a long time where i often will recreate historic works using a new technology with just enough of a spin and for me this is because i'm someone who very much cares about art and art history and i care about it because i believe that artworks are a really useful tool in understanding the world around us and so when i recreate previous works using new technologies i get to figure out okay were the ideas in that artwork like were they good enough that they're still relevant today and then i look at the new technologies that i'm you know that i'm sculpting with and i'm saying all right and when i try to sculpt this idea with this new technology what does it tell us about the technology does it have a sort of intrinsic bent towards good or evil or whatever you know i mean simplified you know and so i'd previously tried to you know reproduce works by you know the conceptualist solo wit with code and i'd previously tried to reproduce works by jmw turner out of like kinetic robotic components things like that right and so this was a derivative project and i feel like this is an important thing for me to do just because it's going to help me and anybody who stumbles across this project kind of have a new perspective on what blockchain and crypto is all about and it's going to help anybody who's coming at this from an art perspective understand the the like promise or potential peril of crypto but you know in a language that they understand so i did i like i really i just i researched all of the rules for the transaction of this artwork um and i copied them in solidity and like when you do that it turns out that you make a non-fungible token whether you wanted to or not and believe me like i'm a pretty hack coder okay i'm not a code genius so i couldn't like just invent non-fungible tokens on my own all right not that i mean people had already done that unbeknownst to me whatever but like um but then you know it was also important the other side of this beyond just the technology the rules the financialization is you know the meaning the profound meaning and that was important to me to make sure that i actually believed in this so i wanted to understand more the ideology of crypto um i wanted to understand like the extremely emotional connection that people have in this space which is sometimes you know very idealistic sometimes very unhealthy so i really did immerse myself in crypto trading um you know for non-stop for for for for six months being trying as hard as i could to be in communities um and i tried also to think very much about you know my own art and my own sensibility that was imbued in this piece you know i went so far i traveled i did color studies about you know what do i you know really can i really like concentrate and focus on this idea and writing the essay was central to that as well because you know just putting that effort into communicating is i think what lets people know that i'm you know sincere about this that this is not somebody who's just kind of like having a joke you know this is a really you know profound investigation for me so i created all that there were these tokens i presented and premiered them at interaccess media arts center in toronto where i learned you know most uh uh most of my my trade and it was a the the room was packed when i exhibited it and we minted the first token it was always set up so that you know there were no no marketplaces i ended up crypto punks ended up coming out about a month before i finished this um they had a marketplace that was built right into their smart contract i wasn't smart enough to do that and so but i was happy about that to buy it people had to actually like interact with the smart contract and even as the co even as the project was rediscovered all these years later i made sure never to make a front end dap i always wanted people to have to go in and look at the functions and buy these things because it is about understanding blockchain you know like a little bit of an educational tool um and so and you know um a few people bought them uh that night and in the days after my presentation um but mostly they just sat there um mostly they just sat there for about three and a half years yeah and then what happened then everybody found out about them um slowly at first and then all at once you know it's very much like kind of the story of what happened with nfts in this crazy crazy year right there are a number of people um who uh really i mean they do incredible works like scouring the blockchain for old projects i'd become involved in a few communities and a couple people heard about oh there's this like you know proto nft from 2017 you know seems seems early looks rare um you know we should probably get that and of course you know the people who uh got there first you know ended up being you know big big collectors because that's sort of how they became big collectors as they you know work hard finding stuff so they were people who were really big in the crypto punks community those are the people who kind of bought up um the last of the tranche that was available and that was you know and that was really nice that was really nice and then the smart contract is set up so that i could only make tokens available in bunches of ten and so i would release another bunch of ten and then all of a sudden enough people found out about it right and then fingerprints dow i discovered and they became the first you know major public collector and public advocates for the work as they were building this collection of artwork that they they wanted to tell the story of art on blockchain and so they were the first major collectors in of of of the work publicly and then every time i'd release a series of 10 tokens it would they would just they'd be snapped up sometimes as quickly as like 90 seconds that they would go the other thing that was happening is that every time a new bunch of 10 tokens was released the price doubled right and this was hard-coded into the contract these were on these were sold on a bonding curve and that was a feature of eve klein's artwork as well i mean i mean you would talk about how many weird things he was like really did first nft sold on a bonding curve and so all of a sudden i mean at the time when i made them in 2017 it was not that much money but all of a sudden even like the initial sale price out of the contract was extremely high until the final tranche of 10 tokens was costing 12.8 each each right but it didn't matter they were selling out literally in the same block that i would release them in and then of course there were no more the maximum issuance of this of this token was a hundred and one um and there were only 101 in the world and of course you know we had ourselves a bit of a year didn't we um um and so you know people are discovering this project and not only is it rare uh not only was it early but i think there were a number of people who felt a real connection to the piece that in this piece uh and in the s essay that accompanied it it really was a statement of the values like and the ideology that they believed in um in nfts like this really is the nft thesis statement um it's sort of like you know so what people like you know the ether rocks right people like the ether rocks because of their complete lack of utility right because they refuse to point to anything beyond themselves and you know somebody said you know ether rocks is the joke and this is like the very profound explanation of the joke right um that was made before that and so it does it connects to people and so there ended up being a number of high-profile you know collectors there's fingerprints dow there was justin sun there was xerox b1 who all kind of came in and became champions you know for this work uh justin's sons ape nft foundation translated the blue paper to chinese which like exposed you know the ideas behind it to you know a massive new audience and the thing just kept kept going and going sort of probably culminating in uh an auction at sotheby's which happened in october where you know one of the first you know tokens from the contract minted in 2017 sold for you know one and a half million dollars which is which is crazy yeah one other thing that i love about the artwork is that the smart contract also imitated the way eve klein you know had that burning process and so um why don't you yeah tell about that and also tell about the one person who appears to have called that function sure so just like eve kline's project my project also you can burn your token uh right and there's a burn function that is built uh straight into the smart contract um but it works not exactly like the burn project on most nfts if you burn um so one of the funny things about those primary sales of nfts right is like i had to leave money in the contract so that people could burn them right because if you burn the token you also destroy um half of the money that i originally quote unquote received for it right and so anybody can go and burn their token and it will destroy um half of the original purchase price and it is this weird thing like it it's it's such a it's a really beautiful little social experiment because of course since these things become became valuable and expensive nobody has done that nobody has done that right the only time that somebody did that was like the day after the day after these things went on sale for the first time in 2017 at interaccess when they cost 29 or whatever you know that would have been the equivalent you know somebody bought bought one and they burned it immediately the day after and i don't know who it was right it was done completely anonymously i've been trying to track it down this year i can't find it i even like looked at all my i was like did like did i do that and like not remember no it wasn't me like it wasn't like i i have no idea but that was the only time that that it has happened but yeah anybody yeah go go ahead and watch and and watch my my account wallet balance uh go down okay so if you are listening to this and you were the person who bought that nft and burned it i think mitchell would want to talk to you i would love to yeah okay i really love this artwork and i just love how it is kind of like an extension of a conversation in art history and in a way like puts nfts in that larger context which is super fascinating so in a moment we're going to talk more about nfts and the traditional art world but first a quick word from the sponsors who make

description back to my conversation with mitchell so now that you've kind of experienced um this ride with that initial nft project and since you of course also have extensive experience with the traditional art world what's your take on how the traditional art world views nfts do you think that they are embracing this new art form or not well that's an easy question the answer is i think most definitely not um overall and there are a number of reasons for that um i think i mean you hear a number of criticisms of this space coming up and and i have i and i have a lot of time for these criticisms um but again i feel that you know criticisms can be you know merited and valid and yet not tell even close to all of the story one of the things that i think is well i mean look the first thing we should just talk about is the money right um there is the art world exists in this sort of i think somewhat disingenuous separation of church and state where there is a um commercial art world and there is an institutional art world um in the institutional art world uh i think likes to believe that they are like the custodians and keepers of our cultural history and that and that they do so while remaining separate from the vulgarity of the commercial art world to be politic i'd say i'm not sure how true that is maybe i should just come out and say that i i don't think that is true um but it's an easy lie to maintain because the commercial art world operates through a dearth of information the commercial art world operates by being a black box right initial sale prices are rarely published and the commercial art world gives us just enough information on the secondary art world by doing public auctions and whatnot to feel like we have some waypoints in terms of understanding what values are but of course the vast majority of sales of artworks in the secondary market happen privately and those sales numbers will never really be disclosed and if you and i both call um you know one of the handful of mega dealers who control the flow of you know most of the you know masterpieces of contemporary art you and i would very likely get quoted different prices on the same artwork right um and that's that's how it works right it is a lack of information and it is opacity that makes um the commercial art world work right and in this nft world of course everything is radically transparent right and in fact knowing everybody else knowing exactly what you paid for an artwork is part of the point isn't it right um and i don't know like like that that is part of the point and it's i wonder how different that is than this sort of like the art world again at the highest levels i'm talking about the highest highest levels of the of of the commercial art world of the contemporary art world um but that certainly is a threat you know but then of course most artists don't work at the highest levels like do they right most artists are struggling most artists do not you know don't end up being represented by one of the mega dealers like david zworner or larry gagosian and seeing their work fetching millions of dollars in secondary most of them are struggling for their next show at an artist run center where they may receive a modest grant and hoped to be you know to eventually make it to a mid-tier commercial gallery um and straddle these institutional and commercial worlds at the same time and in the nft world you see that a lot of the entrants are people who wouldn't be perceived to have paid their dues in that system right and so the question becomes well why are all these artists making all of this money all of a sudden they're they're not even the best artists right i mean they're not even the artists who deserve to to make money right i think that some of the posturing is often that you know we want artists to make money but you know not you know not not these artists and you know like i and look i look i do uh i get that i think it's natural to see if you've been working in the art world for a long time and then you see once again only a handful of artists um and often ones that you don't recognize succeeding where you've worked with so many who struggle it's a lot easier it's so funny in broken systems somehow it becomes so much easier to criticize the unworthy few who succeed than the system that has like led the worthy many to fail right that's just an easier thing to point at and criticize um i believe so these are i think some of the i mean some of the reasons why i think we've seen skepticism and the other thing is just that institutions are very slow to move right even i've and and i should say this is like not this has not been my experience with with everybody in the art world i've had a number of meetings with people at museums and galleries and curators who really do have open minds and are curious to hear more and you know i tell them my stories i tell them about you know the about other artists who i feel do a great job telling this story and they are really receptive and then they just say okay but you know we move really slowly here you know it'll take some time yeah i mean i do think it is you know on the fringes i mean not that i'm like really on the up and up with all the art stuff but you know clearly we've seen christie's and sotheby's this year have these auctions so i think you know they kind of recognize all right there was something there but i was curious for the people who collected your ikbs which are the international climb blue is that what what they're called uh which yeah those are your digital zones pieces that we discussed earlier were did they tend to just be crypto people or did you find any traditional art collectors who were interested in those they were i mean i would say all of them crypto people first i mean i would say that all of them were i mean i mean so many of them are i don't want to make totally the distinction because i actually think so many of the people that i've encountered in crypto you know do you know first of all they did have an art appreciation right you know and so many of the people i've encountered in this space both you know people who've collected my work and people who haven't you know have had i i just met so many people with genuine curiosity right and uh we're it it it's remarkable but i would say they all came to it from the crypto pathway much more so than from the the the art pathway but then the secondary sales are those also crypto people or also crypto people oh wow yeah i personally don't see a lot of art people in the market right now oh interesting because um you know since this artwork is very much in conversation with you know a pivotal art work from the traditional art world i would have thought there would be more interest um but that actually leads me to your other project which so i'm i'm a big fan of sol lewitt um this came up in the i were i don't remember if it came up but at least i was at least thinking about it while i was writing the questions from my episode with ria myers i don't remember if we actually discussed it but soloway was a really great conceptual artist and you ended up creating something called the lit generator generator so why don't you explain what that is and your inspiration for it and then we can talk a little bit more about traditional art versus nft stuff sure so i mean like i look i think a lot when a new technology comes out and i don't understand it because i'm not a futurist or a scientist or whatever right i use art as a tool to understand it and so with you know generative art and i'm thinking about these conceptualist school of artists who were active in the 1960s right and so one of the foremost conceptual artists is this guy named solowit and he's very famous for he wouldn't he he would create instructions on how to make a drawing all right and when you wanted to buy a piece by solute he would sell you those instructions just the instructions right and the instructions were like also provided authenticity that whatever came out however you know the instructions were manifested that was a solid drawing and so this is i mean you know from a conceptual point of view it's about all right it's the idea is the actual location of artistic merit and whatever but now all of a sudden and so i made an artwork about that in 2015 where i'm like okay this is essentially basically saying that code can be art i make this computer code uh you know that that that also translates you know one of solowitz wall drawings while drawing number 118 right but then blockchain makes me rethink this all in terms of okay let's we understand that solowitz's work implies that the idea is the center of artistic value but what about the center of financial value this is really interesting because it is the case that when a museum would buy a solid this was the case you know 20 years ago 30 years ago whatever they were buying just instructions they were buying information they were buying data and most of these instructions they were very simple they're almost poetry in their simplicity um right they could easily be put on blockchain and so the idea right and then whatever comes out the other side is is is fine that is still a solid drawing but it is not as important as those instructions right and this is fascinating and this is fascinating to me when i discover art blocks right i discover art blocks in like january of of 2021 and i am like oh this is an evolution of this idea of artists you know creating instructions those instructions being what is for sale and yet managing to preserve the uniqueness of different iterations you know it's like like the iterations come out of these instructions are no longer throw away or discardable like art blocks for me conceptually had upended actually so many ideas that the conceptualist had like i think it's a really important project in in in digital art history um but so anyway i created uh a project on art blocks um that ended up you know being released in the summer in august that was where i um you know similar process i translated well it was i mean i actually translated the program that i made in 2015 the translated solutions from the 1960s and it generated all of these um wall drawings while taking advantages of some of the affordances from uh blockchain and the art blocks platform and so something that was fascinating to me was in the discord that you run there was uh someone in your discord who said you kind of needed to do more drops and you know correct me if i'm wrong but i think aside from the ikbs and then the loit generator generator i don't think you've done much more in terms of nfts and you made a little speech back to this person where you pushed back on this notion that you needed to do more drops so why haven't you done more drops during this nft hype cycle um right i haven't released any more art during this hype cycle because i hate money no that's that's not true that's not true um it's it's nothing so i i wish i were so bold and and revolutionary um no it is because you know remember what i was saying at the beginning when i was talking about eve klein's work how it is sincerity um like like what underpins all of that work is faith uh and belief and i really believe in that and it's but we're it's so weird so much of what we're doing here in nfts and in in blockchain in crypto is like we communicate kind of through the medium of the market which is really weird people talk about market signals you know and like what the market tells us i know this is like a really like super like libertarian view but it seems to hold true in in crypto right and i think that it's very important the way to communicate um your sincerity and your belief in what you do to the market is probably to not abuse the market you know i think i've been very the most important thing to me is is being an artist and continuing to to be an artist and an artist's career is built up very very gradually and you have to build a lot of goodwill as you go and it's important to me that i believe in every single work that i do um and so even though this year obviously the digital zones you know blew up and did very well but that was a project that i you know created when there was no money in it and um you know the lewitt generator generators on art blocks obviously that was produced this year but it was you know a translation of a piece i created in 2014 and there is look it's heck of a year um heck of a year um and there's been a lot of money out there and i am not yeah i am not actually that like radical who can sit here and say that i like you know hate money and don't want to be tainted by it i'm prone i'm susceptible to the same like temptations and self-interest that absolutely anybody is and that is why i haven't really trusted myself to release artwork based on ideas that i've had this year because there is no way to tell whether those ideas are sort of tainted by a desire to grab cash okay um i just i just you can't in in in the face of like such overwhelming market incentive you just you can't trust yourself so um so i'm just i'm i'm going to wait and whatever ideas you know sit with me i am working i mean i'm working on new projects right now um but i will release them after a long time like and i as soon as i know that they're my like real sincere beliefs and real sincere opinions and that is that is not altruistic like that is self-interest because as i said my goal is to be an artist for a long time um it only takes one really scammy cash grab to lose the goodwill that you built up with collectors um so i think i'm just gonna make sure that i i don't do that you know one other thing i found fascinating is that you have been making um i don't quite know what to call them i guess you were calling them artist proofs and they're basically kind of like these physical works for the different collectors of the digital zones and uh for the liquid generator generator for those who you're working on the physical works so why create a physical memento and are they just gifts for these collectors or are you selling them oh no they're just gifts i mean like i yes i have for both my projects um i've made physical gifts still in production i work i do everything very slowly um and so but i just uh generated um prints for my collectors of lewitt generator generator on art blocks and those will be printed in january and then hopefully mailed out by the end of the month and i've been creating physical books physical copies of the blue paper for the 100 collectors of the digital zones and i do that they really are just gifts because i do believe that you know i mean we still do live in the we still do live in the real world um and it's nice to send something to to people's houses i don't i don't charge um anybody anything for them but i i'm extremely grateful for the people who have invested in me and shown faith in me like i've been i've been doing this for a long time i've been like artists like you know i've been an artist for for 15 years um it's really hard to get people to believe in you and it's just like even you know even people even artists who get upset about flippers who buy their work you know for resale value or whatever and don't get me wrong i'd prefer that they stuck around and absorb the ideas but man i was doing this for a long time and nobody was betting on me you know so it's like somebody wants to bet on me i'm like i'll i'll sure i appreciate it i sincerely do i uh and so i just you know i i like to you know make uh gifts for people it's it's nice and so now that you have experienced kind of this frenzied nft art market but then also you have experienced the contemporary art market i was curious for your take on how the two differ it's weird it is obviously i have had more success in these systems that are more transparent right because you you can see how sentiment develops right you can see how the pieces move from collector to collector that is you know that's extremely helpful the the traditional art market that i've been in um has been very opaque except it's very telling that where i was most successful which was in making large-scale public artworks and large-scale sculptures right that is one of the more transparent art markets you can be in because most of these things are created with public money or as part of public programs there is like it's very transparent there is a call that goes out for expressions of interest who would like to make a 20-foot tall sculpture for this park and then everybody puts up their hand and then they choose five people to develop a proposal and then the proposals are public then they pick one and that person gets you know a quarter million dollars or whatever to make their sculpture and that was always as long as the rules were out there for me it was fine like i could accept losing um and i like like th they would even losing would feel like like like forward progress um whereas i know that for so many people the idea of who gets selected and who doesn't in the traditional art world was extremely opaque like it's extremely confusing you can try to pick out patterns you know um and and analyze it but at the end you're kind of reading tea leaves you know so the nft market has made more sense to me however it is also the case i mean criticisms about it being you know turbocharged and based on you know based on financial speculation more so than artistic appreciation those are also valid everybody who has made an nft has chosen to make an artwork on top of a financial technology which means that it is going to be a financial asset and i don't know how that can change i think you can just hope that you get the maximum number of people to stop and think about your ideas and appreciate what you've made along the way and all of these ideas are familiar and comfortable to me because i made public art for most of my career right like most of my career i didn't exclusively make stuff that was going to be in a safe white cube gallery like to be like revered and only ever experienced as an important you know uh uh unveiling of my soul right i made stuff that was the people walked past on their way to the subway station right and you have to accept that and you ha and i had to at a certain point in my career except that that doesn't debase what i'm doing that i can tell stories that are just as meaningful and just as deep and just as profound as the stuff that is protected by that hermetic white cube right but i have this other constraint i have to do it in and honestly and if like if if if pigeons poop on it which they will all right that's okay right i can still tell stories in that medium actually so much of my attitude towards the nft world in the nft market was informed by making public art was in form of making art that was going to be for everyone not always perceived as being completely delicate and special yeah yeah i mean if i think about different public artworks that i've seen um you know many of them are things that are super memorable so i definitely wouldn't say that uh doing that is it has any less value even for the beholder there's one topic that we kind of uh touched on a little bit but i wanted to ask you about it directly how do you think nfts have changed access to the art world for artists that's a big one and now of course there's still a long way to go right because as we know access to crypto is not evenly distributed right we we we know this um and it's only getting worse as gas goes up um as crypto gets more expensive you know pro so so access to crypto is a problem i think that once a person is across that barrier once a person is across that threshold i do see and which is a big you know whatever that's a big caveat i get it um it's not perfect however i mean going to art school having our career is also insanely expensive okay i mean people are coming out of my mfa program like with a hundred thousand dollars in debt all right and no clear like way like you know there's no one waiting to scoop you up from an art school out of your mfa program to give you a six figure salary okay um and so and and and there is a general sense that you you you have to do that mfa and you know take on the student debt to be taken seriously or have a chance of teaching or whatever so there are bears to access everywhere whatever whatever i think that it provides access for a type of person who would not have the barriers to entering the art world are very subtle and very invisible it really helps if you're sociable all right it really helps if you're good at a cocktail party it really helps if you live in a metropolitan center all right it is not a like it is not a coincidence that these major art movements oh like it turns out that everybody who lived in the same apartment block in new york city in 1958 ended up being famous what a weird coincidence right and nobody who grew up in boise idaho did um you know some of that is you know some of that is really tricky um and it's like even for me like i'm a person who i began my you know art career as a person like at a time when you know i had a lot of family stuff going on um i was you know starting my family just as i came out of grad school i had to move away from you know the city where i did grad school literally the day after my graduation right so i didn't have the network there that i supposedly spent all that money on at you know a grad school right and then you know i would have you know a young family i couldn't go to all the parties i certainly couldn't do the artist residencies right and living online for all of its challenges has provided access points for some of those people and you see i see even here in canada you know when i see an artist like mad dog jones all right who having all the success having come from thunder bay if you've ever been to thunder bay that's not a place you move to if you're trying to make it as an artist okay like it's like and it's incredible to me that he's achieved what he's achieved and you know and a number of artists who've come from disparate backgrounds um not insiders i have found they've found a path and that's good i just think that's good so what do you think nfts have been doing for art do you think that they're kind of creating a fundamental change in what art is yes um i think that it'll take some time to see it but yeah i won't hedge it all there and i will just say yes because i think that every nfts represent a new kind of patronage model for artists and i think that every time the patronage model for art changes art changes you know as an example right i like to point to the renaissance easy example if you look at the italian renaissance it is mainly paintings of this jesus character and like maybe his mom and maybe some of his buddies and that's like most of what we paint um in the italian renaissance and then if you you know um move north a little bit to the northern renaissance or the dutch renaissance you see you know different types of paintings you will see paintings of you know couples and you know pregnant wives and things like this all right and despite the fact that they have access to the same technology what you're seeing is very different patronage models right um is that you know you have one place where work is funded entirely by the pope um and one place where you know work is funded by you know by like in emerging like bourgeoisie and that means that art changes you make a different kind of art right um and it's the same and every time like like so often whenever you see big changes in art and romanticism is because a new patronage model emerges and so for better or for worse this is if this is how we're buying and selling art now it will be reflected in the content of the work itself and sometimes it takes some time to figure that out but it it will happen and whenever we see how this new patronage model and this new type of collector you know begins to make their presence felt in the institutional world then we're going to see some even bigger changes and and that that will happen i believe you know when you say that you're talking about like major museums or something is that what you mean yes i yeah i i i believe so i mean i believe that there are major collectors who are interested in preserving the cultural legacy of of what this moment in time right and the they're in it's it's inevitable that we will we will see eventually it will happen slower than most people think but we will see institutions who have to interact with this moment and reflect on it and figure out what it is meant for society and for culture and for the art world right and typically you know those moments of reckoning and institutions do often end up being mediated by the commercial concerns behind those works well speaking of commercial concerns um capitalism and financialization are not only big parts of the world right now but becoming more so i would say with with crypto so um i was curious if you have a take on how the art world has tried to represent those trends and how well you think nfts are doing in terms of representing or critiquing them yeah okay that is so interesting right so yeah i mean i made a work uh you know based on eve klein making a work that was like very much about the difference between an artworks expressive form and its commodity form right and to me that's a very profound conversation but it's like what i was saying at the beginning of this conversation which is that one that commercial world operates like its superpower is opacity all right the superpower of the commercial art world is is controlling information and of course which allows us to live in this fantasy world where those two things don't impact each other it shouldn't matter how much a thing is worth if it is a great artwork and yet and yet and yet right we simply can't avoid it so often on a very basic level i don't know i imagine many of us have walked into a museum with our aunts and uncles and heard them say well i can't believe my tax dollars paid a million bucks for this you know um and so immediately their perception their experience of the art uh is is colored by what they know um about its commodity form that's a shame in some respects but i can't deny that it happens and yet there's also it's also very powerful when an artwork can overcome that connection to its commodity value to create a genuinely transcendent experience i just read a wonderful article um by richard wernicke and hazlitt who talks about you know he was researching this mark rothko scam and it led him all the way to the top and it's sort of like it ends with him at the trump inauguration and looking and seeing all of trump's donors all being people who had paid millions of dollars for rothkos and what did that mean but then still when he sits down with the artwork like he can't help but be completely overwhelmed like it doesn't matter he's able to shed that and that is really beautiful but the nature of that relationship whether the commodity aspect of the artwork stains our experience of it or whether our experience transcends it or whether in some rare cases they're able to have a sort of like symbiotic relationship it is rarely addressed in i think like the discourse like the literature around art and it's rarely addressed in art itself and i do think like that eve klein is one of the only artists that i've encountered and of all the artists i've encountered he is the one who has done it the best who is willing to earnestly acknowledge that his artwork is spiritual and profound that it is also a commodity and that these two things will affect each other hence you know the ritual and the gold and the river right and typically when artists have tried to address their role like the financialization of their work i think it has been a lot more like facile or sort of sophomoric you end up with artists trying to be sensational about it you know like you end up with like you know damian hurst will make you know this crystal skull and part of the point of it is supposed to be that like he sold it for 100 million dollars but he has too much to gain in that statement right i don't think he would like us to believe that he's being cheeky about you know how supercharged the art world is but even if he is making that point like can i believe that that's his sole intention when he just has so much to gain from it you know and so and it's not something that and it's not something that artists like to acknowledge they don't like to acknowledge that you know the the the price of their work you know will reflect on their own legacy uh and the perception of of themselves nft works of course being created on a financial technology have the ability to talk more about the intertwining of like commodity and expressive forms of artworks however i do think that you know this medium is still in its infancy um many of the artists who are working in this medium you know we're all still kind of figuring it it it out you know all right so if we're gonna uh you know have this discussion about nfts which we are the probably main topic that we definitely can't miss if we're going to close out this discussion is the fact that every time non-crypto organizations announce a move toward crypto or nfts there tends to be a backlash earlier this year art station had to abandon its plans to launch and to launch nfts because people protested that and then there's been some video game developers and studios uh that had similar situations recently such as the company behind a game called stalker 2 and then ubisoft i think is still going to go forward with it but they just like quietly de-listed the video that announced it even the chat platform discord which is super popular in the crypto community got a lot of backlash for kind of hinting at and ethereum integration so what do you think is going on here like why do you think the art world or the non-crypto world in general is so angry about nfts okay so i'll start off by saying very level-headed some of that is healthy some of that is healthy because say it with me not everything needs to be a token right and not everything needs to be an nft so like a good chunk of these ideas getting kind of slouched out um that that that's incredibly positive and healthy right but there is like there are valid reasons for skepticism from the outside world like i i i believe that like i've presented like a fairly like you know crypto positive view here but i i hear the concerns i hear the um uh i hear uh and i hear a lot of the skepticism somebody who cares about um you know a game to expose the assets within the game to what is really really really like a supercharged market you know right now it is it is dangerous like it is scary you know imagine if you you know like all of a sudden really really couldn't afford your like you know the some of the best assets in a game that you care about i get it and also like gas is really expensive right now and i know that mo anybody any like serious game developer or mainstream company who's planning on putting nfts online has got to be looking at like an l2 or a roll-up or something like that but it's still i mean even even spending you know a dollar per transaction every time that you want to interact with your game that's that's not great so maybe not everything needs to be a token and although i recognize that a lot of the concerns that are being fairly brought up like gas ecological impact etc there are solutions on the way i don't expect people not in the crypto space to be fully informed and like understand that like well you know whenever there's you know whenever ethereum 2.0 comes out this will be solved and you know gas will go down as soon as stark net goes live nobody else is gonna know that if you haven't been spending all your time on crypto twitter so it's like it's okay for people to be spec like to be skeptical right now um that is fine and then you see some blowback from the nft community right we don't need we don't need pepsi to be selling us nf jesus and it's because again the same thing that i was saying like look we're all guilty of the same stuff we're all guilty the same stuff that kind of tribalism that i was talking about in the art world saying well we just you know it's not it's just those artists aren't on my team so they don't deserve to get all the rewards right so you know crypto people have been here for a while it's like well they're not a crypto native they shouldn't be making money on nfts they're that's not our tribe you know it's the same stuff we all do the same stuff right so it's like it's pretty that you know it makes perfect sense to me okay all right so well we'll have to see how all this plays out because i kind of can't imagine it's going to last forever that's just my personal opinion so you've said that you're kind of working on things you're just not quite ready to release but how will you know when the time is right to get back in and in the meantime you know what should people watch out for from you ah thank you i will know well i will know that the time is right to release new work when i think that it is when i think that it's great um and no and know sooner than that uh which i think will be a while but what people should look out for is um you know i plan to stay extremely active in the community um there are a lot of ways to contribute to this space without putting out things that people can buy which and that can just mean staying active in your communities i hope to do um a lot more writing in the future um a lot of writing and criticism i feel like you know criticism is a big thing that we need in this space to have a healthy discourse and for the art to get better and um and you know i hope to continue supporting the people who are doing that and and and that's um and that's basically uh it for me until i have something really great to share with the world okay and where can people learn more about you and your work yes please you can check out my work um and see a lot of my crypto and non-crypto work at chan dot gallery perfect all right well thank you so much
