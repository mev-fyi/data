thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap the sec goes after block five for 100 million dollars block fight a popular crypto lender is paying 50 million dollars to the u.s securities and exchange commission and 50 million dollars across 32 states to settle investigations into whether block vice interest earning accounts in which customers lend digital assets to blockfy in return for yield are a securities offering current customers will remain unaffected by the settlement though they will not be able to deposit more crypto into their accounts and blackfy will discontinue offering it to new us customers as part of the settlement blockfy will be filing an s-1 for a blockfy yield product which would allow the lender to offer interest earning accounts to u.s customers as a security registered with the sec said sec chair gary gensler in a press release this is the first case of its kind with respect to crypto lending platforms today's settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws sec commissioner hester purse had a different take on the settlement writing is the approach we are taking with crypto lending the best way to protect crypto lending customers i do not think it is so i respectfully dissent she went on to add it is difficult to understand how the civil penalty will protect investors and called on the sec to do a better job in accommodating innovation rather than hurting companies who attempt to work under the scope of u.s regulation the block fight settlement does not come as a surprise as the lender has been under scrutiny since last summer when five states issued either cease and desist or show cause notices against blockfi crypto's super super bowl performance while the rams and bengals battled in los angeles crypto fought to make it fully mainstream with multiple crypto exchanges taking out commercials during last weekend's super bowl coinbase ftx and crypto.com disclosure a sponsor each ran ads and turbotax and etoro mentioned crypto coinbase ran its ad in the first quarter in an on-brand move the company purchased a minute-long ad showing a qr code bouncing across the screen viewers who scanned it were prompted to download the app and participate in a 3 million giveaway data from the block shows that the ad was a roaring success with the exchange jumping from 186 to 2 on the app store in the day following the super bowl and speaking of on brand coinbase had to briefly throttle back access to its website due to increased traffic where coinbase stayed simple ftx swung for the fences its ad was headlined by the famous comedian larry david from curb your enthusiasm in seinfeld foe denouncing inventions like democracy portable music and of course crypto crypto.com also ran an ad starring nba superstar lebron james j.p morgan in the metaverse jp morgan the largest bank in the us is now a proud resident of decentraland the play to earn metaverse game this week the bank opened up a metaverse branch called the onyx by jp morgan lounge located in the metajuku mall in decentraland metaverse natives who visit the onyx are greeted with a portrait of ceo jamie dimon framed in the lobby also featured is a timeline of jp morgan's blockchain history upstairs visitors can listen to analysts talking about crypto via virtual tvs attached to the virtual wall one humorous addition is a pet tiger pacing the foyer which is a stroke of genius according to bloomberg's matt levine i feel like the tiger is a good idea if you walk into the offices of an investment bank there should be a roaming tiger to make you nervous keep you on your toes obviously in a real bank the tiger would pose liability problems it might eat the clients or the bankers for that matter but in the metaverse it is just some nice symbolism wrote levine jp morgan's crypto team onyx also published an 18-page paper outlining its metaverse thesis in its report jp morgan revealed a bullish outlook for the metaverse the asymmetrical risk of being left behind is worth the incremental investment needed to get started and to explore this new digital landscape for yourself the bank recommended our long-standing core competencies in cross-border payments foreign exchange financial assets creation trading and safe keeping in addition to our at scale consumer footholds can play a major role in the metaverse the jp morgan team concluded canada blocks bitcoin and ethereum transactions from truckers reports indicate that canada's royal canadian mounted police aka mounties and ontario provincial police are barring all firms including cryptocurrency exchanges registered with canada's anti-money laundering authority fintrac from transacting with 34 cryptocurrency addresses tied to funding the trucker-led protests in the country the protests began in january over canada's vaccination requirements for all entrants of the country the protests were deemed illegal by canadian prime minister justin trudeau this week via the emergencies act giving banks the power to immediately freeze or suspend bank accounts tied to the truckers for 30 days in a leaked document it appears that canadian authorities believe this power extends to crypto addresses regulators ordered crypto exchanges to cease facilitating any transactions associated with 34 crypto addresses where donors had already sent more than 20 btc in an attempt to continue funding the protests once canadian authorities froze that nine million dollars that had been donated to gofundme notably canada's decision had many on crypto twitter pointing to bitcoin for years it was difficult to explain to canadians why bitcoin is necessary it was always a conversation of yes banks are currently reliable in canada but they aren't in other countries now their own bank account is at risk the transition is inevitable wrote atomic wallet co-founder matt black trust makes the travel rule a reality 18 companies have banded together to bring anti-money laundering technologies to digital assets via a coalition called travel rule universal solution technology or trust headed by coinbase the group includes other industry leaders like anchorage bitco blockfi circle fidelity digital assets paxos kraken and robin hood essentially the group was formed to implement the travel rule recommended by the financial action task force which requires financial institutions to store information about customers with transaction partners according to coinbase trust is built in such a way to protect the security and privacy of customers personal information which is of paramount importance in the privacy focused blockchain space the coalition has a three-part plan to make this happen one information will be sent directly from exchange to exchange via encrypted channels exchanges must provide their identity before receiving customer payments and finally coalition members must meet core anti-money laundering security and privacy requirements through a partnership with compliance and risk management firm exeger the group does not plan to stay at 18 or in the us the next step is adding new members so that trust can provide comprehensive compliance across the crypto industry the travel rules reach is expanding internationally and so must the trust solution trust is focused on expanding to many other jurisdictions
