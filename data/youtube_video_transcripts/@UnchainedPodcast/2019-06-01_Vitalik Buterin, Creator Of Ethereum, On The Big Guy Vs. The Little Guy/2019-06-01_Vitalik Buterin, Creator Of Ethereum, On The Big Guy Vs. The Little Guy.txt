aetherium welcome batalik thank you it's good to be here so you wrote the etherion white paper a little over four years ago and if your aim has been not live now for about two and a half years and it's now a project worth about 90 billion dollars what were your feelings expectations and vision when you first conceived of the project and how has the reality of aetherium compared to what you initially thought so honestly when I came up with the idea first of all I thought that the idea clearly made sense and the second thought I had is well okay so this is clearly like the next logical step to take with watch ins if we can go from watching it's the one application the blockchains to five applications to the blockchains was built in general-purpose programming languages so next idea is why hasn't anyone done it done it yet and my response to the factor to that fact was well it has to be because there is some kind of fatal flaw in the design and basically something that as soon as I release the white paper and what five very smart cryptographers would come in email me and basically tell me why I'm a completely stupid and even suggesting something like this and to my surprise this just totally ended up not happening and a lot of the cryptographers respected at the time actually said be emails saying that you know wow this is a great idea I'm excited to be following the progress so that was my first reaction then once it became a bit more clear that the idea made sense to always try working on I thought okay well this is an interesting project I'll work on it for a few months and then once it's kind of out there and oh it'll be its own thing and I'll go back to doing Bitcoin legacy and I might go back to university then a bit later you know there was the Miami conference in January 2014 and that was when I really realized oh wait this is vastly bigger than I ever imagined it would be and I'm probably going to end up spending a bit more of my time on it and the kind of community interest and the growth of the project just kind of kept on going up and up from there they've been pretty much surprised by each step and no wait just to go back to that so when you thought that you would put this out there and then go back to University and stuff like that like what exactly were you envisioning like why did you think that you wouldn't need to be involved in how small did you think this would be and I I don't even know what you're what you're picturing there or what you were picturing then so first the first version of a theorem that I'd conceptualized was actually much less ambitious than what I and ended up coming up with a few months later and it's definitely a not as ambitious that's what I'm thinking about right now right like you know if you're familiar with protocols like master coin.this these are protocols that existed back in 2013 where they're not their own independent watch chains they are kind of meta protocols on top of another protocol so the idea would be that you would run a node if another block chain so it could be Bitcoin you know in my case it was prime coin or something else and then you would also run this other node and this other node would just kind of tell you a different way of interpreting the transactions in the underlying blockchain so it's kind of like embedding your language inside of another language and the reason why I did this originally is that I thought this would be something that would be worked on mainly by myself and possibly a couple of other people and I want it to be just kind of as a limited as simple as possible so basically I would make something as simple as possible that works then get it out there and then you know get it done fairly quickly and it would be fairly anonymous and that's what I kind of naively thought at the time obviously that ended up being totally wrong now as the amount of interest in aetherium grew all the way through in December 2013 and in January 2014 so just in his first couple of months I realized oh wait you know there's this entire kind of small army of 10 to 20 people who would be willing to help develop this sort of thing and building etherium as a meta protocol is a good design decision for seeding work but it's not really a good design decision for making a protocol because you know there's just a whole bunch of good reasons why meta protocols like that just aren't that good an idea and uh yeah at that point there would be the decision okay we're not doing that we're gonna make a theory I'm a separate watch in and that already increased the workload and in part because it's actually harder and in part because it unlocks a whole bunch of other possibilities and it just kind of kept growing from there after Miami I mean the workload did continue and outperforming my expectations but that's mostly probably just myself not really having good intuitions about how long stuff is supposed to take and you know in general in software development it's a rule that pretty much everything takes three times longer than you expect and so we were saying that it theorem has continued to surprise you as you've gone along and it's turned out much different from your expectations so what are some of the other ways that it's differed as you've gone along I mean this is now you know four years ago that you're talking about so I'm sure your vision of what it would be and how it's turned out has been quite different over this time period yeah and I would say just the sheer scale of you know attention Zappala yeah usage like pretty much everything is vastly bigger than I ever thought it would be and that I would say that's on two fronts where the first front is and if aetherium x' roll inside of crypto and the second roll as just the sizes of you know crypto itself including Bitcoin you know including you know like what interfere yeah and the various out coins including Bitcoin cash and so forth Nick I was definitely not expecting you know to $15,000 prices so that's one very big thing that I was surprised about another thing that I was surprised about is probably just the various center specific challenges we entered ended up happening so look things like the various set of logistical issues and setting up the foundation the Delft work do s attacks scaling challenges and when I was thinking of a theorem I wasn't really thinking too deeply about a lot of that stuff and you know over time it's just certain things ended up happening yeah well well yeah it was a third major thing actually yeah what it's a breakup ESO was sorry it's a what if hearing will be used for so like the very first vision right was basically a general purpose platform for financial contracts you know if X happens then send five dollars to account Y if Zedd happens then send five dollars to account B that was basically what I thought no aetherium would be for and over time you know as the amount of attention grew the amount of attention also became wider right and people started talking about oh let's use a theorem for IOT stuff oh let's use the theorem to implement democracy on the blockchain oh let's use aetherium to you like implement identity systems supply chain stuff it's you know like Internet infrastructure a domain name systems and so on and so forth and like that list just kept on growing very quickly so that's probably the third thing I should really mention I was surprised by well so when other thing I wanted to ask you about when we talked about kind of initial vision versus reality I did see in a 2016 wired article that you talked about how blockchains will empower the little guy and also disempower the big guy and there was a quote in the article you said and personally I say screw the big guy they have enough money already but you know if I look at kind of all the different things that etherium is doing the etherium Enterprise Alliance counts companies like JP Morgan BP Microsoft as members so why why form an alliance like that that would enable the big guy to use your technology how do these kinds of companies figure into your vision for what etherium can bring about that's definitely a good question I'm I would say that I mean I don't remember the exact context in which I made the quote like I though and I do really think that both at watching its primary value is in empowering people that don't have access to you know basically like in part financed in part contracting ability in part just the ability to make other people trust them and things like that already I mean as far as we are a big companies can fit in like I do think that they have a role and I do think that gotta have smart ones that to take the first step and are willing to kind of play with the technology rather than rather than against it I can survive and even benefit from the whole process like so one example I could give very practically as if you look at something like Microsoft for example like you might notice that Microsoft's kind of roll in and kind of position in the space as the space being just the tech space as a whole has really changed in the last 20 years we are in the 1990s there were they were this kind of evil big bad bad monopolist that was constantly suing people and I constantly abusing it's a monopoly position in various ways and the kind of you know open source free software cultural zeitgeist has to be cick way that these people are the debt or the devil and you know Linux is gonna come in and save us now I mean I say this as they continued proud Linux user but like over the last few years it seems as though people emphasize like the desktop proprietary side much less because basically everything's moved over to the web and on the web you know what you have is basically a kind of proprietary software that's actually even worse because like with something like Microsoft Windows sure you don't have the source code and sure it could be doing all sorts of crazy stuff to you but at least it's running on your computer at least people can kind of analyze it at least you have you know basic control over things like oh if you run this program you know on an offline computer then it has no way of screwing you over by an aside that your personal data to anyone but with online software as a service you know things like Facebook you really have even less control and basically none whatsoever and initially people didn't realize this as much because like the soft software as a service companies were a kind of new and shiny thing and they had this kind of positive image but especially over the last couple of years I think the tides are really turning and people are realizing you know oh wait that's the actual problem and this is where a lot of the kind of yearning around things like solves self sovereign identity systems comes from you know this idea that oh wait you know Google Facebook and Twitter basically control your identity and there are these they like big unaccountable set kind of centralized centralized that'd be Hamas that even if the people some of the people inside of them have good intentions you know the the founders that came up with a don't be evil soggy and are stole and if heavily involved but even still they're kind of incentive and their pressure is that one that's kind of naturally on the side of those things and with Microsoft on the other hand first of all I think their culture has improved a lot you know I guess especially with Satya Nadella becoming CEO and you know you notice that they've become very active actively interested in blockchains they have growing open-source divisions in the year and inside of a sure they're even willing now you know I'd play nice with with Linux distributions now thanks for very far from perfect but it still seems like Microsoft as a company at this point actually is quite naturally Alliance to be a New York on the side of people controlling their own stuff and the basic reason is that you know like web company is or you are not their customer therefore you are their products whereas with Microsoft while you're still their customer so they have you know a bit more of a kind of willingness and an incentive to do with it and basically refuse to completely sell out your data so like that's just one kind of fairly intricate example of how I think you know there are big guys that are fairly well positions to be on the right side of things I mean so as far as corporations ago there's a lot more of those and you know there's a lot a lot of other examples of companies that are kind of fairly neutral but in terms of their positioning but that you know it could still be quite helpful to the industry and to end to the technology so even just at JPMorgan as one example I know that it it just happens that they've been actually quite helpful in the in building out quorum and so I think the thing that I've learned there is that I stopped viewing large corporations and if over the last few years as kind of singular evil be Hamas and as I've come to understand the more I've come to realize more that these are you know very complex institutions that are staffed by real people and even if there is a lot of sociopaths in there there's also a lot of other people in there and you know what realistically speaking if you have a company of 50,000 people there's you know there's no chance that he'll there's not going to be at least a few hundred you know ik rabbit Valachi an enthusiasts inside of there right and you know that's part of why you have in a GP more could actively could should being Nick Oram oh you know a coffee is like even oil companies having internal blockchain projects Microsoft in in part doing a lot of things and so forth though I mean in the Microsoft case I do really think that feel the excitement about a theorem and blockchain really does go pretty high up to the top so that's there in as far as some governments go I mean that's definitely kind of interesting and multifaceted story because they are on the one hand people that could that have the ability to you know regulate the technology and even though it's theoretically münster it's a resist their censorship no they're practically speaking I think there right now the industry is really benefiting from kind of quite a bit of a convenience on their on the air side over top of like any anything that we expected three to five years ago and I think that maintaining that is as much as possible as good and also in order there are people in these governments that do want to be users of active users of the technology so yeah when I visited like Taiwan a few weeks ago for example and look there's a politician who I are a member of Parliament's I think Jason Xu who visited these the meetups and you know he seemed excited about the possibilities of just using block chains to you know improve their democratic political system so these things exist well I was gonna ask you is like you know here in the US Vladimir Putin doesn't have the best reputation and I wanted to ask why you met with him so do you also kind of count him in the same bucket as what you were just describing or why did you meet with him and I think the meeting with him in particular was probably a bit overhyped because it was basically we ended up talking for maybe one or two minutes and and I met him and I got I got to see his personality a bit and let him know that you know what a theory I'm in watching a technologies and so forth exists and you know and woke her up to he's like okay great you know what people are different building Russian people are building cool tech to improve the economy you know I think that inside of the Russian government in particular and it but there are kind of people you know lower down who are more interested and there are people lower down who are more or less interested so like one of the kind of champions of this space for example as the more active ones and as Herman Gref from spare Bank and like if you look him up he actually probably has you know at least in the US one of the higher one of the highest reputations out of people in the kind of top level Russia destruction establishment I think he might have even been involved in getting Russia into the into the WTO tío about 15 years ago if I remember correctly so it's once again the sort of place that on the one hand you know ik Russia has a great tech talent and it does have and like all the people who are really kind of thirsty for positive change and on the other hand there's a side that you know I start stupid wars in Ukraine so you have to kind of take one side without and we like hope the other side doesn't do too much damage and I guess the reason why I'm involved this be in part is basically just I think we do have a large community there and you know there's also adjust the angle that you know with myself being a Russian citizen I just have the practical ability to have these people listen to me more and accept the ideas more so I figure you know if if that exists then you know it's still positive to try to take advantage of it in pushing he's in a good direction okay well speaking of pushing things in a good direction you recently tweeted about how the market cap of all cryptos had reached more than half a trillion dollars and I think now it's like around 700 million or a billion but you then you said oh you know I don't know if the companies earned it and you gave some examples of you know like for instance you were wondering how many unbanked people have been banked or how many Venezuelans were protected from hyperinflation and you know here on the other hand when we look at the actual things people are using crypto for its things like initial coin offerings and crypto kitties so how do you think we will get from these particular applications of crypto that you know basically benefit they'll already privileged to the world changing ones that you kind of idealized in your tweets yeah so first of all I definitely will say that if I was worried at 500 billion at 740 billion I'm even more worried I'd say that a large part of it is that right now there is a lot of expectation that stuff will be built and there are people who are building stuff you know what there is that what UN World Food Program that I keep talking about there is that look various identity projects there's various stuff in all these various different countries there are so these things are private blockchains so right they're not I think yeah okay so uh what are but like one of the key reasons why what if it's going private is because of public watch and scalability is total crap and you know I basically the like there's a lot of stuff that's being built and a lot of stuff that people wants to build but it's really because of the technical obstacles that they can't do whatever at this point and like does that mean you think I'm sorry so does that mean that you think some of these things will will actually flourish more in private blockchains or do you think it's just happening for now yeah so I think in the short term a lot of these things will definitely flourish board private blockchains in the medium term I really hope that we can make public blockchain scalability be good enough that you know it's even the kind of naturally private Cheney an institution inside just ends up being um moved on to public block chains or you know and or public blockchain based layer to is just because you know the scalability is good enough and why not so one example of this is that there was this technology called plasma that I'm sure you've heard a lot about that Joseph Putin came up with a few months ago and this basically allows you to kind of have you know what the BIC when people were promising back in 2013 which is kind of private chains anchored into a public chain but we are in the case of plasma you know the anchoring actually is meaningful and you know if there's a good kind of mathematical understanding of what the anchoring is which basically is that if you have one coin inside the plasma chain then even if the plasma chains are totally breaks then you can use that to recover one coin inside the public chain and so it old coins in the plasma chain are kind of actually equal to coins in the you know in the public chain without you know transactions in the plasma taking up actual public in space and so I came up with something a few days ago that I called minimal viable plasma which is basically a way to take that protocol and maybe simplify it by a factor of five and still keep the basic properties and this is something that I actually think will be developed very quickly and I really hope that a lot of these in our kind of institutional token projects can just quickly spin up and basically start using it so if that happens right then I think we'll have something really interesting because but even just that as a product basically means that you have a system that can be used for issuing just tokens at enterprise scale whether it's companies whether it's in our governments whether it's random individuals whatever you know whether also whether it's chat applications without or while paying very low public chain transaction fees so the polymer chain transaction fees would be pretty much negligible compared to the software development work and at the same time you would get a lot of the publishing benefits which are basically interoperability and security so huh yes that's an example of something that I think could be nearly valuable and wait so just so I understand actually in what you're describing it sounds like you think the way we're going to get to these world-changing applications of blockchain is by having these institutions that already provide many of those types of services can't you know like the World Economic Forum or you know other institutions like that having them implement programs on on blockchains is that how you think we'll get there there's both paths right so there's um first of all there in the reason why the insight and why institutions can be helpful is because they have existing customers and or existing users and so they can adopt stuff very quickly you know I like the aspect of you know just people regular people being able so I just got transact with each other peer-to-peer I think is no that has to really transform but if in the more transformative thing I mean I think the institutional aspect is transformative as well because you're basically convincing companies to build applications where you do not have to trust a company in order to trust the application and you know this is something that existing institutions really are not used to at this point but not the kind of more peer-to-peer side I think is just going to come or a scale a bit later because it doesn't depend on just a few people changing their minds that it depends much more on this kind of slower and more organic growth and kind of people cheat you know changing their culture and changing their expectations and like that's already happening on its own right like a theory employee theory and blockchain has 1.15 million transactions happening on it every day so that's more transactions than for example there's rides on uber with you know and that's happened without you know a single mainstream use case being adopted right that's just a collection of a large number of little use cases and just add it up together it ends up to of your racing a very significant amount of economic impact so that's doing 13 operations a second and that's valuing the ethereum blockchain enough to be it to be paying something like half a million dollars every day in transaction fees so like there clearly is stuff happening and I think it clearly is true that if we just enable more scalability then more stuff will happen right and is that why you announced these grants for groups yeah yeah so right exactly so the kind of conclusion of all this is basically that there's like there's all these institutions that want to do stuff and there's just regular people that want to do stuff and for both of them the bottleneck right now basically is scalability like a in it yeah and like the the grant program is so definitely a large part in our kind of multi-pronged strategy that we're rolling out in 2014 to just deal with that okay so we're gonna talk about icos and governance and other fun topics but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsor on-ramp if you're starting up a new project or need some design or branding help on an existing one on-ramp has

rest to on-ramp to learn more and see the how they've helped passionate entrepreneurs achieve their dreams go to think on-ramp comm I'm speaking with vitalik deuteron the creator of etherium so one thing I wanted to ask you about was you're gonna be moving etherium to a proof of stake algorithm why so I want you I want you to describe for me the security pros and cons of proof of stake versus proof of work and why you're choosing to switch aetherium to proof of stake okay so for a proof of stake I would say the pros are number one I think that it can have higher security and what I mean by that is that basically that I think it proof of state can be designed so it's more expensive to attack it and I think premier state can be designed so that it's easier to recover from an attack so with proof of work for example if someone has you know more computing power than the rest of the network combined they can't just double spend once right what they can do is they can do what I call a spawn camping attack where they basically just kind of keep on preventing any other blocks from getting into the blockchain forever and just minding empty blocks forever and just continually rendering the blockchain unusable and if you do that how does that work they just they just continually have more padding basic no so the the way that you would do this is that you would let's say you have all of your like hypothetically 51% hash power just on one laptop I mean in reality it's much bigger but for a kind of simplicity we'll say that then you disconnect your laptop from the internet then you mind for two hours then you reconnect it to the internet publish all the blocks immediately that'll just totally erase all the other work that's been done in the last two and it'll make your chain be the longest chain then turn the laptop back off then mine now they're two hours then keep on going and they just repeat this forever so what that does is that first of all it ensures that only your blocks are going to be part of the chain and the second thing is it ensures that basically any other miner who participates like there will be times when it looks like they can mine but then their box will still just be reverted anyway so it just wastes all their time so if this kind of attack happens on proof-of-work the only possible approach is to change the proof-of-work algorithm but then if you change the proof-of-work algorithm to kind of basically make the attackers Asics useless then if the attacker has just a bit more resources then the attacker can just do the attack again and if and the second time around you know your algorithm is going to be one that said that that there hasn't been enough time for a kind of special purpose hardware to develop so there is only going to be a general purpose Hardware mining on it and so if the attacker gets 61% of that then you're basically screwed right so like I don't think that proof-of-work has very good properties in terms of recovery from attacks with proof of stake what you can do is basically if the attacker doesn't have to 1% attack then you can coordinate a minority soft fork and that basically takes away the attackers money then if the attacker gets more money they attack again then you can do another soft fork at the end take away the attackers money again and you can repeat that process pretty much forever right so basically if it's a kind of battle between you know the attacker and the community then the community can pretty much just keep on winning every single time and eventually you know this attacker is gonna get tired of burning five hundred million dollars every two days or whatever the amount is so that's part of why I think realistic it has higher security um it also has a lower cost so you don't need to pay like a very high block rewards you just need to pay a fairly low interest rate a third thing is obviously just the environmental friendliness aspect so I'd say those are probably the main pros in jeez worries sorry do you worry at all about switching it this late in the game like with oh I definitely worry about it and we're definitely going through the as fairly slowly and carefully but like I personally do think that heuristic is part of you know I'm making its my overarching philosophy I have of how block chains are going to secure or it can't succeed like basic way to think like there's a couple of philosophies here right like the way that I would describe kind of proof-of-work Bitcoin philosophy is they say well yes block chains are very expensive and block chains are very expensive by design because you need to be very expensive in order to get censorship resistance and therefore the only block should applications that are really gonna succeed are those applications that really really need censorship resistance over and above everything else so like you can probably find you like lots of and a proof-of-work advocates discussing this pretty explicitly my philosophy at the end that focuses on you know a proof of stake and short a scalability with sharding is that if you make watches that just focus on the the really censorship resistance requiring stuff then but first of all you know the the establishment is going to make your life very very hard and even if you theoretically technologically can win against them practically speaking you know that's like their interference is still going to be very successful at basically cutting you're cutting down your potential user base by a factor of 10 so it's like you can't just kind of sail directly against the wind and say you know aurora we're going to be you know like very this proudly opposing anyone who tries to stop us and we're just gonna say technological now not technological you can't catch me and like just basically you know i can do whatever you want that way i think if you wants to achieve real impact then ultimately you are going to have to win the kind of public acceptability and part of the way that you want public acceptability is by providing value to people other than these applications that would literally get shut down by banks and governments if those if those applications didn't have more chance to run on now then the next part of that theory is that therefore blockchains absolutely need to have applications where even though they benefit from watching they benefit from watching some medium amounts read so they don't benefit from watch ants enough to justify you know ten billion dollars a year of proof-of-work mining and like twenty three dollar transaction fees or whatever it is a Bitcoin has today so basically you need the the cost of consensus to be much lower and you need the cost per transaction to be much lower and like I don't even mean like the you know like five to ten cents whoa as aetherium has now I mean you know a 0.1 cents low so the first of those two things which is that consensus needs to be much cheaper in order for these systems to be a long-term sustainable and that implies proof of stake and the second part that each transaction needs to be cheaper that implies our very heavy scalability focus so look that that's basically where I see the pros of Roo stake being as far as the cons I would say the main one is that it is a different security model and it's a different security model that basically says that you know in order to secure way authenticate the blockchain you have to log onto to the Internet at least once every few months and if you don't do that then in order to bootstrap yourself to the chain again you basically have to trust trust some group of people who have and I think that in reality this is a totally fine security model because people basically already trust that security model for software updates so you know it's pretty even like Bitcoin core you know a kathiria Bitcoin cache like any measure a cryptocurrency of watching Apple notation does release software updates you know every some few months half year at most a year and people are just totally happy to just trust these software updates so basically why can't you know we require users to log on or basically as often as they all gone already to resit to receive you versions of the software so that's my response to that great to add to that criticism there's a people also bring up this kind of rich get richer aspects that oh isn't proof of stake just basically paying people who have a lot of coins and giving them interest rates that give them even more coins my response to that is first of all well proof of work does that already and like if you look at you know where the proof mining farms are it's basically just a few big guys with a huge amount of money and a huge amount of hash power and the second part is that with proof of stake we can a kind of a limit that aspect because you look for if previous stake paid you know a 15% annual interest rates then I think that would be horrible and that would be a really legitimate criticism but I'm looking at seeing if we can knock those interest rates down so you know something like 1 to 3% and if they're at that level then you know that's basically less than you know the difference between like what stocks and bonds pay so it's not nearly as large a contribution to you know actually kind of unjust undesirable kinds of kinds of inequality that people are worried about so that's probably how I did you how I'd address that argument you know there are a lot of other various fine distinctions so I can't think look one of the nice things about proof of work is that it's simple to implement and so that it has like easy like coin protocols you know I do think that's actually a genuine advantage of proof of work so you know there are a genuine week that says we're the only thing I can say for Perot stake is well just suck it up and deal with it because the benefits are much larger but in general I do believe that the benefits are much larger than the costs interesting I think what's interesting to me is just to hear you describe all this it sounds like your vision is maybe a little bit more pragmatic whereas like some of the rhetoric I maybe hear from some of the other blog chains or at least from people such as like Bitcoin Maximus or something is a little bit more anti-establishment but you it sounds like our having kind of a more pragmatic user-friendly focus and and just having a vision of you know a large swath of society whether it's like institutions and wealthy people as well as kind of the little guy that we talked about at the beginning using the blockchain um to actually to move to like a slightly different topic um you have all these new competitors smart contract networks that are popping up such as Definity Tasos Cardno pogoda Neos and several of them aim to solve problems that the etherium network is currently dealing with in terms of scaling governance lack of formal verification and smart contracts which for listeners who don't know is a way of sort of like mathematically proving that the smart contract will run as the programmer intends which was was an issue in the Dow so how much of a threat do you believe that these other platforms opposed to aetherium um you know I think that they're definitely going to get some adoption and though I do think that a lot of them are targeting somewhat different properties than for then what aetherium does so for example um like one piece of technology that a lot of these platforms rely on is something called GPOs a delegated Pro stake which is basically a system where the the entire network is run by something like 20 to 40 computers and the only way that you know other participants in the system can have an influence is basically by voting on who the participants are and this basically is you know that the entire security model this is separate like it's basically I can sort am chained where people with coins can't get to control who the consortium is I personally believe that look this is nowhere near decentralized enough for a public or for a public watching in a system to really stay public in the long term and I wrote a blog post about this a few weeks ago like one of the examples I got I got into was how like one of these block chains I'm a wisk ended up basically being captured by two political parties that basically bribe everyone to vote for them right so there you know there's like basically you know if you think that the just voting is enough to ensure a systems decentralization you know come look at us politics is the line that I usually yeah so I think that there's like these systems can get some users but at the same time you know with aetherium we are also trying to kind of aim for this angle of in Ohio decentralization which in our case basically means like anyone's like we want the system to be able to process you know like 50 thousand transactions per second while only running on a collection of notes running on people's laptops right so this is one of our kind of inform in informal design goals and so you know like of waiting the need for just you know various kind somewhat capacitor don't so super filled with you look good fancy specialized hardware and also designing systems where you know if the systems actually do have you know like a substantial degree of this kind of trust lessness and kind of emphasis on you know basically algorithm algorithmic kind of governance rather than you know like heavy political processes like I mean look you know as you said we're pragmatic and we don't believe that any of those things can go away a hundred percent but at the same time we're not willing to give us that as an excuse to basically lean on that sort of stuff exclusively in our security bottle well to speak about governance and your blog post um I was wondering how you plan to implement governance and etherium because you know as we just discussed some of these block chains they have on chain governance and you wrote in your blog post I'll just quote this for people who didn't read it the abstract says that you believe quote tightly coupled on chain voting is overrated and I have a feeling they're you're referencing things like Tasos you also said the status quo of quote informal governance as practiced by Bitcoin Bitcoin cash at their EMC cash and somewhere systems is much less bad than commonly thought you also said people who think that the purpose of blockchain says to completely expunge soft mushy human intuitions and feelings in favor of completely algorithmic governments as emphasis on completely are absolutely crazy I really liked that phrasing there and then you also said loosely coupled voting as done by carbon votes in somewhere systems is underrated so why do you think why do you have all these opinions and how do you think people should be thinking about blockchain governance yeah so and basically one of the there's a few examples that I use in my post and so regarding tightly coupled on XI and voting being overrated I think my main argument against it basically as that I think it's like it really runs the risk of creating a system where people believe that like basically if the governance algorithm outputs the decision then the decision is legitimate but there is plenty of situations where a decision that's approved by 60% of coin holders really should be viewed as an illegitimate one so even something like like if there's some convenient way to separate 60% of coin holders into group a and 40% is a group Pia well you couldn't imagine a decision that just finds some way to double the the coin holders I've ever of everyone who's part of group a and then the 60% core part of group a you're gonna vote for it this is like you know the standard to wolves on a sheep voting on what's for dinner problem and like basically I worry that if you have a black sheet that work really deeply enshrines tightly coupled governance then that sort of stuff just will end up happening and possibly even worse stuff will end up happening like I mentioned like these bribing attacks that happen to whisk and like I do think that there's basically five or ten different ways that various you know more or less subtle forms of bribing attacks can happen and I basically view this in the same way that you know like bitcoiners of you Lena that nothing at stake problem improves steak like I personally you know I don't think that the requirements to log on every year as an issue and they think that this is something that you know even if it works okay for a while ultimately kind of is the death knell of decentralization and there I disagree but like that's the kind of opinion that I have about this kind of on chain boating stuff yes for the status quo if uniform just one thing I wanted to add there it was about the Unchained voting is it is sort of one of those things where if you know what is going to you know be the threshold then you can game the system so you know just will always be trying to do that yeah totally yeah so as far as informal Governance goes like I basically I think that people they don't often don't realize the extent to which the systems will turn a formal governance actually you know like have governance and the governance actually does work quite well you know like both ensuring that the protocol changes that are made are changes that are good and preventing one person from having too much power over the system so you know on the one hand people say for example that if the area is completely centralized around myself and it's true for example that I run the long term research agenda but if you look at the actual process that we've institutionalized you know between the gift the see boss prosperity and harmony developers on for actually taking you know changes that people in the research you know either on the research team have come up with or people in the community have come up with and turning them into things that get implemented it become part of the protocol like that actually is something that's has been fairly institutionalized is you know meaningfully a decentralized it actually works quite well right like basically we have these open chords developer calls that happen every two weeks and participants from every one of the major implementation say like yes parity and so forth participate in the calls we discussed them and generally end up adopting changes by consensus and it ends up I would say well you know working fairly well and people who are actually part of the process or who actually will watch it closely tends to be fairly happy with it so but this is something I was going to ask you about because like you know I do see this criticism of how aetherium is governed and you know sometimes it's people just saying oh Fatah likes and a benevolent dictator but then other paint people think oh he's a single point of failure for aetherium do you do you think that you are and like for instance you know you did say on Twitter the other day oh if things continue in this immature fashion I'm gonna leave like let's say you just really did decide to leave and you were so angry you didn't put any succession you know a process in place like what would happen then so first of all I want to correct the record on a small thing which is I didn't say that I will leave if things continue being immature I said that I will leave if price memes and people being immature continue to be the only thing that gets accomplished right till there's a really huge difference between those two that people have didn't capture right right like I am definitely not going to you know a bit like abandoned the refugees in Jordan that you know the UN World Food Program applications on top of aetherium or or working on feeding just because there's people saying stupid stuff on Twitter when I am gonna worry I'm gonna leave it as if that stuff doesn't materialize and people keeps and the only thing that's happening is people say stupid stuff on Twitter no why were you there I will I will stop covering this face also if the same thing happens so I think we both agree on it okay the as far as what happens if I do leave I I would actually say that the extent to which have a single point of failure is probably dropping fairly rapidly so for example over the last like six months we've really scaled up our research team and you know we have a team in Python that's developing the shortlink specification that's pretty much look fairly has a fairly high degree of autonomy at this point and I personally have like actually a quite a bit of confidence in these people and like I I think that if I ain't get run over by a bus tomorrow I really do believe that they'll be able to cure a dog version one of basic sharding to completion basically on their own it's some as far as like proof of stake you know we have the Alpha proton FFG test that so the algorithm is no it's very close to basically being what it needs to be if if we have like on the plasma side the situation is fairly similar so but I we are definitely trying hard to like basically make sure that we have you know like a large and growing core group of people that understand the the ideas and interesting and the vision enough that basically any of them can kind of executed through record regardless of what happens and I think but is there like a governmental kind of like infrastructure around you like three years from now what will the etherium foundation's organizational structure look like right okay so I guess like if we kind of take that question we're replace that question a bit with the question of you know like basically is is aetherium meaningfully independent of myself there is two kind of threat models that you can have right the first is what if I disappear you know what if I get kidnapped what if I get run over by a bus and the second is what if I you know become corrupt or evil in some way you know for the first one I think like I ants I basically I answered that question and I based by basically saying that gets we you know the research team is growing we're rapidly adding smart people and this is basically the only way to really solve the problem as far as solving the second issue goes I think that part of that is going to resolve itself over time because as these the research end-to-end development teams grow they're going to inevitably start having their own opinions that they contribute to discussions and we get harder for any one person to force things through and the second thing that I mentioned is that you know even if the mean the research agenda is still run by this kind of very informal process that's still between a few people like myself you know Vlad Karl and a few other developers it's some the part of the agenda that actually decides what changes get implement get it implemented it's a etherion protocols all right that part I think is mean really meaningfully decentralized already and probably bourdieu centralized and a lot of other blockchain projects you know as far as the etherium foundation goes and that's something that you know we have been working on and we do want to kind of give better governance to the etherium foundation already though that's only one of two tracks right the second of future acts is making sure that aetherium can kind of grow and prosper even independently of the etherium foundation if necessary so like for example the theorem Enterprise Alliance being a separate organization is part of that there's kind of a vision of kind of decentralizing the ecosystem a bit the there's also going to be other kind of what I would informally call sister organization said to the etherion foundation that I think are some of which are already being kind of quietly developed and you can probably look forward to announcements fairly soon there's some so that's part of it and in other part is that look if your iam is fairly unique and that we have this large number of it of a full client implementations so gift parity harmony see boss boss Python and so forth and that was a deliberate strategy to ensure decentralization of the development layer right because like basically there isn't one repo that controls the entire project there isn't one core dev team that controls the entire project and you know if the NGO etherium team becomes evil then we have parity if the parity team becomes evil then we have go if both become evil then we could put it put some more resources into harmony and and people can switch to that so I think the actual kind of implementation and release side of the cycle really does have you know there's kind of meaningful decentralization that people are looking for are looking for already and you know a part of the reason why we sped us spun off this grant program in the foundation is to help support that you know though I mean I do agree that no governance some of the foundation itself is something that can also improve a lot okay so I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier in the conversation about how aetherium is actually being reused and how that you know maybe had differed from what you imagined so obviously this past year we saw that initial coin offerings it just really really took off and aetherium was the main platform where they were holding those icos and especially now when we're seeing so many of them and also there are a number where maybe you might say they're at the very least unserious and at the very worst scams how do you feel about the fact that aetherium is the main platform for this activity it's I would say that in first of all it's in every single scam that's happening is definitely unfortunate but it's kind of an inevitable part of a new and rapidly evolving economy so it's like in the cryptocurrency and ICO space so like basically you know a very few people and you know that's including you know regular people on the street including regulators including just you know what people you know even in if you're only deep into the space a lot of the time have a good idea of how to judge many of these projects and that basically means that you know what projects that in my opinion really shouldn't proliferated you end up for a pro operating for some time and I think that up until now like I definitely don't think that scams are like the majority of projects that are var being I kind of that are taking place and especially among the successful ones you know like I do think that a lot of the stuff that's being funded actually is a genuine innovation that's hopefully you know I'm going to mature and come out over the next couple of years and I personally do think that the space actually is Grug growing up more and more so I'd expect that like in 2018 2019 like for example like any new icos ends up happening during this space I think like first of all arts going to raise as much money as the previous ones did very likely probably even despite the fact that right now they're cryptocurrency prices are three times higher than they were before but also and why do you think that just because there's too much noise or why um because I think like basically the kind of like if there is like in extremely yeah kind of a good one then possibly but in general there's already less hyping people are already noticing that you know oh wait the first round of these projects like basically like didn't do remotely as well as the as the as the cryptocurrencies of people gave up gave up in order to participate and I think that's having a fairly significant effect and also I mean regulation is definitely having a significant effect and also a the year just increasing number of these separate of these projects is having an increased affect like basically it's some like it's a lot easier to argue that you have a 1% chance of changing the world when there is only for other projects out there then when there is 40 other projects out there so like I do think that you know the future of these of these projects is going to end up being smaller the other reason why I think I think that's the case is that a lot of these like fairly early stage projects are projects by people who have already spent a lot of time establishing themselves in the space and you know 2014 and 2015 and like I think that most of the people that have that property have basically figured out what they're doing at this point so like projects that are run by people just totally new coming into the space I think are likely to be less successful that's just my own opinion yeah although it frankly it's been a little bit despairing to see how some of the people hovering these I see knows that really don't have a background in the space or it's still able to raise a lot of money yeah I agree yeah but so to go back to you know what I mentioned earlier about the Ponzi schemes and scans that are going on so here we've seen this year that or last year now that there's been a lot of debate over how much responsibility platforms like Facebook and Twitter have in monitoring things like fake news or trolls on their sites so do you think should a theorem or the theorem community how do they have a responsibility to monitor or audit the different projects that launch I see us on aetherium aetherium platform definitely no aetherium community yes and what do you mean by that I mean like if the etherium platform itself starts kind of actively policing what applications are built on it then you know that basically kills the whole idea of censorship resistance you know like way more than anything anything that happens at to the Dow's in and yeah so like that's basically just a non-starter you know what both philosophically and probably technologically as well because like actually implementing something like that would require you know like hard Forks pretty much every day to weed stuff project down that we just so you know what we're not even going there I think is the the general lesson that we learned the other as far as the community goes I think there are a lot of things that the community can do to encourage good projects to appear and I mean um and you know get more attention and encourage a bad project set to get less attention so one I think the example of this just is you know what kinds of things to people at the top say right or so you know what do people at the top go around like pumping every single every single ICU under the sky do they talk about you know like how you like buying whatever cryptocurrency is going to make them super rich or you know do they do they emphasize other things there is a and there's even just like the culture of people who participate on the subreddit so you know it's what gets up voted on the etherium subreddit what's what gets down voted what do people talk about a conferences what are people allowed to talk about our conferences what's a conference organizers emphasize what do the people who end up going to conferences choose to talk about so I think there's a lot of these kind of smaller social decisions that really can kind of be basically be the deciding factor between whether and you know projects that are less reputable and or and probably even outright scamming ends up succeeding or whether they just end up based being like completely ostracized and kicked out and like in general I do think that the etherium community has been doing a reasonable job on a lot of that so like for example if you look at most cryptocurrencies subreddits you know what you basically see a lot of like just you know like oh you know cryptocurrency is going to X s going to the moon everyone you know like bye bye bye huddle you know you're a fool for selling you know like yay like invest more if you all of your life savings take out a loan invest more and things like that but you know like on if you look at the etherium subreddit that just doesn't happen at all right like that's like you know there is kind of our East Raider which has this kind of sandbox in a corner where a lot of that stuff gets pushed to it but it's - that's you know what step removed from our etherium which tends to you know actually be focused on via the technical discussion and that's I think it's something that a community decision that were fairly proud of and that I think has been quite successful so that's some one example of a thing that can be done and one other thing that I wanted to ask you about was you've written about the difficulties with having AI cos in terms of kind of you know ensuring a wide distribution but then also ensuring that people can participate or that they can get in at the valuation that they think is reasonable so you wrote about interactive coin offerings what are those and what problems are they solving for icos so what what problems a interest or an active coin offering solving for icos sure so I think so the idea is right that there is two kinds of icos there's a capped ico and an uncapped ico and in a capped sale the main challenge basically as oh what happens if the sale ends in one minute and like basically whoever is the best at sending the transaction in first wins and I think that's an approach that's just incredibly unfair it's expressly inefficient and the long-run equilibrium I think it's basically that miners are gonna get are gonna always be the ones that get in ahead the other kind of sale is an uncapped one and in an uncapped sale I know that's also bad because people just have no certainty about what the valuation is that they're participating at so they're kind of compromise between the two is these sub kind of dynamics Kapoor kind of interact or or interactive models where people can basically in an interactive ICO send in you know eath into a smart contract then when they send eath they also have to specify what he has to back some own valuation the roller dissipated and as soon as you have you know X dollars worth of people that are willing to participate at valuation X but basically that is the fact that that is the valuation and people who are okay with that valuation it can basically had the contract accepts them and they end up participating and people who specify that they would that they wanted a lower valuation their coins end up getting refunded so the idea is that the contract just basically calculates what the supply-demand intersection is and this accepts everyone who was okay with the higher price and doesn't accept people who wanted a lower price so with that kind of model I think that you know we can solve at least some of the some of both models of some of both both of problems from both sides now like that's one of my ICO ideas I also have other ICO ideas that are interesting so like I talked a lot about what I call the DEA ICO so this is like a decentralized autonomous interactive coin offering Salah organization and the idea here is basically it's like a mini special-purpose Dao where people throw their money in but then instead of the money immediately going to the team the money goes into a doubt and at that point all of the people who participated or all the token holders have to vote on basically waste email that the team that the team can spend per month so the basically the the voting mechanism has two weavers that it can press the first Weaver they can press as give the team more money and the second Weaver that I can press or I give the team more money in the sense of increase the amounts that the team could get per month and the second Weaver that he can get or that I can press is basically decide that the team sucks the project is it going well and they wants to have all the money be refunded so basically people could vote on kind of pressing this kind of nuclear button that just basically adds the project so the idea there is basically that you have a mechanism where the team only like has certainty that you know if they get to you perform reasonably then they are going to have an ongoing ongoing budget but at the same time it's a reasonable budget and it's not like they have access to you know twenty five million dollars immediately and at the same time you know there's this kind of ongoing accountability to the people that participated in the sale so this is you know just another example of how in our smart contracts can help in reducing some Eric solving some of the issues with existing icos so it's basically incorporating some DAO elements but also not going all the way into a Dao so you because it's still designed around one project and the benefit that you get out of that is that it basically makes a lot of the game theoretic issues much simpler I really like that I actually hadn't heard that one before and I really like how it solves yet another trust issue with the ICO space where you might think that a project sounds really good but if you put your money and there's no guarantee that the developers you know they could have just painted some lovely picture but then I have no real intention to actually carry it through um so I wanted to actually ask you what types of blockchain applications do you think will be the first mainstream breakout we'll see like with my wide adoption well crypto kitties has clearly already had a breakout um but I mean really mainstream like that's I don't know quite big enough it's right you know I think it's um well it's going to happen in stages right so I think like there's stuff that like a lot of the stuff that's happening right now I think has a chance of really breaking out into the mainstream but basically usability has to go up and transaction fees have to go down so if those two issues are solved then things like crypto currency payments things alike crypto currency or crypto kiddies things like ens things like watching why crypto kitties like when you say things like what two kitties what is it about that that you think will take off so I actually think that you know the idea of digital collectables is a totally fine is a totally fine idea and it seems to be something that like it's like it's gotten my technical family members using etherium depths for the first time when you see that than you real then you know you realize you have something that actually has mass market potential mean now granted it's not a kind of feed the you know feed the poor bring world peace save the world sort of thing but at the same time you know it is something it is something real it is something that gets people excited and it is something that I think that like I do think is a great example of something that kind of benefits from the blockchain to a moderate extent right because like it's like it's not the sort of thing that would get you know a quarterly shutdown by governments and it was on a centralized server but at the same time the idea of a coma of a collectible it just really does just become more interesting if it's not dependent on a single company for its ongoing existence so it's like that's just one reason why I think it's an interesting kind of example to look as it's to look as as an example of a paradigm and what do you think would be the first type of blockchain application that would go mainstream but also provide a social good um I think I mean like cryptocurrencies cryptocurrencies payments and remittances and things like that I think are starting to be useful already oh I think you know some of the identity stuff I think is going to get out fairly soon also once the some of the decentralized exchange infrastructure comes out there's a there's some project so I I talked about a Mesa Co a lot so the idea there is that it's a project that's trying to use a public watching based a decentralized exchange in order to improve interoperability between various different like digital payment while wallets in developing countries and that's something that you know actually really does benefit from you know being on a decentralized platform that's not controlled by any one company and d-dog that's an example of something that's so working to watch at least a basic version next year so like I think things in things in the payment and identity space are definitely something to look toward another thing I'm personally interested in is at the intersection of blockchains and strong cryptography so this includes things like blockchain based on privacy preserving polling systems or based on things like a ring signatures and zero knowledge proof and you know what I'm actually thinking of you know even right now if I you know like work for applications that would be you know willing to be the first to benefit from that sort of thing yeah well I was gonna ask you that so etherium is gonna add privacy but so why do you think it's important and that when you we already have privacy coins like Z Cashman arrow and - so a DC cash madera went - add privacy to money in theorems like advanced cryptography experiments that can add privacy to you know all the other applications other than money okay yeah so just like examples that include things like like as I mentioned privacy preserving polling systems on the blockchain privacy preserving smart contract systems I in privacy preserving digital identity layers so basically you know if you think about the original pitch of a theory em is like oh Bitcoin does money name coins as domain names aetherium does everything and then you can think of it as you know oh you know Zee cash is general purpose or sorry Z cash is privacy for money and in theory ohms privacy experiments are privacy for the other stuff one other thing I was gonna ask you was how disruptive you think crypto will be to governments I think it's definitely going to be disruptive in some ways like I often you know talk about the like the kind of philosophy behind that we script the currency as being to make national borders as irrelevant for payments as they are for email and you know practically speaking yeah that's a very disruptive thing though and I do think that you know governments are going to have to change a lot if so a lot of the ways in which they think about things things that they think about right now so especially with the you know at the like the internet and sharing economy applications I think they and they've they've had an opportunity to get to get used to what we stopped or at least part of like or the first wave of the sort of thing and I think watch ins you know watching based applications are to some extent going to be a going to end up being kind of a second the second wave of a similar trend so similar in some ways but also you know difference in other ways because you don't have the kind of big corporations at the center controlling everything there's also ways that I think governments can use blockchain technology so look there's a lot of interest that I've had even for people inside governments on things alike you know what this state-issued cryptocurrencies that would be used inside of governments in order to improve transparency of Finance or you know improving you know the security in various kinds of voting systems like I mean I what I voting systems are something that you have to be very clear from when you talk about because basically if you try to add technology to a voting system it's very easy to accidentally make things worse but like I'm not even thinking about national elections I'm even thinking about like much smaller stuff so you know the u.s. equivalence would be at the like the the petition website that Barack Obama put out I think around five five to seven years ago so like even kind of lower grade of lower scale things like that or I think possibly very good for kind of first targets from for watching a vacation what do you worry about I worry about well first of all the possibility of that like the speculative side of cryptocurrencies will continue to kind of grow and succeed without the practical value of cryptocurrencies kind of growing and growing and catching up to compensate I worry about a lot of the time about the wealth distribution consequences that some of that might have so basically where you just have you know totally random people who happen to have bought a few thousand bitcoins in 2010 and you know now they basically ends up being multi millionaire sub they could be all on their way to becoming billionaires without really having done any work and I do worry about you know look the kind of effects that will have on society and like I noticed that there is a lot of people who kind of cheer the Walt redistribution that's coming from cryptocurrency because they think oh you know old it's old money that's being disempowered and you know what flashy new tech money that's being empowered but I'm skeptical that people who are involved in cryptocurrency are better people than people who are involved in the Bakey system like I think if crypto succeeds it's not because it empowers better people it's because it empowers better institutions and you know a better incentive structure and better way and and better ways for existing people to interact with each other like I know I used to believe you know like if you saw some of the things that I wrote maybe four years ago that like the idea that crypto distributes both to what I thought I thought are better people is going to be a large a large positive social consequence but after watching just the way that Bitcoin maximalist Street a theory I'm with a way that the Bitcoin scaling debate has happened the way that all of these you know akaviri various like scam projects are going like I've just realized that no it's definitely absolutely no it's not true that you know a crypto people are any better than people anywhere else in the world and I can and yeah I mean I actually you know like really do worry about what happens if it like wealth transfer to these people and like the the resulting kind of super empowerment of these kinds of people ends up being in a largest or only social consequence or the watch-chain space I also worry about the just that the the the possibility that the growth of the of the of the amount of interest and the technology will outpace the technology's ability to scale a scale enough to meet the demand and you know we have had I mean the probably the big one of the big stories of 17 was bitcoins a transaction fee crisis and if the areum's transaction fees are definitely not in crisis mode but they definitely have started to go up to it would I consider I'm uncomfortably high levels so those like basically I do worry about the possibility of those those things are not going to be fixed on time but you know we'll see and it's you know I do think that like we are gonna starting to and we'll continue to engage in a very aggressive scaling strategy for 2018 that I hope will end up delivering very real and massive a transaction volume growth you know especially through things like plasma within the scope of this year and do you have any crypto predictions for 2018 hmm crypto predictions are very hard to make because like a lot of the predictions I end up making just continue ends up being consistently wrong yeah it's the stuff that ends up happening just ends up being stuff that's totally unexpected so right like the dough aetherium classes well the dough I'm sorry yeah I mean like the stuff like if you look at the big stories of 2017 right well okay I did successfully predict Bitcoin splitting it's a core into cash so that's one place where I was successful oh yeah I probably did predict Bitcoin dominance continuing to decline I am I mean the I did not predict that transaction fees would go all the way up to $20 I did not predict I think you're right I think they're like 30 or 40 by the way oh yeah totally yeah yeah I mean actually and there was this kind of sad moments that I had about a few weeks ago where I just paid something like a $6 transaction fee in order to real what use bitcoins to reload my name cheap account and that transaction ended up being delayed by a couple of hours and one sites away it I basically just said screw that I'm using my credit card and I'm like okay well you know when cryptocurrencies inferior to credit cards for just simple payments and buying stuff on the internet you know you know like I really kind of deeply if the inside kind of feel and know that the space has you know kind of lost its way to some extent so that's in as far as I mean I definitely did not predict the price increases I definitely did not predict in a lot of this stuff that stuff that's happened LM outside of the etherium space I am definitely like the sheer size and scale of the various ICO is for example um so for 2080 and I guess my concrete projections are like me and I do think that I mean I see ores are going to be quieter through 2018 and then they have been through 2017 I think that bitcoin dominance is probably gonna continue to erode and the space is going to continue to diversify I will predict like basically I think the conversation in the public mind is already you know a rapidly moving toward you know it's not it's not one thing it's an asset class and that's something that 2018 is really cemented and I think that's something the 2018 is gonna continue to cement further I predict that you know plasma will be out and you know there will be think there will be meaningful things running on it on the IDE projects you know ongoing great progress on the Casper and sharding side I mean if it's the case that Casper is the Casper is not out by 2018 it'll be because we made a strategic decision to prioritize charting over Casper so that's something that I think totally couldn't you know could end up happening though I do think that proof is take it scalability are both important I would predict that you know there are going to be more applications that come out but there's also going to be more kind of on the institutional side just kind of fake watching applications so applications that claims to run an abortion but actually are it's beautifully decentralized in any way and like those exists already right there's plenty if you know there are applications like there's a few I know I know about in China I'm sure there's some in other countries where they claim to have a blockchain running for over a year in production but actually all the servers are run by one company so I think what's up just seeing more of that from you know the port the the portion of the institutional space that likes watch it as a buzzword but really doesn't get it hmm well I will add one prediction that isn't my own but that I saw both Fred Wilson and Olaf Carlson we have polishing capital made on TV and both of them said that they thought
