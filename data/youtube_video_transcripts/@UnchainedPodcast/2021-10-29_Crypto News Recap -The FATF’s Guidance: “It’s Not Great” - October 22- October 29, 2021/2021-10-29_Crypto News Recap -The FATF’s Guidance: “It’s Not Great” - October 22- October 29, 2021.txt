[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap the financial action task force unveils finalized crypto guidance on thursday the financial action task force or fatif a global anti-money laundering watchdog published its finalized guidance for regulating the crypto industry the draft of this guidance published last spring veered in the direction of expanding roles that traditionally apply to transactions involving financial intermediaries to peer-to-peer transactions and even to wallets managed by individuals or so-called self-hosted wallets several crypto lawyers and advocate groups such as coin center and jake travinsky found that the finalized guidance appears to be better in some respects than the draft but otherwise is too vague what effect this will have in practice remains to be seen since thursday's publication is merely guidance not law member countries decide whether or not they choose to implement the fad of recommended guidelines as a reminder the fat f is the organization that advocates applying the travel rule to virtual asset service providers or vasps such as crypto exchanges and money transmitters to collect and report information on parties participating in transactions last spring's draft guidance could have required such reporting from those facilitating or governing transfers such as miners and validators now the requirement applies to persons with quote control of vas or virtual assets it also does not put such obligations on crypto protocol developers most importantly it no longer applies the travel role to transactions that occur between a business and a self-hosted wallet for decentralized applications vast reporting requirements are unclear especially for developers or anyone with quote control or sufficient influence in the defy arrangements the fat off appears to believe that many heads of decentralized protocols would fall under the vast definition quote it seems quite common for defy arrangements to call themselves decentralized when they actually include a person with control or sufficient influence and jurisdictions should apply the vast definition without respect to self-description said the guidance on twitter miller whitehouse levine policy director at dfi education fund wrote quote tldr it's not great my initial read is that the fataf sees a world in which permissionless and decentralized systems are at best suppressed from the guidance it seems that the phantom is having trouble coping with the fact that defy eliminates those intermediaries mark boyron dydx's general counsel tweeted that the fat recommendations are quote so bad that it makes the infrastructure bill look reasonable only permission to defy is allowed an intermediary must be inserted to serve as a vasp the global impact of these recommendations is an attempted kill shot at d5 mastercard is building out crypto payment rails mastercard is partnering with backed a crypto payments firm to enable
