hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the show that reveals how the marquee names in crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines and gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon i'm your host laura shin a journalist with over two decades of experience i started covering crypto over five years ago and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time you may have heard about interpop a super team laser focused on the emerging landscape of fandom they are tapping into the latest innovations in nfts to revolutionize gaming collectibles and comics on tazos learn more at hello interpop dot io the crypto.com app pays you up to 8.5 interest on your bitcoin get 25 when you download the crypto.com app with code laura the link is in the description nir is an open source platform that accelerates the development of decentralized applications overcoming high fees and slow speeds with its fast scalable low cost and climate neutral blockchain protocol learn more at near.org today's guest is dan finlay co-founder of metamask welcome dan hey thanks for having me on laura metamask just passed a big milestone five million monthly active users congratulations yeah thanks it's been a long road and we're really really proud and excited to have hit this milestone yeah it is uh quite a milestone for an online wallet is something that requires a learning curve for people so the fact that there are that many people who've done that that is pretty amazing one other thing that i found really fascinating about this milestone is that it wasn't that long ago just in october that metamask crossed one million monthly active users so how do you think you can quintupled your active user base within the last seven months well i definitely think that there's been a combination of a few factors all coming together um of course everybody knows that nfts have been a really big cultural event um and so nft participation i think brought a lot of people in it i think it was a use case that people it was simple enough that it was engaging and and it was fun and you didn't have to like read a white paper to you know appreciate some art and then at the same time we're seeing like the rise and emergence of a lot of ethereum compatible other blockchains um side chains and layer two networks coming about and that's really increasing the scalability of the entire platform so while uh during you know last summer d5 was having a really really hot moment the d5 the d5 trading boom was clearly driven by a much smaller number of users that were getting really into you know liquidity providing and derivatives trading and investing and lending in in ways that it was very capital intensive so they could justify really high transaction fees but that was also kind of ensuring that a long tail of users were not going to come in during that time but having a use case that's as accessible as nfts at the same time as we had scalability solutions starting to come online i think was a really a perfect storm for a lot of people to get an opportunity to get into it have it affordable enough even have a way that anybody could start making money you know nfts as a way for artists to make money immediately you know now it's not just people programming solidity who are doing token sales you've got you know just artists with the following yeah and what are some examples of the scaling solutions or um products and services that you feel like have lowered gas fees enough to draw on many more people well obviously there's a lot of there are some kind of let's say more centralized uh side chains but there's also varying degrees of one so things like matic and things like uh you know exi are still strong and uh and we're really looking forward to optimism and you know zk sync and eventually we are very eager to support uh more yeah uh stark and snark based uh scaling solutions like starkware 2. but yeah those those ones things like matic and xdi have definitely been providing a lot of platforms so far yeah and matic i guess now goes by polygon um so and so before we dive even further into all this um let's just make sure that you know for any listeners who aren't familiar that they you know understand what metamask is can you just describe what metamask is and what it does sure metamask started as a browser extension now it's also a mobile wallet that let you connect to applications that might have some amount of their logic that lives on a blockchain and that part of the logic is usually the the value sensitive part so it could be like a token or it could be an nft or it could be your voting rights in an organization and so metamask is the thing that lets a user hold their own keys which means they're really kind of personally in control of their accounts and now they're able to engage with these decentralized applications that just weren't even a category five years ago yeah it's quite similar to my ether wallet or my crypto for people who are familiar um but yeah the the fact of it starting as a web extension i think is sort of how i always think of it and so what kind of users does metamask typically attract we actually have a very very diverse kind of user base both across use cases and across like demographics we actually just completed a uh a partnership with this organization called emerging impact where they did a bunch of user research where they interviewed something like 300 people around the world they were doing a lot in indonesia and nigeria and in south america and because we've been seeing that for example uh what is it india and indonesia both broke into the top five countries but we we haven't really been doing any outreach there so we wanted to better understand like what's driving this in indonesia and actually we have a seminar coming up on uh may 5th and you can find that on our twitter where we're going to be sharing a lot of that research and and talking about the use cases that that people in emerging markets are are finding for metamask a lot of it was just having access to to funds that they had control over there's different situations where people don't have access to banking where that's that's valuable but but even aside from the emerging markets thing obviously d5 was a big thing in the summer and that continues to be a big thing nfts are our thing they continue to be a big thing there are people trying out lots of new organizations and dows and you know i i like seeing all these experiments you know i got into this largely because i you know i think our society has a lot of trust problems and i i don't have a magic wand for a solution but i thought we needed a platform where we could iterate on on creative solutions and i think that's part of why it's powerful and i think that's part of why it's hard to pin down the use case because i think we have a lot of things we're trying to work through and that requires a lot of iteration and experimentation so so i don't think we can really pin down a single use case is dominant oh and not to mention gaming like there's a whole category of gaming where the collectibles are portable between games and in auction formats and stuff so yeah it's it's spread around a lot and it is often surprising us it's not all stuff that we anticipated on and we've really worked hard to make sure that our wallet is kind of general purpose enough that it can serve this kind of constantly evolving set of use cases rather than just try to pin down a particular customer segment yeah and for listeners who are interested i did interview robbie ferguson of immutablex recently or immutable and they launched a layer two solution called immutablex and i also interviewed marguerite de curcel of neon district blockade games and both of them are in that blockchain gaming space um so i you know just out of curiosity when you talked about how you haven't done marketing for metamask in the developing world and yet enough people are using it there that now some countries like india and indonesia are in the top five of users i mean granted of course india is the second most populated country in the world and indonesia is the fourth most populated um but i was curious how did you find out how it was that those users had found out about metamask yeah would it the if i had to put a blanket trend on it it's people introducing each other it's not about uh yeah i don't know a central exchange or you know somebody going through and hawking it's everybody it's it's there's usually somebody who's an early adopter in a community who's doing the research and they uh may have gotten into it early and they may have had some success and right around now their friends are asking them how to get involved too and so i think we're seeing a lot of kind of grassroots education and i think that that's great and i think we're going to continue trying to target the the grassroots kind of virality approach i i don't think we will ever be able to serve people as well as they'll be able to serve each other so as much as we can just facilitate that kind of activity i think is the best thing a crypto wallet like us can aspire to and did you see if there was a difference in the type of usage in the developing world versus in the more developed or is it what you were saying about just accessing their funds that they control yeah you know the use cases weren't as different as a lot of people thought they would be so one of the things that i think was interesting is a lot of people have a narrative like oh in developing nations they just want stable currencies like if they just got access to die they'd be happy or something like that but what we saw is yeah people are happy to invest in crypto like they they're here for the gains too you know so they're not trying to they're not trying to just uh ape into things they're they're trying to do their research and understand things but they're trying to make informed decisions and and educate each other and read up and and so i i really do think there's like just kind of this booming enthusiasm to to learn more make better informed decisions there was a lot of peer-to-peer educating about avoiding scams and fissures and i think that was a really good healthy uh sign you know we know fissures are are a serious problem and fishers know that crypto users you know you've got money that's yours and it's digital like it's a it's a right place to to deceive people but fortunately you know i think that there's also like a bit of a grassroots immune system kicking into gear too and it was really great to see that also happening yeah clearly some of the echoes of 2017 are reverberating out into 2021 all right so in a moment we're going to discuss some of the new features and services of metamask but first quick word from the sponsors to make this show possible meet

by using the code laura the link is in the description back to my conversation with dan finlay one of the newer features that metamask adopted was swaps in october 2020 tell us how that works and what the user uptake has been and what people have been using swaps for cool so swaps is a a tool that we added to the wallet that helps users discover what's likely the best trade they can make at any given time given an asset per they're trying to exchange so we scan liquidity sources from a wide variety of dexes and dex aggregators and what we found is oftentimes we're able to find depending on the pair and the depth that the person's trying to trade we're often able to find a particular trade route that you know the user wouldn't think of on their own and then let them make that trade on their own um we we are taking a small fee on that and it it's meant that we've had our first revenue stream and that's been really really valuable because it's meant we've been able to staff up and actually start improving the wallet in ways that we have been a bit more constrained to previously and metamask has been around since may 2016 what have been the pivotal moments for gaining new users yeah well i think it all started with a couple tutorials about how to how to build an application for ethereum and how to connect it to metamask there were obviously a lot of experiments people trying to figure out the best use cases i think that games started really paving a lot of ground for user experience and watching transactions a little better when people started doing uh lending for the first time i think the lending protocols like started breaking way to the idea that you can you can deposit one token and and get another one and you know so you kind of start starting to get the beginning of derivatives trading i i continuously love all the work on contract accounts uh they're coming a long way a lot of the proliferation of nfts this year which has been a lot of the success is the fact that there's like five viable nft platforms all in hot competition and uh they're competing for artists interests and distribution and i think that that plays a major uh role in in this particular run for sure oh and indexes of course you know like yeah like automated market makers and stuff like like having one click trading has been huge and and we wouldn't have been able to create our swaps product if there hadn't been such a rich ecosystem of dexes for us to draw on you know it's the kind of product we couldn't have launched on our own it's it's like the culmination of of a lot of other people helping yeah it's pretty meta actually because i mean i'm sorry not not to make a funny pun on your name but um because if you're not only aggregating the different dexes but then even the dex aggregators it's just um you know i can't think of an equivalent because it's not quite kayak but whatever's above kayak so anyway i found that interesting and i just wanted to ask also because nfts are drawing in quite a different crowd from the typical crypto crowd and i wondered for that crowd have you noticed any particular challenges with them and using metamask and if so how are you either modifying the wallet in order to accommodate them or how are you trying to get the word out about educating them about how to use it yeah so some of the some of the two biggest short-term problems that we're working hard on addressing right now are about scalability so making it easier and easier to use ethereum compatible chains and layer twos and then just security because while you know users have been able to wield private keys safely you know new users are the most vulnerable and so we're really kind of redoubling and redoubling our efforts to improve our onboarding education improving in-app education uh just really trying to protect users from fishers as much as possible the fishers are are very alive and and they're they're coming after uh all all crypto users i i know it's sometimes perceived as just a as a private key uh based account issue but you know if you ever have control of funds that are digital people will try to trick you into sending them uh to you so i think this is like a critical moment for the internet to start growing up about how people discover information a lot of the problems stem from people searching google for support just things as simple as that the habituation towards the search engine so we're fighting a big battle but i think it's i think it's the right fight and i think in the long term if if we're going to have digital currency we need people finding the trustworthy paths of getting information for what they're investing in and how they're handling it so so that's one of our big fights this this quarter fishers were coming for you i hope you've enjoyed the ride and but when you say that is it just about the information or you also changing the wallet in some way or um yeah no no i mean we we've been doing a lot of different research on ways of changing the wallet right away so so we're both of course doing some improved education we are also continuing our extensibility project which is going to let us integrate more and more account types so we are interested in facilitating let's say multi-sig multi-factor type accounts but partly because there are you know different kinds of cryptography for different protocols and different scaling solutions there isn't exactly a one-size-fits-all uh solution to those problems so we're you know working hard to and be a kind of wallet that can let users opt into the types of risks that they want to take so there's a longer story we're doing this year which is we are working on this extensibility system um that we hope will let users lock down them their accounts even more but it still always starts with education and making sure users aren't you know trusting the wrong people and for listeners just a multi-sig wallet is of course one where it requires multiple signatures for instance two out of three or three out of five but is multi-factor you know just like with any web service where you know it's like a password and a code sent to your phone or a password in a ub key or something is that what you mean by that multi-factor yeah yeah and the cool thing about encrypto is you know because they're just cryptographic keys you can kind of choose your own multi-factor solution you can pick what devices you want and so you know we start with the user having full control but they can distribute it in whatever way they want unlike traditional uh two factor where you are still just validating your identity to a particular server there's still kind of a single source of truth there and so earlier you mentioned that swaps have brought in revenue for the first time for you can you give us any figures on how much you are pulling in so we we did publish a dashboard i i don't have it right now but uh we surpassed a total of two billion dollars swapped so that's not revenue but that's how much has been traded the the math isn't totally trivial to get our revenue because uh we have made some partnerships with dexes so that we're not adding a fee to them but yeah it's it's been it's been substantial you know for the size of team that we are that we are it's it's been very encouraging and you know very motivating and so we're just we're just uh going to be doing more and so other than some of the other improvements that you discussed what are what else are you going to do next with metamask we're doing we're going to be doing quite a bit um the tip of the iceberg so i mean we're working obviously on layer two and and i talked a little bit about that the first phase of that is just making it easy to to add and switch between different ledgers we are also working on a lot of kind of deep user experience challenges so we have staffed up and added a lot of designers to our team we've been doing a lot of design research and we're working on making sure that not only are we adding all these additional ledgers but we're making sure that the wallet continues to be coherent and even dare say simple in the context of what's under the hood an increasingly complicated situation i i think we're going to be an increasingly multi-chain wallet you know this year and we've got a couple kinds of new variants of the product coming out this year that are going to let us iterate and experiment even faster which i think is going to be really great because this ecosystem has no no end to its appetite for experimentation so i think we're going to be um we're going to be creating a pipeline where we can validate proposals experiment with them and implement them in the wallet a lot faster so i think we're going to be kicking in a lot of faster innovation a lot of that in service of our extensibility system our extensibility system is going to let eventually anyone add new blockchains to the wallet even ones we didn't design to and new account types and uh like multi-cigs contract accounts and uh voting rights in an organization etc hardware wallets the the list is really really long so yeah that's that's kind of what's going on for us it's it's actually quite a long road map i i hope i didn't summarize it too pithily we're really excited about it we we think that we're gonna help turn what's today a kind of rudimentary cryptographic way of interacting with applications and we're gonna establish kind of the new way of engaging with you know untrusted second parties like our goal is you know look we're going to we're going to decentralize digital authority and we want to be the wallet that people use to make deals and to last quick question so you've been using this word extensibility and from the way you're using it i'm guessing it's kind of like allowing the user to customize you know to turn it into a multisig if they want or to um just add more security or is that what you mean by that yeah yeah we've the same way you know the ethereum blockchain is interesting because people can deploy new contracts to it we want our wallet to be the kind of thing where you can deploy new features into it it's kind of like your own personal blockchain you could think of it as except it has hooks where it could potentially enhance your user experience it could maybe add extra security indications when you're interacting with things um it could even include your friends recommendations of things you're interacting with i i think that it's really going to be the beginning of a whole new chapter um you know extensibility at the blockchain layer is really valuable but it just hasn't really been accessible to the end user yet you know there's still like every time a new contract comes out you're waiting for this long pipeline of people to make an interface for it and then make a wallet integration for it and and so on and so forth we're we're going to just shorten that bridge and so the the pipeline from innovation to your hands as like you know any any user is going to get really short and i think we're going to we're going to enter a time of very exciting and interesting creativity sounds super interesting and then when you said you were going to add other blockchains which do you think are at the top of the list through extensibility we should be able to support any blockchain um we we are working with a variety of different groups we're working with groups to make sure that we're covering a general use case yeah i don't know if we have like any arrangements or commitments uh yet we have been working uh with filecoin that's actually that's totally public we've got a filecoin beta so there's a beta version of metamask that developers can download today that supports filecoin um so that's a good example of one you know if if you had filecoin in your crypto wallet uh that can connect applications then that means you could upload things and pay for things to get persistently hosted in a decentralized network from your wallet or you could commit to hosting something for someone else and then writing contracts that relate to file presence and etc um it kind of opens up another dimension to smart contracts and you know the more the more other purpose-driven blockchains we add i think they'll really have compounding effects in the way that they interact with each other well this is just super fascinating and i'm so glad that we checked in with you and it um i look forward to hearing what you guys are up to next so thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed cool thanks so much for having me don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break did you know
