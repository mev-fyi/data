I mean there always is like a little bit of this LARP in the beginning I think people think of it a little bit kind of like yeah the comps always get drawn to like um WordPress and automatic or like you know uh red hat and Fedora where it's like um okay there is the open source thing that people are contributing to and then there's this separate entity that like the Dao pays to do the thing and in reality it's it's kind of a LARP because they're they're kind of very tightly you know connected at least in the early days and so it's like yeah sure it wasn't the best show but like you know what's the alternative note like no one's going to develop arbitrum and and like you know some so they're gonna wait for some third party to show up and generate like a Consulting proposal and so you know obviously everyone kind of wants the outcome I I said something to a Founder recently which apparently really resonated which was like early stage they're a little bit like China where it's like yeah you have the power and the control but like you need to let the people believe that they have some of the power and some of the control sort of keep this this process going and I've heard that resonate
