hey everyone my idea for this episode was that it would be a year in review with Chris bernisky and Kobe one that I expected to be a doozy after the mini collapses of crypto endured in 2022 however they ended up talking a fair bit about where the industry is going which seemed an appropriate question for this soul-searching moment in crypto I hope you enjoyed this look back and look forward a year from now we will find out whether the industry has not only learned but Incorporated the lessons of 2022 and now enjoyed this conversation with Chris and Kobe foreign welcome to Unchained you're no hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host Laura Shin author of The cryptopians I started covering crypto seven years ago and as a senior editor at Forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocancy full time this is the December 20th 2022 episode of Unchained in case you didn't know every episode of Unchained is also available on YouTube go to youtube.com Unchained podcast to subscribe defy saver is an all-in-one management app for top lending protocols on ethereum such as Ave maker liquidy and compound they're best known for their one transaction rebalancing options and automated liquidation protection features and you can check them out on ethereum arbitrim and optimism today chain analysis demystifies cryptocurrency by providing industry-leading compliance Market intelligence and investigation support for all crypto assets for organizations like Gemini crypto.com and block fi maximize your potential with the leading blockchain data platform by visiting chainalysis.com Unchained Minima is a new layer 1 blockchain designed to run in full on a smartphone join over 300 000 minimum node Runners on the incentive program today to start earning every month until mainnet launch get your node set up at minima.global buy earn and spend crypto on the crypto.com app new users can enjoy zero credit card fees on crypto purchases in the first seven days download the crypto.com app and get 25 with the code Laura Link in the description today's topic is 2022 year in review or as I've been calling it The crypto Carnage of 2022. here to discuss our Kobe crypto investor and host of up only and Chris bernusky partner at placeholder Ventures welcome Kobe and Chris hello mate thanks Laura oh Chris who's lost my money this year me or you we both lost but we're we're both surviving yeah it's me then well the last time we had both of you on it was to talk about the crypto bear Market which at that time was just kind of starting it's only been like about six months which is kind of crazy to me because in that time so by then uh Tara Luna head over to collapse but by then or since then now we've seen you know additional collapses we've seen an even bigger drawdown in prices that took us below the highs of even the previous cycle we've seen additional Falls from grace of previously lionized figures in the crypto community so as you guys are looking back on this year what are your main takeaways Kobe I saw a tweet I was it was a great tweet I don't remember who it was from maybe thinking USD and it just said crypto companies be like our CFO yeah our chief fraud officer is the best I think that sums up a little bit of 2022 for me and like 2022 in summary is also like the hangover of 2021 right so like people just borrowed a lot of stuff from the future that they have to pay back in 2020. I don't just mean like Leverage borrowing money and stuff they like took shortcuts and blah blah blah blah blah so yeah I mean it's been pretty brutal and what's remarkable about it is how much of it was like just fraud not necessary it wasn't you know some stuff is business practices that uh were you know either incompetent or really Juiced to the max or whatever but some of it was just theft stealing you know non non-viable businesses using Ponzi scheme type structures or fraud in order to turn something into a real business I think that is what is most disheartening or demotivating for me is like we went through a lot of this kind of stuff in the last 10 years big blow-ups big meltdown stuff going wrong all hope being lost but a lot of the time it was because someone was hacked someone made a mistake that they didn't intend to make someone you know the mount gox who knows what happened there but uh I don't think Mark and likes tried to steal anyone's money he tried to cover up a hole and maybe made some bad decisions along the way but for next was a big meltdown it was just you know poorly um configured bitgo uh or whatever it was I can't remember which they managed to recover from and this time around it's like at least two of the big blows was just like oh yeah we were trading with customer money and we lost it like it's just outright egregious fraud so I think that is quite disheartening in a way that so much of the industry was just propped up by charlatans and you know confidence Men and stuff um you can talk about also like how it on the flip side is motivating for a lot of the core reasons a lot of us are here um you know uh like Bitcoin remains unaffected and a lot of the D5 protocols uh still operating and with the first place uh loans were repaid and then often uh cases the only place loans were repaid so you can talk about the the positive angles on this as well but I just want to dwell on the misery for her for a moment so I'll counterbalance Kobe's misery and I would carry on right where he left off which is 2022 is the reminder year of why we're all here and the truly decentralized protocols didn't skip a beat Bitcoin kept producing blocks ethereum kept producing blocks ethereum went through a major upgrade this year and then you know if you look at defy on ethereum as Kobe just pointed out that protected consumers um those loans were were repaid there was no favorable treatment to anyone within any of the truly decentralized part of the costs and that's exactly as it should be and then what we're seeing is the Fallout of people who got over their skis who you know flew too close to the Sun I think that perhaps the thing that's most frustrating to me is that we as an industry allowed those people to rise to the positions they did and in a Twitter spaces I did in the midst of the FTX Fallout with Jesse Powell and Spencer Bogart we were discussing you know the trickiness of when when things are on the rise like calling out these different folks even if you have suspicions and just to use Jesse's perspective for a moment when he's running an exchange like Kraken and he's got a competitor like FTX and he's looking at those numbers and he's like these numbers don't quite check out for me if he voices that in that moment in time people will be like oh you're such a sore loser like you know go home like we don't want to hear from you right and so the resistance that you're gonna face from the masses when you're ahead of your time or when you're right in a period where everyone's enthusiastic and you're you're exercising caution that resistance is tough to persist through and I think it silences a lot of people and there's also the bystander effect right where like everyone's looking and everyone's like well surely If someone knows something's wrong then someone will say something but the less that anyone says something or if no one says anything then everyone may end up being being signed and there there were some cautionary instances and you know to crypto Twitter's credit it did sniff out a lot of these collapses before the mainstream media did I would say it went crypto Twitter crypto native media and then mainstream media but you know it was too little too late still to to protect people so overarchingly you know the the core systems are functioning as they should be functioning I feel great about that I you know on the Venture side I'm seeing still a bunch of great teams that are building that are raising Capital that are you know creating the systems that will excite people in the years to come that hasn't changed and we got to get through this Quagmire we'll see what what happens um regulation wise that's probably gonna be the biggest thing we have to keep our eye on to the downside over the next six to 12 months I'd say just and and I mean less downside even Market wise but more industry-wide and this is more a U.S Centric concern so those would be some of my reflections yeah I think for me one other lesson which maybe Chris alluded to a little bit at the beginning is that you know crypto sort of created its own little mini great financial crisis or not so many um but you know one just you know for the crypto sector and so it just goes back to the first block of the the Genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain you know what Satoshi put in there these centralized players really you know caused a lot of the problem and so in a way um it feels to me like the community hopefully at least we'll learn some of the or relearn some of the core principles of crypto and and why um at least a lot of the early people you know were trying to build this stuff right when we took it on the chin we didn't get a bailout right like we're we're going through our own salvation Arc here and it's painful and it's a lot of volatility but um the systems are continuing without you know uh infinite balance sheet propping it up yeah yeah I definitely feel bad for all the you know retail people who definitely were hurt by all this earlier when you two were on the show we were talking about what was then sort of like the coming bear Market obviously we're still in this bear market so I was kind of curious to hear your takes on this particular moment right now of this bear market like how would you characterize where we are in the overall bear cycle I guess I can kick off I will always lean more optimistic when we're this depressed so you know my view is majority odds that the bottom is in and so that would be eth in the mid 800s and BTC in the mid 15000s that said I would expect a retest or a couple retests next year I don't think next year's you know uh joyous year I think you know next year's a grind with a fair amount of volatility but so if we if we did have some pullbacks I would expect retail tests potentially inflationary high risk assets bleed lower if BTC is retesting that mid 15's low I could see some of those assets making new lows but that doesn't mean that I'm not prepared for a reality where you know there's chaos in the traditional markets s p makes a new low for its own drawdown and if things get really messy there then you know I'm prepared to see BTC somewhere between 10 to 14K and if either retesting where it was or you know making a bit of a new low and so that those would be say the two realities that I'm preparing for um but regardless of which of those happens we will look back on this period as around the lows right and this is where I think I see a lot of people on crypto Twitter get lost where they're like oh I'll buy one it's 50 lower right and it's like well when you're 90 down and you're going to wait to buy when it's 50 lower you'll save yourself five percent um depending on where you where you took cash or if you did take cash uh take profits last year and so I I am of the view that like the biggest mistake that you can make in crypto is not buying enough or not buying at all uh in these ranges and so I'll tranche out and I'll continually buy and I totally understand that I have the privilege of managing a lot of capital for placeholder and myself personally but like any amount of capital is very divisible and so so long as you're disciplined with your tranches you can consistently have bullets and I would say you shouldn't run out of bullets to put into the market until there's a clear policy shift from the FED which could be late next year and so that's how I'm approaching things and I I would say that some people put too much weight into any single commentators ability to call the top or bottom and that includes me like I'm by no means perfect any of this and I'm I'm not I don't consider myself a great Trader um I'm a long-term investor and so the way that I have succeeded through these Cycles is just making sure that I that and Kobe said this somewhere of like you got to make sure you keep paying attention that's number one so keep paying attention and then number two being disciplined and tranching out your Capital so that you can always continue to buy each new like freakout point because you'll look back on the units of the assets that you accumulated at those points you know years from now and you'll be like oh my God I bought you know this amount of that asset for for y dollars like that's crazy yeah I think that does happen I think the counter argument to it is so you're kind of saying like look back the people that bought Bitcoin at 600 uh like they don't care they bought it at 600 when they went to 300 in the like you know months following or whatever and I think if you manage to hold through the 300 you look back and go cool I bought at 600 I'm I'm I'm the guy look at me and you don't go I could have bought a 300 and doubled like you know doubled up uh one more time but I do think the risk is and it's the thing I struggle with myself is that if you buy at 600 it goes to 300 when you're holding at 300 it feels very bad and the like it always looks bearish at the bottom right it always looks terrible so if you are holding at 300 it looks like it's going to 250 it looks like it's going 200 looks like it's going to 150. you can buy at 600 be happy with yourself and then sell it 250 be like I'm just I just need to I need to get out of this and like let's take a little break and then it's back at 600 again are you gonna rebuy our exposure so I think at least for me personally I find it so much easier to buy after the bottom than before the bottom like once it once you go to 300 and it rebounds to 600 sure you missed the bottom you're back at the price where you are happy to buy but like you know that's kind of in the past things look a little bit better you have some hope for the future again you know it's not in this like snowball running down the hill I think it's much easier for people to wait for that I'm allergic to sitting underwater in positions I like feel terrible I feel like an idiot it makes me unable to think rationally about what's happening to the market so I don't mind not buying the bottom as long as I'm buying after the bottom if I'm not buying the bottom before the bottom then I like lose like my sense of my ability to think clearly about stuff because I've already like made terrible decisions so for most people I think they can just kind of chill you know where we are in this bear market like dude I don't know I don't ask me I I don't I don't really trade anymore and [Music] my only experience in the markets ever has been in crypto so I've never like really done anything in any other market and I learned about crypto Bitcoin in 2012-ish maybe slightly before slightly after so my only experience has been in the last 10 years of markets where every single Market in the world went up in a straight line um for a decade rates trended to zero and you know there was a couple of like hiccups here and there where the markets may be dipped once or twice um traditional markets I mean but everything else was a straight line upwards crypto went through like these cycles that were very much powered by low interest rates cash being crashed nowhere for people to allocate capital and stuff like that so honestly I don't really know we live in like economic circumstances that I've never experienced before and I do not understand the levers of in order to really make sense of them so like every day it's like oh we've got the PPI the CPI the DNA the BBC coming on like they're just making them up they're making up new ones new numbers that so they can say it's bullish or bearish I don't understand what any of them mean and I don't understand how they interact with each other and stuff like that it's like everyone's losing their jobs it's a recession apparently that's bullish that's great because then they're gonna have to like it it doesn't make sense to me I've never studied it I've never really thought about it in depth so I don't really know if those circumstances were the same as the previous circumstances I would be raving you know Bottoms in it's like we're going to if it's going to 3 300 and all like whatever but that's not really the case right like money is getting more and more expensive it's not cheap anymore money is getting expensive and you can sit on your capital and earn like how much per year like five percent a year or something you can just sit on your money cool so I really really really have no idea the most demotivating sort of picture I can put in my head is the what the chart of the like stock market looks like after the tech bubble in the year 2000 right topped in around the year 2000 and then until 2009 it kind of went sideways and down just like a boring decade and I think like something like that kind of might make sense right if like inflation is like sticky doesn't go straight back to two percent sticks around but not like super high but rates have to stay kind of high globalization's reversing so you can't push rate too far down like all that stuff really changes the environment within which Bitcoin and ethereum has existed and reduces a little bit of that YOLO capitalism type um investing uh style when people don't have that spare cash hanging around anymore on the flip side asset prices are still insane young people can't afford houses so they have to go to like push out of the risk curve in order to have hope of ever buying a house and stuff so who knows man as I said and hopefully you can understand from this like monologue I've got no idea yeah I think actually it's done either it's just they have a lot fancier words to make it sound like they do so let's now talk we kind of alluded to this earlier but I do want to make sure to specifically discuss what I believe is the biggest story not only of the year but perhaps of crypto like uh you know over its entire history which is obviously FTX and Alameda the biggest bad story biggest bad story yes not the biggest good story yeah well or biggest news story is another way to frame biggest bad stories so far oh god um yeah well what what's your take and this is just a high level question like what are your takeaways or what do you yeah what is what are your main thoughts about what happened there Sam was a fraud he ran a fraudulent company or system of companies he abused a powerful technology often criminals are very early adopters of new technologies because they can run ahead of law enforcement's ability to monitor those Technologies I never invested or used or interfaced with Sam or any of his products I think they were maybe in one or two rounds that we did and this is where I carry some guilt like it was well known that alameda's structurings were predatory and so uh I was never part of a deal where Alameda structured something actually I'm not sure that FTX or Alameda and placeholder ever co-invested I know we co-invested once with three arrows um and that was in Orca the um am of Solana so but the reason I carry some guilt is because it was known that Alameda was predatorian I didn't say enough and so I'm shocked that it was such a house of cards but I guess when I pieced together the story you know you can connect the dots backwards and and really I think it's a tale of someone who was bright and motivated who was doing unfathamines and had some early success broke a few rules didn't get caught and then it started to snowball and I think it kind of all fed together with like the drugs the money the power the sycophants and the rules or the laws that he was breaking or the scale in which he was breaking them just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and he thought he could get away with it I don't think he started off as a criminal mastermind I think he ended up there through like a series of unfortunately linked events yeah I don't know I mean the the thing that's just crazy to me is like you know over the last month or so he's been doing all these Twitter spaces and podcasts and interviews and stuff telling a story that the new FTX CEO John whatever John Ray John Ray Ray J uh his just seems to be saying in you know um in these filings is like so far away from being true that I can't really I struggle to put myself in Sam's shoes or Sam's State of Mind where you would go around telling the story if it's like your most months away from what actually happened just becoming public like it I don't really get it so it just makes me think he's like either delusional or pathological liar I I have I don't really understand like him as a person whatsoever I also find it crazy that like they built the second or third highest volume exchange which like from a product perspective was one of the better ones had its flaws as most of them do but like that's the really hard bit right like building a consumer part like people like to use is really difficult and then they just like threw fraud in with it it's not even it's like a profitable business too it's not like crypto exchanges don't make money and they just did this like really really unnecessary egregious fraud I I struggle to even think like what I don't even understand the incentive structure there like you build a business it's worth 40 billion dollars like why do you need to steal customer deposits to make what another five billion 10 billion like you make an extra 10 billion for risking everything and life in jail or you can just run the exchange not steal customer funds and have a company worth 40 billion and maybe you can say okay well actually it wasn't worth 40 billion they were using customer deposits to provide liquidity making a better product which means FTX would not have been as successful as it was if they were not doing that right so like maybe you can say that I don't know if I buy it but yeah I I find the whole thing quite dismaying honestly like partially my like you know I run a podcast and FTX was a sponsor of that podcast we're getting in touch with the FDX estate to give all the money back so we'll make a loss on that podcast thanks Sam when we were initially figuring out who could sponsor us we had like loads of these people reach out and make offers and you know lots of Merit were much much higher than what blockfolio which was the original sponsor before FTX acquired it and then subsequently FTX were willing to pay and we said to ourselves oh we can't like you know though that company is like they do this that's kind of dodgy they do this it's kind of dodgy FTX is a top two three volume exchange and they you know they sponsor like Mercedes and you know blah blah blah and they have the biggest VCS in crypto that is much more reputable um so we'll go with that and like oh as you know how that turned out so I I just find it sort of phenomenal that you can be in a position that is as so much upside and you can just throw it all away with a really really poor trade like Risk Everything risk 50 billion of equity for stealing 10 billion of customer deposits right yeah but you know I don't know I I I hope he spends life in jail honestly well yeah I I think it's pretty likely at this point so and I'm Sorry by the way about what happened with the sponsorship oh look it's like you know yeah it's like it's worse for people that trusted them because they listen to us right like we lent credibility to this thing that we thought was legitimate but like we don't need to bounce money right we can give it back we're in a like a privileged position to be able to do that but the sponsorship money wasn't very much and like what it adds like not like not not not one cent on the dollar for creditors and like yeah we're not the people that deserve an apology you know anyway  somebody I've read all my homies hates someone freed yeah Chris alluded to this earlier but I was curious to hear if you guys had any ideas on how to prevent this type of thing in the future you know you you kind of identified the problem earlier Chris but I don't know if either of you have thoughts on what the industry can do going forward proof of reserves definitely on the centralized exchange side and as we're seeing with binance one difficulty there is how do you account for liabilities and um you know the audit firms that will do a good job of assuring people of the liabilities so on the like centralized exchange side I think that needs to become an industry standard and then um I'm going to go back to the start of this podcast which is this will push more people to the decentralized alternatives you know you often have the like the fall of one thing with the rise of another is not coincidental it's mutually reinforcing and so you see this with like traditional structures and like the the upstarts right so like traditional Finance with defy but I think we'll also start to see it with centralized exchanges versus dexes and we've seen it in the on chain metrics like there's been a lot of movement to self-custody into all on-chain Alternatives because of FTX that's ultimately a good thing I think it also comes about during a bear Market where Builders are working on dexes that are going to have close to centralized exchange performance fees user experience but in a decentralized environment right and so like you see Anatoly from Solana rallying the troops right now where he really wants a DEX that is basically everything that FTX was for people but in a decentralized format where you can see you know your positions on chain you know what your your reserves are you know say the whole balance of the exchange like it's it is the dream we have pursued for a long time of an open and transparent organization and that is totally possible like that is the the substrate of blockchains allow for that to be possible it's just we're going through years of building layers of infrastructure to get there maybe maybe Kobe disagrees yeah I saw he and I was running too because I was like are block times fast enough for that but anyway what about you Kobe yeah so like maybe you can maybe make it work on Solana but then everyone's got a bridge everything over to Solana right and then you have Bridge risk and like how do the bridges actually work in practice these days they're just multi-cigs to recover the funds until you get you know some better like optimistic Bridges or light Cloud Bridges or something in the future but I've been thinking about this a lot right like how do you remove the custody risk of an exchange like FDX how do you have FTX or binance or whatever type experience without having to trust the CEO of that company and then as a second question actually do users even want that because there's tons of deposits in binance right like there's how many Bitcoin in there like a million Bitcoin or something in in finance and decentralized exchanges are often the biggest staking deposits to a lot of the the networks I think the only exception to this is like cardano or something but I don't really I totally understand their staking because this is like a limit per pool or something so users actually seem to kind of appreciate this banking type relationship with an exchange where the deposit and they go call it safe in there um self-custed is hard so do users generally even want it maybe they will over the long term so let's put that question two aside and just say I want it and like we are on this call probably want it and users will want it more or more over time so then how do you actually build an exchange that supports that where you take out a bunch of these risks and Anatoly wants like a fork of Solana or something with like it's all built as a like an app on top of a focus line or an asset so then wormhold or layer zeroed or whatever in I think it just adds a bunch of additional additional risks Plus you don't actually get the FTX type experience because you can only trade from the place you store your private keys so you have to have your private keys on a machine which is the one that you use and you can't like switch to your mobile phone and then go make the trade make a trade on the train or whatever unless you have your private keys on that device as well and yeah I think it gets a little bit messy there I think one way that it could work that could be quite nice is if you had like a just in time custody model where users can self-custody and exchange builds like a very very simple custom wallet fragments the key based on an email address or something so you can log in on multiple devices and then when you're using capitalize collateral it's like used as open interest on the exchange it moves into the custody of the exchange and then moves back um perhaps after the trade but like I think a lot of this stuff is very messy and decentralized exchanges kind of have to work without fear on ramps right because if you have a fear on ramp then you have like a centralized company running the fear on and off ramp so you don't have a like a decentralized exchange you have a centralized exchange that runs on Smart contracts and stuff which actually might be totally fine right maybe that is actually optimal is a centralized product that inherits a lot of what's good about D5 like the transparency like openness lack of requiring a custodian Etc but I think it is actually a quite a difficult part and I think changing regs are going to make it harder and I don't think there's a big incentive for any of the existing exchanges to start messing around with this stuff and saying to users actually now like here's a private key like you have to withdraw everything but you can still use that platform like they're going to stay basically as like banking type relationships with with customers so I think we will see a lot of stuff here changing here over time plus if you also have to consider what's going to happen with stable coins right because there's this EU regs that are changing I read something like you're not allowed to hold over a certain amount of non-eu denominated stable coins if you're like in these new EU regs or something so you can't have more than like 100 Grand in like usdc like that sounds that seems like pretty wild um wow wait is that past or it's like a proposed thing I haven't heard of that I don't know it's proposed it's definitely not passed otherwise people would be going crazy about it but yeah there was something like that in something I read and I don't know really what's going to happen with U.S stable coins in like the wake of all this FTX Fallout you know every day there's a new like story about tether and like who knows if any of these stories I think tether's probably fine but I thought FDX was probably fine so like you know there's a lot of that and then decentralized exchanges have to rely on centralized stable coins because there isn't really a decentralized and scalable stable coin yet so there's a lot of stuff I think to monitor and keep an eye on over the next few years because how this stuff plays out and which products are built which are well adopted how the existing centralized exchanges change will really impact what happens in crypto in the future and like how the Cycles play out and whose investing Theses uh end up being the better ones so I think there is a lot of stuff to I have no idea how it plays out but I think there's a lot of stuff where you can put it in categories and try and research and monitor how those things progress and one of the big ones honestly is like what happens with Bitcoin like how will Bitcoin work in these more decentralized on-chain worlds yeah so there's a lot to like watch out for and I think from an investor and a crypto Optimist point of view there is a lot of work for you to do from a builder's point of view there's a like a lot of opportunity and a lot of work for you to do uh now as well in an environment where less and less people want to do it 2021 people were coming over like I'm going to work in a crypto company I've quit my job at Goldman Sachs or Citadel or whatever and now they're all quitting going back like no that didn't happen I was unsabbatical so I think there is a lot of outsize opportunity but you're also in an environment where like who the knows what's happening next I think uh I think Kobe needs a hug but I've needed a hug for the last 10 years oh my god did you see Sam's um Sam's testimony to Congress where one of the bullet points was like basically like I'd just like to get on the record I am and have been for the better part of the last 10 years sad he was just like this I'm like depressed that was he's like it was a really really well well who isn't someone wait so Chris I it sounds like you want to respond but why don't we do this we're going to take a quick word from the sponsors to make this show possible defy saver is an all-in-one management application for a number of decentralized Finance

Chris so Chris you want to respond to what Kobe just said yeah I was gonna I don't have a hook mate come on I'll give uh I'll give probably a you know a remote hug um I hope you feel it from afar but um no so Kobe's definitely raising true and important points that there's a bunch of hard problems left to solve in crypto the smartest Engineers I work with all want to solve hard problems right and so like when I go back to last year where we actually weren't that active in terms of deploying Capital because like a lot of the problems people were trying to work on were fluffier and valuations were crazy and what I see now is like a lot more focus and motivation to work on Hardcore problems and I say focused because it's just less crazy so you have more time and like the conversations I'm having with people are way better and like even myself I'm I'm more vocal now because I I think that it's a more interesting time to be vocal and to converse as I think about how we get ourselves out of the current situation we're in I think that there's an opportunity for traditional Finance players to come in and so and this is on the centralized exchange side so like you look at what Fidelity is doing Fidelity is not stopping right Fidelity I think sees an opportunity and I've met with Abby and you know she's all in on crypto like she gets it Abby Johnson the CEO yeah and so she's not she's not a Day Tripper right so like I think that certain heavy weights from traditional finance will move in and see this as their opportunity so that's one thing on the centralized exchange side then you know in terms of some of the existing players like the two that I trust the most are coinbase and Kraken and it's really just because they've been around for the longest right and they've made it through multiple bowls and bears and I think their Founders are ideologically driven and and they've learned how to manage through these situations and they don't take undue risk and then when when I look at those two firms they're that like Kraken has quite a good staking environment for people and I understand there are concerns around centralized stake and that's that's real and maybe we could come back to that later in liquid sinking but then when I look at coinbase coinbase doesn't have to be doing their web 3 wallet but they are and the web 3 wallet both for like retail and institutions is quite cool because it starts to set up you know this non-custodial environment that is endorsed or built or like has the trust of the coinbase brand but that you don't need to trust in the way that you trust essential exchange and so I see that as like something that you could argue in a way is almost against coinbase's core business interest but is very much aligned with crypto's ideals and so like I think they need a round of applause for that basically or like I'm really happy to see them continuing to invest in that and that's a conversation that we're having with them on the institutional side and so it's not just retail and then you know in terms of solving some of the or like some of the trickier problems I think that will be in the first Innings of solving in the next expansion would be the multi-chain wallets and this is where I see progress both from metamask so going ethereum native out and how you can switch networks but then also from Phantom which is Solana native going into ethereum right and so I think you're gonna start to see a lot more maturity on the multi-chain wallet side and a smooth user experience and that's key because that starts to get into what Kobe was talking about in terms of where your keys are you know if there are because wallets are just basically private Key Management right um with candy coded user experience and so if that gets better and that's getting better every single year that I've been in crypto right it used to be horrible and now you know it feels like candy to me but I understand how like it still has quite quite a ways to go but that will start to enable more multi-chain gaps right and and that idea of a DEX that is on par with FTX will in part rely upon that and then you know I expect inner chain protocols to basically go through their boom in the height of the next expansion similar to what alternative layer one smart contract protocols went through last year and so there will be tons of examples of those by well-capitalized teams they'll be relatively poorly understood like value and technological models like some differences at the margin a lot of copycats but like a lot of capital and experiments pumping through excitement there and there will be some like disasters that come out of it but I also think that some winning models will get cemented through that process and that's a key that is another like say the next key layer of the infrastructure which needs to come in and so I just kind of go back to the fact that this all takes time you know smart Engineers like working on hard problems and they will continue to get supported by investors like us a lot of capital allocators have gotten walloped um but I would say like the um maybe the most skilled or the most ideologically committed or whatever we're all still allocating and actually like placeholder was way more active this year as an allocator than last year and will be similarly active next year so like those are the seeds of what will come later and then to address an issue that Kobe raised earlier about Bitcoin like you talked about you know these different multi-chain wallets and stuff like do you see any really good solutions for um bringing Bitcoin in because I'm sure you saw that news about how Alameda asked Biko to uh take the Bitcoin out of the wraps BTC just like basically stealing it for the people who had wrapped it in there which is kind of crazy and they refused um and I I did hear that tbtc is going to be relaunching um in a in a more decentralized way which will be interesting to watch but there's also sbtc from Stacks which they just published the white paper this week so it's a trustless Bitcoin Peg from Bitcoin into the stocks ecosystem so we definitely need more trustless Bitcoin pegs you know it's a type of bridging so like everyone is working on this bridging or interoperability problem because it's a hard one and we need it but I think you know it's finally the time where people are so bearish on building on BTC where I think it's time to be bullish on it and it's been increasingly a joke over the years that anyone would build anything on BTC but like the protocol is still there it's still the most valuable asset in crypto and there's motivated teams probably the two that seek out to me most would be lightning and stocks we we work with Stacks there are teams that are committed to making this more programmatic I don't totally understand how Stacks works I'm not going to fight it because I don't understand how it works I'll say something wrong but it seems a little bit like woo magic to me like it's like too good to be true anyway I won't afford your investment um because I don't understand it no maybe you can but I would study it more yeah I'll I'll do that I'll do that and then I'll put it afterwards yeah when you've been around for a long time and I'd say he's he's committed and what I like too is like that team has um spread so like it's there's there's it's not just like one core entity supporting it and so the team has spread in different parts of the core founders of the protocol now run their own entities and they're tackling the problem from a number of ways you can fight Stacks Kobe because Bitcoin Maximus but Stacks relentlessly um but I also I'm seeing an interesting change within the Bitcoin Maxi Community because I went through a falling out with the Bitcoin Maximus basically 17 18 19 because when I was at ARC like in 2014 and 15 I was really just doing Bitcoin right and so like that was my community and then 16 things started to get tenuous and then you know 17 when I started placeholder I started having fights in those exploded in 18 and 18 with the Maximus so anyway I had a lot of like falling outs with different people that I had been conversing with but what's happened recently is a lot of those people have come back to me and said you know I'm more of a Bitcoin moderate now and you know I understand what you were saying they're working to reform Bitcoin culture I would say and a lot of them are supportive of stacks even though like the more extreme remaining Bitcoin Maxes who have you know a quarter of a brain will still like just scream that it's a useless  coin or whatever yeah I do think that like if you like Bitcoin is one of the areas that probably has the most opportunity in it over the next few years particularly if Bitcoin developers go how can we rely Less on centralized how can we rely Less on centralized exchanges as like a form of acquiring and selling Bitcoin for like people that weren't told um Bitcoin sometimes people will want to sell their Bitcoin how do they have to how can they do that in like a trustless way you know not not going like back in the local Bitcoin days where you went peer-to-peer and met someone in a cafe with cash because that went very safe in hindsight I'm interested that you think the multi-chain thesis still holds up and like like it's still interesting because like what were the big successes of multichain in 2021 I wouldn't say I wouldn't say there were any but like I think that like that means there's no evidence for this thesis the the hacks the hacks were very successful the bridge hacks were lucrative I mean they were lucrative for the hackers but um I kind of see the bridging or multi-chain infrastructure in 2021 being where proof of stake protocols were in 2017. right so like in 2017 it was Ethan BTC and then there were like some weird proof-of-stake protocols right uh I think nxm was proof of stake or like like some Fringe ones but then a lot of people were talking about it and working on it and capital was getting allocated to it and everyone knew it needed to happen and I guess I'm enough of a Promethean where I'm like okay if capital is getting allocated to it and smart people are working on the problem and motivated to solve it then it will get solved we'll try a bunch of stupid things in the interim you know we'll make a ton of mistakes things will blow up people lose money out of that eventually the solution will emerge and so you know using that cadencing it's like in 17 proof of stake was theorized but we were still a proof of work dominant environment and there were a lot of people who were like ah proof of stake will never work like there's there's no good examples of it and then in 2021 proof of stake exploded and we were like whoa like this is valuable and I think in value there's probably more or it's it's probably roughly equal right proof of work proof of stake I haven't summed the major proof of stake protocols against BTC but like certainly proof of stake is now say proven and On The Rise and then you know in the year that that happened is really when there's like looking forward to the bridging and interoperability stuff and it's kind of like the industry as a whole needs to solve the biggest most pressing problem first to then free up the space both labor and capital wise to then move on to the next problem and this is where it's a little frustrating it just seems to me that the multi-chain the multi-chain thesis came around because Solana Avalanche and Luna appear to be doing very well so I was like oh clearly we're going to live in a multi-chain world ethereum fees are too high so everyone's using these other chains but then each of those chains had like a backer that has since like totally blown up right so like FDX were obviously the big sponsor of Solana and perhaps allegedly who knows selling everyone's user deposits to prop up Solana and ftt and Solana ecosystem things Avalanche obviously had three AC as the Flagship uh supporter who are like just constantly constantly bidding Avalanche and suited his big yes I've abandoned ethereum fees are too high ran around the Avalanche top and then Luna obviously had the unsustainable UST dokwan backing so like if you remove each of those actors from those ecosystems like what actually would have happened like obviously you can't say right because of power of the universe you can't just go back and edit edit stuff but like would the multi-chain thesis have become so popular then and then where does the economic activity actually happen today is there like surely it's like mostly on polygon versus any of these uh other layer ones so I I don't know like I think there's two ways to to think about it like in terms of the multi-chain there's just pure like if you want to take your argument that Avalanche and soul are doomed now and they won't go anywhere because they're not necessarily doomed but like would that have happened would people have been so bullish on multichain if not for some people buying with other people's money so I think that um no people wouldn't have focused on it as much but it still has to be a focus because even just if you set those two aside then you probably still believe in ethereum and Cosmos right and um and even if you just don't want to believe in anything but ethereum I see the l2s as basically independent chains at this point and so then you have to figure out bridging and the experience between those different execution environments and so regardless of you know which coin you want to be a cheerleader for if you believe in smart contracts at all and even like it's almost just inescapable because even with Bitcoin and stacks and lightning you're getting different layers and different layers require bridging and then they require interoperability between those execution environment layers and so whether you're a Bitcoin believer ethereum believer Cosmos believer Salon a Believer or believer of you know all of the above I think that the next big problem to solve is the seamless flow of value and information between the environments in those ecosystems but I agree Kobe that like yes multi-chain got ahead of its skis because things were say so over inflated last year but I I think it's going to come back um in full force in a few years time and I think that in addition to ethereum we'll have a handful of key Innovation environments and you know I've been vocal about Solana and Cosmos and I'm happy to talk about that more because I think in particular Salon has probably been surprising for folks the The Narrative got bigger than the reality as it always does but I'm still seeing now in a bear Market where there's very little narrative the reality is still strong that there's a bunch of people working on on bridging yeah the way I see it is there is room for a layer 1 to exist if it provides the ability for new stuff to exist like New Primitives new apps new type of thing right because you had Bitcoin and then you had ethereum which brought this additional stuff you could do like trustlessly and all the other Bitcoin sort of forks that just changed part of the technology added snore signatures or something perhaps before Bitcoin did um or like change the like you know hashing algorithm or the block speed or whatever all of those just like trended down versus Bitcoin over time um and like it didn't it didn't bring anything new it didn't enable anything um additional and then ethereum did it enabled you can do a series of actions that you can't do on bitcoin so people go oh cool now I can build this thing now I can build this thing and those things start to exist and if you just like again then like change the ethereum block time or like you know tweak a thing here or there it doesn't seem super interesting to me outside of it being like slightly cheaper to use or you know blah blah blah blah but if there is a layer one that enables functionality that just on ethereum is non-non-viable you know so like say sui or whatever it's called enables like some app that you can't build an ethereum because like you need parallelization or whatever then I can kind of see some life being had there because like people will build stuff that couldn't exist on ethereum and users will go oh wow this is cool look what I can do that I couldn't do before and maybe that's just like a a function of scaling or maybe it can even be done through layer twos right where you can have like purpose-built Roll-Ups for apps that enable new functionality that was just not possible with ethereum for scaling reasons or whatever then I can kind of see it but like I'm I really really like I feel very bearish on this like multi-chain thesis where it's just like which can have loads of chains and they all kind of do the same thing but like this one's got this language this one's got this one this one's got subnets like uh like who cares until there is something that like is fundamentally enabled or it's like okay we couldn't do that on ethereum and that's important to the world people actually want to use that now you can build something in a trustless or decentralized way that you couldn't build before then I maybe think this thesis comes alive so I think that's another area that's worth like monitoring and researching is someone building something on one of these new chains that could not fundamentally exist anywhere else new chains on Roll-Ups or wherever I I mean I think you you guys are both making good points and I think you know we're not going to know how things play out because the show was meant to kind of recap 2022. I love it that we that we looked forward because I have been getting comments from people like oh you know I kind of want to hear about the Innovation that's happening or new things so I'm so glad that we covered that at length but I do still want to ask a few things about kind of current events in the past year so at this moment in time obviously you've had this huge huge collapse and yet sad as it is to say contagion may not have fully played out yet in the industry at the moment we're recording there's yeah a number of concerns one that's in the news a lot is binance another one I did a whole show on it was dcg and Genesis people were making noise about crypto.com which disclosure is a sponsor of the show um silvergate bank is in a tough spot there's a lot of short sellers on that stock right now and they're I think the leading bank for crypto companies so I don't know if you you know I I meant to have you each discuss each of them but we're kind of running out of time so I don't know if you guys want to call out any particular ones as being ones that you're either looking at in terms of being significant or you know if you want to say anything about what you think might happen with any of those or what the impact would be on the industry Kobe you want to go first yeah I mean obviously like I don't have any insight into like the binance stuff like a lot of the finance stuff that's happening on Twitter you see these videos and they're like really taken out of context and I'm always like is this person like intentional like they know it's taken out of context or have they been like fooled by someone else so that like makes me a bit disheartened where we have this type of um people see the fear and like the panic and the dead bodies and it feels a little bit like vultures of swoop like swoop swept swooped God what's the do they swoop in or they swept it yeah they're swept in and they're just like picking at the carcasses and like you know it feels a little bit like that to me at the moment whereas in previous bear markets it was like people's rallied together and like you know we're gonna make it through it now it's like people like egging on the catastrophes a little bit and hoping for new ones yeah just to explain some of that quote-unquote fud I think the video that you're talking about is whether or not binance might have to pay a claw back to yeah for the FTX bankruptcy process of 2.1 billion dollars which is what FTX or slash L meter or somebody or Sam or somebody paid to finance to buy binance out of its stake um however I did and granted this is just one person I think it was wassi lawyer that I I asked multiple lawyers about this but I'm pretty sure bossy Laura was the one who responded and he said because that transaction took place in July of 2021 he said that's probably like too long ago or actually I don't remember his ex this is like literally in the minutes before we've recorded so but he said he thought it was unlikely to be subject to a clawback so just to the way the video is presented on in those like tweets made it look like he was saying we'd let the lawyers handle it if a user tried to withdraw their money rather than like could you process the clawback so it was like presented in this way where it looked like you had to take your money out of finance that said CCA is acting weird on Twitter these days it used to be so like chill and didn't tweet very much and now he's doing weird stuff and he you know banned that guy's account because they were having to fall out in the custom support chat or something coin member yeah so like if I mean if balance goes down it's going to be obviously very bad they have like 80 odd percent market share their orders of magnitude larger than FTX uh was even at its peak so that'll be bad um like I've seen tweets where people say that personal bank accounts are being closed because they deposit it or withdrew from FTX which like also seems very bad it's always been difficult for crypto companies to get bank accounts and for large crypto investors or traders to have personal banking relationships um in at least in in the west I think in the US but definitely in the in the UK if that gets worse I think that is just a real headache for for normal people but outside of that like the rest of it like yeah it doesn't matter like does Bitcoin keep working does uh is there no major flaw in ethereum's uh proof of stake implementation finally that's that worked seamlessly by the way like Kudos but you know as long as those things are fine and everything keeps ticking the core thesis Remains the Same to me like do I believe that trustless and sensor resistant money is important they believed like sensor resistant like trade is important or Commerce and do I think the world is getting more trusting or less trusting therefore are these like protocols and services in higher demand or lower demand so yeah sure like let's say every single one of those things you just listed goes down like crypto.com blows up binance blows up silvergate blows up  it let's throw in tether usdc etc etc does it actually matter at the end of the day like probably for a few years it matters but if a bunch of like centralized businesses blowing up in the industry generally um can kill the industry then like in a way it's maybe already dead so I'm not super worried about any of them like how much worse can it get a touch word hell maybe I'm worried so I don't have any um any Edge I would say on on any of those proceedings other than knowing some of the people who run those organizations for a long time I think that you know specific to dcg and Genesis the fact that we don't have news yet means Solutions are being worked upon right like if it was a disaster emergency scenario they probably would have been forced into action by now so that's where I take you know the the view that no news means nothing or no news is good news Finance I'd be pretty surprised like much more surprised for binance to go down than FDX to go down I think that tether has been flooded forever and you know there there are things around tether that if you're intellectually honest you know will raise your eyebrows and um that has pretty much always been true that said they have handled a massive amount of uh runs on usdt this year pretty seamlessly and so I have nothing against tether or bitfinex or any of the people who run those orgs but I would enjoy at like I think it would be good for the industry if tether share became less over time and I don't think that has to happen through a blow up it's interesting what coinbase just did I think with um zero fee trades allowed into usdc from tether and I think you know that's one way in which share shifts will will take place as people take the trust or or the entity that is backing some of these stable coins more seriously a com is probably the sketchiest one to me I mean it came out of nowhere I know nothing about the team um like all of a sudden it was in the top 10 or 20 coin market cap it has it's like they're sponsoring the World Cup like it has a lot of Echoes of FTX but I know nothing about it you know and so I yeah that's one that is kind of a newer entrant and uh at least within how I interpret crypto players but like I also trust newer entrants less like they have to prove themselves over cycles and and I think that's a key tenant that's why I go back to client base and Kraken and for what it's worth dcg has has been around for a long time I mean a new Barry in his second Market days before he sold that I forget to who and then started at dcg and then started to build out these conglomerates or you know grayscale acquired coin desk um Genesis so on and so forth um and so I think that varies very well connected and Savvy and I've I think he's more pinched than he's ever been here but I've consistently seen him make lemonade out of lemons and so I'd be expecting that out of this situation from him and then overarchingly like I I wish all these companies you know success and um if they do blow up that that is a bummer but the protocols will just keep chugging along and that's what matters and like no core protocol has um blown up this year and um you know that's the most one of the most important takeaways Luna I don't consider like a core protocol for what it's worth I think it was like always poorly designed and worked as intended for a short period yeah no I mean even the bloat work is intended right like if yeah if you if UST depegs then it sells on Luna like that's literally the design I mean didn't restore the peg because it was a flawed design but it worked as it was designed um so I was curious you probably heard that Joe was still trying to you know be entrepreneurial and build um in the interview I did with him he emphasized that he wanted to keep contributing to the space is that something that you think the crypto Community should be open to to more entrepreneurial efforts from dokwon I mean no but like I I don't know like would you use or invest in Elizabeth Holmes next business like probably oh yeah but hers was like an actual fraud do you think that uh Tara Luna was an actual fraud well I read I don't know right because I've got no internal um View and originally I was actually of the view that like it there was no fraud but there was it was poorly designed and he believed in something stupid and you know like maybe acted Invincible because it made 50 billion or 100 billion or whatever it is net worth was in a couple of years and that went to his head and you know he was just really believed this mechanism would work which it somehow managed to do for a while but then I read this like Thread about like you know there was this and there was all this lying and the chai numbers were all fake and actually the person that depaked the stable climb was like tfl or something I read and like they were selling UST and then those are still the basis cache thing is that ever was that ever like confirmed to be real he actually built bases cash and that went to zero so like he's one of the co-founders yeah yeah so it's like you must have questioned a little bit if the exact same mechanism could have the same result as last time so like I don't know like oh when I read through that thread I was like actually this seems like really bad but then again when you read these Twitter threads you're like is is there also even credible so I don't know the optimistic way to look at it was flawed mechanism that he believed in the pessimistic way is fraud either way I wouldn't use or invest in something that he like created um again yeah so like no but if he does build something like he's allowed to do it right like it's like do whatever you want it's a free world I wouldn't say like I'm not gonna try and cancel people that do want to use his stuff because I think people should be allowed to do whatever they want as long as there's information Symmetry and people are acting you know openly and honestly so yeah I won't I wouldn't recommend it to my friends or family or you know to to you a lot but whatever you can do every once Connie I'm surprised he hasn't been arrested yet but listen yeah apparently it's like on the run so these are permissionless systems so anyone can do anything they want and then I think it's upon all of us to educate people right and like I don't trust o'quan I don't trust Kyle Davies I don't trust suzu like I don't trust a lot of these characters and I think the um the key thing for me is like I haven't seen like a genuine apology I've seen like thinly veiled apologies that are still you know dripping in ego and like I'm still the greatest and you know this unfortunate thing happened to me and so then it's like well you didn't actually learn your lesson and if you didn't actually learn your lesson then you're probably going to make the same mistakes and you're going to continue to hurt people and so if I had my choice yeah I don't want them into history anymore any of those characters and you know if someone really takes the time learns their lesson like has like true reflection that is voiced or written or whatever on the things that they went through um then I do believe in in second chances but I haven't seen that here and so I would really caution similar to Kobe people from trusting them fully record even if someone did what you just said I would still not trust them honestly because like easies do that stuff right it's like easy to say sorry and like you just gave them the Playbook they could just follow that now I'm great no they're back in so like I yeah that's fair all right you know if Sam was willing to lie to literally everyone is like easy enough to lie in your apology as well so in general I think people's actions over time reveal them for who they are and apology here apology there like generally meaningless I think but like like actions afterwards will reveal more about what they learned from that um you know event if dokwan goes like you know Anonymous build something in five years like one of the biggest D5 protocols is revealed was built by dokwan but it's like economically sound it's worked really well there's no Shady business practices blah blah blah blah well at that point I go I'll reevaluate this thing that he's built and the action sense as this like Anonymous um hypothetical developer because you just have new evidence but like yeah apology light and Phuket apologies the minimum that these people should be issuing yeah and I want to call out um some of the statements that sues you and Kyle Davies of three years Capital have made recently Kyle said in an interview with CNBC that part of the recent 3ac collapse was because their positions were hunted in the recent 3ac bankruptcy hearing a lawyer for the Liquidator said in the middle of June as three arrows Capital collapsed it hired a security firm able to establish a secure communication system that could then allow this Communications to be deleted and they've both been very active on Twitter ever since FTS collapsed like literally within the hour after collapsed and in an interview with Bloomberg Sue told told the reporter that they're looking to set up a new trading shop and Kyle also said on the analyze Asia podcast that they are speaking with investors about a new venture so I've heard the same like and I think they're going to get the capital for what it's worth like I I think they'll pull it off from from what I've heard they yeah I think they will I'm not happy about it but um hey Traders provide liquidity I thank them for the exit liquidity last year and they can come back and we can do it all over again yeah they raise money for other people to buy the top again cool okay oh Kobe did you want to add anything on the three AC stuff yeah I mean I like I don't know I was friends with Sue and not friends with Kyle and like I would chat to do sometimes during the bull market I met him in like 2021 digitally and never met him in real life in 2021 and he never did anything bad to me but I was not one of the people that they tried to borrow money from in the dying hours you know which is Apparently one thing they did they went to like family friends portfolio companies to borrow money when they kind of knew the game was over which I think is very difficult to to defend I imagine they probably were hunted on FTX right like if you deposit money on FDX it seems like Alameda was instantly selling your coins so yeah they were working on a rigged Market but like you can't blame that for all of your actions surrounding it I don't think yeah look if they raise another fund like that's a that's a relationship between them and the investors I imagine they'll find deal flow much more difficult because investors will refuse to co-invest with them I imagine and projects will want them on their cap table much less than they did before whereas before they were like Founders would go after them as a um an investor I think so they're like yeah what can you do all right so we're going to do kind of a lightning round so just try to keep your answer to like a sentence uh who's the biggest winner of 2022. U.S government ethereum who's the biggest loser of 2022. FTX damn yeah like yeah some FTX users all right and then this last one you can you can elaborate a little longer but if you were to make a prediction about 2023 for crypto what would it be renewed interest from crypto community in things like privacy and assumptions like around how protocols work with regard to like custody risks you know those kind of things and renewed interest in like decentralized stable coins and stuff and renewed interest from the regulator side in turning coinbase into a Securities Exchange I would say at some point next year the majority of crypto Twitter will be um pounding their chest that a new bull market is upon us and we're going to uh future all-time highs very soon whether it's true or not I'll I'll withhold judgment but I uh I expect that sentiment at some point on crypto Twitter next year I think it'll be wrong actually I'll just share that I think people get whiplashed but I think we'll have a strong move at some point before a retest no all-time high in 2023 no chance yeah yeah but I think we've got more chance of breaking the lows than making a new all-time high that's true I agree with that yeah all right kind of a depressing note to end on it's 2022 that's the way to do it it's not something here's a more uplifting note I was thinking about this earlier so one thing is the cause of like the Lost decade or you know I've seen some people saying it'll be six years until we have a new high or whatever I think those will ultimately be looked back upon as markers of like the sentiment bottom of like how horrible things got I think that the and and this is where you know some of my training comes from Kathy Wood where like the rate of change that we're seeing in the world is so fast and we kind of forget that but that underlies a lot of the protocols and companies you know within crypto within AI within Tech at large and so like I don't believe in the Lost decade I don't believe in six years until another boom so that's one thing I want to say the other thing is I think a decent way to stay sane in Bear markets is to stop looking at dollar amounts or dollar net worth and look at unit amounts of the crypto assets you care about and I try to never really fixate on like dollar net worth of course like how I manage placeholder I have to like produce uh results for for my investors but but specific to myself personally I'm pretty much always thinking in units of the assets and that's what I care about and maybe that's where you know I'm just I I drink the Kool-Aid enough where like like I'm stoked to be building significant unit position sizes of certain assets and so then I don't really care what the dollars are that that would be my advice I guess to people is like focus on the units you want to get to if you want to make yourself happy you can always say if all these assets got back to their former all-time high then you know these units would be worth you know a certain dollar amount you know that's like some hopium not all assets will get back to their all-time high but the quality ones will go multiples of their prior all-time high right and so that's where you have to pick carefully but just focus on the units focus on the units and stake and you'll be fine and and the last thing sorry the last last thing is I very strongly believe that like crypto has years for buying and for selling and so I don't even think about selling this year next year whatever like it's just not even not even an action I'll really take I just think about buying and on a year like last year I don't even really think about buying in the public market that much I just think about selling and so you know kind of and that's a very kind of glacial way to move Capital but it keeps me more sane as opposed to like trying to time every single thing and so it's just like oh things go down more there's even more opportunity I can stack even more units and I guess that's one way that I keep myself optimistic and happy in this current environment I like it good note to end on all right so where can people learn more about each of you and your work I'm on Twitter at C bernisky and placeholders website is placeholder.vc yeah twitter.com nothing good happens there one of my favorite Twitter accounts sorry about that all right it's been a pleasure having you both again on Unchained thanks Laura happy holidays thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Kobe Chris and the year of 2022 in crypto check out the show notes for this episode Unchained is produced by me Laura Shin with Alfred Anthony Yoon Mark Murdoch at pilchard Juan ranovich Sam sriram pamajimdar Shashank and CLK transcription thanks for listening [Music] foreign
