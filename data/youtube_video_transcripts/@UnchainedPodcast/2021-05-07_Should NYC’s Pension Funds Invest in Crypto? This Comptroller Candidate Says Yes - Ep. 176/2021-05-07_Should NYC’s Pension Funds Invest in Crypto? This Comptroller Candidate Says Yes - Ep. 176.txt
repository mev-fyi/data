near.org tasos is smart money that's redefining what it means to hold and exchange value in a digitally connected world discover how people are re-imagining the world around you on tezos today's guest is reishma patel candidate for new york city controller welcome rishma hi laura it's great to be here with you thank you for inviting me you're running to become the democratic candidate for new york city controller crypto people may be familiar with controllers after brian brooks's tenure as a us controller of the currency at the federal level last year but what does the new york city controller do yeah so the new york city controller is uh like the chief financial officer of new york city and also the chief auditor of new york city the 250 billion dollar pension fund which is the fourth largest in the country is managed by the new york city comptroller um the city's 118 billion dollar capital program is done through the comptroller's office and then the city has 55 agencies and the comptroller has oversight over them and audits each agency every four years and the role of the comptroller really is to hold the city accountable and serve as a check to the other areas of our city government which is the mayor and the city council and all contracting and all arbitration goes to the comptroller's office and you've proposed what you call a future-proof plan that centers around investments in blockchain businesses and crypto assets for the city why don't you tell us about that plan so you know i think new york city as we come out of this pandemic and the economic fallout from it really needs to be thinking ahead and what ways that we can bring new technologies to new york city and how we in city government can use it and i really believe that blockchain is a tool that can really help city government in terms of transparency and accountability and i also think it can help diversify the city's pension fund as we think about long-term you know hedge against inflation how we prepare if there's a turn in the public markets and the s p goes down i think investing in um crypto uh would be a really wise thing and i also think that we need to have more favorable conditions so that we get blockchain companies to come and you know start business in new york city as we rethink what this new economy looks like and so for part of that plan or proposal you want to allocate one percent to three percent of the city's pension funds to crypto are there any special approvals that the city controller would need to do that or just in general what would that process entail yeah so the controller is the custodian of the pension funds but they are trustees and the city has five different pension funds in the pension system so we would need to get approval from the trustees to move forward on that plan and there would be an investment committee that would be looking at the plan and making the best recommendations you know how do you invest which uh you know currencies you know i propose bitcoin and ethereum but you know we'll be looking at all options and looking at what's the best way to move forward and how much you invest and do you have a sense from speaking to some of those trustees just how many are open to this idea so i have had general conversations with people you know since i'm running for the office i'm not the comptroller i can't uh you know go and meet with the trustees and stuff so this is a plan that would need to be put forth once i was elected and then they would really seriously have to take a look at it and move forward on it and so i know you're saying that you know they would kind of study how to go about doing this but what investment vehicles have you been thinking might be appropriate are you thinking that the city would directly invest in the assets themselves or into crypto vc funds or into you know certain investment vehicles similar to gbtc or some of these other new etfs that are out there um you know what what do you think would make the most sense so i was looking at both investing directly into the currencies as well as etfs and with the idea that you know you want to have a diversified portfolio and have exposure to different things and i thought that it made sense to look at both of those and also on the vc side too because uh you know one of the pension funds in the us who's already done that in virginia there's two pension funds who've invested in blockchain vcs and they actually have upped their investment this year because it's been going so well and would you also look at investing in the stocks of some of these companies that have put bitcoin on their balance sheets such as tesla or microstrategy or some of the others yes and then in terms of managing those investments how frequently would those be rebalanced the city's investment you know there's a chief investment officer the controller are looking at this on an ongoing basis and really looking at you know what market trends are um how we you know because it's about risk management this is a long-term investment and so you are looking at rebalancing um i would be looking at it all the time you know and you'd have quarterly updates okay and so how did you become interested in crypto and blockchain technology and decide to incorporate into your platform so my background is in finance um it's been in public finance you know which is uh different uh than you know uh blockchain uh technology but i you know i had worked in various banks for almost two decades and had experience in that and i had my clients who always stayed in local government so that's how i got interested in how we make our city governments work better and this role of controller and i had worked as a financial advisor to controls office really got to know the nuts and bolts of the office and what kind of things that i feel like we need to fix in that office and so that's what brought me to thinking about okay what are the problems that we have what are the ways we need to think about this and then that's been amplified as a result of everything that's happened in the past year because new york have been doing well for you know most of the time that i've been working with the city and technology i went to mit i've always been interested in technology and um since 2015 been going to events where people are talking about blockchain how it can be used in the procurement process following you know the crypto space and so i thought that this should be an important thing that our city government should be looking at and frankly governments all around the country and around the world and so you mentioned the procurement process part of that proposal that you put forward is to use blockchain technology in that and that system is um the way that the city uh awards and pays out government contracts for city projects so what is the problem with that existing system that you think blockchain technology can solve sure so one of the main ways that the city interacts with constituents is through this contracting process because they outsource a lot of human services through non-profits and then they have contracts with uh small businesses large businesses for supplies and other things other work construction work you know there's all kinds of things that we contract out there's almost 20 000 contracts annually with the city and one of the problems i've been board chair of a community development corporation that does pride a lot of these human services and one of the pain points has been that the city will contract with you and the contracts take almost a year sometimes we've had three years waiting time before we get paid which makes it really hard because you're providing these services but you haven't gotten paid and it makes it harder for small nonprofits those are serving communities that aren't that large um like a lot of ethnic communities and stuff those nonprofits have a really hard time managing their budgets hiring staff because of this and similarly if you're a small business if you're a woman-owned business that doesn't have as much capital minority owned business it's harder for you to access some of these contracts if there's that much delay and so that's the pain point that i felt and i've seen that across non-profits and small businesses and wanted to solve and fundamentally it's a matter of trust as well right in building this trust between constituents and the city and i thought putting this on blockchain because what happens is the comptroller's office the mayor's office of contracts the different agencies that are contracting these services are all working on these contracts together and the comptroller's office is required to approve it in 30 days but no one else's right and if we had a much more transparent process where everyone could see where the movement is happening including the person who's actually contracting with the city it would make it much easier it would also save a lot of time and it'd be much more efficient and we could also see where the money's going to right because you'd be able to track that and it would right now everyone is keeping their own records and blockchain would allow there to be one record that can't be changed that everyone can trust and work together so in a moment we're going to dive more into this proposal to use blockchain technology for the city's procurement system but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible with over 10 million users crypto.com is the easiest

five years to power sustainable innovation through its ecosystem with fundraising opportunities and support for dows and dapps to engage fans and reach new audiences come learn why near is the infrastructure for innovation at nea.org back to my conversation with rashma patel so i was just shocked when you mentioned that sometimes it takes three years for some of these contractors to get paid um hopefully that's with interest because um that's it's just really crazy uh why does it take that long so three years has been the extreme of one of the contracts that a non-profit that i was involved it had you know but i would say on average it has been at least uh six months uh it used to be even a year they've improved the process slightly in some cases right and that happens because there are so many different areas of the city government that has to look at these contracts and it just takes a long time to get it approved and having not been at each of the agencies i don't know why certain agencies take longer than others because it's not consistent across the 55 agencies some are quicker some are slower it is one of those things where it seems to be a black box the city has created something called passport nyc which has a database where you can try to track this but it isn't accessible uh to all participants and you know the idea with this blockchain proposal is that everyone would be able to go and access the information and know where in the process the contract is and i'm assuming this would be a private blockchain or are you thinking of putting it on a public blockchain like ethereum no it was saying public blockchain like you okay using i guess i'm sure there would be some kind of privacy for the city okay and do you have are there any particular would it be like a decentralized app or would it be a um yeah i'm not sure really what that looks like yeah so it would it would be on a public blockchain but it would have security measures because you want to keep certain information secure but the idea would be that there would be the transparency in where the contracts are in the process and you know each individual involved like the agency the mayor's office the controls office already um has knowledge of who the parties are involved in each of those parties involved would be able to look at the ledger see where things are along the way okay and yeah have you discussed this with any particular companies who you know have talked about implementing this kind of thing i've talked to other experts in the field about this you know but no one who was actually implemented for a city government or any government because i don't know anyone who's done it procurement for a government agency okay and and so but this would be something that would be directly in the controller's scope of of work okay yes because all the contracting is gone through the controller's office okay so something i know that is a little bit outside in fact i think just plain outside the controller's direct scope is um this new york bit license which i know comes up a lot when new york politicians are discussing crypto and as i'm sure you're well aware many crypto businesses feel that the new york bit license is unfriendly to innovation do you think there's any way for the controller to bring weight to bear on influencing that regulation in some fashion and if so how would you like to see that changed sure and as you correctly point out you know it's the new york state department of financial services that regulates uh the bit license but the control of new york city especially given that a lot of the you know blockchain businesses would be centered in new york city really push uh the state to move on that and you know it has been onerous for a lot of people you know it cost upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more to get a bit license so it's been limited to no more than like 20 firms have been able to access it and a lot of lawyers end up making a lot of money off of it and a lot of entrepreneurs you know can't innovate as a result and the idea is that we want these businesses to stay in new york and not be going to other places and i would strongly advocate for it and the state did last summer uh you know start something called like a provisional bit license as you probably know right where someone can uh work with an existing a bit licensed company and be able to work in new york state and so i think that they are moving in that direction um but you know there's more work that needs to be done so um as you just mentioned there you know there are a lot of cities around the country that are kind of vying to become the crypto capital of the us if not the world why do you think it's important for a city like new york to be welcoming to the crypto industry and how would you plan to compete with other cities like miami that are also aiming for that title so you know new york has always been the center of financial services right and blockchain is financial technology and i think that we can't lose our ground if this is going to be the industry of the future right and financial services declines then financial technology and blockchain is going to be the way the future goes so i think we need to hold our center of financial services by investing in blockchain and being welcoming to blockchain companies and if you think about you know in the some time in the early mid 90s right you know silicon valley really invested in technology in a way that new york didn't right and then about 15 years later we were trying to attract them to new york city through silicon alley right and then we have now in the last 15 years been like really pushing to try to get the technology firms to come to new york city right so we don't want to be behind we want to be on the forefront and we don't want it to be you know as you know miami has really been um blockchain friendly and you know adopted all the policies that wyoming has and um we don't want we already seen i mean i feel like this past year a lot of new york was moving to miami and we would rather have them stay here and build businesses here so new york is at a pivotal moment in its history as you mentioned it's coming out of the worst pandemic that we've seen in the last century and it's really a pandemic that's hit dense cities like new york that rely on public transportation especially hard what role do you think crypto could play in that recovery so i think one as you as i said you know having the companies come to new york city because we're going to have to re-envision our economy there's going to be a lot of firms that still allow people to work remotely and we're going to have to think about what new companies that would want to come and be in new york city because the foot traffic that we get from people coming in and working is what supports all our restaurants and cafes and a lot of other things in new york city and um i also think that the technology behind crypto and blockchain can be useful in so many things like i talked about the procurement process but we could be looking at it even in helping fix how the mta works you know which is a state agency not a city agency but if we're going to think about transportation all kinds of different types of things that i think that there's future potential for blockchain technology to help improve and can you elaborate on that how would you how would the mta use blockchain technology to solve whatever problems you think it has so i mean i mean i think the problems you know in terms of managing there's huge projects right that they empty all these capital projects that they undertake and a lot of times again it goes back to transparency and trust with the projects right there any mta project that happens there's usually people who think that the costs are too high there's always time delays and how we can use blockchain to make the whole process efficient if we're going to have this happen all the contracting or you know do smart contracts where people get paid when they hit certain milestones and i think things like that will just hold people much more accountable so the primary is june 22nd what is on the docket for you and your campaign between now and then well um you know lots of campaigning is outside meeting people finally because we have been in pandemic so it's been all zoom meetings and um there's also always you know american democracy is expensive and if it was a startup that was some you know people would be shocked by how much it cost to acquire a customer when you're uh you know acquiring a voter and so you know i'm fundraising all the time as well you know so it's out meeting voters getting the word out and it is out pushing ideas and it's out fundraising and um my website is reishma2021.com and you know people have um any suggestions on things i should be looking at um want to know more please visit and actually one thing that i should have checked on your website before um but neglected to do is are you accepting crypto donations because i know in past years there have been other candidates for office who've made headlines by doing so yes and i am not and the reason i'm not is because new york city has very strict campaign finance laws so it's not allowable but it is something that i looked at in the beginning and there are candidates who run for state office or there's a d.a candidate right now running which is not a city office is considered a state office that is accepting crypto oh interesting oh yeah okay and we and just out of curiosity i'm sure it's not like a specific ban on fundraising and crypto it's like can you say what it is yeah so yeah so i mean new york city is campaign finance board is perhaps one of the uh most uh diligent campaign finance was that they really take a look at donations and they really regulate how donations are made for instance you know the limits are up to two thousand dollars is all and you can't take money from corporations and packs you have to take it from individuals and they also match in donations from residents of new york city eight times so any donation between 10 and 250 would get matched eight times by the new york city campaign finance board and the reason why they do that is to make it possible for many more candidates and people who don't come from a lot of money and a lot of resources to be able to run for office but because they do take that step in kind of democratizing the financing of campaigns they also make it very strict you know rules about how you fundraise oh interesting and who you take money from okay okay yeah um you know i have to admit i kind of like that uh in in a city where it feels like the money reigns um supreme all the time well not all the time but you know much of the time um yeah it's a model it's a model in campaign finance around the country because on a national level there's about 132 people who control our democracy in the united states because they're the people who give sixty percent of super pac donations oh i thought you meant the politicians and but you mean the donors that's fascinating yeah well yeah okay well yeah that's quite a statistic all right well thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed this has been really

increase privacy and help scalability whilst also enabling more complex transactions miners who wish to adopt the update can signal support by adding a signal bit in blocks they mine bitcoin magazine reports that nearly half of the network hash rate is currently supporting the update if ninety percent of blocks mined during the next three months include the signal bid the upgrade will be confirmed

recap second fun bits maybe crypto isn't so fun on this week's unchained the pod ended with annabelle huang partner at amber group giving advice for women thinking about going into crypto saying for the women out there who are thinking about this it's not as crazy as you think that's why i had to laugh at a recent thread posted by john sue marketing director at bright loom that certainly pumps the brakes on romanticizing the crypto lifestyle and gives some insight on what actually goes on behind the scenes i recommend the whole thread but i'll end the show with my favorite lamentation regarding poor sleep cycles for crypto founders john writes crypto never sleeps and guess what that also means that you never sleep half your audience is in the west the other half is in the east singapore time is almost entirely during sleeping hours in the u.s have fun with that perhaps going all in on crypto might be as crazy as john depicts but as i can attest leaping into crypto is totally worth it all right thanks for tuning in to learn more about reishma and our campaign for new york city comptroller be sure to check out the links in the show notes follow unchained on twitter
