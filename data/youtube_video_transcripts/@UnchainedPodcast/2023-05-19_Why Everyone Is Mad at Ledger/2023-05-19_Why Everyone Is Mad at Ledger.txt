with the code Laura Link in the description today's guest is Seth for privacy blogger and head of content at Foundation devices welcome Seth for privacy hey Laura thank you so much for uh for having me on I was I was really excited when I got the invite to chat chat with you first time we've really gotten across paths and and chat through all the the craziness of this week so really looking forward to it yeah and nice to connect with you while you're at Bitcoin Miami I um imagine it'll be an interesting conference as usual um and part of the reason might be because this week letter caused quite a Ruckus when it announced its new service although actually I guess they announced it two weeks ago but for some reason it um really made the rounds and caused a lot of consternation on crypto Twitter and the new service is called Ledger recover but before we dive into all the details around the controversy let's just explain what it is that ledger recover does how it works and how this is different from Ledger's previous offerings yeah so I think we need to also clarify something up front in that when we talk about how Ledger recovery works we are trusting Ledger 100 that it works the way that they say it works and that that comes down to it being closed Source in both the server side and the The Ledger side part of things so It's tricky to say for sure exactly how it works uh but the way that it's described is essentially it's a a service that you can pay to know us a month for to help you to be able to recover funds if you lose your Ledger device that all sounds good and fine uh that's not necessarily a terrible concept but the specifics of it are that you give over your ID so a passport driver's license something like that you do a special selfie recording with you um holding up that that ID that you're going to use for the service you give that over to Ledger via a third party called unfeto and once you do that you create an account with Ledger recover essentially what happens is that on your Ledger device you'll be prompted through their Ledger live application you'll be prompted to allow Ledger recover to again theoretically it's close or so don't exactly but you'll allow your ledger to encrypt the seed that's on your Ledger itself into three separate encrypted shards and then your Ledger will send these three shards over USB or Bluetooth to your computer or smartphone I think both will be options and then the app that ledger produces will send those shards to three different custodians one is ledger themselves one is a company called coin cover Global and then the third one was originally named as escrow Tech which is a us-based company but they have since removed any mentions of them from their website so I'm not sure if that custodian's changing at this point but essentially you'll give those shards to the three custodians and then if you lose your Ledger device you'll get a new one you will sign in to Ledger recover you'll do ID verification and then Ledger will somehow send those shards back to your device from the from at least two of the custodians you need two of three and then on your Ledger device those shards will be decrypted your seed phrase will be restored and your funds will back where they are so that's the basics of how it's supposed to work and so what was it that the crypto Community was objecting to when it came to this new offering I think the the two biggest things are that the the general understanding of how Hardware wallets work is that you have a hardware device that has some sort of security Focus whether that's in the actual security model that's taken like being an air gap device or if that's in the hardware itself like using a secure element like Ledger does that that theoretically prevents people from being able to extract private Keys uh or or use malware to steal your funds when you connect to a computer and the the idea that most people have is the hardware wallets have no way to send that seed phrase off of the device so that you can never upload your funds somewhere else on accident you can never make them hot on accident none of that can happen and while in theory that is how things have worked there's always been the possibility that you could install malicious firmware or something that could send the seed phrase off the device especially if it's not an air gap device like Ledger devices aren't air gapped you plug it in via USB or use Bluetooth so it's always been theoretically possible with some sort of malicious firmware but most people's understanding was if you're running official Ledger firmware that Seed where all your funds are stored never leaves the device now with Ledger recover we've learned that in the firmware that you can install on Ledger at least theoretically it's only in the the most recent firmware they've released you can press a few buttons confirm and let you live and send your seed phrase off the device which is uh I think a rightfully terrifying Prospect for many people because they generally do not want the ability to do that much less for it to be a baked in functionality the second main complaint really revolves around the transparency of the whole process because Ledger themselves write closed source code Ledger the operating system that runs on your device uh and the the way that this actual recovery process functions is 100 closed source and so what that means is no one outside of Ledger has any visibility into how it works no security researchers can just spend some free time to dig into it no one can try to to ascertain how exactly this functions what encryption is used if it has protections against sending to anyone but the three custodians that sort of thing as opposed to being something that is free and open source in nature where anyone can quickly look at the code obviously experts you or I maybe aren't going to be diving into the code and finding security vulnerabilities but experts in the field could look at that code could figure out exactly how it works could verify the claims that ledger makes but instead they have all of this code closed Source no one else can see it so we were already trusting Ledger with this this isn't new Ledger has always been a company that usually releases closed Source software for their tools and so there's always been Trust that ledger wouldn't push firmware that could do malicious things or that could exfiltrate your private keys off the device or something like that and I think part of that trust has been broken and now that the firmware explicitly has a function to do that even though in theory it may be secure um and maybe useful in a recovery sense so since it was always possible that they were either doing something malicious or there was some flaw that you know maybe people didn't know about because it was closed source so it's people are only objecting now to the fact that it is closed Source what because this new offering does enable you to send your private key elsewhere is that what you're saying yeah I think so I mean this this risk has always been there and and many of us who are strong Advocates of the free and open source software movement brain Open Source Hardware as well have been I think kind of ringing this Bell for a long time and that if you trust your cryptocurrency keys to a device that is closed source to software that's closed Source you are 100 trusting that entity to not do something malicious you're also trusting that no one else finds a vulnerability that isn't visible because there's no open source code that others are looking at and does some sort of malicious attack against it that's unknown in the wild this has always been possible but I think in reality for most people it doesn't connect until they see a real world way that this type of approach can be problematic and so I think this has kind of brought closed Source into reality for many people in an understanding they're like okay Ledger can do this they actually have done this and I should be concerned now about using something that's closed source and not verifiable and so is the worry that like for instance if you opt not to sign up for that service that somebody could get a hold of your physical device and then send your private keys but but then you'd have to sign up for the service so so like what is the fear about having your keys and frankly if they're split up you know amongst three entities like what is the concern about that yeah I think there's there's a few major fears I think if you're someone who signs up for the service the biggest issues are privacy and data security and that you're giving over all of your identifying information selfies audio video uh and a lot of device information as well when you sign up for this this service and you're directly linking that to the fact that you own cryptocurrency and that you own enough to want a hardware wallet so not only have you probably given over a shipping address to Ledger when you bought the device but now you're giving over all of your ID information as well so there's a large risk of them either eventually being malicious or just law enforcement or governments that are are malicious or tyrannical going to them and forcing them to give over information on on who has cryptocurrency seizing funds something like that another main concern is that if you don't opt into this service uh it now is more easy it's simpler for a malicious attacker to trick you or to trick a loved one family member spouse whatever into approving this service in a malicious way so hopefully the service has been engineered in a way so that on the device it can only send these shards to these three legitimate custodians but it's also possible that there's vulnerability where someone could could send you a prompt with a for instance a malicious version of Ledger live they can send you a prompt to enable Ledger recover maybe your spouse says yeah I'd love to make sure that I don't lose these funds when you're off on a work trip or something and and she goes through and she she signs up for this service but it's actually a malicious entity with a malicious version of Ledger live and you're sending all of these shards to them in an encrypted State it's not something we can verify again so that would be definitely worst case if that's possible outside of that I mean I think for those people who don't sign up for the service it doesn't necessarily pose a risk it just opens up that possibility that there's something going on that that you don't approve of and there's now code running on your device that's explicitly designed to send the private keys off although theoretically in an encrypted fashion okay so in a moment we're going to talk about some of the other concerns about Ledger recovery but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show

dollars in D5 rewards back to my conversation with Seth so one other issue is of course when you give the personal identifying information such as a government issue ID to these different entities we live in a world where there's a lot of people who can use fake material to pretend that they are you um so I saw some tweets about that so what are the fears around the proliferation of fake IDs and how that could um interact with this service I understand the reasoning for blocking recovery behind identification because it is one of the harder things to fake it's certainly harder than just like username and password from what it seems there will be a username password and ID verification but username and password are very easily Brute Force most people use very simple passwords socially engineered there's a lot of very easy ways to get access to someone's account from just username and password so the identification angle makes sense from adding complexity but the downsides are twofold and that one like we talked about a little bit earlier now you're trusting a third party and all of their authorized third parties which is the language that they use in their privacy policy to retain that information securely so if on Fido was ever hacked the ID information for every person who uses Ledger recover could now be available for purchase and ID verification either uh fake ID verification or legitimate ID verification with stolen credentials has long been a service that's very easy to purchase uh on on darknet Market it's in other places so it's not like this kind of thing doesn't exist this does exist now and constantly happens a lot of centralized Exchange accounts are actually opened using malicious fake identity verification or identity identity that's been stolen from someone and used to sign up for an account so that they can do whatever they want to do at that point um so the fear now is that all of your funds are not secured by the hardware wallet that you have in your in your drawer or on your office desk but in fact anyone who has the ability to pass identity verification as you which is not impossible for sure could now recover all of your funds themselves without needing access to your physical device which is a huge shift in the security model from what people usually are used to with a hardware wallet which is a big deal I think that's sparking a lot of the the controversy around it and I feel like some of this criticism in a way also came up because of Ledger's own track record on security it was certainly something that I saw cited and some of other tweets on this so describe what the issues were there yeah so a few years ago I can't remember exactly what year it was I think it was 2018. um Ledger had a massive data breach where information on people who had purchased ledgers was stolen and that information included full personal names full shipping addresses uh information on the credit card they used things like that so we already have a track record of Ledger having problems securing data and that's not even necessarily as a Slam against Ledger this is the hardest problem to solve for large corporations today cyber security is extremely complex very hard to implement and the larger your company gets the harder it gets but they have a track record of having problems with that now we're trusting Ledger themselves as a custodian in The Ledger recovery service so if you use this service they hold one of the encrypted shards you're also trusting them to not ship malicious software whether intentionally which I think is very unlikely because obviously they have Financial incentives to keep their customers happy and ships off software that works and that's what it's supposed to but it's possible that someone could hack in and release malicious binaries malicious installation packages that you can use to install Ledger live or firmware or something under their accounts that's another possibility of how that could happen um but the other the the third main concern I think is that while they don't have the ID information themselves it appears it's a bit unclear exactly how the relationship between Ledger and on Fido works but they likely don't have the identity information themselves they do have all the information on who uses the service what Ledger devices they have their IP address which is likely their home IP address full name that kind of thing to go along with the fact that they use a ledger that they own cryptocurrency and now that they use The Ledger recovery service or not so it continues to open up more potential attack vectors uh for people to to try and steal your funds from your Ledger and it trusts yet another entity um and the unfortunate thing with privacy policies and the the Privacy practices of companies like Ledger and other large companies is that it's very unclear who exactly has access to this data Ledger uses the the term authorized third parties in their own blog post so it's unclear who exactly will get access to the information about your identity about your usage of Ledger recover uh and on Fido does the same thing where they they have a long long long list of information they collect about you not just your identity information and then they also have authorized third parties we have no idea who that data is being shared with who could sell that who could steal that who could get hacked and have that data leaked and then if your identity information and the fact that you use Ledger recover is leaked all of your funds could be stolen at that point which is a huge deal when your Ledger device could be sitting safe at home in a drawer untouched uh you didn't install malware you didn't do anything wrong and yet your funds could be stolen and that certainly is worst case scenario but it's a possibility that it gets opened up with this type of approach so one counter factual thread that I saw was by haseeb caressio dragonfly and he talked about how initially he also agreed that this was a bad offering um for them to introduce but then he realized it was based on certain misperceptions around how Ledger worked he was saying that he thought initially that it would just hold your keys and the keys would never leave now when he realized oh your device can be upgraded that that would introduce the possibility for potentially like bad bad things to happen like you know some new thing that uh takes her private key but then he realized that actually this isn't how ledgers have worked all along that they've always been upgradable because they're always adding new blockchains and things like that and so he actually concluded that this was totally fine like you've always trusted Ledger and you know you only have to trust them at that one point in time you never have to do the upgrade you know if for whatever reason you're not comfortable upgrading the soft where you could always just get a new like toss out your old device and get a new device with the new software um so what is your take on his uh thread there yeah I mean the the core of his argument is is sound I mean as we mentioned a bit today all of this has been possible it's closed Source you've been trusting Ledger when you install firmware updates that they're not including code that does this or or something else malicious for all we know the code to actually handle Ledger recover has been in there for a long time and has just been activated with this latest release there's no way that we can verify whether or not this type of thing has been possible before or on your device the main pushback I would have against his argument is that it's not just find that this is possible if you understand the risks and if you understand the trade-offs of trusting a third-party explicitly with the security of your funds and trusting them explicitly to do the right thing forever and trusting them explicitly to not have any sort of malicious firmware pushed or anything like that then yes that I mean life just goes on for you the whole point of these things being built the whole point of Bitcoin the whole point of these cryptocurrencies is that we can remove trusted third parties that we can remove custodians we can remove people who have control over our money and so when we introduce someone like Ledger as a trusted third party and that they could do anything with your private key you have no visibility into that any firmware update could do literally anything it introduces back a lot of the problems that we're trying to escape from here um so while he's right that this could always have been done I think that should frighten people even more than than put them at ease because it means that that they have always put explicit trust in Ledger that maybe they didn't understand and I think one of the the big positive points of this whole situation is that it really is kind of shaking people awake to the the risks of closed Source software and Hardware because it is an explicit trust that you're having to place in them rather having the ability to verify it whether than rather than having the ability for third parties to go in and check what's happening so while it is technically true it could have always been done that doesn't mean it's a good thing that just means nothing has changed explicitly here except that now we know that there is code running on running on the device that can do things that many people don't want their Hardware wallet to be able to do so The Ledger CTO Pascal Gautier disputed that this is not what people want and he said I think this might have been on a Twitter spaces that they held he said you're saying this is not what customers want actually this is what future customers want I was curious for your response to that I probably agree with him uh if you are purely seeking profit over principles I think this move makes sense most of the people who don't actually see the need to remove trusted third parties who don't really care about the the broader ethos that is behind a lot of the cryptocurrency movement and the free and open source movement uh would be happy to have a service that makes sure that they can't lose their funds um whether that implies complete trust in a third party or not there's not a concern for many people because they don't understand the risks that are inherent until something goes wrong so I'm sure that there is plenty of money to be made providing a service like this whether or not it's a net good for society I think is a harder thing and more of a philosophical debate on whether or not helping people to custody Bitcoin with trusted third parties and closed source code is actually a step forward or backwards from the the systems that we have right now but I I'm sure that there is a large percentage of profit that they can gain by implementing a service like this whether or not it's good well done open source anything like that so I don't disagree that there are definitely people out there who want a service like this it's just sad to me that the way that this is being implemented by the largest company in this space is in my opinion very dangerous especially with the aspect of the the kyc the know your customer ID information that's a part of using the service in any way not to mention well I think a lot of the people who have been kind of hyping up this thing and this need for easier custody Solutions are usually talking about like the global South and a lot of the the world that doesn't have access to these types of tools that doesn't have the the easy self-custody tools and that we need to improve things there but this actually restricts many of those people from being able to use a service like this if you have to give over ID that's not an option in much of the global South whether they have an ID or not whether they have the ability to up to upload it there are a lot of restrictions there so it it further restricts who can gain self-custody in this manner if you can't even really call this self-custody it brings brings so many potential flaws and dangers that we will see something bad happen around Ledger recover I think it's only a matter of time until something goes wrong and more people will wake up to the risks here when that does happen but one thing that I'm thankful for is a platform like this uh my tweet thread the ability to help people to see the issues now and make a decision if they're fine with the trade-offs here and they have no problem with it at least they knew going in what the trade-offs and issues were with it but hopefully it'll also help people to see that that there are some some major major risks and issues here and hopefully people will opt not to do a service like this but obviously there's always freedom of choice and I'm not against I'm not for forcing people to do one thing or another I just want to make sure that people have the the truth going into decisions like this yeah I think one thing that's clear is so far there's no one perfect way to store or secure your coins it feels like every option has some trade-offs and I do agree that there are certain aspects of this service that probably go against the ethos of kind of the more Cypher Punk sectors of the crypto Community which is why I think it did cause the Uproar that it did um well anyway it has been um very fascinating unpacking this whole incident with you thank you so much for coming on Unchained yeah awesome thank you so much Laura it was a great chance to get to chat through this and I'm glad we were able to finally chat and meet a little bit so thank you for having me on excited to to see this shared out

current leadership claims that the funds used in this deal were illicitly drawn from FTX customers additional suits have been launched against embed's founder and former CEO Michael Giles and the early investors who sold their Stakes such as Propel Venture Partners notably the case argues that ftx's bankruptcy representatives were swindled into a quote terrible deal due to the overvaluation of

Unchained has thoughts about how Sam Altman of openai is returning to crypto and worldcoin Oakland AI founder Sam Altman is now turning his attention towards crypto which I guess makes sense because AI can kind of manage itself now like how you get back into gardening after your kids go to college he's close to raising 100 million dollars which he clarified is in Fiat for worldcoin's new minimalist wallet worldcoin isn't new it got big last year with a crypto version of a universal basic income like a crypto token to be distributed equally to everyone in the world I think this sounds totally easy we just need to choose one of the coins whose value is zero and there are a lot to choose from there were a lot of issues with worldcoin's initial rollout last year but now it's back with a wallet that includes a global identification system basically it scans your irises to prove that you're a human and I cannot wait to make all of my exes try it gold coin's first round of funding
