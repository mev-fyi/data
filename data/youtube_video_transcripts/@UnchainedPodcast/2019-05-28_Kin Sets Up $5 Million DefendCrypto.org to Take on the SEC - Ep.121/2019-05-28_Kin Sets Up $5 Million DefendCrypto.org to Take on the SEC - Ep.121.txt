welcome Ted and Patrick good to be here Thank You Laura I think this is a first for the podcast but we are announcing news today on the show Ted why don't you tell everyone Kix plans yeah so first off thanks Ward for having us so just a bit of background we've been in the crypto industry for quite some time now we launched our own cryptocurrency kin back in 2017 the Kaneko system continues to grow there's over 40 apps where you can earn and spend kin live today and in the last month over a million people have earned kin and over 300,000 people have spent Kent making kin were the most used crypto currencies in the world so that's been great that's been really exciting but the continued challenge for us has been the lack of clarity on the regulatory side and so over the last year and a half we've also been working with the SEC you know they first reached out to us three days after our token sale then and they started to ask us for some comments and some meetings and then you know some subpoenas and then formal testimony and just trying to work with them to understand crypto to create that clear guidance we all need and after spending 18 months and over five million dollars trying to work with them I just continue to be super frustrated a bit the lack of clarity and so you know it's recently felt important to us and not just for us but for the whole industry like we need clarity here because this is really starting to hurt our business and so we've put together defend crypto org and what that is is it's saying the only way we're going to get clarity is if somebody goes to court and so we are prepared to do that you know we need a new how we test and that new how we test is going to come from a ruling in a core case we have great facts we have great circumstances we have a great team great lawyers and so we're in a unique position to create this clarity not just for us but for everybody else and so we've created an account with co-invest custody to make sure the funds are available to because these things are expensive and we put five million dollars of Bitcoin ether and kin into that coinbase custody account but we've also opened up contributions for any other project or in a individual who's frustrated with the current status of clarity in the regulation to contribute alongside to make sure there's the funding there to create the clarity we all need and so the way you phrase that it wasn't totally clear to me do you definitely intend to take your case to court we hope so we hope so so you know the way this works is the SEC would take us to court and they haven't done that yet they haven't decided to make a recommendation to our knowledge that they would recommend to commission to authorize a case against us so that hasn't happened yet but at this point we hope it does because it's become clear that that is the only way we're going to get the clarity we need and okay so something that I need to understand is essentially they notified you that you that they intended to take an enforcement action against you you wrote this Wells response back to them and actually publicized it which as far as I understand is pretty unusual and you know kind of indicates that the discussions weren't necessarily going well and so I believe that there was a deadline last week or sometime in the last couple weeks where the SEC needed to take a vote about whether or not they would pursue an enforcement action against you and have you heard of the outcome of that decision or if they've taken a decision we have not but maybe Patrick I'll turn it over to you sure Laura you're correct the SEC sent the company what's called the wels notice which is a notice the staff intends to recommend to the Commission itself that the Commission approved the filing of an enforcement action the the response that we filed that you've alluded to is our wealth response and there is a presumptive time frame after the SEC serves the wells know this of six months within which the Commission is supposed to make a decision as to whether or not to bring an enforcement action that deadline can be extended internally at the SEC and often is and so we don't read too much into the fact that they haven't filed an action yet they could they they very likely extended that deadline and are still in the process of going to the Commission to get permission to file an action and so in this case where you know they have done a number of enforcement actions and essentially the ICO issuers that they were taking the actions against agreed to the terms but essentially you know I think what you're saying is you're not agreeing then is that the only course of action at that point is that then they would take you to court or how would it end up that they would end up suing you that's correct the the settlements that they've announced so far have been actions where the the SEC has threatened to file an enforcement action against a token seller and rather than litigate with the SEC the seller has decided to settle the case and so the SEC simultaneously files a case as well as the settlement and they don't actually litigate any disputed issue so that's that's exactly what Tent means when he says we need clarity from a court decision if the SEC files an action against kick or the foundation we intend to find it and litigate it and ask a court to decide whether or not the the sale of kin tokens amounts to an investment contract or security okay and so let's now talk about what it is that you hope for from such a case you mentioned that you hope that there would be kind of a new Howey test and for listeners you don't know we'll just review what how it what the hell is is and why it's important for crypto but essentially this test is what has been used so far to determine whether or not tokens would be considered securities and so in order for a token to be considered a security it has to be and they're essentially four prongs that this Howey test and you have to meet all four prongs so that would be that the token has to be one an investment of money in to a common enterprise and three with an expectation of profits for dependent on the efforts of others and so Ted and Patrick when you say that you are or at least the defined crypto website sees that your case will hopefully set a precedent that could serve as a new how a test for cryptocurrencies as far as I understand these kinds of new laws end up taking years what you know to go through the higher courts which are the ones as far as I understand that end up do create these types of laws so how would a new law years from now help the industry which moves much much faster than that Patrick do you want to talk about timing sure Laurie you're correct that the the the court process can take a number of years to work through a case and then even after something that's resolved at the trial level there can be appealed so there's no question that this process will take some time but in the absence of the SEC giving appropriate and clear guidance itself this is really the only option so it's a fair question and I think we certainly would have preferred for the SEC to have laid out clear guidelines and guidelines that are consistent with the limits of their statutory authority they haven't done that and so this is really the only way we can see to get to that clarity and to get to the right result but he will take some time and so let's actually also then just dive a little bit more into what exactly it was that the SEC took issue with what was their exact reasoning for bringing the enforcement action was it about the sale itself or was it that they believed that kin is currently a security meaning that it has not become decentralized like ether which the SEC has implied was the security at the time of its sale that's a good question the SEC hasn't been crystal clear with us about exactly what it is they think is a violation and what it is they would include in an enforcement action I think we know for sure that the SEC staff at least believes that the sale of kin initially in 2017 involved an offer or sale of securities under the Securities Act of 1933 we disagree with that but we we know that's part of their theory it's not clear to us whether they are also going to take the position that later transactions or transfers of kin are covered by the Securities Act so we don't know for sure well that's interesting how did it how did it get that I mean you guys were talking for more than a year so how how is it that you actually don't know what they take issue with also a very good question there's no way for us to force them in this process to lay out in detail what they intend to do an enforcement action we can ask but we can't force them to tell us and and maybe a back up just a little bit so the welds notice is supposed to give notice to the person on the receiving end of action that the SEC staff is proposing to take in practice what they only do is send you a letter and says the staff believes has been a violation of section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 they don't lay out or articulate in any detail what their theory is and so we've had some conversations with them where they've described their theory at some level but not in very detail and we unfortunately don't have any way to force them to lay it out for us and then we detail like when we've we've we've noted that in discussions with the SEC and we've asked for a more explicit description of everything they would include an enforcement action they have declined to give us that level of detail that's been part of the frustration with this whole process is you know even behind closed doors it's hard to know exactly what they're saying or exactly what they want so you're sort of guessing a little bit when you look at the other settlements they've done the part that concerns us the most is that in every case the projects have said and yes it was and is and will be a security and for us you know a currency that's being used by hundreds of thousands of people in dozens of apps that would just be a complete deal-breaker you know if the only way you could buy something from the Apple AppStore was to first go after your broker dealer and buy a share of Apple's stock then obviously nobody would do that and so that's the part that we have the most trouble with is you know if this were a security it just simply would not work and that's why the 19th three Securities Exchange Act explicitly excludes currencies from the definition of securities because otherwise they're just be way too much friction and they wouldn't work but wait so you are in a way I think jumping a couple steps because if you don't even know whether or not the enforcement action is around the sale itself or around the current status of kin then how do you know that whatever the enforcement action is what results in your users having to treat every single transaction of kin like a stock sale or purchase or whatever yeah we know for sure that if they bring an enforcement action it will raise the question of whether the initial sale of kin in 2017 involved an offer or sale of the securities so we know that we will resolve that question and that has been one of the key questions that has I think slowed down or stopped the number of projects in the US or has caused them to go overseas so I'm quite sure that an enforcement action would resolve that question of the of the initial sale it's true that we can't force them to also bring a claim asking whether more recent or current transactions and can involve offers or sales of securities although I think if they were to file an enforcement action the server claims based on the 2017 sales but didn't try to assert enforcement jurisdiction over transactions that are happening today I think that would be a very telling an important signal because I think the reason they wouldn't bring that claim is if they didn't think they could win it and I think it's also important that you know we've asked this question in our discussions you know hey look at kin today look at all the usage it has can you at least confirm that that is not a security that those are not security transactions and they have been unwilling to do that I mean okay yeah I mean but this is a yeah I I didn't realize that you didn't even know what they were gonna bring the enforcement action for and so then presumably you also don't know what they would ask you to agree to you're just going off the previous settlements where the issuer's did agree to classify their tokens as securities and therefore do you know the the proper I'm not sure if it's yearly or quarterly or whatever filings that they have to do but they did agree to that so so you're just assuming that they would offer you similar terms is that is that why you've decided that if it comes to that then then you'll fight this that's not quite right and I should say as a general matter lawyers we don't get into discussions about some of my conversations and so I'm gonna I'm gonna try to respect that we have had discussions with the SEC we have tried to find a resolution we sent that in our wells response so that's not reviewing anything that isn't already public so we haven't had specific conversations with them and we have been unable to get to a resolution that would permit the the ecosystem to continue I think you could look at the other settlements they have done to get a sense of what kinds of things they are demanding that that make it impossible but we've definitely had discussions with them and we have not been able to get them to a resolution that would allow the project of the ecosystem to contain all right so now let's talk about the main points you would argue in court about why they can token sale should not be considered as securities offering I think Ted has actually gotten into some of these a little bit but why don't you go ahead and just lay out you know top line what would be the main points you would argue in your favor mm-hmm so maybe maybe just we can go into the specific points in a moment but I think it might be helpful to come back to you know what the hell test actually is like everybody hears about it they read about it they see the four prongs but what actually happened what actually happened is this gentleman William John Howie owned a bunch of orange groves in the 1930s and he broke up all those orange rows in two plots and he offered the plots for sale but when buyers would come he said not only you can buy the plot but what I'll do for you is I will farm your plot I'll then take those oranges I'll bring them to market I'll sell them I'll get the money from that and then I'll bring come back and I'll give you the money and you know the investors going wow that sounds that sounds great like how much money do you think I'm gonna make and how we said oh I you know last year we made 20% profit so I think you can expect at least that but you know we think next year it could be even more and the investor said wow that sounds great like but how do I know if I give you this money that you're going to come back and give me the profits and Howie said I know what we'll do we'll sign an investment contract we'll sign a contract that says you give me the money I'll go ahead I'll do all this and I'll come back and I'll give you the profits that is what the Howie test is and that's that makes sense now the investor and how we are in business together that's not what we did you know instead imagine how he had said listen I have a bunch of land you can come in you can buy some of it from me and I'm not gonna farm it for you I'm not gonna sell oranges for you it's your land I hand you the keys and that's it we're not going to sign on contract and we're not going to be in business together and so the investor says hmm maybe I'll buy it because you know what maybe the area will become more valuable in the future and I'll be able to sell my land to somebody else for a profit and Howie says you know what I don't know if you will or you won't I don't know if you make a profit but I know one thing for sure you won't get a dollar of profits from me that's what we did and so I think it's very important you know the Howey test or it gets pulled apart to understand what actually happened the investors and Howie were getting in together but that's not what's happening in crypto networks and that's why when the Dow report came out in 2017 the guidance on that we were really excited because before that they hadn't they hadn't given guide and said the Howey test was the right test but once they did for us it was clear that well then obviously these things are not securities and so I think that's been a big challenge you know walking that back and now we have all these extra factors we have to consider that's been the big frustration so the one thing I would say because I did notice that a big part of your Wells response kind of indicates that or claims that you guys thought that oh it was so clear that these were not securities offerings but surely you must have known that pretty much from the beginning like every team has done and ICO has known they might run afoul of securities law like if we look at the very first ICO master coin junior Willett the guy behind that was told by numerous people he ran that risk the etherium team when they did their as token sale they were super concerned and delayed their sale for months getting that all buttoned up back in 2016 when the ICO wave started I would often ask teams if they were trying to skirt securities law the you know July 2017 Dow report indicated that that Dow tokens were securities so this was like a known issue so why did you not check with the SEC first of all - you have to consider the SE C's normal process for that sort of thing it is is very difficult and it takes a very very very long time for the SEC to give that kind of forward-looking advice usually in the form of a no action letter I mean here we are in 2019 and they have only just recently released what I think is the very first no action letter relating to a cryptocurrency and that matter has been pending for well over a year so it's not practicable in a in a business that's moving as quickly as this business was in 2016 2017 to go and ask the SEC for a no action letter like that because the process just takes too long and in a situation where in our view it's quite clear that what we were doing is outside the scope of the SE C's authority we don't generally think we have to go and ask the SE C's permission to engage in business activity that is outside the scope of their authority they are in the context of crypto currencies have been mapping out a extremely expansive and extremely aggressive view of the scope of their own authority and and the the scope that they have mapped out is frankly much broader than I think people expected it to be when when all of these token offerings took place I mean so when I asked ed about the main points you intend to argue and point in court you instead you know kind of talks a little bit about how we how they act you know the actual Howey case is actually quite different from the way crypto tokens work so why don't we again now talk about what main points you want to argue in court sure and I think the keeping in mind the facts of how he is an important way to remember sort of what the test is supposed to illuminate but I understand the question so we have a number of points of difference with the Commission as as ten already mentioned we believe that ken is a currency which is specifically excluded from the definition of security so that's one point totally separately from that though we also think that the circumstances around the offering and sale of kin do not meet the requirements of the Howey test for an investment contract and I think it's worth just briefly noting that the question here is not whether the tokens themselves are a security the tokens themselves are clearly not a security and and the only angle the SEC has laid out for regulating offers and sales of tokens is not on the ground of things themselves our security but rather that the circumstances surrounding the offering or sale of a particular token creates an investment contract and how we test is designed to tease out whether or not those circumstances have have created an investment contract I think that perspective is important and you've correctly identified the four elements and we disagree with the SEC on a number of them starting with common enterprise and this Ted was describing how we test he used the kind of the plain language of whether people are getting into business together I would say the the more technical legal way of putting that is there are lots of cases that say where someone sells an asset to another person and it's a simple transfer you give me money I give you this asset and there's no ongoing promises or obligations that is not a common enterprise it doesn't support the the notion of an investment contract is just a sale of an asset so we think that's that's one reason why there's no investment contract here another reason here is there's no expectation of profits here the SEC has spent a lot of time talking about the subjective expectations or desires of people purchasing tokens if you go look at the summon orders that they have written up they focus very heavily on the subjective intent of purchases we don't think that's the right way to test for an investment contract under Howie under Howie the test should be what were purchasers lend to expect meaning what were they offered or promised what did the seller say that would support the creation of an investment contract that would lead people to expect profits from the efforts of another so it should be looking objectively at what was said by the seller to ask whether the seller was promising people profits based on the efforts of another we don't think that's what happened here we don't think that kick was offering people the chance to buy a token to make a profit from someone else's efforts if you look at the totality of what kick was saying about kin what they were proposing and what they were offering was a digital currency for use in a new digital economy a new way for people to buy itself digital products and services they were not telling people by this token and you can make money based on my work that's that's where Ted's comparisons to the fact that how the case I think is quite powerful so we don't think people were led to expect profits and we don't think people were led to expect profits from the efforts of another there are many cases where sale of an asset whose value will increase or decrease based on market effects supply and demand that does not equal expectation of profits from the efforts of another it's just that you will profit or lose based on market movements that's the case here price of kin increases or decreases based on market forces supply and demand not based on kick going out and running a business that generates profits that are going to be shared with people who own the toughens again the contrast with with the Howey case I think is quite powerful so those are the main points that we intend to argue in the case and that we've laid out in the walls response one other thing that I want to highlight also is you know about this argument that people are using this you know that it's not just an investment that this has utility that it's used as a medium of exchange is you also previously had kick points which was sort of like a centralized currency and that had as far as I can tell from you know what you've said about this had sort of successfully demonstrated that a currency makes sense for your system that it would be embraced by your users and so the other thing that I want to highlight about that is that another argument that I think you've made is that your idea to have this currency is as a new business model something that would kind of align with your values better and enable you to not have to rely on the advertising based model of revenue that a lot of these other social media companies use and I'm just wondering now do you feel like the fact that general public opinion has sort of swung against that business model will help your case and is that something you intend to play up sorry what I'm not sure I understand the question what do you mean by public opinion has swung against oh I mean you know just look at how Facebook sort of in the doghouse right now and everybody is you know the GBP are I think everybody's against having their data being used and and having their selves manipulated totally I think you know we have 40 developers in the ecosystem now it's growing some of the largest communities in the world beauty communities comedy communities chat communities people are really excited about this you know for a long time as a consumer developer there was no good way to make money the only way was with advertising and advertising what's monopolized by a few big companies making it very difficult for kik and thousands of other developers to monetize their creation so the idea that there's now a new fundamentally different business model a way where as a developer you can make money but not only make money but do it in a way that's great for your users and then also do it as part of this bigger team all these developers coming together and competing as one has been very exciting for a lot of developers out there so I think it's been a huge benefit you know the world is realizing just how much power these big centralized companies have and how dangerous that is for the future of society another thing that I find surprising about the fact that the SEC was planning an enforcement action against you is that it has become clear that they consider whether or not that the network was functional on day one to be an important factor in determining whether or not the token would be considered as security so I know you guys delayed launching your network three times in order to make them functional on day one so did that come up at all in your conversation with them it did I think that's another area where the SE C's approach to this thing frankly surprised a lot of people who had spent a lot of time thinking about these issues before the SEC started speaking I think that the the SEC as a general matter has set a very very very high bar for what they would consider utility or functionality much higher I think than people expected going in and now having said that they also have not drawn a very clear line I don't I don't think anybody can really say with certainty where that line is drawn all the assent is that they think etherium and bitcoin are sufficiently descent for decentralized and functional but they haven't really said where that line is drawn and everything else that they've spoken to they said is not sufficiently functional or or decentralized so yes it's come up I think that is one area where they set the bar in the wrong place frankly so essentially it sort of sounds like even though you have the network functional from day one that wasn't enough for them and so maybe people have been reading that the tea leaves incorrectly that they are oh oh interesting so you have to set their class of arguments where you're arguing that kin is a currency and therefore not a security and this kind of goes into some of the definitions in various laws and stuff can you explain that for readers who don't have a legal background sure court listeners sure I'll do my best so the the there are two main statutes that regulate securities and securities transactions in the United States they are the Securities Act of 1933 the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 each of them has its own definition of what is a security and therefore what's regulated by the Act and in each case there's a there's a very long list of things that the statute says are a security and then in each case there are provisions that say you know what's not a security and courts have said over the years that the definition of a security under these two separate acts the 33 act and the 34 act are basically the same and so you know it should be the case that something either is or is not a security for purposes of both statutes so what we've pointed out in our well submission is that the 33 Act which is the statute that we're talking about here that requires offers and sales and securities to be registered unless they come within some exemption it doesn't list currency has one of the things that is a security the 1934 Act which has essentially the same definition of a security actually specifically says that something that is a currency is not a security Tazz carved out or exempted from the definition of a security and there's nothing in the securities laws either the 33 act or the 34 act that tells you that currency for that purpose has to be a government-issued or government-backed security it just uses the word currency and the ordinary definition of currency is a something that's used as a medium of exchange which we think is described in precisely and we think we fall within that exemption all right so we're gonna discuss the factors less favorable to kicks and kins side after this break but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors did you know that if money-laundering were an economy its GDP would be the size of Canada's large volumes of tainted crypto assets move through financial networks often below the radar of banks cyber criminals use unregulated crypto exchanges to avoid detection no wonder governments around the world are rolling out tough new anti money laundering laws for crypto currencies complying with those laws isn't easy banks and exchanges need the best cryptocurrency intelligence available

which are very good but there's of course the other side and you know I know you don't know exactly what it is that the SEC is taking issue with but there's general knowledge around kind of what you know what their concerns are and as people probably know Kathryn Hahn the GP of a 16 Z crypto who's a former federal prosecutor she wrote a blog post about this and in her blog post she actually was talking about how during her time as a law clerk she clerked for a Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and I also when I read this I was like I totally know what she's talking about that's talking about because this I know from being a journalist where you can hear one side and think oh wow the other side has got nothing or you know they're dirty bastards or whatever you think and then you or talk to the other side and you think oh man the first side is toast or they're totally duplicitous or you know whatever so well I I actually don't know that as he sees reasoning for wanting to bring an enforcement action against you I did reach out to them but haven't heard back if if they do respond to me before publication of this podcast I will update the episode however I can at least look at your Wells response and some of the other evidence and see what the weak points are and so what Katie noted in her post and a lot of the evidence shows that purchasers did seem to by kin for usage purposes however she says quote that won't matter as much as the evidence around kik what kik led purchasers to expect and this has to do with that certain fourth prongs you know that there was an expectation of profits dependent on the effort of others and as you know there has been a lot of references to a video of Ted at the San Francisco Bitcoin meet up in June 2017 and at one point in the video Ted you say quote by setting aside 30 percent of the Kin tokens for ourselves if kin were as popular as ether is today that would that 30 percent would be worth 9 billion dollars that's awesome we'd give some back to investors you invested 50 million maybe we'll give you five hundred million out of that 9 billion slightly later in the video you say quote maybe developers the can they get rewarded and they will hold on to them actually that's one of the things you can become a stakeholder you can share in the economic upside in the creation of this ecosystem and then from the same video video you said quote we are using kick to boost the value of kin and in the kin white paper you guys wrote quote to establish an economy around the new currency kick must help to establish kins fundamental value so just here in you know multiple verbal and written quotes we see that kick was indicating that profits could be expected and that kick would be the entity that would make that happen what's your response to that I think that's a great question Laura you know I went back him and when it came out and watched that video again and I think the context here is really important you know what I was explaining in in that Meetup and in other many other places is just simply how crypto economics work you know why does Bitcoin work well Bitcoin works because you can guarantee the scarcity of a digital asset so supply is fixed so if demand goes up and the value will go up so this is almost like explaining the law of gravity I'm just explaining what the innovation is that makes this so exciting and so really what the price of any of these assets is worth is just a function of demand how many people want it how many people are buying it because they want it and so when I talk about kick I talked about kick can be part of creating that initial demand you know kicks users will want to use kin like they use kick points and just a statement of fact but in the in the same video there I also make it clear that one you know somebody says well can you guarantee the price we can no I absolutely cannot guarantee the price of kin you know if if nobody wants it then demand will go down when the price will go down and I also said if only kick were to adopt can then it should also be worth zero because at any point kicked it could decide to no longer integrate kin into their app so that's where I made it clear that you know nobody's guaranteeing the value of this the value is purely a function of demand and demand will only come and grow if it's a whole ecosystem of developers that form around it now some people could bike in because they want to use that ecosystem some people could use kin because they wanted to integrate it into their apps some people could use kin because they hoped it would become more valuable but that does not make it a security that does not mean we are in business together it just simply means we own a similar asset no different than you and I owning a house in the same neighborhood another point is that it seems as if from the start the Kin foundation was in control of kick art sort of of kin and in your white paper you're saying things like over time kick will work to structure and form the kin foundation and then you go on to describe the responsibilities of the kin foundation which would be to manage the supply of kin and distribute the tokens and that it will help other service to start using kin and you conclude quote ultimately the kin foundation will facilitate the entire ecosystems transition to a fully decentralized an autonomous network so if kick is the one that's creating the kin foundation and setting its goals then it sort of seems like that two entities aren't super separated and then on top of that the two entities together control what would be 90% of the tokens because you salt you it you created 10 trillion you sold one trillion kick kept 3 trillion and the kin foundation kept six trillion so even assuming that the SEC would agree with you that kick and kin were separate entities how could the network be considered too centralized if two entities hold 90% of the tokens I think that the ownership of the tokens is fundamentally different from control over the network for one thing and the the kin token right now is operating on a network with a number of independent nodes and neither kick nor the foundation has control over that network in the sense that either one of them would be able to decide to make changes to the way the network works and in fact other node operators completely independent of kick and the foundation could if they got together and voted they could make changes even over kick set or the foundations objection so the fact that kick and the foundation own a large number of tokens does not give them control of the network more importantly from my perspective for curb the Howey test the question is whether people were led to expect profits from the managerial or entrepreneurial efforts of another and so the question has to be assuming someone was led to expect profits and we don't think that were but even if you assume that you have to look at what's the what is the conduct or the activity that is expected to lead to profits and the kind of infrastructure work that kicked and the foundation have had done is not the effort that's going to lead to profits because it's not going to affect the value of the token the value of the token is going to be affected by large numbers of independent actors offering products and services that people want in exchange for ken and kick alone can't do that and isn't proposing to do that I've never told people that it would the the language that they attend and kick used in describing kicks anticipated role in any ecosystem was a participant not a landlord and I think that captures it very well and so it is not from kicks entrepreneurial or managerial efforts that profits are going to come and to get even more granular a lot of people who are buying and selling ken are developers who are buying and selling it to use it within their business and and they're gonna make money not by just holding Ken and waiting for value to increase they're gonna make money by offering products and services that people want in exchange for Ken and then they will exchange Ken for dollars or some other currency that they were used to pay their expenses or earn their salary or whatever that has nothing to do it with any efforts by kick or the foundation so I think that the key is to focus on what is the activity that is going to or might lead to people profiting and is that within the control of tip or the foundation and it's not in our view but to go back to your earlier point about control the network as we know there have been a number of technical changes that happened with the network where for instance the Kin blockchain started on aetherium then it was using both aetherium and stellar and now it's on a private Fork of the stellar blockchain and every time one of these announcements was made about this move as far as I can tell it was kicked that was the entity that decided that you know these just you know all these decisions so in that sense you know it's quite different from the etherium heart fork where there was this very public decision of where for a while it wasn't clear how it was gonna go and the community members were weighing in and all these different venues and then there were these carbon votes and you know it was like all these other actors were engaged and there was even I looked I saw this article from last December on next web where it said that kick kick was choosing the validators for the blockchain it was creating this federated blockchain so in that sense it really does feel like kick has been the one that's been controlling them the network there's no doubt that the the network has evolved over time and there's no doubt that kick and the foundation have done early work to get the network launched and underway but that's why I keep hammering on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts as contrasted with someone who creates you know an infrastructure I mean it could imagine someone who builds a marketplace and invites all kinds of other people into the marketplace to come in and offer their products for sale we don't think that that kind of infrastructure building which itself does not lead to profit is is entrepreneurial or managerial within the meaning of the Howey test there are cases out there including one we've cited in our in our wealth response dealing with someone who created a ticket exchange and and that entity had complete control over the the infrastructure of the network the exchange itself but because people we're going to make money by making their own decisions about buying and selling tickets it was not deemed to be an investment contract we think very similar circumstances exist here kicks and the Kim Foundation's efforts to to get the network up and running are not profit generating entrepreneurial or managerial efforts that said it has evolved over time to where I think it is now quite decentralized and so even without regard to all the other factors where we are now is a situation that we think is is decentralized and it's not within kicks or the Foundation's control one other question I wanted to ask about the expectation of profits was that just before your IC o---- you also had a pre-sale that raised 50 million dollars from a venture capital firms like blockchain capital pantera capital and poly chain capital so if the Kin tokens were not an investment why were these VCS buying these tokens during the pre-sale I think what's important is we weren't selling them kin we were selling them a future right to acquire kin and so in that case out of the you know the abundance of caution it made sense to and do that as a securities offering but that doesn't make in itself a security when we look at a can again we come back to the Howie test it's it's like the land and you know there's a community there and all sorts of people are showing up because I think it's gonna be great community at this point we have over 40 independent companies who've all join the community have a piece of land and are improving their piece of land and that's improving the whole area and so some people are buying land to come use it come visit it and then some people are buying land because wow this is becoming a great neighborhood but again that doesn't make it a security this gets back to my point that that the even the SEC theory is not that the token itself is a security the SEC theory is that under some circumstances the offer and sale of the token creates an investment contract and so you have to look at the circumstances of each offer and sale and kik treated the pre-sales as an offer and sale of an investment contract because the circumstances of those transactions and what was being offered to the purchasers was very different from what was being offered to people who bought tokens in the token distribution event the the pre sale participants were being offered the right to acquire kin in the future at a discount to the price it was offered to the public assuming a sale took place and so what was being sold to the pre single participants was not just the token itself but the right to acquire tokens in the future at a certain price under certain circumstances which is different from what was being offered and sold to participants in the toko distribution at that right I just feel like if I'm an everyday person and I know that a VC buys this token a month before it's possible for me to buy it or they buy a promise you know this I guess maybe did you use a saft or something yes yeah then you know I probably would be expecting profits from the same purchase but anyway let's do let's move on one other thing I want to ask about was in your wills response you keep citing this block vest decision that the SEC initially lost but that was later reversed when the court it did indeed determined that the SEC was right that token sales can be investment contracts so I just wondered if that development would affect any of your arguments you know differently from what you published it doesn't in my view we cited the original opinion in block fest as an example of a rigorous application of the standard and in particular the courts focus on what was offered or promised to purchasers as opposed to just the subjective intent of the purchasers after that initial decision the SEC went back to the court and presented additional information that changed the courts mind about that particular case but that changing of the courts mind was based on the evidence in that particular case has nothing to do with the evidence in this case so in other words we were citing that case as an example of how one should properly apply the framework but the facts in that case is dramatically different from the facts in ours and so the fact that the SEC submitted additional evidence that changed the courts mind about the facts in that case doesn't affect our arguments at all and then also in the Welles submission you said quote currently more than a year after the token distribution event token issuers and industry participants alike are still unclear as to what types of tokens fall within the definition of a security and obviously in the last couple months now the SEC has released a framework for digital tokens has that changed your opinion at all do you feel that that has brought more clarity I don't think so at all I think if anything it's the opposite the framework that the SEC has most recently discussed I don't think makes it possible for someone to know in advance which side of the line they're falling on it it is a very large number of different factors that the SEC says it will consider in making a judgment but it doesn't actually tell anyone where the line is and so I don't think that guidance actually helps people know in advance whether a given offer or sale is one that the SEC is going to say involves an investment contract and I also wanted to ask in general about this choice to go to court do you think that this route would be antagonistic at antagonistic to regulators and sort of negatively predispose them to this industry because I know you know there are these other options where you could push for a kind of a clearer framework or an exemption of some sort or something where essentially you kind of work with the regulator's more I think that's a totally fair question and and as we said in the wealth response we have certainly tried to find a solution that doesn't involve litigation and we haven't been able to do that and the fundamental problem is that in our view the SEC is extending its regulatory reach to things that are not within its statutory authority and to some extent that's just an issue that has to be resolved and I think just to add to that I think the point where we're at with the industry what's become so dangerous is the entire industry is operating under this cloud of fear of what will the SEC think and we're now starting to see the real impact of that of the industry in the u.s. starting to fall behind you know it's it's one thing to you know go in try to educate the SEC we spend a lot of time doing that it's one thing to produce all these documents do all these subpoenas do all this testimony cost millions of dollars that's another thing but at this point now what's the most worrying thing is we are falling behind you know I look at coinbase and they come out they built this amazing product or early to build an amazing team but they're operating with this uncertainty and that makes it really hard you know what will the SEC think what will the SEC think what we the SEC think and then you know less than two years ago or something like that you have by Nantz come out and say listen what we should do is we should do everything coinbase is doing except we won't do it in the United States because that will let us move a lot faster and fast forward to today and finance is now the number one exchange in the world is replaced coinbase you know coinbase has been financed and i think that's where we finally said enough is enough and you know and when we speak to people in the industry we need to stop living under this cloud of fear of what will the SEC think what will the SEC think because we all know this is the next megatrend of technology and by always having to ask ourselves what will the SEC think we are giving ourselves a fundamental handicap to being able to compete on the global stage so enough is enough we need to come out we need clarity and the only way we're going to get that is if we go to court so let's do that I love your concern for American companies because you are a Canadian company right we are a Canadian company we have lots of we have lots of American companies in the ecosystem you know I like to thank Canada's a little bit the little brother and sometimes it takes the little brother to tell the older brother like what are you what are you doing here you know we as a Canadian grew up I considered myself like you know I follow the American elections more than the Canadian elections yeah the American market is very important to us and developers and consumers and so we made a decision no we want to occlude the US and what we are doing that's the only way we'll be able to build something amazing for the world but now in hindsight that's looking like a mistake you know that now we are we are at risk of being financed ourselves somebody says Wow Kim great idea let's do that everywhere except in the United States and then racing ahead and that's the part where I think it has a lot of entrepreneurs a lot of projects who want to serve the United States but have the United States be part of this are starting to wake up and say whoa we can't what are we doing here like we believe in there's so much there's such an opportunity here but we're gonna lose and that's so unfair and so wrong and so that's why we need to we need to take this to court and so just so I understand also I mean I sort of asked this or but I you know because we have this like very concrete effort I want to know like why not throw your efforts behind getting the token taxonomy Act passed which that would create a class of digital tokens that are not considered securities so we can do many of these things in parallel and we are we think the token taxonomy Act is great but it will also take a very long time and so speaking to senior people in Washington people there are telling us like listen these acts are great and we want to get them through and we appreciate the support and the help but the fastest way to get clarity is somebody has to go to court and so that's what we're doing all right so something else that I want to understand is in your wills response he wrote quote further further any action will not only harm kin purchasers who the Commission purports to protect but it will carry the ill effects of regulating through enforcement so what what do you mean by that so what we mean by that is the distinction I was trying to allude to earlier we think that the best way and the right way to regulate is to set up a set of rules and standards in advance that apply to everybody so that people can know in advance how to do a transaction that is or is not covered by the securities laws but the SEC in this instance instead of getting ahead of the issue and issuing an affirmative and comprehensive set of guidance has been regulating by bringing individual enforcement actions against specific sellers involving specific facts none of which tells you how the standards apply to a set of facts that are a little bit different or a lot different from those facts and so you have to you have to look at each of the individual settlement orders and try to interpret them and try to figure out how the how the SEC might apply that analysis to a different set of facts which makes it extremely difficult for people to predict how the SEC is going to come out on on their project and and we've actually noted in the wels response that some some folks at the SEC have actually said that the SEC is making an affirmative decision not to give that kind of prospective affirmative guidance because in their view people will just find a way to work around it which in my view is just another way of saying comply with it and so we just we think that's just fundamentally the wrong attitude they should be sending a clear set of rules that applies to everybody that are specific enough that people can actually know in advance how to comply with them yeah that was a very very interesting part of the wels response people should definitely read that if they get a chance essentially Valerie Stefanik she was saying you know oh if we make a clear guideline then basically people will essentially use that to kind of skirt around the rules that's what she implied and that you know you responded saying well no actually then we'll use it to make sure that we're you know doing things the right way so yeah I think you know these are different interpretations so one last thing that I just wanna circle back to I think we touched on this briefly at the beginning but I just need to understand so at this point you're sort of in this waiting period trying to figure out whether or not you know or you're gonna find out if the SEC is going to pursue the enforcement action or not so just walk me through the different scenarios that could essentially lead you to end up ending up in court versus not sure so where we are in the process is the the staff has told us that the staff intends to go to the Commission and ask for the Commission's permission to file an enforcement action against us we have submitted our response what happens from there is the staff does some additional work and at some point goes to the Commission itself the commissioners and asks the commissioners to approve of the filing of an enforcement action we don't know right now when they intend to do we believe they do intend to do it and so the one gating item here is whether the Commission will sign off on the filing of an enforcement action against okay and as I'm sure you know and as you've discussed on your own podcast there are commissioners with different views about these things so I wouldn't want to be in the business of publicly handicapping what the commissioners will do but that's one gating item is whether or not the Commission agrees with the staff and approves of the filing of an enforcement action if they do then I would expect that the staff will file an enforcement action in fairly short order after that and then so if that happens then you know you would then how will you respond and in how would that end up in court so they so if they were to file an enforcement action I think they would most likely file it in court in a in a federal court not sure where they would file it but that would just kick off it's essentially a lawsuit between the SEC and kick and/or kick in the foundation and so we would we would respond as we as we think appropriate to to the lawsuit and the the case would proceed like any other lawsuit but with the government on one side and then if the commissioners don't agree then maybe the enforcement action would not go through in which case then you would have set up defend crypto and maybe it wouldn't go to use that's certainly that's hypothetically possible I think one can look at the enforcement actions that the SEC commissioners have approved and reach your own conclusions about about the likelihood but yeah I mean the our wealth response is basically an argument to the commissioners that they should not approve the filing of an enforcement action and I think at that point that would be great guidance I know it's not legal guidance but you know this is a very public situation right now you know we've read the wels known as we read the wels response so if the Commission you know we hope the Commission the four commissioners will vote not to go ahead and if they do they will unlock a ton of innovation and excitement in this industry because they'll be implicitly saying what Kim did was okay and that would be actually the first time well not the first time one of the first early times recent times of a new cryptocurrency project coming out and where they're actually implicitly saying it's okay so either way this is where we want to force clarity either it doesn't go ahead and it's implicitly okay or it does okay God does go ahead and we get a court to make a judgement and you know that becomes the new highway test we can stop referring to an orange grove from the 1940s and trying to say you know this is what it means for crypto currencies in 2019 and we can start to have a new how we test maybe maybe we'll be called the Kin test who knows that probably makes sense and I think that's exactly what the industry needs yeah well you are not the only ones saying this recently Jeremy a layer of circle published a pretty pointed blog post where he argued that essentially these tokens have the characteristics of commodities currencies securities forgot what the other one 100 and that they have utility or anyway I'm forgetting but but the thing is that he was like they're just new and they're not typical securities you know because they have these multiple functions they're just something new that needs to be regulated in a new way and he also took the SEC to task for the framework and said that it essentially just created even more uncertainty and actually roped in a lot more actors in these crypto networks than had been previously thought would fall under the SCC's purview so I think this is sort of coming to a head in the industry now so we'll see how things play out well anyway where can people learn more about kick kin and defend crypto people can learn more about ken @ken org and people can learn more about defend crypto at defend crypto org this is where we're coming together as an industry you know we start to talk to people about it and and it's just been overwhelming the support we've received which has just been so exciting to get and you know one of the interesting things here is at first people are excited yes finally this is a clarity we need we're so glad somebody's stepping forward to get that clarity but then fear wait I'm not sure if I should contribute I'm not sure what the SEC might think and I think that just shows like the messed up state of the industry is we've sort of lost focus of who the customers are the developers and the consumers and now everybody's building for the regulator and there's fear of people even speaking their mind because what will the SEC think and could they punish me in my project and well I'm that I'm afraid and so when I talk to people but I'm like just listen to what you are saying just listen to what you are saying you're operating out of so much fear this is why it is time to defend crypto and people are getting really excited about that we're so excited to see the support and you know a little bit honored and humbled that you know we didn't want to be the ones to go first we didn't choose it weren't we don't even know why we were chosen but here we are and to have the industry rally behind that to defend crypto you know we're really excited about that and what we can all do together to create the clarity we need to compete on a global level and take to take advantage of this mega trend of an opportunity and for wanting to include the United States not to be a fundamental handicap as we do that
