[Music] hi everyone this is a fireside chat i did with sec commissioner hester purse for the la blockchain summit last week she and i dived into some of the meatiest issues regarding securities regulation of crypto and cover topics such as her descent in the sec settlement with crypto company unicorn the status of her token safe harbor proposal from the beginning of this year her views on how securities law applies to d5 and the recently introduced securities clarity act in congress among other issues as usual commissioner purse aka crypto mom was thoughtful and knowledgeable about the intersection of securities regulation and crypto i hope you enjoyed this interview as much as i did and now here's my conversation with sec commissioner hester purse crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per year on your btc and more than 20 other coins download the crypto.com app now to find out how much you could be earning hi everyone welcome to this fireside chat with sec commissioner hester purse aka crypto mom and thank you commissioner purse for giving us some of your time this week and congratulations on having your second term as sec commissioner confirmed in august thanks laura and it's such a pleasure to be able to be here with you today i have to start with my standard disclaimer which is that my views represent my own views and not necessarily those of the sec or my fellow commissioners you began making your mark in your second term almost immediately with the unicorn settlement in september at that time the sec settled an action against token issuer unicorn and you published a dissent can you explain why you disagreed with his settlement i felt that it was a rather heavy-handed settlement for a case where there were allegations that there was a registration violation um there were no allegations of fraud and so given that it seemed rather extreme to take the action that that we did which which basically was depriving the the firm of all its liquid assets um and so that was would not be my preferred approach to dealing with uh with a registration violence violation and i think that the message that we send with a case like that is one that is basically if you want to do innovation go somewhere else to do it because we really don't want you to try things here as you noted unicorn did not commit fraud but as part of the settlement it had to permanently disable its tokens and also pay a 6.1 million dollar fine and you deem that too harsh because it put them out of business what do you believe would have been the proper penalty well i think we should look when there's a registration violation and again i mean i'm i'm just saying for sake of argument let's say there's a registration violation there i had my own views on that issue as well but if there's a registration violation it's typical to allow people the right to um you know basically get their money back and that's that's fine but to essentially take the further step and say we're gonna we're gonna just take all your assets away we're gonna penalize you by taking all your assets away it just seems like a very strange um remedy to me for for something where we're just saying there was you know there there was a problem maybe people would want unicorn tokens to keep running maybe the people who purchased them would still want them to keep running and we're basically telling them no sorry that's not going to happen because we have this other vision in mind which is to get rid of the tokens and then you also just said that you had your own thoughts also on the registration issue what were those thoughts well i think these are really complicated questions um and that's part of the reason that i think we need a safe harbor i think it is not always easy to tell whether something is a security or not but in in this instance i think there was a case to be made that this was not being sold as a security and or or as part of an investment contract which is how these tokens tend to get pulled in to the securities analysis and i i just came to a different point on that but again i will acknowledge that it's a gray area and it can be difficult to figure out where things fall in february you also proposed a safe harbor for token issuers which would give teams a three-year grace period in which to decentralize their networks and as a part of that you would require the disclosure of certain information such as details about the project or that the code be open source the development plan among other things what is the current status on this token safe harbor proposal well i haven't yet convinced my colleagues to do something like that i'm still hopeful that i will be able to what i'm trying to do now is is work on version 2.0 and think about ways that we can incorporate some of the feedback that i've gotten uh and you know one one piece of feedback is people want stronger protections for token purchasers so are there are there ways that we can look at some of what's happening now and the way perhaps people are doing launches of different tokens that might help me think about what we could build into the safe harbor to make it to offer more protection to token purchasers and what would be an example of a protection that you might include well so you could do something on the disclosure side and this would be sort of similar to what the eu is talking about in its proposal which is you could say you can't you can't market this um and i'm not an expert in eu regulation but you can't market this uh with the idea that the the token is gonna rise in value um so that would be one option another option would be to try to take advantage of the technology and build in things that would actually prevent the development team from selling their tokens for a particular period of time so so maybe you could do something along those lines um so those are some of the things i'm thinking about but still there's been a lot going on at the sec and in the world in general so there have been a lot of other issues that have been taking my time and meanwhile you know the crypto industry is kind of moving on too so so um i i do hope that we can move forward with the safe harbor i still think there's room for it to do some good um but there are also a lot of other developments happening and when you said earlier you have not yet convinced the fellow commissioners or the chairman have you discussed it with them and if so what were their views on it well i one thing that i never want to do is purport to represent my my fellow commissioners views um i'll i'll just say that you know i think i still need to do version 2.0 in order to um to win folks over and so that's that's what i'm hoping to do and then what would be the process after that like what does it take to get this kind of thing adopted so what it would take i think it would probably be done through some kind of a rule making and that would mean that we would go out with the proposal which would then get comment and then we'd go out with a final version based on the comments that we had received so going back to unicorn if your safe harbor proposal had been in effect would you have found that the unicorn offering complied with the safe harbor well so i think that what you need to do the unicorn would have needed to say hey we're taking advantage of the safe harbor but assuming they had done that i think it is the kind of thing that could fit very nicely within the safe harbor i know and that's because they had done some of the disclosures and like what about that particular token well i mean again they would need to make the disclosures required by the safe harbor but i think that that's that's sort of along the lines of what they had in mind right they get some venture money at the beginning um and they they do a lot of the work and then they do the launch after that so i think you can those are the types of instances in which i think the safe harbor can be particularly useful when there's been some work done on the front end that's been financed by venture capital or other accredited investors and then um at some point the company is ready to launch it out into the wider world and have users of the token and and it's at that point that you would say hey we're taking advantage of the safe harbor there's been a new trend in the d5 space where a lot of these tokens are actually being launched um kind of more in the community and they're uh you know non-vc coins as uh the vc coins are being called and um you know it strikes me that your safe harbor proposal maybe is tailored more toward the projects that do start with vc backing so then does that mean that um the community type tokens like these fair launch coins would uh kind of not be allowed to go that direction or that simply they wouldn't fall under the purview of this safe harbor proposal well i think that they could certainly that wasn't what i had in mind when i when i developed the safe harbor and i think it's interesting to see that that's where where a lot of these token launches have moved have moved and i think that that's in in many ways it's a it's a really interesting and positive development to see you know trying to get the tokens out into the hands of people who are going to use them right away right that's kind of the vision for a lot of these projects and i think that's that's consistent with the idea of decentralization right which then takes it outside of the framework potentially takes it outside of the the securities framework so i don't know i i'd be interested in getting people's feedback on whether i need to tweak the safe harbor because i think you know as i as a securities regulator i probably ought to give the warning or the admonition that you know no matter what kind of launch you do you really need to think about whether if you put on the glasses of a securities regulator especially one looking in hindsight is that going to look like a securities offering and so people need to be careful no matter how they're doing it and that's why i would certainly be open to tweaking the safe harbor to accommodate those kinds of fair launch events um whatever kind of token distribution event you want to use i think we need to be thinking about is there should this really be regulated as a securities offering or should it be regulated in some other way and just to make sure that i'm uh setting the baseline correctly i i had been assuming that currently the fair launch coins don't bump up against securities a lot but i just wanted to check is that true well again i think people need to need to think carefully about whether that is the case because even if you do something like an airdrop that doesn't necessarily mean that you're out of the securities law framework right so even if you're not selling it but you're basically giving the token out it could still end up fitting within the securities classification so people do need to be careful and again i think this is all the more reason why the sec needs to be out there providing guidance because people are trying to figure out ways to get the tokens out so that people can use the tokens and we're not we're not really stepping up and providing the guidance that i think people need to feel comfortable and trying these different methods so when you mentioned airdrops you know famously the sec has indicated that those could be considered securities offerings and you know as you mentioned that's just where the tokens are given away for free to certain groups um however in your safe harbor proposal you actually seem to take issue with the fact that the sec has indicated that those could be securities offerings so what is your view on how the sec should um consider airdrops well i'm going to give the typical lawyer response that everything is facts and circumstances based but you know i think if you are giving something out it looks very different than if you're selling something but again i caution people that i'm one person on the commission there are other people on the commission who might look at the same facts and circumstances differently than i do and so so i i just caution people to be quite careful in this in this area i think it's really interesting that people are coming up with different ways to distribute tokens and i i i do think that that should factor into our analysis when we're looking to see whether it's securities offering or not and it sort of feels like we're almost dancing around one particular story in particular that a lot of people have been talking about which is the launch of uni which is the coin for the decentralized exchange unit swap after the airdrop of that coin a lot of crypto lawyers were saying that uni was almost certainly a security and i wondered if you agreed with that and if so and this kind of goes back to the kind of like t v c backed uh project versus one that is you know a community launch one whether you thought that it's competitor sushi which kind of is more of a community coin or started that way is also security or if it's not simply because sushi swap you know was not created by an entity located in a specific jurisdiction well i'm not going to speak about any particular instance um again these things all have to be looked at on their facts and circumstances and so i i can't say anything specific about it other than again to urge people to think carefully about the intersection with the securities laws even when they're doing things they might think are well outside of the securities laws and and please you know come talk to us as you're thinking about how to do things i know that i make this we often come talk to me but come talk to our fin hub our folks on the staff who work on these issues all the time and they can help you think through some of the ramification ramifications without giving you legal advice but they can help you think about what kind of questions to ask so that's what i would urge folks to do crypto.com

safe harbor proposal was published um there were some public responses including from a group of attorneys one of whom is a former sec staffer zachary fallon and uh the group of attorneys is ketzel uh they're a fintech compliance firm and they said that actually they felt that maybe what could be done instead is to just tweak existing securities laws such as regulation a in which token issuers can raise up to 50 million dollars through the sale of what would initially be considered securities and i wondered what you thought of that idea look i think that's an option too and i'm i'm certainly open to that option i've always said that my safe harbor is not intended to be the end all and be all or the only solution if there are other solutions that will work better i'd rather spend my time working on those but i i i do worry if we focus only on a reg a type solution we might end up with tokens that are sort of stuck in a securities law framework after a point in which it doesn't really make sense for them to be in that framework and again that's a project by project determination and and it seems to be working for some projects which is fantastic um but i i just worry that that's not the right model for for every token offering um and so certainly willing to be shown that i'm wrong on that but i i think it's because there's so many requirements around what it means to be a security and how you can move those tokens around if they are deemed to be securities that's where i continue to worry that a reg a solution might not be the only solution we need and so to go back to d5 i wanted to ask a broader question than the question i asked about uni which is that in general a lot of these d5 projects are using what they call a governance token to decide on the direction of the project and i wondered if you thought d5 governance tokens were securities well again facts and circumstances but i think when um when you start to put security like sort of benefit like equity like characteristics then again that's going to be something that you have to think about i say that with with a little hesitation only because i think it's really interesting what's happening in the d5 space and i you know i've heard you talk about this laura and so i know you feel the same way but there's some real potential for for some pretty major and revolutionary change um coming out of the d5 space this idea that you can have the users of something be the ones who also govern it in a really direct um there's there's no attenuation there right it's a very direct way and so that that will challenge the regulatory structure in a number of ways and some of those are on the security side but i think also on the corporate governance side some of which much of which is within state law purview we're going to have to ask a lot of really difficult questions about what that means for for how how we regulate things and i did also hear in a recent interview you said that defy itself plays a regulatory role and i love the way you phrase that it was so interesting to me and i just wanted to hear you expound on it what do you mean when you say that well i think when you have the people who are actually using something deciding its future um then the changes that that that happen are are decided by the community together and that's a sort of regulatory um function it's not a government regulatory function but it's a regulatory function by the people who are actually using it so someone can launch one of these projects and say i have this great vision for what's going to happen with this project but if you really launch it and you put it into the hands of your your community it could end up doing and being something very different than what you ultimately what you what you initially imagined it to be it could could ultimately be very different so you have to have a little bit of willingness to be hands off and and see what happens and that's probably a little bit scary for some for some developers to do that but i think it's kind of a uh an interesting thing to watch um and and it can have some really i think positive ramifications for regulating behavior so now talking about congress there was a recent bill called the securities clarity act that was introduced and that bill would create a new definition for tokens that are between a commodity and a security and part of it would be to amend the securities act of 1993 and 1940 1940 to say that the term security does not include an investment contract asset i wondered what you thought of this bill well so i think it's really it first of all it's good that congress can can get involved when there are questions where two agencies here the cftc and the sec potentially have some jurisdictional claim but more generally sometimes what we see when the sec is a bit slow to act on things is that congress comes in and says okay well if you're not going to deal with this we're going to tell you how to deal with it and that can be that can be a really important push for us actually to make some progress on our own uh but i do appreciate the fact that there are people in congress who really care about this space and it's a bipartisan interest which i think is fantastic that there's there's real interest into trying to figure out the appropriate regulatory framework and at some point there probably will need to be congressional involvement simply because in the us there's so many different regulators involved um both on the federal side and the state side so i i think it's kind of inevitable that at some point congress is is going to weigh in one way or the other on this and just so i understand how something like that would be adopted if it does get passed in congress then would the sec be able to weigh in in any way to amend it or revise it or would it simply be handed down to you and you would enforce it so it depends often what congress will do is they'll write a broad enough bill that gives the agency the relevant agency the ability to kind of fill in the details at other times congress will be much more specific um and you know there along the way people from from congress will come to the sec sometimes and ask for technical advice on what will this mean if we write it this way and so the experts at the sec are able to provide technical advice on it but it just really depends you know and it depends on the mood too if sometimes if we saw for example with the jobs act um that i think there was a frustration in congress this was probably before you were following this space laura but there was a real frustration in congress about um the sec not taking capital formation at small companies for small issuers seriously enough and so congress came in with the jobs act which which told us what we had to do basically for years now the crypto community has been hankering for a bitcoin etf and multiple attempts to create one have been rejected by the sec this morning the uk financial conduct authority banned the sale of cryptocurrency derivatives and exchanged traded notes for retail users what did you think of that decision and does this also influence the chances of a bitcoin etf being approved in the us well i mean i don't even comment on what other regulators in the us are necessarily doing so so all i can well i sometimes say i think there's been some positive work actually by other regulators in the us and in the crypto space so i'm happy about that but you know figuring out what what products should be available to retail investors is probably a country specific thing what i will say is that in the u.s we have a tradition of of believing that people should be free to make decisions for themselves and then responsible for the consequences and i don't know why that wouldn't apply in an area like a bitcoin exchange traded product where you see lots of interest from people in in getting exposure to bitcoin this is one way that would would be easy for people to get exposure again the facts and circumstances matter so how the product is designed matters and that's something that the sec looks at and so each one of these will be judged on its own merits when we when when people come in and apply but as i've said in the past i think we've taken a a an approach that is a merit regulation approach and is saying we don't think that um investors can make wise decisions for themselves so we're just going to cut this product off from them all together and it just doesn't make any sense to me in the news recently there were also some really big enforcement actions against the crypto derivatives exchange bitmex including criminal charges against its owners and although this is outside your domain i wondered what effect you thought this action would have on the industry in general particularly maybe around kyc aml or on future etf applications well i think that the the message has been coming to the industry fairly loud and clear on the aml kyc front and i'm sure it will continue it's a difficult area frankly for for very traditional financial firms as well um and i think that lots of firms run into trouble there um but i but i think that it's definitely sending a message to uh to the crypto world and then in terms of you know when they're when there are us users of a product or a service um there's going to be enforcement of u.s laws and so that i think is is what we're we're probably seeing here and so we'll see what happens um that as you said those were our agency was not involved in that so i don't know the details other than what i've read in the paper same as you stable coins have become a mainstay in the crypto ecosystem with volumes up this year over last valerie stepanek the sec's cryptozar has said that certain types of stable coins could raise issues under securities laws which types of stable coins do you believe veer more in that direction well i think sometimes when you see a stable coin that's built on a basket of underlying thing underlying assets it could implicate certain of our rules and so as with anything else if if you're developing some kind of stable coin you ought to come talk to us but i think there have been some positive developments i mean we saw what the occ did a couple weeks ago and and we came out with with guidance or a statement in response to that say hey um we want you to come talk to us to see whether there are any securities implications i think some people took that statement as as sort of a negative one but what i would say is i think it was really saying we don't think every stable coin implicates securities laws but you ought to come and check with us to make sure that it doesn't so i think there is a path forward there recently chairman clayton j clayton said that all securities may one day be tokenized do you agree and if so what do you think needs to happen before that can become a reality i think that is likely um you know we've seen the the transition from paper certificates where most securities are not are not evidenced by paper certificates anymore and so i think it's a natural progression to to think that there will be tokenization and blockchain is a really useful way to keep track of where securities are who who owns them so i think that we could see that there there probably is work that we need to do on the um transfer agent rulemaking side um and then i think there are technological changes that will have to happen because for something like that to happen i think you've got it everyone in the industry sort of has to get on board so it can take a longer time for something like that to uh to happen but you know sometimes it takes a it takes an event like we had the paperwork crisis in the late 1960s which caused broker dealer a lot of broker dealers actually to shut down um and so sometimes it takes something like that and i feel like with covid as bad as it is one thing that it's made us recognize is that the more we can do to um to rely on technology the the better we're set up for when something really terrible happens because you can it's easier to do you don't all have to be in the same place right and so i think blockchain really lends itself well to the era that we're in now all right well we will see where this uh technology continues to develop thank you so much for joining us for this fireside chat thanks laura you
