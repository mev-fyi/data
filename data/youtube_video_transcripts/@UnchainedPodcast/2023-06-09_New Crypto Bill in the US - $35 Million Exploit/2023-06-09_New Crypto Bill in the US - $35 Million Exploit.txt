[Music] U.S House Republicans proposed new crypto bill as discussed briefly on the show despite negative regulatory news around binance and coinbase there was a potentially significant development with U.S House Republicans proposing a bill to pave the way for crypto assets to be classified as digital Commodities Republican chairs Patrick McHenry and Glenn Thompson spearheaded the initiative with the legislation seeking to settle a long-standing debate around the classification of digital assets as either Commodities or Securities the proposal put forward a set of criteria for a digital asset to be considered a commodity with one key element focused on the decentralization of the blockchain network under this framework an asset could be classified as a commodity as long as the network is sufficiently decentralized and no individual or entity owns over 20 of the Network's tokens the bill also requires that in the previous 12 months a single person should not have had the power to quote control or materially alter the network coinbase Chief legal officer Paul Grewal lauded the effort for laying quote a strong foundation for regulatory jurisdiction and definitions in the crypto space despite the Bill's potential to clarify regulatory boundaries for the digital asset industry the legislation still needs broad bipartisan support for it to become law this follows a growing Rift between Democrats and Republicans on crypto regulation with different bills from each party currently in the house Financial Services committee and a polarisim that far extends this

estimate a dispute to be resolved in future hearings in addition to this defunct crypto hedge fund 3 Euros capital is frequently advocating for a seat at the mediation table the failed fund has asserted claims of over 1 billion dollars against Genesis these developments occur amidst increasing frustration from genesis's creditors such as Gemini and customers affected by genesis's Financial

use blockchain or anything else arbitrim suffers unanticipated halt arbitrim a layer 2 scaling Solution on ethereum experienced a temporary halt on Wednesday pausing transactions for roughly an hour with over 2.24 billion dollars in deposits the stoppage was initially attributed to the sequencer a key transaction processing software component running out of ether used for transaction fees however contrary to this explanation Arboretum developers cited a sequencer batch poster bug as the cause of the interruption noting that the sequencer's wallet is programmatically refilled regardless of the exact cause the incident underlines the tension between decentralization and the practicalities of operational Control blockchain Association stands against tornado cash sanctions in a recent development the blockchain association filed an amicus brief supporting coin Center's lawsuit against the U.S treasury over its sanctions on tornado cash the cryptocurrency mixer which the US government alleges was used to launder more than 7 billion dollars worth of digital assets Kristen Smith CEO of the blockchain association argued that tornado cash is a tool and sanctions should Target those who misuse it rather than the tool itself quote punishing the tool itself simply because it can be used by anyone including Bad actors runs contrary to the values this country was founded upon Smith said the suit also emphasized the need for financial privacy in the digital asset industry underlining that users seek tools like tornado cash to maintain privacy without compromising blockchain technology benefits tapping on the Privacy debate on blockchains Luke Chang CEO of Nocturne told Unchained quote it's just very hard to imagine a future where everything is public by default time for fun bits so we just talked about dokwan's bail but let's now hear it from stand-up comedian Jenny Hogan the disgrace Tara co-founder doe Quan is out on bail that's right his 428 thousand dollar request was approved by a court in Montenegro Juan and his CFO are now on house arrest in Montenegro which is incidentally what a lot of people would call a vacation Juan couldn't get the bail until he verified that he owned property worth millions to be fair no one doubted that this claim was true they just weren't sure if he met millions in Luna or millions in actual currency with actual value in that quantit his CFO both have to pay is approximately two hundred thousand dollars each which is incidentally the same as four years of private college I think this is apt since in the last four years it doesn't seem like either of them have learned the bail is supposed to incentivize Quan to stay in the country which really shouldn't be an issue why would he leave he's wanted in literally every other country the pair is set to be monitored closely by the police in Montenegro which to be fair seems like an appropriate job for a cop sure have fun watching Quan last his ass off while he spends the next two weeks counting his money and trying to beat SBF at Diablo 4. thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Emily and the ongoing lawsuits against
