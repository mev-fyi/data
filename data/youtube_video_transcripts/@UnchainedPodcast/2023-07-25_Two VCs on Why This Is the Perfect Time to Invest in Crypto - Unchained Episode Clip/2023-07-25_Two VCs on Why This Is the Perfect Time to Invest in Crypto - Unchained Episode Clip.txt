you said there but one thing that I was laughing a little bit about was when you said that the eruption creates a frenzy that brings in more Capital than the technology can support and I was just like that was definitely the Ico bubble um which yeah it was 2021 bubble both Yeah well yeah yeah although that one you know obviously there was a lot more the stuff that actually were but we'd say you know we'd say that that that frenzy stage started in 2017 and ended it 2021 and so actually going back to the early days of placeholder we had this chart that took the uh and this is on our website on our original uh thesis uh that looked at the it had an image of Carlotta cycle adapted to crypto as we saw it in 2017 we marked it as the beginning of the frenzy and you know that tends to be a period of about similar duration and so in some ways it's kind of fascinating that this is a book from you know this is almost a 40 year old book and it still has predictive power in in deter or describing how technological yeah I've read that back in the day I'm gonna have to reread it because yeah I want to see how everything maps on yeah people should definitely read it by the way if you haven't we I yeah I think we might even have a link to it on my website somewhere the Unchained crypto website but and we'll put it in the show notes for you so one thing also that I wanted to ask about because in my opinion the year of 2022 was a very singular year for crypto I've taken to calling it The Year of crypto Carnage um you know it's just historic for the sheer number of collapses like Terra Luna Celsius 3C FTX and I'm not even naming all of them there's more so I was curious how you guys feel that the crypto industry has been building differently if you know it's been different building differently at all um and then generally if you kind of feel that there are like certain lessons that either entrepreneurs or investors have absorbed like what would those be certainly well I I do think that Humanity will continue to repeat certain mistakes again and again and again and one of them is using too much leverage so so that's one side of it of like humans will make certain mistakes again now if we build the infrastructure better we can protect people from making those mistakes so I think coming out from the Carnage of 2022 one thing we've seen is return to to focus on the non-custodial truly decentralized mechanisms because those are the ones that didn't fail us right and Luna was not decentralized we would argue and it was a failed mechanism um and I would say that anyone who studied it closely and helped um you know how to say intellectual honesty without getting skewed by by the returns could see that it was a failed mechanism but so there's been a return to non-custodial and like specifically within Solana I think that's a great case study um because a lot of teams did use FTX right and got burned by FTX and that has caused them to shift over to using squads and using a multi-sig and getting more crypto native with even just how they run their operations because those mechanisms and those protocols Can't Fail them right and so learning that lesson was was really important and I remember Joel saying something like uh this was in the midst of sbbs you know collapse and you know the crypto specific stuff of like what a great way for entrepreneurs to get you know lessons on the importance of counterparty risk right and so that's important and that will influence how people build in in the years to come so I would start there the other thing I would say and this relates to what Joel was saying about regulatory activity in the recomposition phase we've we've been articulating this as a progression from defiant defy to the internet Financial system and that while we do think D5 will continue to persist as a permissionless you know potentially non-kyc AML system and there will be that that world and it's Unstoppable and I think that there are Arguments for why it has a right to to persist as a form of speech or code written as a form of speech we also think that there's going to be a growing part of these systems specific to finance that is regulated um that is kycaml that does say work to meet the needs of some of the biggest capital allocators in the world um and that would be what we think of more as the internet Financial system and um again it it benefits from the efficiency and speed of blockchain-based systems things you know we've talked about for many years now in the crypto space it also benefits from you know the transparency and in some in some cases the autonomy of a non-custodial system I think that we will see that you can be non-custodial and compliant right and there are ways to to go about building things that way but the non-custodial is really about limiting your counterparty risk whereas the compliance is really on the application layer of who you are able to do business with and the types of capital that you can touch so those would be two things that I would say that we would expect out of the 2022 Carnage I think that no one is upset about uh law enforcement and Regulators going after Bad actors but everyone's upset about them going after good actors and unfortunately we uh had a situation where the lack of action or preemptive action with uh against Bad actors has created in the United States at least it seems a situation where there's an overreaction uh to the events and and that that is dragging down the good actors like coinbase but despite that we think that companies like coinbase and the good actors will prevail but it's really important that the Bad actors don't get away with it and that the cycle of impunity stops because up until 2022 we had largely a regime of impunity where there were some isolated cases where enforcement did go after Bad actors but they were kind of scarce but going after those large-scale Bad actors and you know there's people that been put in prison there's people that have criminal cases against them is really important as far as setting precedent and discouraging future Bad actors from uh from trying to do the same things or executing the same schemes so that's that's really important that's part part of the reason why it's such a significant year um and so coupled with uh the changes in how entrepreneurs are building products that Chris alluded to that create safer products overall uh I think fewer people are or people are going to be more sensitive to building resilient systems that don't fail that have uh sound crypto economic mechanisms but it also means that perhaps some people will think twice before acting in a way that's a proper acting in a way that that goes against uh users or a question for both of you actually would you because this was a debate I think on The Chopping Block like do you think that criminal cases against doe Quan are fair there I know that placeholder you know did not believe in Terra Luna you felt that it wasn't going to succeed but you know I know some people said hey being an entrepreneur and failing is not a crime other people said he you know should be put away for that so I was curious for your thoughts yeah you know I I don't know and I don't think my opinion matters on that you know speaking for myself um and it it's sort of up to the justice system to the site that and and judges to decide that I do I do understand the sentiment it's hard to judge you know intentionality which is really what what um a lot of cases are about that you intentionally act in a way that was helpful or that you unintentionally do it and something that uh we've talked about internally a lot is when you get these big events that are uh negative events often we need scapegoats to kind of release a lot of the trauma uh and and the industry trauma and uh sometimes the scapegoats that are chosen by the market or by Society are chosen unfairly and and that is something that happens and so you know there's good actors there's Bad actors and there's people who make mistakes who you know are neither good actors nor Bad actors I think that there's a lot of people who didn't like uh folks like dokwon because of their attitude and demeanor um throughout the you know the whole Saga and that doesn't help him um and so you know things like that matter and even how you behave and um uh your your personality your character is hugely influential in establishing credibility and so I think he put himself in a position where uh there's not that many allies in part because of the character that that he exhibited and I'll keep it very brief the only thing I would say is um how someone reacts to Earnest critical feedback always reveals so much at least to me about their intent and I think that if you look at you know vitalik and how he deals with Earnest critical feedback um or you know totally from Solana or um any legitimate ecosystem building for the very long term they tend to incorporate and you know cogitate over feedback and the people that I'm really skeptical of are the ones that punch down at that feedback and are reactive to it and inflammatory around it and then I have to ask well what's the intention like if the feedback is meant to make your system stronger you know why are you being so reactive it feels insecure right and are you actually protecting against a known insecurity for your own monetary gain and if that's the case then that's intentional right and I'll leave it to the courts to decide that I have my own opinion and I would just say the pattern of you know being reactive to Earnest quality feedback is amazing your red flag yeah either the intent or the dilution or level of delusion
