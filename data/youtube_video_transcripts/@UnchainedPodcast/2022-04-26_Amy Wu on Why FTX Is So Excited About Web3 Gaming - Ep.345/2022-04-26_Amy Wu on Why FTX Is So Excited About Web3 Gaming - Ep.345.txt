description today's guest is amy wu head of ftx ventures and gaming initiatives welcome amy hey laura you went from being a partner at light speed ventures to heading up m a and ventures at ftx tell us what it is that you do for fdx so i started at ftx at the beginning of this year i actually had the you know pleasure of meeting sam um beckman freed our ceo um earlier last year when he was raising his first institutional round and you know was just honestly like so compelled by him and the vision and everything that ftx is doing that um thought it was a really unique time in the company's life cycle and uh was thrilled to join and you know similarly to almost everybody at ftx i wear multiple hats you know i spend a lot of my time playing a leadership role with ftx ventures but then also our global m a efforts and uh and then also our gaming business you know we've been you know i was talking with um almost all the largest gaming companies in the world and seeing how we can be support them as a technology partner as they're launching into web3 and uh and so that's been super exciting as well and you're really into gaming from what i understand talk a little bit about your background and your journey and how you got into both gaming and crypto yeah i've been a gaming investor actually uh longer than crypto uh so first time got into gaming well first of all the lifelong gamer i really grew up playing first-person shooters and a lot of other games with my little brother and then um professionally first started covering gaming when i was an investor at insight and this was like eight almost like probably eight nine years ago now when we were sort of majority shareholders in jagex runescape and also looked at a number of other large gaming companies at the time from an investor lens and then subsequently i also covered gaming esports when i was an executive at discovery the global media company and uh and so then naturally when i was a partner at lifespeed as an investor i led our gaming investing and had you know supported companies like fortnite epic games um 1047 games and a number of other studios and so um that's kind of like a long history and on the crypto side you know actually my my really good friend paul from pantera got me into the space we were angel investing together back in 2017 and then i led um crypto investing for life speed is from from like being of last year and you know obviously i'm uh spend most of my time covering crypto investing in particularly web3 now so in february ftx us announced that it is launching a new gaming unit to help gaming studios incorporate nfts into their games and at the time you tweeted at ftx we offer an end-to-end solution of our core product to launch nfts and tokens a custodial wallet with non-custodial integrations primary and secondary trading compliance and licensing and more all white labeled and in-house can you talk about what it is that is that vision of that product that ftxus will be providing to gaming studios yeah so i think i'm gonna try to bring this to life with an example so say you're a gaming company and um you're you have you know your own gaming account let's say um and a player who signs up for one of your games actually the first thing they do is they spin up an account like um that's owned by the studio and so the idea is that if the gaming studio wants to launch like three elements you know fungible or non-fungible token the a lot of pieces of that let's say the wallets the marketplace is i i would say fairly commoditized but what is not is the compliance around that so um you know as as ftx like we actually so we support something like around 16 billion dollars of transactions crypto transactions per day we're also in over 160 jurisdictions we spend um up north of a billion dollars last year just acquiring companies to acquire essentially licensing fiat crypto on-ramps across the globe in order to facilitate crypto transactions and a compliant environment and that is actually kind of the hardest thing for for a publicly traded company or a large company to be able to do um on their own and you can imagine in this case you're a player and you just you just grinded in the game and you're collecting an nft item well potentially when i collect that item it actually drops into a y labeled ftx custodial wallet and um as a player i have no idea i'm actually working with ftx at this point i just think i'm like literally just collecting items in the game however that gaming studio now has a compliant environment in which to hold those in-game assets um and then you know the and then the item can then subsequently be potentially transferred into like an open marketplace in order to trade either within the walls of that gaming studio or in like a fully open um nft marketplace and so there's a lot of different ways to implement those user flows but this is sort of an illustrative way of you know how to compliantly offer lecture elements as a gaming studio to your player but also in a way that doesn't disrupt the natural flows of a player that's just like um you know used to play games and the alternative is you know you can have them download a non-custodial wallet and then maybe go on ftx or coinbase and buy tokens transfer it to their wallet and integrate that into your game the friction is just so much higher in terms of onboarding and you know one of the core theses that we have is that the majority of players are actually just going to play the game rather than actually interact and trade an in-game item like on chain or not and so therefore like you know those are the players that that you know a studio should be catering to oh okay yeah that well that all makes sense uh what you said at the end but one thing that i have to admit is like at first i kind of didn't understand the compliance for just like nfts what are you talking mainly tokens or like what what are the compliance parts for nfts so it turns out that one of the most regulated parts of operating crypto is this conversion from fiat to crypto so if i'm a consumer and i want to actually pay a dollar um i want to put my credit card or debit card or transfer usd and convert that into a crypto currency or asset of any sort that is actually one of the highest um most regulated parts of um that transaction and depending on what jurisdiction it is around across the world there's different licensing and banking partners that you need in order to facilitate that that part of the transaction there's also money transfer licensing that you need in order to transfer assets of value and that's another regulatory layer on top of that and so you know i think you know we like to think about ftx is that we have actually the biggest network of um of licenses around the globe u.s and also outside the u.s in order to help facilitate this specific um this transaction and you know most of the large gaming companies are actually global and so um this is something where down there at some point their gc and their compliance team are going to be asking all right are we allowed to do what you want to actually do in game and that's where i think we can provide the most value since as a global crypto exchange compliant transactions is actually sort of our core value that we provide so ftx is also spending a hundred million dollars with lightspeed your former firm and solana just for integration of solana into video games in general i'm noticing like this you know huge focus on gaming as a category why is that gaming has really captured a lot of people's you know it's their imagination as one of the biggest potential sources of onboarding mainstream audiences into crypto because today i mean we're still we're you know we're in sort of like the millions of people that are holding crypto and um we still have another sort of billion billions of people to go um around that um i do think we need fun entertaining and also like real use cases in crypto beyond just trading crypto and having a b store value and that's finally coming online this year um and we're really excited about that in ventures but specifically for gaming you know some stats are kind of 200 billion dollar industry revenue industry last year two to three billion gamers globally if he includes their mobile platform and then now kind of up and coming like browser platform as a game as well and so therefore it's just such a huge number of people to potentially on board um especially if you consider that gamers have essentially value digital assets longer than almost anybody with um buying and trading grinding for in-game assets and so originally um you know people in web 3 and crypto have thought well you know owning that asset is just the natural next step in terms of that in-game item being and you know and nft however you know obviously there's been a huge backlash in the gaming industry gamers from particular against this concept of web 3 and nfts and so it's been pretty fascinating you know i was recently at gdc uh largest gaming conference in the um you know this year and it's feeling that tug and pull you know most gaming companies obviously at least at the ceo level typically are very excited gaming large gaming companies always have like you know dozens of experiments that they're working with right they have dozens of titles some of you that are huge and others in production and so therefore like you know most of the large gaming companies that we were talking to have some experiments or innovation sort of brewing in the um web3 space because you know if this does become a massive sort of trillion dollar industry then they don't um in games they don't want to miss out and so therefore like it's just been an area of intense interest and a lot of activity that a lot of partners um vendors you know like ourselves are um are spending a lot of time with so yeah i definitely want to talk about that backlash but first let's just talk a little bit about this history that gaming has around incorporating like money or objects of value into earning or into play because as far as i understand like before crypto came along there was this concept of free to play games and players kind of resented those i heard you say they often seem to be designed more as pay to win games but then that evolved and then now there's been this new evolution of like play to earn and yet again later and i think you know initially there was kind of like a lot of promise around it and then now there's people are kind of aware that there can be problems where many of these people that are playing the games are more like mercenaries just wanting to earn the token earn whatever the money is and then you know not really interested in the game so yeah so how do you like what do you think is the kind of best vision of how games can incorporate blockchain based um tokens or assets and do you think like play to earn is dead or do you think it could be revised in some fashion my thesis around gaming monetization paradigms is that i personally think that um web 3 is a an evolution of free-to-play gaming rather than in itself a monetization strategy so um if you look at the evolution of of uh free-to-play essentially like gaming 20 years ago the predominant gaming industry was really like premium games right i go to the store i go to gamestop i i buy i pay 40 bucks for the latest you know playstation game and that is pretty much the end of my monetization for that i came as a gamer right until they came up with like the sequel and then i might you know buy that and so like free to play is this concept that um instead of having this activation of like 40 or whatever that is 20 bucks or whatever in order for me to even start playing the game it's free to play to begin with and then essentially the monetization happens in game right i can accelerate my progression i can um in various ways i can buy certain things like i can buy skins cosmetic items in the game and so essentially it's like um and actually it's the gaming industry i think um adopting a lot of the mechanisms of consumer internet which is that you monetize players depending on the segmentation of players you're going to have player whales you're going to have people that will never spend a dollar in your in your game however you monetize them via ads right um and then you'll have people in between or you have people that you are not even monetizing ads however they're adding to the overall player base and so it is adding to the overall experience of all the players if it's like a social um sort of multiplayer game and so this concept of segmentation of players and then optimization of the lifetime value by segmented players actually just has a lot given birth to this to this sir crop of evergreen games games much larger from both the player base and also a um monetization like total revenue perspective than ever seen before and sort of like all the largest games like in the world now are pretty much free to play whether it's um league of legends riot game and then um or like fortnite or you know gentian impact and and others and then within that you know it's uh free like web 3 or having kind of like um tokenized in-game currency or sort of nft which is really just like another another type of like in-game item is it's just like adding what is an open economy to previously close economy almost like um it's like simulations of open economy right now it's like actually full economy because a player can just trade that token openly on exchange or um trade that nft openly in exchange and um and it has a level of difficulty for game designers and game economists to balance the various parts of that game economy because it's now so open um but it also potentially off like makes for example an open world mmo game feels even more real and it also allows like new innovative ways of gameplay now that it's totally open and also it helps it it unlocks a few more lovers for example we have seen from parallel life um like in others that even before the game is launched you know how do you actually engage and start building the community around that game before it launches well if you launch an nft collection that people know that they can then utilize a game later but it immediately has some amount of like value and then there's like ways that they can start interacting with the community then you're essentially building this pre-built like passionate community that has skin in the game because they've actually bought something in your game far before your game has actually launched and it's a way of then basically dropping a active community into your game on day one now there's definitely a backlash like this is part of the backlash where some gamers are like wow you're literally selling me these nfts on this future promise you're gonna deliver me a great gaming product and are you actually going to ever launch this gaming products when are you launching this a lot of times the products have made at times like you know 50 to 100 million or something like that on you know nft drops and and some of them get distracted because of that and you know they're less focused on making the game and things like that and so you know i understand why some players are frustrated with you know the introduction but at a pure sort of conceptual level um it basically just adds so many interesting levers for game studio or consumer brand you know presumably internet company to play with like player and user reward and retention and what do you think about play to earn do you feel like that model is broken or do you feel like it's not like just there are a lot of questions about it i feel you know yeah i think it's a challenge model um so i think i think when people say play to earn what they mean is completely supplementing people's income with um you know revenue that they're going to make in-game so the reality is is that a a type of play to earn has existed in gaming for the last 20 years right as in you know people in western markets have paid people in emerging markets to grind for items for gold etc in games since like about 20 years ago since you know the old runescape days or like you know world war crafts right gold farmers and uh and there's some people that can earn a living um doing that but it's always but that population of our earners have always been dwarfed by the population of actual game players and so um in quote-unquote play to earn which is essentially borrowing that terminology from what was previously a gray market right in um or black market in in games you could still have absolutely populations of people who are earning a living playing games grinding for items etc but personally i always think it's going to be it's going to be smaller than the actual player population and by a very large margin and so you'll have an industry there potentially but i think it's going to be somewhat limited so obviously right now with crypto entering kind of the gaming area we are seeing that it's bumping up against some really basic facts about you know executing transactions in crypto right now which is that there's a lot more demand for block space than there actually is and so fees can be high and gaming is one of those things where potentially you could have a lot of transactions so how do you think games can kind of incorporate crypto now in a way that isn't either cost prohibitive or just something that is completely not fun as a user yeah so lots of different ways to incorporate web 3 elements to it on the one hand you can essentially just drop some cosmetic nfts which is no different from like you know a game like launching skins for a character which many free to play games like have today but that those skins can actually just be traded outside of the confines of the gaming studio and uh and that's all that is nft skin and on the other end of the spectrum is what if every single gaming transaction is actually carried out on chain and i would say that pretty much today that's like virtually impossible like there is no public blockchain that has the throughput and uh that can sustain that kind of transaction volume for one of the major games and that's totally fine i mean today games are starting with minting nft's um items on chain and then i think like promises that in the future like as public blockchain scale you know and l2s are helping with that like arbitrary and starkware and then you already have for example um the some of the alternative l ones like solana and polygon are able to um be a lot cheaper for example than running transactions on ethereum and also a lot more environmental friendly at the moment you know um there are a lot of different ways that games can incorporate web3 elements today you can also games can launch a token as well game studios you know obviously there's legal complexity with that and so in terms of how do you launch that as one consideration but then also a practical consideration is that actually it's a lot more easy to control um and manage nfts in your gaming environment than if you actually tokenize your in-game currency because once you do that then you are essentially going to be actively balancing that currency otherwise it's disrupting actual gameplay and so uh we kind of encourage gaming studios to start with launching nfts and then uh before launching their in-game token um but you know we have partnered with for example um com2s which which is a publicly traded korean based gaming company that launched summoner's war one of the largest you know mobile mmos in the world um they've launched um c2x on ftx and they um are embedding the ctx token in you know ten games they have in their pipeline from here to the end of the year they're also using the ctx token as part of their game's launch pad which to partner with tara blockchain with um and so a lot of utility for that token and we think that's like a really terrific way to um embed a lot of utility right now and something and we'll see how it goes right it's still like super early in in the experiment and um in the roadmap but um early on it's gotten a tremendous amount of user interest that is so interesting one thing is that just the way you described it at least i think in the u.s that might be considered a security because that there would be kind of like a centralized company that would be responsible for the success of that but it sounds like in korea that's not how a security is defined or currently um they structure in a way that they think is compliant but you know there's a new administration currently in um in korea that's actually very crypto friendly and so there's a lot of ongoing conversations around you know how to stay compliant at all times and that's the thing you know compliance is like an ever-moving target and it involves like um regular conversations with the right regulators uh in order to always you know stay staying locked up yeah yeah and i think it's confusing because different jurisdictions have different laws but yeah do kwan was on my show and and talked about how just how friendly the south korean president is to crypto so you know at the moment you know as we discussed there are kind of scaling issues when it comes to crypto gaming but i think there are also other issues and you've kind of talked about some of them but are there any other kind of user experience type issues that you feel that gaming um needs to improve when it comes to adopting nfts and other blockchain based assets into games so i'll give you actually a really tangible example at gdc we also announced that ftx had acquired storybook brawl which was uh uh which is an auto battle or a card game um sort of in sort of like a similar genre as hearthstone and it's very beloved you know like a lot of people play it at fdx actually sam's childhood friends with uh matt the ceo of a storybook brawl and um that's how we got introduced and and um when we announced the announcement actually there was quite a lot of of you know public sort of um negativity around oh now it's sort of like raw it's like selling out they're you know they're gonna they're gonna ruin the game by um by launching nfts et cetera there's just essentially this immediate visceral reaction by a vocal minority within the gaming community that nft equals bad like crypto equals bad because you know there are actually scams and money grabs and space but there's also like really good teams and people trying to build something great for players i will say that interestingly i mean because we like you know are part of the same team now like that the announcement essentially like even though there was a negativity it virtually did not impact the play and the kind of like engagement and player base in the game in fact some of the most vocal people like we know continue to play the game and um and so that's and actually like storybook and we got a lot of people saying hey love this development really excited to see the innovations here like i'm not going to post anything publicly because i don't want to get like torn down by people on twitter and so like i just i come back to the fact that it's like a vocal minority and again we totally understand that the proof is on the crypto and gaming community to actually create fun experiences for gamers and rather than like not fun experiences for gamers where it's kind of like a token money grab that responsibility is definitely on the developer side but you know um i think and um and so i don't want to like make light of people's nativity but i do think it's um it's still the minority i've actually we've got a lot of support and a lot of people that are really excited to see like you know where um that team is going to take the innovation yeah i've experienced something similar where you have like a large group and then there's one small vocal minority that like hears a lot about one issue and they make so much noise and frankly will attack anyone who doesn't agree with them so then you end up getting flooded with private messages of people who disagree with them but don't want to say it publicly uh so that's yeah it's interesting how that happens and at the end of the day these are like developers that are pouring their you know heart into making great products and um and you know it's disheartening for them to see the negativity um online and so you know i really hope that um over time that we're just gonna launch great experiences and then people will just see that as proof in itself so in a moment we'll talk more about this backlash against crypto and fts by normies but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible finance

crossriver.com crypto back to my conversation with amy so i actually want to just kind of give listeners a sense of you know what this pushback has looked like we've seen when companies like ea and team 17 have made announcements about nfts then they've had to pull back from their plans there was a company ubisoft which definitely faced quite harsh criticism but they actually didn't reverse course there was valve which owns the online games for steam and they decided to prohibit blockchain games that use nfts and then the head of microsoft xbox said that he saw nfts as exploitative so you know i actually thought before i kind of looked into this deeply that most people were just upset about the environmental impact of of crypto as you know what they think of it or and if he's you know without because they're they seem to not be aware of the nuances between different consensus algorithms but um i actually read in this one new york times article about this backlash that actually some of this stems from kind of some users protesting that video game companies have been trying to nickel and dime them for a long time and so they view nfts as just another manifestation of companies trying to do that so how much what as you're kind of navigating this world how much of this do you think is a negative response to crypto or nfts themselves versus kind of protest that stems from the past behavior of gaming companies i think it's a mix of all of that gamers have historically been very sensitive to any like disruption or fast realization of you know their beloved products you know in mmos um since the dawn of time you know when like the game maker has kind of made a pretty big like change in the and introduce i don't know like new economies and new markets into some of these games like you you get absolute like rioting you know actually when i was at uh insight uh we had we had like a bomb scare from like the runescape players because we had done something on the monetization side that people really really hated i mean players are hyper passionate about like you know people not messing with their product and so therefore it's like you know it's not a surprise that they're worried about bad players and the crypto world and and the money grab and the scams et cetera um and i'm you know i i um i i really feel for that and there are i think like just right ways and wrong ways of implementing like some of these like web 3 components for example you know in the true spirit of free to play i don't think it should cost like a few hundred dollars for somebody to start playing like anyone should be able to start playing a game like um it shouldn't cost like two east to buy an in-game and a key it should be essentially affordable to absolutely everybody um and maybe there are some rare items though that you're pricing differently and quite frankly like even today you know as a player you can grind for a rare item or you can like buy a rare item from like a in-game marketplace right and i don't think that's crazy at all for um like you know for for the nft version of that item to have a similar type of like marketplace and i think following this kind of ethos like allowing players to be able to grind their way to um to like get their nfts which for example is like what ubisoft had done with their nft collection i think are all like really equitable ways of offering that to players and so i think like that's um one way to potentially start bridging that um but it's actually got to the point where like you know game makers and game executives that go out publicly against nfts and crypto this is like kind of like the populist view right now and just like free-to-play mobile gaming i am personally pretty bullish that as soon as there's such a pipeline of incredible gains being built right now and it seems unlikely that one or a few or few of them aren't going to be absolute breakout hits and when that happens like you know i think people will see oh like actually it's kind of convenient to be able to grind for my items and then be able to openly trade them as well like for the people who want that um and for people who don't they can literally keep playing the way that they have always i find it really interesting because you know at f6 ventures um i do a lot of webs reinvesting so i also for example an investor in hugo labs um i'm on the board of the um of the acorn dao and then i look at a lot of sort of nft projects um and also like with my ftx hat also talked to large consumer brands and internet companies in their kind of um exploration of web3 and the negativity is like way less pronounced i would say across other parts of consumer at the intersection of consumer internet and um and uh and web3 like i think that there's like this particular thread of um pretty deep vein of negativity in gaming right now that i think is like a moment time or at least i hope it is that isn't actually shared by some of the largest common brands in the world that are interested in experimenting with um with um nfts and web3 as a means to provide like you know rewards and engagement because they see it as like just part of the cultural um zeitgeist of what's happening right now and like i think that's literally what it is it's less about the technology and more about it capturing the consumer imagination i mean cultural imagination celebrity imagination and that's what makes this movement um cool for a lot of people so a couple of things so the first thing is um you said something like about how you don't feel that it should cost to ease to buy one of your in-game assets which sort of seems like a little bit of a knock against axey infinity and i wondered you know generally do you feel cause because obviously now we have these different guilds that try to um help people with that do you are you sort of like down on that whole model or what's your i'm i'm not so much down on them as in like it was hugely innovative right like actually infinity had 2 million daus that is like one that makes them one of the most like the biggest like gaming uh like games titles in the world however i think that like um if you look at like high spending your traditional kind of like western audience or broader like gaming audience like there's just like a very like is this gonna cost you like 300 dollars in order to start playing a game like you are very much tapping your um total addressable market and that's why like the predominant model in gaming today is actually free to play rather than like premium games it depends on like how big you want your adjustable market and in general how do you think the crypto community or the nft community or the gaming community like the the heads of these gaming studios that want to incorporate nfts how do you think that those people should address this animosity or or try to kind of like you know lessen lesson than backlash that we're seeing from normies yeah i think because of the um of this kind of backlash um more gaming studios are like i'm not gonna announce anything i'm just gonna launch a great beta and then people are gonna discover they can actually own their assets you know um and i think that's pretty clever rather than like what i had mentioned before which is you can also just launch your nfts early and um and ride that wave i think more studios are like i'm gonna launch a great product first and show people that i can launch great products and then um sort of you know announce like the the web three components to it and then other people are using and like you know in crypto we kind of have like a brand marketing issue you know what does nft really actually even mean we just call them like in-game items or something like that right like i think that the means and the terminology itself is like causing some like heartburn for a lot of people and so some studios are getting like very creative around that and also like um so i would say like a lot of people are worried about nickel and diming but i would say like you know the way that economics work incentives work with um web 3 is that it can be actually a lot more equitable right so like for example today if you're an artist and you created an item that generates a billion dollars of revenue for a gaming company because it's like the number one gaming skin or something like that you're you're all going to be paid like 50 000 as an artist for that gaming studio or whatever amount first is like imagine if you actually can get like some sort of royalty or some sort of cut um in perpetuity of that of that item being sold well like you know a web 3 token it's like can actually like create that incentive model and a lot more um a lot more easier than just a traditional model today although i mean there's obviously like regulatory um issues you know that you need to work through with that but you know i think that's like super interesting so now let's talk about mergers and acquisitions since that's obviously a big part of your job in january ftx raised 400 million dollars and ceo sam bankman freed said that most of those funds would go toward mna so what's what's your vision there for deploying deploying those funds where are you concentrating and why yeah we're looking at a number of areas on the m a front to date we haven't done like a large transaction yet but definitely um uh had the capital and very interested in exploring and um they're across the different areas right one is just like we are in so many markets globally and in some of those um some of the biggest crypto markets we are looking to buy partner sell strategy into expanding our market share in those markets and then also you know we are seeing this opportunity in consumer right now and so while there's consumer fintech or consumer internet companies that have tens of millions of users that have a management team and founders that are super web 3 curious super crypto curious and we just see a lot of like strategic and vision alignments with what we're also trying to do that's also a great opportunity for us you know whether it's in the us or globally we also have product roadmap you know with our own sort of um course or infrastructure um software and um as we see opportunities accelerate that roadmap like we will also um like look at you know you know strategic opportunities there as well you know we have dozens of conversations you know around the globe happening and and you know at the highest level we're looking for sort of visioned um and philosophical alignment and um at the end at ftx you know we would like to power as much of the world's crypto transactions as as you can and and that's you know hopefully going to be across the exchange and ftxpay and um our into marketplace et cetera and um and also kind of white labeling our product um and so in that vision like we're looking for strategic alignment partnerships so ftx has been pretty affiliated with solana which is a newer smart contract blockchain it's obviously taken off hugely in the last like year and a half or so and so a number of the partnerships and investments so far that you've made are to push things in the solana ecosystem or get more people into solana and yet you know obviously still the ethereum ecosystem is pretty dominant i was curious to hear what you what you think the future of layer one will look like do you think it's going to be multi-chain do you think there will be one dominant chain or a few of them and kind of what do you think is the future for ethereum yeah so we are um you know we're cross team platform ftx's um solana is um you know one of our closest partners um the team is phenomenal uh you know they've they've built a product that is um cheap and also much more scaled today than um others out there you know we're also really close with the ethereum community and you know um our investors and arbitrarium and starkware and uh layer twos but then we're also close with other l ones like um nir and polygon avalanche et cetera and constantly exploring you know like new layer one block chains although right now i mean when i think about the the blockchain ecosystem a couple of thoughts come up um one is that we're still in a time when right now like some of the best teams are coming are exploring blockchain technology and are you know starting to build consumer and enterprise products on chain and that is going to drive the next phase of evolution you know like mainstream adoption crypto is going to take killer apps built on blockchain essentially we saw the in the first way we had d5 summer and then we have a lot of games being built on chain right now but i think you know we've seen some amount of stalling i would say um on in the d5 space across chain and so we are also kind of on the lookout for more innovative products in the space um i would say that probably like the eighth lending protocol is like less exciting than than like something that is truly innovative and you know if you're doing kind of like complex or different field protocols on on chain well that's a specific i mean i think it's like a more smish like audience that you're going to be addressing large funds though so like these protocols could be large but again like from a total number of adjustable users just smaller and so we're really looking for innovative use cases in crypto uh sorry in in mainstream applications that are interested in building on chain and really leveraging the um blockchain technology in order to provide faster transactions or more secure or like more um you know permissionless and like there's different reasons to build on chain you know utilize incentivization model of a token um use token gating et cetera and there are dozens of block layer one blockchains right now because it turns out that it's easy to raise money for layer one and also you know the token around a layer one accrues value quickly i think it's fairly unsustainable you essentially need the long-term sustainability of any single blockchain ecosystem relies on having a deep community of strong developers building useful and killer apps on top of that and so i do think that over time we're gonna have a few winners in the layer one space you know and of course like ethereum is still like the largest ecosystem you know in the nft side but then also in d5 and i think there's room for um you know a few chains to have dominance and then you'll have a over time and we're already seeing it this year a rich ecosystem of infrastructure and dev tooling on top of these blockchains in order for a developer to for example build their product on one ecosystem and then potentially go cross chain in a safer um and faster way although currently cross-chain bridging is one of the most vulnerable parts of crypto i mean pretty much all of the major exploits have happened and um on these cross-chain bridges and so we will see like you know as there is innovation in the space like you know ways to fix the problem of rug pools and um and hacks um in in this space which i don't know i'd probably argue it's probably the single most reason that um some of the biggest companies in the world are feeling a little bit um maybe like not going all in on building on chain yet although most of them are are experimenting so like yeah those are some thoughts that that makes a lot of sense to me because i do agree with you that it feels right now like there's so many vulnerabilities and they're constantly being exploited and we even have uh north korean hackers going after some of these projects so um clearly yeah there's a lot of a lot of interest by nefarious actors one thing that you talked about in there was about mainstream adoption and i know that you guys uh recently sponsored the coachella music festival can you talk a little bit about like that strategy and you know what it is that you get out of doing these types of sponsorships yeah so my colleague tristan um he's a head of strategy for ftx us um really led that project for us um he's been working on it for the last year along with you know you know other folks on the ftx team and you know we were um we're a sponsor for uh a partner with coachella for the next couple of years including this year i was just there it was weekend one it was amazing and what we had was and a t activation where you know people on the ground at coachella grounds can um can actually collect uh and tied with actually like a unicode on the wristband a unique you know coachella nft and some of them are able to get you know rare um nfts and we did that in collaboration with like you know a few awesome artists and uh we also had done a drop with like coachella keys that did really well where um you know people get like lifetime membership or tickets to coachella if they own one of these like limited keys and so um really awesome experimentation and coachella is one of the largest music festivals in the world i mean something like 150 to 200 000 people will attend over two weekends and so if you imagine something like 80 000 people were at um we're at coachella week one and we had something like 30 000 people um sign up for our nft i think like midway through weekend one and so it was i think like one of the largest um activations for nfts in the world like ever and it was just awesome to see people with such a positive reaction um to it and they were just having a lot of fun with it and so we we see this as like a really awesome example of of really like mainstream interaction with um with web3 and we're really excited to continue working on that with coachella and with um our some of our other partners as well and i've also been noticing you know along this adoption theme that you've also been doing a lot of deals involving you know other countries like you have had a number of announcements involving india such as a partnership with yield guild games india and with something called super team dao which is to help foster solana projects in india and you also have a partnership with i guess that's asa finance in africa um our as a i'm not sure uh it's headed by elizabeth rosiello who was the first podcast guest ever on unchained she's amazing oh my god i need to have her back actually because people have requested her back she yeah she's so fascinating but i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see these opportunities around that around the globe and how that's affecting your strategy yeah every market is so different i mean some markers i'm spending a lot of time on right now include you know certainly india like you mentioned um japan korea um indonesia and then you know can you talk about what it is about those particular economies that interest you i mean um i'll give korea as an example um i mean korea essentially has one of the deepest crypto penetration sort of in the world right it's it's it's one of the top three it's one of our top three markets and it's one of the top three markets for crypto in terms of total volumes traded like in the world and um and also just korea is interesting i mean i'll put my gaming hat back on consistently korea is probably five years plus ahead at least i'm going to speak for gaming because i know other industries less than that from an innovate tech innovation perspective than almost any other market there is a deep adoption and acceptance of new technologies i'll give an example nexon one of the game gaming studios um they had acquired actually like two korea um exchanges four years ago um and if you look at if you look at actually paying asia you know um you've got line games you've got which is more like lines like japan but then you've got um other teams that actually have been building blockchains themselves and wallets etc for years i mean this is how far ahead they are right and so as a result it's an extremely important market for us and and it's also a heavily regulated market so that only a few entities actually have banking licenses so that korean consumers are able to buy crypto from uh fiat currency and so you know it's important for us to partner with multiple players there and so we can spend a lot of time i'm going to korea myself like later in may super excited to meet some of our partners and so that's an example of a market that is like super distinct and has very deep adoption and has a rich ecosystem of partners that we can you know work with but you know take that and then you take like indonesia you take india every market is distinct in itself it has a distinct like history of regulatory um you know development and a distinct ecosystem of like large players in the space that are doing really interesting things um in the market you have for example in india you know you've got players like dream 11 that are see you know experimenting in the space and they're probably the largest fantasy fantasy gaming company in the world i mean they have hundreds of millions of users um and so like a company like that is just like you know i'm super fascinated to see what they end up doing in the space because these are the companies that are going to bring um mainstream adoption in crypto and many of whom we hope to partner with in these jurisdictions yeah no it is interesting i agree with you about how all these different economies are so different and yeah i you know my i have relatives who live in korea and definitely sometimes they will come to the us and they will make fun of how the us is behind in technology and my mother will get annoyed so um yes we we know that they're advanced over there so let's switch at topics and talk about apecoin you're on the apecoin dao board how did that come about so um i was introduced to the community um sort of like the the four day community you know sometimes some months ago and i think they were um as like the the dow was coming together as a way for certainly board ape um enthusiasts and nfp holders and community members to come and have a way to like create awesome projects and launch their own token and um and sort of kind of innovate in ip space and and and find collaborations like they were kind of thinking through like board members that were pretty deeply entrenched in crypto but then also had a passion for the community and um and a desire to play essentially like a helping hand and and setting up the the dow um and studying and helping sort of guide the governance of it and so you know i was asked to join and was um super thrilled to join what was you know kind of like one of the most innovative dows like in the world and also just um such such a passionate community and so i mean the idea is that you know i'd have a six six month term and that the board members which also include yasui who's the founder of animoka and alexis ohanian um of reddit and also maria from soundventures and dean from horizon labs and that we will come together and basically help set up an infrastructure and kind of really support certain core contributors to then um hand over like um the day-to-day governance to the next set of um sort of core contributors of the of the ape dao aquin dao and so yeah we've been pretty hard at work doing that and meeting regularly uh it's been super humbling scary like exciting all sorts of emotions because when you have um such a passionate and vocal community that have their own opinions about where to take a dao and a beloved ip like board apes and you're constantly throwing that needle between doing the right thing and then also trying to not have you know like certain individuals maybe like kind of overpower the conversation with self-interest you're trying to guide the conversation to the best interest of the general community and that's ultimately not going not everyone's going to agree with the path um but we've been really trying to throw that needle and obviously have so much more that we can be doing and a lot that we were trying to do already lost in store but it's it's been like um a pretty awesome journey um you know yachts and putting himself out there with like um a couple of mistaking proposals and uh you know he's doing like a phenomenal job with that it's scary when you know when people start attacking you know you personally and i had experiences back when i was impulsive that sushi dao likes to stop down as well and um but you gotta just try to not take things personally and just trying to do the best it can for the community if you're interested in these issues i feel like you should read my book because um this was kind of the exact dilemma that played out in ethereum's early years um but you had tweeted that the boarded yacht club or that you think that boarded yacht club has become the disney of our generation can you talk about like what your vision is of you know where where board apiac club is going and then like how you think that vision will blend with this kind of like dow ownership and you know just how how hard it is really to have a community kind of execute on a vision like that yeah so then i'm switching over my house because i'm also an investor with ftx ventures in yugo labs which is the holding company for um board yacht club ip also um crypto punks and ebits and um and yeah i mean google labs is um headed up by um nicole um muniz and then um her team and uh it's i mean they're like visionary in terms of um the plans that they have in building sort of metaverse game but then also other games within the metaverse and then other collabs whether it's like in the commerce space to the um to media to sort of you know shows et cetera that they have like kind of that they're brainstorming and and a lot like sort of like in in process of building out it's um it's an incredibly expansive vision and um they think about companies like disney as the north star in the sense that you know the company has incredibly valuable ip for example or a yacht club that then can be essentially activated in so many amazing consumer products whether that's in the form of a merchandise or a sh or a movie or a game et cetera and um of course like now the um sort of like the responsibility is to create these amazing consumer experiences but i think you know it's like an incredibly like hardworking and solid team operating um at the helm of yuga along with the original founders you know that are involved in the creative side day-to-day as they're building towards this these consumer products are not built overnight you know like their builds over years and um and that's sort of like the time frame that the team has in terms of um building out this this brand and then like you know what do they see as kind of their purview and what do they see is the dao's purview yeah i mean the dao is um so i mean yugo labs is building out the business for yugo labs and then the dao is essentially a um sort of like a sister community right that is really meant for the community around this ip to take charge take governance um and um and also you know kind of do what they want with the token to just generate like ip and projects etc i mean obviously like the there's um there's partnership in that but i think it's pretty awesome like you have a kind of like the centralized company that um that owns one set of ip and then their sister community that is able to actively participate as part of the dao so i i did hear that some people in the apecoin community felt that there wasn't a need for um boarding uh yacht club to have its own coin which is this ape coin that we have talking about or ape what do you have to say to that well i would say that not everyone can afford a 250 000 nft and actually i think it's very democratizing to um have a token that people can buy one of for a fraction of the cost and still feel like they're part of the community and they can vote as part of the community um and vote as part of the dow and um be an active participant and speculate if they want to or use it more as like they're and then eventually you know as they're more projects that come online that utilize the token that they can you know participate in that and build on that if they want to so i i i think of it as a democratizing move and then for eighth itself like would have to happen for that coin to rise in value like what what is the you know price indicative of if you ask that of any crypto token it's like literally nobody in the world can predict like on a short a medium term where the price goes um we can't even predict that for ftt our token i mean in general in terms of a long-term perspective it's general you know it's like if you are generating valuable projects and building valuable projects and partnering with projects that embed the tokens that have a lot of usage generally that should be in line with generating value for the token and i think we have seen that in like some of the uh more popular tokens like um ethereum or um for example ftt and solana and others and and hopefully that will be um the eight coin as well and um and you can see you know like i think some of the prices reacting um around the projects that will be launched and then obviously there's a lot of responsibility in these projects actually being great experiences and fun experiences for um the community and the user base and so um but it's not like a one-time thing it's like over time there will be dozens and dozens of projects launched and um and hopefully like the overtime there will be like a very valuable body of assets that um that the token holders can you know participate in and that is all correlated with long-term price and i think there are also maybe questions about whether or not ape is a security what do you have to say about that i think that you know we're all kind of in crypto waiting to see what the the black and white lines are that defines a token as a security and um i think that the team that launched the token has done pretty much everything everything in their power to try to align with like the latest or guidance they have around it to have it not be a token um but again there's like not that much like hard line regulations around that and so they'll adjust like as there is yeah and obviously gary gensler has uh the head of the sec now might have different views than uh even predecessors um so in an announcement video hugo labs said the other side which seems to be this like metaverse that they're launching will be coming in april we are recording this on april 20th um should we be expecting something imminently or you know kind of what can we expect they do have some imminent um uh i think activities um that people are discussing uh today uh but in terms of like the metaverse game like what i would say is that um a metaverse theme is a multi-year endeavor right like at um they're like you know you guys going to be launching components of it continuously but it's not like a huge game is gonna launch all of one go like really on the beauty of a open world type of game which is what um what this like you know other side vision is is that experiences and games within other side are going to launch over the next like number of years and um and that's what's like we're most excited about all right so we're a bit more than a quarter of the way into 2022. what new developments or trends are you watching for the rest of the year i think that nfts have done better than we expected it is an asset class within crypto that has taken a life of its own that's quite separate from the hardcore d5 community and it's being increasingly coming up in conversation with the biggest brands in the world there's hardly one that's not thinking about it you know um and so i think we're within let's say 12 to 18 months of very awesome creative you know and not you know like experiments and and brands like launching things in the space and what i'm super excited about is utility like just pfp projects less interesting i think for everybody now right like utility much more interesting whether it's like you know membership gating access to experiences et cetera like that's so much more interesting so you know i spent most my time with three and i will continue to there's so much activity going on like across the world and across like new companies building the space so like large large companies building the space and whereas the beginning of the year i was sort of like i'm kind of like regretting how most of the spaces actually just takes in shovels place in in the nft world actually we're like seeing amazing projects launching i mean moon birds obviously you know kevin rose's project recently and um and others uh sort of like um in pipeline and i would say that you know at the beginning of the year i figured we i think we also predicted that it was going to be a big year for um blockchain infrastructure and that will continue to be like an area of intense like of intense um interest like some of the strongest blockchain developers right now our are building in sort of like the pixel shovels infrastructure space and so we're really excited about that although um what this space needs is more killer apps and so like you know kind of like that's what i'm really excited about finding and um and investing in is like really strong traditional teams for me particularly in consumer that are looking to build the next like dating app or social network or you know other sort of consumer apps um embedding um web3 elements like token fungible non-fundable tokens in really creative ways like live streaming shopping um like i'm interested in those use cases because i think that's what's really going to bring like the next like 100 million um to billion users in crypto and that's what i'm most excited about still i don't even know what that means live streaming shopping and like how would that incorporate nfts or crypto so like hypothetically i mean if obviously live streaming shopping is huge in asia i mean does that literally mean like i i walk around from shop to shop and i live stream myself shopping or i don't get what that means okay so that so the core use case would be um you are logging onto a website and watching an influencer like um essentially it's like basically a modern qvc right you're you're watching an influencer like sell items like a lot of a lot of which are like collectibles right and it's like it's a form of entertainment basically it's like imagine if i'm watching youtube or streaming but now i can like buy the item as well and that's basically like live stream shopping and it's huge in china um and some other asian markets and there's a couple of companies like um pop shop live and others in the us that are um that are earlier stage that are trying to make that happen here and um and so like imagine if like if um one of these platforms can incorporate like a token as a means to essentially like rewards membership maybe get free shipping if you if you launch uh if you like own the token that the the platform has launched um the influencers can sell nfts as well like on the platform they're already selling a lot of collectibles you know a lot of them are selling like sneakers and mystery boxes and things like that so i think it's like i'm just giving that as one example another use case that i just haven't really seen yet that i would love to is the intersection of like web 3 and dating apps like you know how do people incentivize maybe like friends introducing their friends dates utilizing tokens in some way that would be super interesting and um so yeah but like how how would you incorporate that um maybe you can get rewarded more tokens if you um introduce a friend to a date where they go on a third date or something like that right you're incentivizing great day dates referrals i'm just throwing that idea out there yeah or you get like 10 times the amount of tokens if they actually get married oh my god yeah or like 100 times right that's priceless um yeah i actually i actually know some people who are extremely good at this and like have you know set up multiple couples so yeah so then it's like you get cred you know you you are a hyper connector of people on dates and high quality dates and so therefore maybe you have like a higher score and so you can you can like collect like you get dropped like more valuable and a tease or something like that i don't know like there's a lot of different ways to potentially get that i think i had tweeted about this once and then people were like no this sounds like it's a terrible idea and i'm like honestly i'd love to see this in practice yeah i don't know it's one of those things where yeah it depends on the implementation i could see it going wrong but you know it could also work um well this has been super fun thank you so much for coming on unchained where can people learn more about you and ftx let's see so um both ftx um and also myself we're very active on twitter so you can find me at amytongwoo i handle on twitter and my dms are open for folks that want to reach out perfect
