look at the signals that the US is sending and look at the signals that Hong Kong is sending or look at the signals that Japan is sending we can talk about Japan in a minute but you know we have the US basically doing this sort of Regulation by enforcement you know the SEC cracking down on various players even if you agree with what the SEC is doing I think most people in the crypto industry do not agree with the process right they think that this is incredibly confusing they think that it's gonna it's gonna scare crypto projects from out of the U.S you know the U.S I think if you just take a step back and look at the message that the U.S is sending it's kind of sending a message that crypto is something to protect people from first and foremost right and so then you look at Hong Kong and don't get me wrong I don't think it's going to be easy to to set up a crypto business in Hong Kong not at all like I think they're going to be very strict but you also kind of get the feeling that they're they also see it as an opportunity
