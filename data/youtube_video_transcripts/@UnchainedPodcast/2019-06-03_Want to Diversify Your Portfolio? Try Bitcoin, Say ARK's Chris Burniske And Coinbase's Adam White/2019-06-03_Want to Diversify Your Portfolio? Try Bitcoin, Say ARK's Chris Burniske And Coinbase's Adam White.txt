welcome to forbs podcasts hi everyone welcome to Unchained a forbes podcast produced by fractal recording I'm your host Lauren a Forbes contributor recovering blockchain digital currencies and FinTech thanks for tuning in today I have two guests first is Chris Byrne Eskie blockchain analyst and products lead at Ark investment management which is the first public fund manager to invest in Bitcoin and the only one offering ETS with Bitcoin exposure joining Chris is Adam White vice president of business development and strategy at coinbase which runs a popular Bitcoin consumer wallet and an institutional exchange called G Dax welcome guys hi Laura thanks for having us Kirsten Adam are here today to talk about Bitcoin and more generally cryptocurrencies as a new asset class a topic they explored in depth in a white paper they co-wrote but before we dive into their findings Chris can you tell us a bit more about yourself in arc sure so arc is an investment manager that was founded about two and a half years ago and we were founded with the mission to inject the open source ethos of software development into Wall Street research and asset management what that means is we share all of our research and publish every single trade we make so that the public can see everything we're doing and question our actions which makes us better and keeps them informed we focus on the innovations that are shaping our future so things like autonomous vehicles robots cloud and of course blockchain technology and so we use those investment themes to create ETFs as you mentioned and so I I am both an analyst and a product lead so that's a combination of research and business development and I've written a number of white papers in the blockchain space now while I'm bullish on blockchain technology generally I'm most bullish on permissionless innovation great Adam tell us about yourself coinbase in G Dax sure so I lead partnerships and strategy at coinbase coin basis what are the easiest places to buy sell and store Bitcoin so for context we've done almost four and a half billion dollars of transactions for our customers I've been with coinbase for almost three years it was originally focused on bringing Bitcoin to merchants like overstock Expedia and Dell computers and more recently I've been heading up product for G Dax which is our institutional exchange and one of the most liquid trading exchanges in the US and throughout the world great so let's talk about your white paper in order to determine whether Bitcoin represented a new asset class what criteria did you look at so initially what we did is we reviewed a bunch of the pre-existing literature out there as with most research it's important to first know what's been done already and so one of the seminal papers is a paper written by Robert Greer I am amused by the name it's called what is an asset class anyway and what's pretty clear in that paper is while there are some well-known characteristics there's still a lot of work to be done in in precisely defining what an asset classes so building upon Greer's work and a few of the other notable names out there we came up with four key metrics one was invest ability and assets must first meet that metric and that's broken into two things one is sufficient liquidity so enough volume turning over every day and then the second is mechanisms to invest if an asset meets that which it's pretty clear bitcoin does it trades over a billion dollars a day in exchanges and arguably just as much o TC then we went on to look at three other things one was the political economic profile so and that's something we can get into later but it's the basis of value the governance the use cases next was the correlation so how does Bitcoin move in relation to other assets in the capital markets when it goes up do other assets go down and vice-versa and the last one was the risk reward profile which is a combination of absolute returns and volatility and I'm sure we'll get into that as well and when you looked at the data what did you discover I think we were surprised to find how neatly Bitcoin differentiated itself from other asset classes so like Chris commented on one of the first things we looked at was what's the basis of governance for Bitcoin how is its value created when you compare that to other asset classes like precious metals commodities like oil foreign currencies even things like the equities market and and what we found is that Bitcoin or more largely digital currencies really kind of differentiate themselves uniquely so one is the breadth the price behaves very differently to market forces so essentially what we did is we calculated a one-year rolling correlation among these variant asset classes and looked across the board in Bitcoin had near zero correlation to all of them so what that implied to us is that Bitcoin doesn't follow in line with other assets for example if the price of equities are moving up does Bitcoin move up with it or does it actually move in the opposite direction and we found that it does neither so to us this idea of diversifying one's portfolio with an alternative asset class like Bitcoin could be a prudent move for for many asset managers or individuals the other thing we found that was really unique was looking at the risk the risk reward profile what that basically is is a measure of risk in the form of price volatility to reward which is essentially just the absolute returns of Bitcoin and when you compare those two you get something called the Sharpe ratio which is just a measure of return per unit of risk and what we found is that Bitcoin better compensates investors for the risk they're taking three over the last five years so there's always a lot of talk about Bitcoin being inherently volatile or far too risky of an investment and what we wanted to do was measure that against the return of Bitcoin and while there's no doubt that bitcoin is more volatile than other asset classes we've seen two things happen we've seen that that volatility decrease over time over 50% in the last few years but we've also seen the return of Bitcoin outperformed that amount of risk so to us two big takeaways were that not only was Bitcoin differentiated in the fact that it wasn't correlated to other asset class is that have really provided a nice return to investors and Laura all add on to to Adam there I think from the the qualitative side as we worked to define the asset as well as Adam mentioned early on this idea of governance so when I talk with people within the financial services space one of the first things they always ask me is who's controlling this and it's kind of this mind-blowing concept of they're technically is no single person controlling this no single entity it's a balance between all the stakeholders and that's really not something that we've seen with most any typical capital market asset and the other one is use cases you know and this is really greenfield territory for a Bitcoin in terms of you know I wouldn't use Apple stock to necessarily transfer ownership of my house but I could potentially use Bitcoin especially as we roll out seg wit and we see a more flexible scripting language in the future okay and just unpack that a little bit at the end what like what did you mean when you talked about a scripting language and segments okay yes so segue is a shorthand for segregated witness it's actually something that should be activated within the the core of Bitcoin software in the coming weeks and what it does is it does a number of things but most importantly by segregating the the signature that goes along with with every transaction it both allows more transactions to be fit into a block about sixty percent more but it also allows a more flexible signature types so to speak so you can do more varied forms of transactions okay and so for the less technical part of you know members of our audience essentially it means that it's going to make Bitcoin more efficient and in a certain way more flexible to be used for other assets is not correct yes and use cases like the Lightning Network which will allow high-speed micro transactions and then also this whole idea of side chains where you start to connect other block chains and anchor them in Bitcoin or you can exchange assets between different block chains this this all gets deeper into the technicals but I think the important thing for the listener to realize is that Bitcoin is very flexible it gets this bad rap in terms of being rigid compared to aetherium but in time I think we'll see the two become very flexible and and compatible with one another and essentially they take away for investors is that soon though they'll be able to trade different types of investment products that are digital currencies is that is that the thinking yeah I think that's generally our philosophy and mine as well is that right now what we see is Bitcoin is the first prime example of this new asset class which we refer to as digital currencies but even that name itself doesn't quite capture what the underlying asset is well Bitcoin is kind of used as a currency I can send you money just like I can send an email to anyone it's this idea of an international network for value transfer like Chris alluded to there's other assets that you could also move through Bitcoin it could be proof of ownership it could actually be something like a security or even Land Registry so for in larger context we look at Bitcoin is the first example of a digital currency but I think our belief is that we're gonna see a world where there's not just one mastered digital currency being that Bitcoin we may see a world where there's multiple digital currencies in each one solving a different problem we're seeing this happen with aetherium coming online and having a higher-order scripting language to create things like smart contracts which Bitcoin itself is not incapable of doing but it's just more difficult to do at this stage but at the end of the day all digital currencies are is programmatic money it's a way for machines to essentially talk one another and move value in an distributed manner I think what we'll see is a world where there's many digital currencies but they all settle and clear programmatically with one another and the end user isn't going to have to worry about am i holding Bitcoin am i holding ether am i holding something new all together it's the same way that when I swipe my credit card to buy a cup of coffee at Starbucks I don't understand the inner plumbing of how a credit card network functions and an issuing bank an acquiring bank all I need to know is that values move for my account ultimate in the merchant and in return on benefiting from that service or product that I wanted to acquire well that's interesting because normally I think of you know when you have a cryptocurrency you're spending like just that Bitcoin or you know in the same way that I would think about so many dollars or Euros but you're saying that eventually someday they're they'll be used in the background and whether you have ether or Bitcoin or whatever it won't matter and it won't just be take oh that's fascinating I think I think that's exactly right one of the things I always think about is potentially Bitcoin succeeds when no one knows they're using it so a good example of this is like we like to think that payments find the path of least resistance right the most frictionless way to move value right now when I use Apple pay I have a credit card tied to my iPhone so when I tap my phone values transferred through that credit card network but credit card networks carry with them high fees and other things digital currencies do not so over time I think we could see a world where when I tap my phone on ambivalent that instead of value moving through my Visa card it's now moving through Bitcoin because in the day I'm not even focused on what that rail is I'm just focused on the end product or service that that value transfers is providing me with okay yeah and there are some startups that are using Bitcoin in exactly this way to move money in the background like circle or opera or a lion commerce exactly all right so actually let's move away from some of the consumer applications and talk about what professional traders are doing are we seeing them approach digital currencies as an investment I think we are I think we're still in the early days of how investors are creating a thesis around this emerging asset class called digital currencies we very much are seeing greater and greater interest in the investable 'ti of Bitcoin early on 2013-2014 I think most of the focus was on the applications of the technology so we saw people using Bitcoin in a transactional medium those were the merchants accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment as that really demonstrated a viable use case for Bitcoin I think what we've seen are more individuals and institutions alike come online and say hey this this idea of a blockchain has value and bitcoin is just one example and the largest example of a public blockchain there's real value in to owning a piece of that a token that helps power the network and what we're seeing is that transactional volume compared to trading volume is actually shifting that we're seeing greater number or greater value of Bitcoin moving into the trading world than we are in the actual transacting a good example of this is on a worldwide daily basis we see well over a billion dollars of Bitcoin traded globally per day and that's not on par with some of the equities and and obviously FX markets of the world but it is a good sign that this market is not ill not as illiquid and thinly traded as many believe we're really seeing it emerge as a global asset that that many people can and do trade and Laura I mean part of what led Adam and I to actually brainstorm and around this paper and write the paper was this idea of institutional interest and institutional investors and in validating with academic rigor the many ways in which bitcoin is displaying asset class characteristics and so as Adam alluded to when you look at the trading to transacting ratio for Bitcoin it's currently just under 10 whereas global fiat currency is a tad over 20 so what we're seeing is a building amount of liquidity in terms of bitcoins trading volume which is dropping volatility as we mentioned earlier that's bringing a more institutional interest and then also a very topical right now right is and so I was on CNBC recently because a lot of institutional investors are freaked out about the capital markets at the moment people are fleeing from equities to bonds there's negative interest rates and so people are looking for areas to protect themselves and while bitcoin is still volatile it's been about as volatile as as oil over the last year it's increasingly being used I like to call it as a disaster hedge within the capital markets for capital market participants and so again that's why we're seeing a lot of volume both from exchanges but also over-the-counter more which is a darker pool but some people are positing that over-the-counter volume is on par with exchange volume which you could therefore argue bitcoin may be trading almost two billion dollars a day now there's a lot that goes into that and people are concerned about how much volume goes through China which is something we can we can get into I see it as all good for the ecosystem but again that this is part of what led us to write the white paper so there are a few things I want to actually dive into a bit more in your answer why don't we keep going with this you know talk about brexit i think adam was saying that he pulled some interesting data about you know what was happening in terms of Bitcoin around that time what did you end up seeing you have first stuff let me just caveat this and say it's really difficult to separate how brexit is affecting the Bitcoin world because there's a lot going on right now we're seeing China continue to devalue the yuan we have something called the Bitcoin having event coming up which is a change in how much a new bitcoins introduced every day so there's really a lot of hat a lot happening but what we did at coin base is being one of the largest Bitcoin retail conversion services as we said let's take a look at our customers in the UK and let's see how their activity patterns have changed over the last week and essentially what we've seen is a double-digit increase in the number of new user signups as well as the amount of Bitcoin purchased so very specifically what we saw is the number of daily signups that usually occur doubled on the day of the brexit announcement so we saw a lot of people in the UK start to say you know what maybe there is value in being part of this global interconnected inherently international payment method called Bitcoin and we saw essentially a doubling of new users sign up for our existing users we saw a 3.5 X increase in the amount of Bitcoin they purchase on a daily basis so well I think it's too early to still say Bitcoin is really this new safe haven investment I do think we are starting to see initial signs of people approaching it that way and even more generally that people are discovering the value of a secure alternative investment when we seat times of like global economic turmoil and Adam correct me if I'm putting words in your mouth here but I recall from prior conversations we've had when we had the Greek debt crisis in summer of last year didn't you guys see a similar pattern in terms of increased interest from that area we did the numbers were actually eerily similar so we saw what looked like a doubling of new user signups as well as even a greater number of Bitcoin purchase so when we were initially talking grexit about a year or so ago and now brexit we're seeing very similar patterns with the wake our users and new users approach digital currency and what about other world events those you know obviously in grexit and brexit are pretty similar so are there other world events where you've seen you know and driving other kinds of behaviors so Adam mentioned one right and that's the fear of a devaluation of the yuan there's because roughly 90 percent of the volume driven through exchanges is is coming through Chinese exchanges there's a lot of hypotheses out there and we do see instances of either when there's chatter about devaluation of the yuan or when it actually manifests we do see some some spike in volume there did you have any other thoughts around that Adam not so much of the global macroeconomic environment I do think very unique Bitcoin you have this thing called the having which is what I alluded to a few minutes ago essentially says that every day new bitcoin is minted or mined very similar to how gold is mined and brought into the world on a daily basis but that amount or that rate and bitcoin is actually set at the protocol level so it's not something any individual or entity controls it's written corn to the code of the software and what we're seeing is in about ten days the amount of Bitcoin created is going to be cut in half and what's really interesting is watching how the market is actually pricing this end to the to the price of Bitcoin at a high level I think it's already largely factored in this is something that's been known it's very transparent from the earliest days of Bitcoin right so it's not a a central bank like event where they announced kind of quantitative easing or a new inflationary target rate this is something that everyone's known from the get-go but what we are seeing is a lot of interest leading up to this event because regardless of what happens if the demand stays the same what we know is the supply of new bitcoins going to be cut in half that may have an upward effect on the price of Bitcoin alright great so um I'm gonna circle back to what Chris was talking about when he you know mentioned that you guys had the idea to work on this white paper because of institutional behavior zebra seeing can you tell me a little bit more about how you came to work together and how you came up with the idea to write the white paper sure I'll take that one I mean as most things start it's not as romantic of a stories that I'd like to be able to tell it was essentially reading the news and watching how arc invest took a very public and I thought a very important stake is introducing gbtc into one of the the first ETS if not the first ETF that was publicly traded bull can you tell people what gbtc is sure of course let me turn this over to you because you did a lot of study on this yeah great so gbtc is in over-the-counter security so what that means you can kind of think of it like a publicly traded equity like Facebook stock it's a little different but that that is what gbtc is and it tracks to one tenth of the value of one Bitcoin now the way that gbtc is created is investors that exit from the Bitcoin investment trust which is a private placement trust those investors can sell into the public markets and exit their private placement sort of when a company comes public that private equity gets sold into the public markets that's sort of the process from the Bitcoin investment trust into gbtc now the thing with gbtc is it's a quasi closed-ended fund so what that means is only when investors sell out from the Bitcoin investment trust into the gbtc is more gbtc created and so that's why we actually see gbtc often trading at a premium to bitcoins price now interestingly since we invested in gbtc in early days for that product it was September of 2015 we had instances where we bought gbtc at a discount to to one tenth of a Bitcoin and it has since gone 5x for us we we have it in two of our ETFs our next-generation Internet ETF AR kW and our overall innovation ETF err KK and it's grown to a top ten position in both I think in terms of building on what Adam was saying about how we came together you know obviously coinbase is a thought leader in the space and Ark has been building its its way towards being as much as well and we connected on an intellectual level both curious about everything going on in the space both realizing that a lot of education is still needed especially to bring this back around to to your more typical investor or more typical world world citizen and so that's what was the genesis for this white paper and we'll be working on future white papers here in the near future and so do you want to finish the story about that's it the only part that curse left out is that we originally connected over a bowl of thaw in midtown Manhattan and like he said discovered a shared interest in how the investment community was approaching digital currencies and specifically decided to dive into Bitcoin and bring kind of a unique perspective from both sides Chrisann dark side obviously with thematic research and really understanding kind of institutional investors and coin bases perspective which has a unique insight into what our four million customers are doing with Bitcoin around the world so let's talk about other digital assets there have been hundreds of so-called altcoins developed some of them were well known are ether litecoin and XRP which is by Ripple many of them languish and value though what separates Bitcoin from these other altcoins that have not increased in value yeah I think it's really kind of three things number one is Bitcoin has a first mover advantage so we have to remember Bitcoin itself so only been around for seven years but it was the first to introduce this idea of a decentralized blockchain from that you have things like network effects right the more people use it the more valuable it is for others to use it that is a tremendous first mover advantage that Bitcoin has over other digital currencies second second is it's also the most well known obviously a lot of the press and public became first aware of Bitcoin in 2012-2013 when we saw some of its meteoroid rises in value and since then it's always been on the radar of people's interest I think much more so than other more obscure or newer digital currencies um the second one is that it has a clearly differentiated value proposition when you look at other all coins many of them for lack of a better term are really just copycats to Bitcoin they take what's essentially bitcoins open-source protocol and tweak something very minor such as the time to discover a new block or the amount of digital currency that's introduced over time these really aren't differentiated value propositions and so there's not a unique or compelling case for people to shift from using Bitcoin to another all coin now third is bitcoins track record of success right this protocol has been around for almost seven years it's really the first one introduced and it's been vetted and tested what's essentially the largest white hat hacker program in the world right because if anyone can figure out how to break the Bitcoin protocol there's a tremendous prize on the other side of that up to this point no one has we've definitely seen Bitcoin companies built on top of Bitcoin have been hacked or compromised but Bitcoin itself never has that trust that belief that Bitcoin has a very solid foundation is why we believe we continue to see people interested in in Bitcoin rather than alternative digital currencies and I I agree with everything Adams said there and I want to emphasize one of his points and that's the idea of network effects this is something that we maniacally focus on at arc because the the basic idea of the network effect right it's best exemplified by the telephone if I alone have a telephone then that telephone is pretty useless however if Adam has a telephone and I have a telephone it gets more useful and Laura if you have a telephone then it gets even more useful because we have three people with telephones now with Bitcoin it has two really great network effects one is the network effect of more users the more people that I can send Bitcoin to and that can send it to me and we can use in different ways the more valuable it becomes and then there's a network effect of developers right developers like working with other really smart developers and building cool products for people and so these two network effects feed back into one another I think what we've seen with a lot of the other altcoins or public blockchain cryptocurrencies out there is that while they they come out hot they they don't get that flywheel effect going of the network effect and so it's easy for them after a period to fade into obsolescence I think you know cerium has done a great job of getting over that hump or that activation energy so to speak and it's it's actually something that we follow very closely it's you know we've had some developers shift from they claim to aetherium and so I as an investment manager that holds Bitcoin we very closely track these user and developer trends are there any other factors that investors should look at when they're deciding whether or not to put their money in a new cryptocurrency aside from network effect yes definitely I I think this is we're looking at things from a holistic perspective from from investors entire portfolio is really important because the rapp that Bitcoin always gets is oh it's too risky and risk is quantified most commonly by volatility how much does this go up and down every day as Adam mentioned earlier volatility has been dropping significantly but bitcoin is still a volatile asset now when you combine looking at volatility with this idea of correlation of returns what's interesting is let's say on one day Facebook stock goes up but on that same day Bitcoin stock goes down or Bitcoin itself goes down and and then on the next day it's vice-versa what actually starts to happen is those price movements counteract one another and so the entire investment portfolio becomes less volatile and therefore less risky and this is kind of a mind-blowing idea but it's it's one of the cores to modern portfolio theory and it's basically this you can have a more volatile asset but if it's zero to negatively correlated with other assets in your portfolio it can actually decrease the overall risk of your portfolio and we have seen instances of this with Bitcoin in the past for example if you had swapped 1% of equity so stock positions in your portfolio into Bitcoin in late 2014 you actually would have seen both the overall risk of your portfolio decrease and the absolute returns of your portfolio increase that is you know an investor's dream and that's something that's really important for people to realize when they're thinking about putting this into their portfolios so speaking about risk before brexit the cryptocurrency community poured more than 150 million dollars into crowdfunding the Dow which is what's known as a decentralized autonomous organization and that is essentially an entity whose actions are governed by a series of bylaws that are programmed into computer code but loopholes in that code allowed about 16 million dollars of the Dow's currency which was called a doubt Okun to be stolen when looking to invest in cryptocurrencies how can investors protect themselves from adverse events like this I think the answer is a very simple one its investors have to do their homework they have to understand the risks they have to know the idea of the investment they're entering into and there's no substitute other than spending the time and energy to understand what that is many times and for example in our white paper that Chris and I wrote we pointed to Satoshi nakamoto's original white paper is one of the first sources that all interested investors should read for things like aetherium and doubt tokens I think that holds up as well I don't think there's any investment manager out there or individual necessarily that would invest in an asset class they don't fully understand so first and foremost you have to do your homework the caveat to that is I'm acutely aware and I think many are that's not always possible when we're looking at things like smart contracts or decentralized autonomous organizations that raise essentially crowdfunding on a decentralized manner this is really pushing the envelope of of technology in capital markets however there are those out there that have the ability to read and understand code and that's the beautiful thing about digital currencies like Bitcoin and aetherium and digital assets like doubt tokens the structure protocol for how that asset is governed is entirely open-source and I look at it much like learning a new language I may not invest in something that I can't understand but if I can learn the language to read and understand that I think it'll help me make a more informed decision so really at a high level you've got to do your homework and you've got to understand what you're investing in and I I do want to point something out here with with the Dow and it's something I think investors should take into consideration when they're looking at these different assets and that is the underlying security right so the Dow was an application that rode on top of aetherium so we can think of aetherium or Bitcoin and the theorems blockchain and bitcoins blockchain sort of as an operating system right and just as I have my my Mac operating system and I have applications on top of that operating system those are fundamentally different things and so while the the Dow was compromised and it looks like they are going to resolve things that that is a very different beast from the security of the theorems blockchain and so this was actually something I focused on a different white paper and that was looking at the long term security of how the underlying compute infrastructure is incentivized and so that's something again as Adam was saying investors need to do do their homework and it's on it's upon us that are involved in the community to make sure that we do our homework and really educate everyone as best we can yeah that's that's right I think the Dow and really aetherium are still an experiment right aetherium the the blockchain the the worldwide computer in essence has really only been around for about a year we'd be remiss if we said this is absolutely gonna be here to stay and the users need to explore the technology they need to test with it they need to experiment they need to play around they need to get their hands dirty and this is really what coin bases mission is all about is let's provide easy unfettered access for people that want to acquire a little bit of digital currency whether as an investment or whether they actually want to use the applet they actually want to use the network to send and remit value there are services like coinbase to try to do this in a very simple easy to easy to do way but ultimately we're in the early innings of this kind of new wave of digital currency aside from Bitcoin the most well known or at least the most popular cryptocurrency is ether have you looked at the investing behavior on ether how is it different so I can I can head that off I think well one of the things I find interesting about ether is early days I mean so-so Vitalik Bhutto rain he announced it in January of 2014 which actually coincidentally was the same month that arc was founded and and early on the the core developers of etherium and and ethers the cryptocurrency that rides rides atop etherium they said this is not meant to be used as an as an investment ether is converted into to gas and gas pays for computational units which perform operations within the theorems world computer and and the smart contracts therein so I I think of ether more as digital oil and Bitcoin more as digital gold now that said you know people invest in in oil and people invest in gold in the the quote unquote traditional capital markets these are just digital forms of those things I think when when I look at an ether long term so I got lucky enough to to invest in it on January of 2016 and so I've been a happy investor but when I when I look longer term it's going to be slightly inflationary that's that's sort of the equilibrium thinking there and that slight inflation rate is good match roughly the amount of ether that people lose through through different manners whether they lose their private key or ether is burned or whatever it may be so that's one thing that people should realize the other thing for an investment manager from arc and and as Adam said it is such early days or ether that institutional investors have a much harder time getting access to it or getting comfortable with it the liquidity is is a fraction that of bitcoins and there's no instrument like even if ark wanted to own ether right now there's no way we could possibly do that and so I think again as we have seen with Bitcoin it's just going to take time there's going to be this flywheel effect and it should become you know I see no reason for it to be any smaller than Bitcoin what developments do you expect to see in the future in terms of cryptocurrencies as an asset class I think one most notably jumps out to mind and that's greater institutionalization I think up to now it's really been difficult for investors whether they be individuals or institutions to have exposure to this asset class companies like coin base trying to make it easy for people to buy a little bit of Bitcoin and store it but what we're seeing is an emergence of the infrastructure the exchanges that allow liquidity and trading for that price discovery process to happen the infrastructure is coming into place and I think we're gonna see greater institutionalization for in the form of new products mainstream access and really Bitcoin and digital currencies will look like any other asset that investment managers may want to add to their portfolio what's gonna be driven from that though is that this idea why someone wants to invest in Bitcoin is gonna move from a belief that the technology is going to be used greater in the future to actual reality we're gonna see that happen what we're gonna see are greater applications actually using Bitcoin and digital currencies the use cases things like using Bitcoin for micro payments or machine to machine payments I think we'll see those come to fruition we're gonna see that end value to the consumer actually in practice and I think that's only gonna add a flywheel effect to investors realizing that Bitcoin and digital currencies are here to stay and then it's something that they should look at it investing in in an example of a machine and machine payment would be like if we're driving and we're not driving but we're riding in autonomous vehicles and I want to faster than then your car I can pay you a little bit like in a micro payment to pass you exactly that's one of my favorite examples there's this kind of saying that's that's being tossed around that on the blockchain no one knows you're a refrigerator and then what it kind of represents is that in in reality in the real world I actually need to use my credit card or use a authorized payment credential to be able to to complete a transaction but Bitcoin at the core is just programmatic value transfer between two endpoints and opening that up to machines to do things like lane passing for self-driving cars or having my refrigerator order a new gallon of milk and having it delivered to my house I think we will see Bitcoin be integrated at the protocol level of the internet of things from the ground up and it's gonna open up tremendous possibilities we can't even imagine and Laura I just want to add on there I think when we look back to 2016 and 2015 and 2014 and and we're in the 2030s or whatever it may be we're gonna realize what early early days we were in when the internet was getting started there wasn't the Internet to disseminate the information about everything going on with with Bitcoin and blockchain technology right now all this information is flying around and so people get frustrated why isn't it doing this why isn't it doing that well this is a fundamentally new technology it's a general purpose technology so on par with the steam engine with the internet with machine learning and these things take a long time to build so a refrain you'll hear a lot in the space is we're in the like 1993 or 94 of the Internet where mosaic came out the first internet browser and so there's two sides to that one side is there's a really bright and promising future in front of us the other side is there's there's gonna be a lot of mistakes made a lot of pain and a lot of learnings which will drive the system and I think over time we will see an interconnected web of Cheng's much like the internet is composed of a massive system of intranets and and it's going to be that enter the the inter the different block chains that is going to be really important for the overall value out of the system what do each of you most people will take away from your white paper what I hope is that people begin to understand that while the technology may be difficult to understand the piece is to develop an investment thesis are there our attempt at this paper was to say you can very quantitatively measure the performance of this asset class and make an informed decision whether or not as something an asset manager or an individual wants to add to their portfolio so my hope very simply is that people use this paper as one of the pieces to start developing their own investment thesis Chris and I I follow along very similar lines as Adam it's really important to me that people realize this is no longer a fringe technology or a dark asset this is a innovation that is something that deserves utmost respect and atop that technology is is this asset that displays really awesome characteristics for someone's portfolio and it's pretty clear to me that while bitcoin is the first of its kind in this new asset class called crypto currencies there's going to be more to come and people should definitely be attuned to everything that's going on in this space and Chris where can our listeners find more of your work or contact you yes so arcs open source ethos allows us to put all of our research on our website so
