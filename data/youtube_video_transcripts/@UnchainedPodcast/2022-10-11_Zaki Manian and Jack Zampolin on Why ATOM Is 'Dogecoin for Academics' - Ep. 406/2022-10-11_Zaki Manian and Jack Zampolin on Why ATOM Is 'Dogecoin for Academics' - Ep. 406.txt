hey y'all I finally was able to fit an interview about Cosmos into the schedule the two guests zakimanian and Jack zampolin explain the technical appeal of Cosmos and why it is that developers are turning to application-specific blockchains they also defended against the notion that using app-specific blockchains breaks composability you can let me know how you think they answer that question we also talked about the recent proposal to change the cosmos Hub security model the issuance of the atom token which they called currently like Dogecoin for academics and we also discussed how Mev will be captured cross-chain they had a lot to say about governance Zuki said he believes no one really has control of Cosmos and all of this got me really interested to see what the trajectory of Cosmos and also Adam will be like over the next few years and now here are Zaki and jack on Cosmos and the changes proposed in the white paper hi everyone welcome to Unchained your no hype resource

zakimanian co-founder of sommelier protocol and co-founder of occlusion and Jack zamblin founder of strange love Ventures welcome Jack and zucky uh great to be here yeah thanks Laura let's start with each of your backgrounds ducky you've been with Cosmos for a while can you tell us how it is that you got involved and what your history is with the protocol yeah so my involvement with Cosmos started as many of these things do with uh there was the open source project tenderbend um so I met Jay back in like I think late 2013 maybe early the co-founder of yeah the co-founder of Cosmos the the creator of tender mint um and he had this you know I was just getting into cryptocurrency everyone was talking about proof of work proof of stake was like kind of a thing like Dan Larimer was talking about it for Eos but Jay had like what seemed like the best ideas of basically anyone I met in cryptocurrency he was like we're gonna have like blockchains uh you can take we can combined like what we have learned from like why Bitcoin works and why it's great um and combined it with all this academic research that has been sitting on the shelf for decades and no one has found a constructive use for we could put it all together and turn it into a it did something and so you know I started contributing in various ways to uh the tendermint project and then we uh we held a conference at our office they're called the there was a something called the crypto economic research Group which was this like mailing list back in the day and we held a conference for that mailing list and like people like Vlad and vitalik all came to this conference and I invited Jay because he was my friend and he presented tender mint and honestly I could see I remember seeing Vitale's eyes light up a lot what he saw like what Jay was doing and being like Oh like this is a good idea like we're maybe you know seven years later you know it's a you know ethereum is now proof of stake but uh you know back then we were so awake uh and then Ethan was friends with Vlad from college and uh uh it had been contributing to like early ethereum um like the early guest implementations and so Ethan came uh uh came to the conference Jane Ethan met that kind of otherwise like the first major full-time contributor now to tendermint was uh uh was Ethan they co-founded the company then they uh uh so it like really started to become a a sort of actual thing but then they tried to do Enterprise blockchains because that's what everybody was doing in 2015 and failed miserably and then in 2016 they were like we're gonna do a public blockchain and there were a series of ideas Jay had the idea these this idea called what Jay and Jahan who was his roommate a housemate had this idea called super tanker which looks awfully like what Celestia does today there were a whole bunch of iterations of ideas and eventually we came uh to what we now know as cosmos so like my involvement with the project just kept increasing 2016 I put the first what is like the first person to agree to put money into the project 20 by 2018 I was like full time on the project and then 2019 and then we had like sort of the famous explosion of tendermint in early 2020 and now I've kind of gotten much more back into Cosmos core so here we are and Jack what about you how do you get involved in Cosmos I uh I just got into cryptocurrency sort of in the 2013 wave as an investor for the first time and after that I kind of decided this is what I want to do and ended up teaching myself a bunch of programming going to a boot camp and I started working at a web 2 database company for a while and when the 2017 cycle came around I had a friend who had started working for Block stack which is uh based in New York uh great Bitcoin company and I joined them and did that for the 2017 cycle and after that I you know they sort of ended up going a different direction and I did too and I was kind of debating whether or not I wanted to get into cryptocurrency really keep in cryptocurrency and I was like looking at a couple of different things and tenderment was definitely one of them I wanted to go right go again I wanted to work on distributed system stuff and I had been through a couple rounds of interviews um and my next interview was with Zacky and I got on the phone with Zacky and he was like in and out of an Uber and we were on the phone for like 15 minutes and at the end he goes yeah so uh I'd love to hire you and uh we'll get you over an offer and hung up on me and I was like that is the most wild interview I've ever had and uh sure enough two hours later I had an offer and uh that was kind of how I got started uh working at Cosmos in early 2018. yeah it's uh it's been really fun since then sometimes when you know you just know I love it I am a big proponent of listening to your gut so um clearly if you're still here four years later then sucky made the right choice so before we get into all the nitty-gritty on Cosmos um why don't we just briefly also describe Somalia protocol and occlusion for zucky and then afterwards check you can talk about Strangelove so sommelier is a cosmos chain we do decentralized actively managed defy strategies which is a a pretty unique offering in the world we have an Ave strategy that is live uh Jack is also a co-founder on the protocol we've continued to work on various things but it is a somewhat unique application of the cosmos technology stack but it is like a canonical example of an app chain but also we one of the other interesting things about it is all of our products are on ethereum so like there's a cosmos chain there's like Cosmos Tech inside but the product is on ethereum which is an interesting model and then inclusion started out as a validator so one of the big things that like Jack and I did in 2018 was like bootstrap this entole validator ecosystem as a way of making a sort of because it was necessary to get tender mint and proof of stake like out into the world um and so I just we decide you know I dog food my own validator but inclusion does a lot of other things now we primarily we run we still do infrastructure providing but we do a lot of like protocol Innovation and uh like uh helping with other uh like lots of different teams uh Jack you know I have a very large portfolio of advising and like ecosystem building and whatnot across a huge number of protocols the joke is always that like there's like three clones of me running around because like I'm uh like on the website of like you know I don't know like 30 projects as like some early person and yeah that's it's true there are three clones of me running her I've seen two of them in one room one time okay so Jack do you want to talk about Strange Love yeah absolutely so I'm kind of describe myself as the cosmos product guys so it's the product manager for the Hub and as a part of that with the cosmos SDK I ended up talking to a ton of projects so I also kind of ended up in this position where I was advising a bunch of folks and running validators on a number of networks and me and my business partner Tyler Schmidt took a lot of that and looped it into this company called Strangelove so uh what we do is primarily focused on building out the open source components of IBC and we also contribute to some other areas of Cosmos as well but uh we built uh relayers and sell RPC nodes and a number of other sort of like infrastructure type products you know Zaki mentioned that we worked really hard to bootstrap the validator set and that's always kind of been my expertise is the sort of infrastructure level stuff within Cosmos all right so now let's get into the nitty-gritty on Cosmos but we're going to start with a super basic question just to make sure all the listeners are on the same page why don't you guys explain what Cosmos is and also what application specific blockchains are okay I'll take the first shot at this um so Cosmos what is cosmos Cosmos has been described as an idea not a thing so like there's this big idea which is blockchains are a kind of new kind of computer a community computer that a computer that can be quite controlled and owned by multiple people it's like an extension of like first we had the Mainframe Computing Revolution then the personal Computing Revolution and now we have the community Computing Revolution and this is like a this is what we've been trying to like this is sort of where Cosmos is and if you're going to have Community computers they should be able to network together so that's like the Galaxy brain version of the idea the little bit more Nitty Gritty is Cosmos is a toolkit for building like an L1 blockchain so like many blockchains that people know about you know until it blew up the most famous one was the Terra Luna blockchain the cosmos Hub osmosis uh uh axolar uh many many other blockchains that I'm sure listers are familiar with are build with a set of tools the tools are the tender mint consensus engine the cosmos SDK and then if you build with those two things you can Bridge or connect or interoperate uh with any other blockchain in this ecosystem using a protocol called IBC and so this is this was is sort of uh is a has been a set of tools now why did we build these tools at the time of 2016 we saw smart contracts were starting to take off on ethereum but we had this like deep belief that like in the long run the most successful blockchain applications would not be smart contracts they would be like blockchains themselves that like the most important like the biggest most successful most important blockchain applications would end up being their own blockchains and that was like in a sort of uh somewhat inevitable progression and so what we needed to build was tools for people who may or may not have been building smart contracts at the time when they were ready and they kind of knew what they wanted from their application to build that application specific blockchain so on most other blockchains a DEX is a smart contract on in Cosmos a DEX is a blockchain uh where the logic of decentralized exchange is built into the core blockchain protocol uh you know lending protocols Etc we have application specific blockchains for all of these things and maybe this would be a question for Jack but when an entrepreneur is kind of trying to figure out how it is that they want to build whatever decentralized thing that they want to build what are you seeing in terms of kind of their thought process around choosing to yes build something more akin to a Smart contract on a layer one like ethereum versus um making an app specific blockchain on Cosmos kind of who goes with the first and who goes with the latter you know one of the sort of classes of blockchain that Cosmos has done a great job of capturing is all the exchange chains so okxchain crypto.com binance chain is built on an early version of the cosmos SDK so those users kind of want sovereignty and they want sort of control over the platform if you look back to web 2 and think about things like Farmville and a lot of these other Facebook games that got sort of rugged by platform changes the same thing can happen in blockchains too you know whether it's a upgrade to the underlying ethereum Network that changes the way you're making money or you know there's a huge nft mint that spikes fees and suddenly your app is unusable for long periods of time that's a risk that a lot of application developers don't want to take and those folks in kind of end up choosing their own blockchain but there's also folks like dydx who have built their stuff as a smart contract on another chain initially and then sort of seen some of these effects and then they sort of move over to an independent chain but the general theme there is sort of sovereignty and sort of controlling your own platform and that is uh really attractive to a wide spectrum of Developers yeah I saw an interview that um Antonio Giuliano the founder of dydx in it he addressed why it is that they were moving to Cosmos and he basically said that the ability to you know have their own set of validators and you know have them do some order book functions along with the validation was like part of a sort of this ability to kind of customize the way validation happens was was part of the appeal but then so would you say that for people who choose to go for instance you know in the other scenario on Via the smart contract route on ethereum would it be that then what they're looking for is more like that composability factor with other D5 projects and yeah it's just something that um is part of part of like a bigger ecosystem or what would you say there I think you know it's kind of a quick to launch thing too it's very easy to write a smart contract throw it up generate an easy front end off of it and start selling product to users and a lot of startups and apps want to do that if you look back at sort of traditional Computing you've got serverless platforms and infrastructure as a service stuff like gcp and AWS and then people can kind of run their own Data Center and that's kind of like a Continuum if you think about blockchains there's smart contracts there's run your own validator set and there's kind of a bunch of stuff in between like Celestia and shared Security on the Hub yeah it's just kind of different entrepreneurs different startups have different requirements and they sort of fall somewhere on that Spectrum and so for people that say that app chains are not very composable what would your response be to that try osmosis go for it it's okay the more actual the sort of more concrete answer is I kind of view that there's a trade-offs like so when you started out there were like a few the first few people to try to build Cosmos chains and this is before IBC people tried to build them and they really struggled with network effects like they struggled to get up listed on exchanges coyote onboard users they needed to get any users had to get new wallets like it was a whole whole nightmare for users and so like if you watched on a on an ethereum or Solana like you kind of got all those Network effects for free and you watched on Cosmos you did and what we have seen over the like sort of intervening time frame is the differentiation between like the network effects you have access to by launching on top of Cosmos and the network effects you have access to by launching on top of an established smart contract platform getting smaller and smaller and then composability is like is one of those Network effects you know can your system financially be composed uh with other systems and one of the whole points of or like what are the views of of Cosmos is that like the internet was built out of asynchronous composability like most Financial systems operate on asynchronous composability asynchronous composability there's no reason why we cannot build a Global Financial system out of asynchronous composability and so we are what you are starting to see is just like more and more interesting ways of composing things using IBC um where like transferring tokens from one blockchain to another was like like you know the email what the email was to the internet the uh transferring tokens is to like inner blockchain stuff and why we're starting to see much more sophisticated ways of composing blockchains starting to happen and like sommelier is a great example of that the sommelier chain controls and runs a set of smart contracts over on ethereum and is able to send ethereum transactions directly from the validator set of the sommelier chain that's a great example of asynchronous composability in production today the toolkit that IBC enables is just a lot more expressive in terms of The Primitives for building that kind of asynchronous composability offers much much more than pretty much all of their Bridges out there so you know what we're in the middle of seeing right now is the development of a bunch of new IBC protocols interchange accounts interchange queries the ability to read and write to other blockchains that can then be used in sort of cool and unexpected ways and we're starting to see the first set of those applications now yeah I would say that in general it feels like Cosmos is at an inflection point um obviously it's been generating a lot of good Buzz a lot of activity surprisingly or maybe not surprisingly it hasn't suffered Too Much from the collapse of Terra um even though as like you mentioned it was a cosmos chain and at the recent Cosmo verse conference you did reveal a revamped white paper so what was the impetus for that what problems did Cosmos have that the community was trying to address so we have this thing we call the cosmos Hub white paper so the framing for this was in 2016 we wrote a white paper Ethan and Jay wrote a white paper about this vision of of the cosmos Network and in that white paper almost nothing is mentioned about the atom token the cosmos Hub any of these things like it was like we have we we envisioned this network we envisioned this use case we envisioned proof of stake and so we're gonna like eat into the world a prototype of all of these ideas that runs on a token called a a thing called the cosmos Hub and that is going to be the product and you know if and for the people who participate in the community that was going to be like the coordination point of the selling point and we finished that white paper in 20 2021 like it was complete it's it's done like everything that was in the white paper exists in the world we completed the work and so one of the things though that has so as the network has grown and expanded we have about 50 IBC connected blockchains now in the network the atom token and the cosmos Hub has seemed directionless there's never there has not been a Clear Vision of of what it was we've started to add conceive of features that should be added to the cosmos Hub so like there's this New Concept called interchange security which actually uses IBC to like expand the number of blockchains that a single proof of stake token can secure it's sort of this form of shared security that we are building for the cosmos help but there's still no vision for the atom token and this lack of vision I feel like is really holding back our ecosystem Adam is a what you know widely available widely listed token but like tarun's joke about Adam is it's Dogecoin for academics and I think that there is some Truth uh to this uh it is current form so like here we were we had this amazing truly amazing Community created conference again Cosmo versus not sponsored by a foundation or a Dev company or anything like it is primarily sponsored by the blockchains themselves so like the cosmos Hub Community Fund the community the community treasury of everything and we go to that conference and like with in coordination with our organizers we did present a new vision that we call the cosmos Hub white paper or more colloquially atom 2.0 and so you know but in Cosmos no one no individual entity has remotely the power to make such a big change to the to the software or into the blockchain and you know Cosmos is not like a cult of Zaki or Jack or anyone else and so we are now in the midst of this like Community Driven process of evaluating that Vision discussing that Vision there's going to be a on-chain governance vote about that Vision you know in about 2 two weeks but that even you know regardless of how that how that vote goes it will can it's like there it's like we've started down a multi-year process but if our goal was to like reinvigorate the sub Community reinvigorate thinking about what Adam could be change people's perspectives I I feel like we've already accomplished that uh with with the with the with the white paper and uh with the presentation so I'm very happy about it right so let's unpack some of the ideas that you guys proposed in there let's start with a security aspect I'm sure you know most people who have heard of this that interchange security proposal um it really seems uh very similar to polka dot where um multiple chains can share security and I was wondering why is it that this was the direction that you felt Cosmos Hub should go this is an idea that was around even with the original Cosmos white paper came out when I came on in early 2018 the developers were saying well we shouldn't build IBC first we should maybe build interchange security for the cosmos hub first and that is like this is an old idea and it was why it was kind of the first atom 2.0 idea to get worked on is because it had broad acceptance within the atom Community as something that we should do one of the common sort of criticisms of the app chain model is that the security is much lower because you have to each chain has to bootstrap their invalidator set and they're responsible for their own Economic Security uh so that we should have a way to sell the security of the most secure validator set in The Interchange to other chains and when we were talking earlier about that sort of like spectrum of sovereignty this Falls somewhere in the middle and that's a really active market right now and there's a lot of like compelling offerings and I think that what we built with interchange security V1 is definitely one of the most compelling offerings out there and I was curious you know we talked about how with ethereum there are different smart contracts competing for Block space and so if this model goes through and you have different blockchains that are relying on Adam and the cosmos hub for security would that ever cause you know some sort of congestion on the network that would increase fees or you know kind of um enable activity on one chain to affect another so the short answer is no like one of so like what are the big concerns in like this sort of blockchain innovation thing is one is your blockchain halting there's a lot of you know Solana gets a lot of criticism you know because of these down times that they periodically have one of the things that like we are very proud of and like could not have been anticipated when we started is that the Cosmos Club has actually never had an unplanned halt since we launched in 2019 and I remember talking to our PR people uh when we launched and being like they're like what is the chances the blockchain is going to Halt I'm like about 50 and they're like that's not great and here we are you know it's it's you know uh three years later the blockchain has never halted and uh so but like we kind of wanted we wanted to find a way of extending the functionality of the atom ecosystem without creating an uh the the competitive pressure that many blockchains face it where they're like we have to keep attic features that constantly increases risk the whole vision of Cosmos is Fault isolation so what what we did is we create like these each one of these of the energy and secure chains are in most ways an independent blockchain which means that activity on them does not affect activity on any other chain and like you know we can take more risk on interchange secure chains um but we can also isolate risk with you know we've been one of the things that was announced uh simultaneously at converge and Cosmo verse is that usdc is coming to uh Cosmos as a consumer chain which is what we call these interchange secure chains and a big part of that appeal to to Circle and to Center was hey we can like provide an environment a generalized asset issue exchange that has a very low attack surface area um and is like going to need to probably not going to need to be like touched or upgraded or changed in any big way on a regular basis and so the rest of the interchange security ecosystem can constantly evolve we can build all these new things the scheduler the allocator we can take a lot more risk and they all know that like their usdc chain is just Trucking along secured by the economic value of Adam and doing what it is that needs to do without really having you know with a lot of isolation from the rest of the ecosystem okay so essentially block space on each of the chains does not affect blog space on any of the others they're just sharing the security would any activity on one chain affect fees on another no okay the only way they would affect it is the fees from the consumer chains go to the staked atom holders as a way to sort of pay for that security theme of atom 2.0 just like kind of like like holistically look at this is a lot of blockchains when they when they build their staking token are like where where is the sustainability of the staking Coke and going to come from and they're like fees are where the sustainability of the staking token they're going to come from and Cosmos has always basically been like if fees are high your blockchain has failed right like fees are like the fees should never be a meaningful source of Revenue your blockchain has failed to fees or like they're there to prevent spam that's they're not necessarily they're not there to generate revenue and so a big part of like what we've tried to do with atom 2.0 and as we get into the other parts of it the whole point has been to design a system that is like no like you want to provide the most valuable service to users which is like it should like the incremental cost should be as low as possible to just keep the systems you know from being overwhelmed by like Spa spam and Bots and transactions that have low economic value but like you want to capture as much economically valuable transaction activity within your blockchain ecosystem as possible so fees should be as low as possible but then how do we make the things sustainable and this is what the the puzzle that atom 2.0 has been trying to solve okay and out of curiosity if this proposal gets adopted what percentage of blockchains do you expect that Cosmos help will end up securing it doesn't matter what the percentage is it matters with the economic value is I'm sorry if that understood the economic what is like what the economic value of so a big part of the cosmos Hub thesis is that the cosmos have value accrual thesis is that if if you look at a value flow in Cosmos um someone raises money for a new blockchain or a new uh a new uh entity someone goes and wants to buy something on a osmosis or another decks somebody wants to open a position on dydx the pull point of atom 2.0 sort of success model is is if we can make atoms the atom Zone The Chain secured by Adam a part of as many of those sort of value flows as possible there's a lot of opportunity for Value to then accrue to Adam and that's sort of our goal we're not trying to exclude any of the uh Innovation around Sovereign zones at all or impede them or compete with what we're trying to do is provide a set of essential building blocks that make sure that atom is relevant to like the most important and like largest value Flows In Cosmos and this kind of gets to the underlying design philosophy of Cosmos we built a suite of Open Source tools that are free for anyone to use that enable you to launch your own blockchain and allow it to communicate with a bunch of other blockchains every other blockchain ecosystem has tried to build in multiple value capture points in each one of those things and our strategy has been basically open source that and then try to monetize on top of this this is kind of a classic open source strategy it's been tried in a number of uh sort of traditional Fields the one that always comes to mind for me is kubernetes with Google uh where they sort of like won the Container Wars by building the best one and making it free and then they tried to build monetization on top of that with their Cloud platform and that's kind of what we're doing with atom 2.0 we built all these free to use open source rails there's all this activity that's being generated but uh none of it is accruing to the cosmos Hub so how do we capture a value in that world all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about what will happen to those funds but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show

Chris Dixon listen to web 3 with a16z today on Apple podcasts Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts back to my conversation with Jack and zucky so under the new model that's being proposed 75 of gas fees would go to a developer Dow so what's your and and this I assume it's for Cosmos Hub so what are your ideas around kind of what would happen with these fees so let's talk about this whole true so there's this so the the cosmos Hub white paper proposes three new things that primarily don't exist in in the cosmos Hub right now so one is the treasury which I believe is what you are referring to um the second piece is the uh the second piece is the scheduler and the third piece is the allocator so this idea of the treasury is so if you look at the cosmos Hub um many other blockchains in the blockchain ecosystem they have sort of large on-chain reservoirs of tokens that are designed for like funding ecosystem activity but the treasury is actually a much more developed thing than these like underdeveloped sort of just like pots of money that are floating around in the various in the various chains so like what we imagine the cosmos Hub will do with its treasury is we actually think that there's a very small thing will be like funding Dev work so like you know you gotta like it sure there has to be money for both Contra continued contribution from the cosmos of to like tendermen Cosmos SDK IBC uh development of new consumer chains Etc but one of the like larger things is we just like want the cosmos Hub to be more like an economic actor we want it to be like hey you have built the service liquid staking uh a new stable coin backed by Adam other economically useful things in the cosmos ecosystem a new token that is that is being distributed uh uh to atom stakers as an interchange secured Zone you bit as people build these things go out collectively as the cosmos Hub and go out there and you know make investments own LP shares uh own assets bootstrap liquidity do these things that only centralize things do now in the blockchain ecosystem do it as a decentralized entity so that's that's a big part of the treasury vision and then the way in which the treasury vision the treasury rather than being continuously sort of draining the value from Adam stakers to fund this activity the idea is the treasury becomes a self-sustaining thing because of two things one is this idea of capturing Mev value uh sort of maximal extractable value block production value through the scheduler and those funds flowing back into the treasury and then also there's this idea of the allocator which is sort of a little bit of a collective investment fund but basically the profits from that feedback into the treasury and so we go through this phase of this transitionary phase over the next three years as described in the white paper um and then what we've done is we bootstrapped the treasury and at that point the treasury is is supposed to sort of be generating ongoing self-sustaining value for the atom community in just one note on the the sort of like investing in other chains a really common pattern during the sort of bootstrapping of IVC is if you were launching a new token or a new Zone in Cosmos you would airdrop your tokens to the atom uh token distribution that's a really heavy-handed way of sort of incentive aligning the atom Community with whatever you're doing and it's not a really long-term way to do it because those users will often go dump those tokens it not really beneficial for everyone in the way that people really want it to be what they want to do is they want the atom distribution the atom holders themselves to make an investment in their chain and sort of like have this sort of mutual economic benefit and this is what the interchange allocator is designed to do it's designed to sort of formalize these relationships between these different blockchains on chain it enabled the atom stakers to participate in the long-term growth of the IBC ecosystem from an investment perspective and this is what is called covenants in the my paper yeah exactly so you know you've been mentioning The Interchange scheduler and it's you know essentially this cross-chain Marketplace for maximal extractable Value it's basically the flashbots of Cosmos as far as I can tell and I was curious you mentioned that that value would then go into the treasury that's being extracted as I'm sure you're aware maybe is a little controversial because there's what some people consider toxic forms of it like front running and then other kinds that are helpful and make things more efficient so I was curious like how will The Interchange schedule or handle those different types of Mev will it you know not uh seek to capitalize on what people consider toxic Mev or will it just go ahead and extract that as well okay so I'll I'll I start with a little higher idea before I answer the question which is one of the big things that tendermint has been working on is this thing we call a b c i plus plus um which is this improve these improvements tenderment that make it easier for application specific blockchain developers to build in Mev mitigations into their application and I think like one of the reasons why Cosmos has been so compelling especially for D5 Builders to build on top of Cosmos is that in other application specific blockchain ecosystems that like are out there the answer to like what do we do about Meb is like no one's really ever thought about this and like we're in Cosmos it's like we've been thinking about it for years we have a plan we built most of it and like this is a big part of the story and we don't want to even it within this world where the scheduler exists we're not taking away the capacity of an application specific blockchain to mitigate toxic Mev Within in their application and it's like a huge reason why you build application specific blockchains the actual biggest source of Mev and like this is the the it's like I don't know it's like it's the truth that people don't want to talk about is the actual biggest source of Mev is between the exchanges and the blockchains like that is the actual biggest source of Meb as far as I can tell it's not really being extracted yet but like exchanges know when you go click the exit button from an exchange like they're gonna know like you know they may be able to buy like what were you looking at in coin gecko like right when you clicked exit on your exchange like they're gonna have like a lot of insight just from like customer profiling about what Financial actions are likely to come from that exit and exchange and they're gonna like at some point exchanges are gonna start frontrunning this and that is the source of value that like atom holders I think are are like when we designed atom 2.0 this is like what the gal what the vision is really about is like if we don't have a block space Futures Market we're leaking all of that value back to the exchanges and atom holders have an opportunity to get a cut of it and that might be a very very valuable source of Revenue that like exceeds what you could ever earn from like fees for instance no wait I'm sorry so you're saying that a lot of centralized exchanges trade against their customers I you this will inevitably happen okay but I don't I don't think it's it's not happening yet but it will I oh and like I've been watching but like if you look at just like value right like we talk about like oh there's like the sandwiching and front running block space Meb value that's like one thing then there's like the cross chain Mev value that's another thing the real giant Gold Mine of mevd is exchanges to blockchains right but I just think a lot of exchanges don't do that for a reason so I'm not sure what would cause them to suddenly change course I mean what happened to traditional Finance like it the same thing happened in traditional Finance in fact eventually they sold that order that order flow for like all retail users got sold to market makers in exchange for zero fee transactions on exchanges and like it all Rhymes Like payment for order flow yeah like there's no difference between like Robin Hood selling your order flow to Citadel and the world in which blockchains are like oh like we're gonna like sell user data to market makers about like when they're exiting the chain like about user exits and like what other user like categorical user Behavior can be sent uh and send it to in exchange for giving like people zero fee trading on exchanges yeah okay I I take your point I you're right that it is a possibility um one other thing I wanted to ask about this was you know flashbots is having this auction it's on ethereum where as we discussed it's a very different model and I was curious how efficient you thought a block space auction could be across app chains as you know it would need to be on Cosmos so the block space Futures market like basically what this is is an auction for Block space across many different chains that are all connected to the cosmos hub and that auction happens via IPC this kind of fundamentally gets down to the latency in IBC and it requires one message on the sending chain and then another message on the sending chain on the receiving chain so it's sort of the sum of the block times of the different chains right now the cosmos Hub has like six second blocks evemos is running with two second blocks and there's kind of nothing really preventing all the cosmos chains from doing that say network has done a lot of research into latency within tenderment and their sort of beta net is running with I think 250 millisecond or 600 millisecond blocks so definitely sub second blocks but if you've got let's say one second blocks then your sort of IBC transaction time is two seconds that's sort of a very long time when we look at things like traditional ad markets with these huge sort of multivariate auctions that happen we can absolutely provide good latency for this and one of the other use cases for or or this sort of cross-chain Mev which is definitely what the scheduler is designed to capture is the cosmos Hub will be selling block space on many many different app chains simultaneously and if you want something to happen over here at the same time it happens over there this is going to be pretty much the only way to negotiate that with any sort of guarantees and there's a lot of opportunity in that space as well all right so now let's dive a little bit more into the crypto economics of atom 2.0 why don't you just describe what it is that was proposed here in terms of the changes to issuance and Etc we could okay so first statement about issuance is there's a proposal about changes to issuance whether or not this proposal is going to be the proposal that's actually implemented is the community process and I'm not really just like saying this I mean like every blockchain founder is like it's not me it's the community like literally I need no one has this power to like actually change anything like this and like it'll it just it's going to be like a it's going to be a a public political process that's been playing out on Twitter and the cosmos Forum there's probably never been so many posts on the cosmos Forum as there ever been like this is again like a a community process but the current dynamics of Adam are this like exponential infinite inflation which is basically transferring values from non-steakers to stakers so people who have atoms out on in defy using atoms in the inner IBC economy are constantly transferring value back to the staking atom holders at this point like the issuance rate for atoms is nine percent uh approximately and it's Dynamic based on how many people are staking in this model and then the uh but this is about like a a 20 yield so you're like 2xing essentially how much at Value is like almost 2xing how much value is Flowing from stickers from non-stakers to stickers and basically what we propose in the uh Cosmos of white paper is that this is an unsustainable model it's harmful to the ecosystem because it makes atoms a bad asset to use in in IBC defy because of this like continuous value extraction for people who are out there using it and we want to like profoundly change this model and so basically the idea is first we create a bunch of new atoms that go into the treasury there's a whole we can get into it but like we create a bunch of new items they flow into the treasury they don't go to any users they're sexually collectively owned by the cosmos Hub mechanism no one the ICF Jack and zucki no one's in control of these atoms still the property of the cosmos Hub but then after three years we very rapidly decrease the amount of inflation and we end up with an issuance rate that is about one percent um and and is steady state not exponential not adaptive and we basically say you know the mature stable state so now Adam goes from this asset with a very unpredictable future Supply that is going to to something that it becomes very predictable very regular and the big idea of this like massive mint into the treasury is we actually think that like the best possible mean from Adam is how credible that like total number of atoms that are out there in the universe is and if we think if we're like we sort of overshoot but maybe like two or three x like what we actually think it will take to set up the economic flywheel we end up with a lot of credibility to the market that like there won't actually ever need to be another big issuance like this ever again okay so essentially like right now it's sort of this focus on it's sort of almost in a way like a venture model where you're just giving it some capital in the beginning to help it grow to a certain point and then once you reach that threshold then you reach the steady state that you mentioned is that the idea okay I just wanted to take a brief digression uh at the beginning of that Zaki was talking a little bit about Cosmos governance and how no one has control I think that this is really one of the defining features of Cosmos for a large number of historical reasons no one there is no one entity in control of the project various Folks at different times have tried to sort of exert control over the project and that has not worked out well and if you go look on minskin and like look at the recent governance proposals on the major chains we're seeing around 50 to 60 000 individuals voting and around uh 80 60 to 80 percent of stake voting on each of these governance proposals we have an extremely active governance community that helps make changes to these chains and sort of provide checks and balances to the various folks I if you remember and I I know you do Laura back in the the sort of 2015 ERA with the uh segwit changes on bitcoin uh people wanted to increase the block space and one of the proposed mechanisms to help sort of resolve disputes like this was on chain governance you would vote directly on chain to sort of do this and Cosmos is a bunch of bitcoiners so of course we went and implemented that and it is one of the things that makes Cosmos unique is this on-chain governance that does truly decentralize control of these systems and when developers like me and Zaki or the ICF want to go make changes we have to go to the community and convince them that those changes are a good idea or else they vote them down like what happened with prop 69 on the cosmos Hub there was a lot of folks who wanted to put qasim wasm which is a virtual machine under the cosmos Hub that would allow us to deploy uh code in a different way basically but a lot of people oppose that and that got voted down and we don't have cosmoplasm on the Hub so I think that that is and you can go and look many many governance proposals I think you did some reporting on the the Juno whale issue and that is one of the things that sort of makes Cosmos unique and out of curiosity I'm assuming that with those coins will not be used in any governance voting right correct okay that would be insane yeah basically um so then I wanted to ask also about liquid stinking which you guys will be introducing talk a little bit about what benefits you expect that will bring to Cosmos what problems it solves so like myself and the occlusion team so like me Christy uh Tony and shella have all have been working on this project which is uh changed the cosmos default staking module so again like Cosmos SDK comes with an implementation of proof of stake one of the things that you know we've long believed is that you cannot stop liquid sticking liquid staking is just part of staking you could fight it or you can embrace it but you cannot stop it and uh so we've seen like a number of liquid staking projects emerge in the cosmos ecosystem and the you know stride Quicksilver Lido is coming to the cosmos ecosystem there are uh persistence many more and so we have this very robust Marketplace of different liquid seeking providers but one of the things that's really annoying about them all is that you have to wait 21 days to move your atoms from like the old Legacy staking to the new liquid staking system and this change that we are putting into the cosmos uh staking module that the occlusion team has built is basically gets rid of that 21 days specifically for this use case that allows you to like move to liquid staking without having wait this 21 days um and so we think that will accelerate the adoption of liquid staking across the ecosystem and our dream is kind of to kind of move to this world of a hundred percent Adam's State essentially that like these liquid staked atoms become like the currency of account in the atom economy that like all essentially all atoms are staped and like that is the prime and white so you know we again we view it as like taking a couple of a few years for doing this and the uh and this is really why it allow and like this Vision allows us to get to the point where like to make that like very low new issuance that we're trying to go to sustainable because the issuance needed to be adaptive in the past because you could own your atoms could be either on securing the cosmos of or in an osmosis liquidity pool they could either be like securing the Cosmos app or like uh collateralizing a stable coin liquid staking allows you to do both and then by actually gradually reducing the issuance we're actually basically incentivizing or incentivizing the world in which the most out of like atom holders in order to earn yield actually have to go out into the economy and actually use all the stuff yeah and then ultimately the value of atom would rise because there would be so much more stake the theory is is that you know you take this thing that is like the Dogecoin for academics and you turn it into like a valuable thing that is doing something really special in the uh ever growing Cosmos ecosystem okay let's also now talk about ustc coming to Cosmos you alluded to this earlier which I I didn't fully understand because I was I was going to ask you that you know I I thought that usdc probably had to pick a chain to launch on and I was wondering what chain that would be but then you said something earlier about how it's going to launch on a consumer chain so talk a little bit about that what does that mean yeah so there's going to be a specialized consumer chain that focuses on asset issuance and usdc will issue directly on that chain this gives the benefit of uh not having congestion with any other chains and gives usdc a lot of control over the environment and you know in order to comply with regulations usdc does need to have quite a bit of control over that and this sort of fits the bill for them uh entering the interchange okay what have I not asked you about that are other things either on cosmos's roadmap or other things that you think Unchained listeners should know um I I would like to sort of just like return to the theme of so like why Cosmos why now um is I think probably the the probably the overarching team like why are you doing an episode about Cosmos right now and it's you know when we scheduled this you didn't know anything about atom 2.0 you know we we did a little bit of Showmanship for once um and we are and like actually like you know had a surprise announcement and so that's definitely not why we're here we're here because it's after like a lot of time of building the market has sort of come around to a lot of the ideas that we have been on since 2016. you need a very complete set of cert services in order to build like great products in blockchain you need a very discreet set of capabilities and right now as as as developers have kind of looking at the aftermath of you know the last Bull Run and saying how do we start building for the next one a lot of them are saying hey we see we finally see like why you need a cosmos why this set of tools are actually the most complete ecosystem for building the Next Generation set of apps and you know just to sort of tag on to that and to return to a theme that we talked a little bit about earlier asynchronous composability composability is key in all sorts of applications and the biggest knock against this multi-chain world for a long time is that composability goes away it doesn't it just changes and it changes into a new programming model and I think that this is where IBC is just incredibly key in this huge technological innovation that the cosmos ecosystem is responsible possible for it allows chains with different consensuses you know even sort of centralized databases to all share a messaging protocol and to build The Primitives for composability between different kinds of applications and that is you know all the stuff that zucki is talking about with the sort of app chain vision is true but I think that the the sort of unsung hero of that and the least understood part of it is IBC and what that enables and I think that that's going to be a huge part of the next couple of years all right yeah I'm looking forward to see where this story goes uh it's kind of interesting because I think the very first time I had Cosmos on Unchained was I guess it must have been very early 2017 like February or something wow um I mean I had osmosis on recently which also addressed Cosmos but um it's just interesting to sort of see the trajectory of of Cosmos over this time um all right to wrap up the show we're introducing a new feature on Unchained which is to ask each guest for a single book recommendation so what one book would you recommend to Unchained listeners okay um the book that popped into my head was uh one of my favorite books about Finance which is a Fisher black in the Revolutionary idea of Finance it's like a 20 year old book but like I love it huh okay and um who's the author uh I'd have to look it up oh okay Fisher black and the something revolutionary assignments Finance revolutionary idea of Finance revolutionary Finance okay cool Jack got uh a bunch of things jumped to mind but uh one of the books that I always recommend when people are getting into blockchains uh is debt the first five thousand years by David Graber uh probably not the most unique response but uh definitely a book that I love and keep recommending okay great yeah it's on my list um I think I like started it and then didn't finish so I will I will try to get to that all right well where can people learn more about each of you and your work um the best place is to follow me on Twitter twitter.com z-m-a-n-i-a-n also on Twitter for me I'm at Jack zamplin uh all one word on Twitter Perfect all right well it's been a pleasure having you both on Unchained Laura thank you so much thank you so much Laura thanks so much for joining us
