there's been a lot of regulatory news this week let's start with sec chair gary gensler's q a with the washington post about crypto what were the main takeaways from that discussion yeah uh genzler kind of repeated a lot of his talking points but what really struck me was near the end he kind of implied that he doesn't see cryptocurrencies or at least some types of cryptocurrencies lasting in the long term which really almost feels like a you know an opposite view to what he said when he was a lecturing on crypto at mit you know at the time he was talking about crypto as a change catalyst as something that will kind of define finance in the future but you know now he's a regulator it feels like he is you know being a lot more cautious and given his role as the head of the sec um you know he if anyone has the power to kind of ensure that you know whatever regulatory regime he implements is you know capable of ending cryptocurrencies or you know facilitating this kind of innovation depending on you know how strict it is or what kind of requirements he enforces so that to me was kind of the most telling thing that he said and do you have any sense of what is the reason for the shift in his views i want to say stable coins and defy i mean he's been talking about this for a while now you know warning about how uh you know he sees a lot of stable coins as possibly being securities especially those that are you know backed by a basket of assets including commercial paper or money market funds it feels like he's kind of casting this wide net because at this point the crypto industry is large enough and has enough momentum that if he's trying to regulate you know specific narrow issues like stable coins or defy a narrowly tailored regulatory proposal might not cut it so my sense is and this is speculation for me but it is that he is casting this wide net saying you know we're gonna do all of this stuff to regulate crypto and it's to an eye of you know being very targeted at the end in terms of you know what specific issues he wants to regulate what kind of cryptocurrencies he wants to you know see registered as uh securities uh securities and what kind of exchanges or trading platforms he wants to register with the sec as you know securities trading platforms but he you know he's been escalating his rhetoric around this for a while he's gone from saying stable coins might be securities to you know saying feels pretty explicit about coinbase registering as a securities trading platform during congressional testimony the other week um it all kind of feels like it's escalating to a specific endgame so maybe let's talk about that exchange piece of it what is the way that crypto exchanges currently operate and then based on his comments how do you think that might change yeah so right now crypto exchanges in the us are primarily regulated at the state level so you have to if you're in exchange you have to register and secure a money transmission license from every state financial regulator you want to do business in so with the exception of montana which doesn't have a regime that's 49 different licenses crypt exchanges aren't wild about this because that's you know 49 times the amount of work you would normally have to do it's a lot of uh it's expensive you have to you know file a lot of paperwork and spend a lot of time and resources but there is no federal regulator for crypto exchanges specifically there's you know the cftc regulates futures products so bitcoin futures uh if you're trading those then you'll be under cftc's purview and if you're registering as a securities exchange you can try doing that through the sec um if you're trying to be a broker or uh you know an ats but right now there's really no real federal regulator that oversees spot crypto trading and gensler said in the past that he you know sees that as being a cause for concern he's said that he believes that you know in the interest of investor protection there should be some kind of entity regulating you know these federal trading platforms and he's putting forth the sec i think i i think it's fairly apparent that he seems to be viewing the sec as the right regulator for this and you know this is based on him saying that in his view if an exchange has listed you know quote 50 or 100 or hundreds of tokens then at least some of them are going to be securities or at least it would be recognized as securities under the sec's purview and so he's said that exchanges that list these tokens which you know nothing explicitly named yet but you know any token that might be a security uh if it's trading on your exchange he wants you to register with the sec as a you know as a platform that's subject to its regulations and do you have a sense of whether exchanges are open to that i haven't heard anything from exchanges yet but you know kind of it's going to come down to what kind of specific guidance right gensler has been saying all of this during congressional testimony and speeches and he always prefaces with saying you know these are my views not to be used as a commission but there's no formal sec guidance right now i think what it might take is if the sec were to come out and say you know we think that this cryptocurrency and that cryptocurrency and this token that you have listed here are definitely securities and you should register with us yeah that might be one way he could kind of force the issue but you know as we saw when the sec sued ripple on claims that it sold xrp as a security a lot of exchanges just either de-listed or suspended trading in xrp so unless the sec is comprehensive about this it you know i i don't think exchanges are going to be rushing to register and say you know like we're a security trading platform and again part of that is just because you know how exactly do you do that so this kind of gets at another question i wanted to ask you um and this sort of even goes back to what we were discussing with stable coins in um gensler's q a with the washington post he talked about how stable coins look like they could be either investment contracts or also banking products and i wondered like um is it even clear um you know what the sec's purview is and does it look like it already has the necessary authorization to regulate this area and and actually here i mean it could even be stable coins or but also uh the exchange issue yeah i mean that's i think kind of it's been the defining question in their regulatory world for at least a year if not more my understanding about the stablecoin issue is if they are backed by securities so uh you know anything that might bear interest then he's kind of implying that the stable coin should be registered as a security but then the banking regulators regulatory side comes in when you have you know a lot of these platforms that are offering uh lending or interest bearing products based on stable coins and i mean banks do this too but banks are subject to a very strict banking regulatory regime and that's either under the office of control of the currency or uh state bank regulators you or you know sometimes even fed and fdic like all of them are kind of involved but the point is it's a very strict banking regime and any you know traditional bank that wants to offer these kinds of interest bearing products are subject to you know strict regulations about it crypto exchanges or crypto lending platforms or you know startups in this industry aren't really you know they're not registering as banks and they're not licensed as banks so they're not subject to those regulations but there's also again still no real federal regulators so the argument for a securities regime has been that you know if you're offering an interest-bearing product it might be a certificate of interest might be you know kind of seen as a note um you know in the security sense and so the sec has jurisdiction there and in this case like the sec would already have that jurisdiction for sure the answer has been saying that he needs more plenary authority to regulate crypto but you know there is i think a solid argument that at least when it comes to lending products or interest bearing products and you know some of these other tokens the sec has the authority it needs but again that doesn't stretch to spot trading of cryptocurrencies that aren't clearly securities i think that's what gensler's been asking for yeah yeah because then that would fall under the purview of the cftc and we did see kind of in the middle of some of the contention around this i did see um former commissioner brian quintenz tweet something um you know kind of like implying that um when when appropriate the cfdc you know tries to make sure that things will fall in in their territory um so in a moment we're going to discuss more about the lending issue but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show

conversation with nick day so as you mentioned another area that sec and in general regulators have been making a lot of noise about is lending uh we're going to just talk about one of these issues to start um a few weeks ago coinbase revealed that it's been trying for several months to get the sec's blessing to launch a lend product and at that time in frustration the exchange published a blog post saying the sec had threatened to sue them if they launched the lend product and um in a tweet storm ceo brian armstrong called scc's behavior sketchy because uh he he claimed that the sec would not explain to them why linda a security would not meet with him and then this week uh coinbase stated finally it decided not to launch lend so why do you think they finally came to that decision and why do you think that they kind of like poked the bear um if they weren't even going to launch it honestly that part is a bit of a mystery to me i think a lot of people in the industry expected the expected coinbase to launch anyway and take it to the courts to make a ruling on whether or not it's natural security i think one of the issues here is we don't have all the information the sec sent a wells notice to coinbase and so we have you know brian armstrong's viewpoint from his tweets and we have uh their chief legal officer paul wheels views from the blog post but we don't know what the sec actually said they haven't published the wells notice and so you know we know that the sec cited certain supreme court presidents and that's from the blog post but you know the exact specifics of what coinbase was launching or what the fcc says are the issues are still up and you know still a bit of a mystery you know there's definitely a bit of a question around that the sec did you know apparently point to long-standing supreme court precedence and there's been you know it's been a point of contention in the crypto industry for a while that we're looking to the howie case which was you know almost i think 70 or 80 years ago um and now we're talking about the reefs case which happened in 1990 there's been definitely a point of contention about using these decades old supreme court cases as president for an industry that was born less than you know 15 years ago but i i don't think the sec has a lot of flexibility there i think the law has said you know the fcc has to abide by tease and the supreme court has said you know these are the precedents the sec must enforce them and they must be you know uniform about how to enforce them so if the industry wants to get more clarity or get changed here they either have to challenge these presidents in court or they have to try and you know lobby for congress to pass a new law and it doesn't seem like either of these is happening right now yeah i did see in an interview that former cftc chair chris jon carlo did with coindesk that he kind of suggested that he felt the laws needed updating but to talk a little bit more about this lending issue all of this kind of controversy with coinbase in the sec is also happening in the context of state regulators going after other crypto lenders such as block fi and celsius and i was wondering what you felt this said about the overall picture of crypto lending in the us yeah so those cases are really interesting we're at five different states filing actions against block fine three of them also filed against celsius and i read those you know the filings and orders and they all pointed to you know state securities laws which are pretty close to federal securities laws so it's the same basic issue that the sec would have with coinbase lend i think um you know without again knowing the specifics of what coinbase lend was going to actually do and how the scc viewed it but yeah again it just kind of comes down to who's the actual regulator and it seems that you know we've seen that new jersey's securities regulator has delayed its enforcement of the block fi season does this by a couple months now i think they just pushed it back again so there's clearly it's not just uh you know they're not just trying to say like get out we don't want you they're saying okay well you know we're open to a dialogue but we think that right now you're violating the law and we want to figure out what's going on here so there's definitely something to to be said about possibly updating laws or finding it you know figuring out what the best regulatory regime is for these products that regulators will be comfortable with and that will still allow companies to you know launch these kinds of products and not feel overly burdened but it all kind of seems to stem back to the basic principles of like you know who's it who's the actual regulator are these products regulated and already safe for investors and you know if not what is the appropriate way to respond yeah so these cases all involve centralized intermediaries but when it comes to d5 i feel like there's kind of this other tension that we're seeing and for sure the regulators look like they're setting their sights on defy and to me the issue that i see is and actually i got this from a conversation i had with collins belton who is a lawyer in the space and he was talking about how regulations are based on regulating intermediaries and decentralization aims to remove the intermediaries and i did notice actually when chair gensler defined staking for the washington post q a he defined it in a way that assumes that you're working with an intermediary who's doing the sticking for you which i thought was interesting but i just wondered like does it look to you like the sec is going to write regulations that will sort of force the crypto industry to use intermediaries and to not go the decentralized route or do you expect that they'll leave some leeway with some openness toward decentralized models which you know has been suggested by sec commissioner hester purse with her token safe harbor proposal that would like basically give projects that start out centralized to decentralize over time how do you see this tension playing out yeah that is definitely a very good question i think gensler is you know he said in the past he's used a lot of this is kind of i think the one we call he's called a decentralization theater he said that he doesn't see a lot of these decentralized projects as actually being decentralized and i think acting you know comptroller michael sue at the occ said something similar the other day he was giving a speech to um a group of crypto companies and said that his visa he seems a lot of these projects as being more centralized or more intermediated than they would otherwise claim and i it feels like that's what they're kind of going for right now is just saying you know defy isn't they see uh and we've seen that you know they've issued subpoenas reportedly to you know swap trying to figure out what's uh you know what exactly is going on with uniswop and uh whether or not it's actually decentralized and so it feels like they're going to try and kind of make this the precedent saying okay well you know these projects are saying they're decentralized but really they're controlled by you know these firms or these labs or these developers and therefore they're not at all decentralized and you know how that translates into enforcement action or regulations remains to be seen but it doesn't feel like they're going to go after the unintermediated projects yet but they are going to say that you know in their view these projects are not as decentralized as they claim to be and so they're subject to gst's purview so next week there is likely to be a number of enforcement actions or other settlements or just other activity in general from the sec because the end of its fiscal year is september 30th so i was kind of curious what you um expect to see from the sec next week yeah there's a i don't know anything specific but there's a rumor that there will be something big happening by the end of the fiscal year and you know in the years past like we've seen this happen at the end of 2019 or 2019 fiscal year we saw a massive block one settlement and it wouldn't surprise me if there was something like that on the horizon i don't think it's going to be any of the cases we're following right now um you know the scc case against ripple and on the xrp allegations is the big one but i don't see that settling anytime soon um so i'm not sure what exactly this will be but you're absolutely right there will be some kind of case or settlement happening and the sec is going to say hey look you know we just we have this new president that is going to give us we're going to use this as our reasoning or our base for when we go after other projects in the future yeah my personal theory is just reading between the lines of what happened with coinbase where they refused to meet with them they refused to explain why they thought it was a security but then also at the same time they're inviting companies to come and talk to that's easy i kind of was like oh i wonder if they're working on something big involving lending and they like kind of can't say anything about it yet and that's why they can't talk to coinbase about this but anyway it was just like a thought in my mind so we'll have to see what actually happens all right well it's been so fun chatting with you um thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you for having me it's really great talking to you

exchange based primarily in russia has been sanctioned by the united states treasury for allegedly facilitating transactions for ransomware attackers the treasury's office of foreign assets control or ofac believes that suex was involved in eight ransomware variants furthermore ofac alleges that forty percent of known volume on suex was associated with addresses linked to bad actors according to chain analysis the blockchain analytics company that helped opec in this case suex deposit addresses quote received over 160 million dollars in bitcoin from ransomware actors scammers and darknet market operators the exchange is now officially listed on ofac's specially designated nationals and blocked persons list barring u.s residents and businesses from interacting with the firm the move comes shortly after a wall street journal article last friday reported treasuries intend to target crypto ransomware payments with sanctions next headline twitter rolls out verified avatars and bitcoin tips according to decrypt twitter began rolling out bitcoin payments features yesterday users will have multiple avenues to hand out bitcoin tips for normies squares cache app and gofundme will let users send btc via a more conventional route for hardcore bitcoiners twitter will allow users to utilize strike a lightning network based payment app to send tips bitcoin tips went live

headline finance is under investigation for insider trading bloomberg reported last friday that u.s officials at the commodity futures trading commission are investigating the world's most popular exchange for possible insider trading and market manipulation according to bloomberg the cftc is looking into whether binance or its staff took advantage of its customers to generate profit citing anonymous sources bloomberg says that the cftc has contacted quote potential witnesses as part of its inquiry for now binance is not formally accused of committing any wrongdoing and it is unclear if the investigation will lead to any actions from the regulator the exchange is already under investigation by the internal revenue service and department of justice as well as the cftc next headline robin hood users will soon have crypto wallet capability robinhood is planning to roll its highly anticipated crypto wallet and transfer features starting in october with wallets users will be able to transfer eth btc doge and other supported tokens off platform security features like identity verification multi-factor authentication and email and phone verification will be implemented for storing crypto on robinhood according to christine brown chief operating officer at robinhood crypto the trading platform will slowly launch its crypto wallets with only a small group of customers testing the alpha program next month more customers will be able to join later through a waitlist at publishing time there are at least 115 000 users on the initial wait list which is less than one percent of the 13 million krypto traders on robinhood perhaps the reason for the low waitlist number can be attributed to the fact that robinhood crypto traders are dogecoin dominant in q2 62 of crypto revenue came from dogecoin trading alone however data from bit info charts shows that dogecoin is not widely used in actual blockchain transactions despite its popularity in robin hood dogecoin facilitates far fewer daily transactions than bitcoin or ethereum for example on wednesday dogecoin executed 16 000 transactions while bitcoin executed 275 000 and ethereum saw 1.17 million respectively it will be interesting to see if robinhood's new wallet feature will affect such numbers going forward next headline the evergrand news was not grand for the crypto market as concerns around evergrand the

ethereum dips below three thousand dollars for the first time since early august according to the crypt over 1.2 billion dollars in crypto futures were liquidated in just 24 hours in traditional markets the dow jones industrial average ended monday down 600 points the dip was most likely related to negative sentiment regarding evergrand's balance sheet which showed over 300 billion dollars in debt an amount that some analysts believe the company would not be able to pay back however on wednesday evergrant agreed to settle interest payments on a domestic bond calming the tumultuous market the total crypto market cap jumped six percent on wednesday according to data from coin market cap next headline investors are throwing money at nft platforms two nft companies dapper labs and so rare
