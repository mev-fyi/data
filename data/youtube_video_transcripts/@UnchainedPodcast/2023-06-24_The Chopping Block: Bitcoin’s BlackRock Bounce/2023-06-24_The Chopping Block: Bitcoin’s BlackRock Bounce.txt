not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so first quick intros we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert of the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound then we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and finally I received the head high band of dragonfly the we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see choppyblock.xyz for more disclosures okay boys we are back at 30k it seems like all of a sudden markets had a sign of life things are up again despite all the SEC attacks against crypto and all you know all these things being supposedly unregistered Securities and we're you know the market is trying to figure out where this stuff is coming from and tarun had a theory uh tarun can you explain to us why markets are up so much um well cryptocurrency's favorite astrologer is is back in Action Marin Altman is putting out a new natal chart as a soul-bound nft it must be it must be the the reason everything's going up which are a naval chart as in need n-a-t-a-l I don't even know what that is what does that mean yeah it's like a birth chart it's a birth chart yeah oh so what it means like what month how does this relate to prices or crypto at all yeah art prices Universe like ever no matter where you're born for my thesis and I I chose a random tweet that I saw today okay you know you had generative AI recently but now we've moved for forward we're on generative own your astrology own your astrology okay we're clicking through this uh hold on you gotta you gotta figure out what what price prediction this is going to give us I have I don't ask me Tom is going to Mint one of these live but but the more most interesting thing for people who don't know is like during the bull market she did give a lot of price predictions from her astrological insights how do they do I don't know I don't think any of them did well but I have no clue like it's it's hard to beat the market when you're relying on astrological signs I'll say that that I think we can say with some confidence I am surprised there's never been a coin that's you know there's tons of coins based on like random astronomical things like well Cosmos for instance but I've never seen anyone go straight for the astrology thing but I feel like if you did that wasn't that uh Jay's new project uh from Cosmos Jay's uh what was it called the Virgo project or Libra project well there was Libra literally no and there's a Gemini but yeah leaned into the astrology they like they just like happened to choose particular you know and the Gemini case it was about the twins not the astrology right I think the the astrology gets you in the door but if you go too hard on the astrology I think he's just scaring people but it's like dog coins are a form of astrology if you lead all the way into astrology you definitely do not have segregated customer accounts that's like the one rule that I can assure you for exchanges but you don't think dog coins are sort of feel like astrology right where it's like whichever dog coins the flavor of the month the suddenly like it people give you some retroactive reasons for why it happens and like they pretend it's causal but you know obviously who knows yeah well okay so taking a step back the real reason why markets are up so much is because not just because Mercury is in retrograde but also that BlackRock filed for an ETF a Bitcoin ETF now uh if you haven't been following crypto you might understand why this is a big deal so uh there there have been many many attempts to try to create a Bitcoin spot ETF in the US there are other countries that have sort of exchange traded products for for Bitcoin but the US the SEC has always denied any Bitcoin spot ETF products although they have approved Bitcoin Futures ETF products and this has been a point of contention for the industry which is that part of the reason why it is difficult for retail investors to get access to bitcoin is that they cannot buy it in a normal brokerage account very easily the way that you could with an ETF and a lot of Institutions are unable to buy it very easily without getting on board in something like coinbase which of course is currently under you know attack for their business model based SEC so there have been many attempts by different groups to try to create Bitcoin ETFs but they've all been um shot down by the SEC over the last you know three or four years but BlackRock just filed an ETF kind of out of nowhere nobody this didn't seem to be on anybody's radar and BlackRock of course is the largest asset manager in the world um they they have trillions of assets under management they are absolutely massive and they also have a pretty incredible record of getting ETFs approved and so there's a lot of speculation now in the market that this BlackRock ETF filing means that this ETF is going to get approved I think out of 400 plus ETF applications that BlackRock has made only once have they ever not been approved and the last time that happened was like in 2007 or something it was a very very long time ago so this this seems to imply that BlackRock knows something the rest of the market doesn't and basically immediately on the heels of that we saw Invesco which is also a large ETF manager Wisdom Tree and Valkyrie all file their ETF applications we also saw the gbtc that's the grayscale Bitcoin trust we saw the nav uh the the discount to nav meaning you know this this was a lot of the the origin of the three AC blow up and all the stuff that was going on which is that this trust which does not allow redemptions unlike an exchange shaded product this uh this trust doesn't allow redemptions so when it trades below par there's no way to actually get it back into par using Arbitrage um that Gap is closing so it's now down to 33 which is a local high AI um on speculation that if this BlackRock ETF gets approved then it's also very likely that the gbtc ETF gets approved as well or the conversion into an ETF gets approved and therefore that this grayscale trust is going to get unlocked and that discount is going to go away that seems to be driving a lot of excitement about crypto and it seems to run very counter to the feeling in the air that we all had just a couple weeks ago which is this kind of gloominess in the U.S that institutions are going to back off that crypto is kind of dead U.S is going to be pushing things overseas how do you guys see the story and how does it fit into your picture of what crypto is doing in the U.S now that you have BlackRock filing for Bitcoin ETF well from what I've heard and again I'm not an expert um but what I've heard from others is that you know there's a speculation that all of this these ETF applications were filed in response to expectations that the graceful graceful lawsuit is going to result in grayscale being approved via you know judicial action and that you know if grayscale is approved or there's the expectation that it's going to be approved and everyone else wants to get in line quickly now the thing that's really surprising is that everybody that hasib already mentioned like all the biggest players on Earth pretty much all came out at the exact same time with their applications and this is actually the most surprising thing because you know it would have required all of them to have done a lot of work before this point you know creating an application is not an opening process it's a lengthy process that has a lot of legal time and expense that goes into it all of the different applications clearly must have been ready to go previously um and so either all of these sponsors were just waiting for some sign and they all you know just immediately astrological sign maybe it could be maybe you know Mercury right Mercury got everyone to take their applications you know that they were you know holding on the Shelf at the lawyer's office and they signed all file on this week um you know or they know something that other people don't or they were instructed you know to or told that SEC was going to change its regulatory process regarding Bitcoin spot ETFs but whatever it was every single firm had an application ready to go and they all filed them with pretty much the exact same time so this week has been just a drum beat of Institutions entering crypto with registered products which again is exactly what the SEC has always indicated that in concept it wants it wants people to file prospectuses for you know investment products and you know disclose the risks and create new things and so there's now there's just a wave of Institutions that believe that the time is right and so you know be really interesting to see over the next couple weeks which get approved it's possible every single one of them gets approved and there's just an army of different choices for consumers to be able to purchase Bitcoin and have it held in an ETF or trust structure so pretty exciting time um but we're gonna have to wait and see to see what the actual outcome is because the applications alone fundamentally don't mean anything so again I I don't know anything about how these processes work but beyond just what I've observed over the last few years of seeing things repeatedly get rejected but it seems plausible to me that the reason why all these folks have come out of the woodwork is that the SEC is basically ready to backpedal uh they they see that this case the gbtc lawsuit that was that is going live is not going well for them and they see kind of sentiment turning in Congress against the way that the SEC has been regulating the industry um and rather than have it be basically the market is owned by grayscale or these crypto folks it's plausible to me that they reached out to uh you know very high quality ETF sponsors that the SEC knows how to regulate very well and basically said look why don't you guys come in the market I think this thing is ready to go and we we really don't want it to be just grayscale out here you know basically attracting deposits we'd like to have a more regulated counterparty to be to be working with in having these products out there right which rugs grayscale essentially you know if they were going to get approved traditionally and be the only product out there they might not be first to Market they might be last to Market well the other thing that's kind of weird is like I feel like some of the speculation I've read and like again I I have no information that is real or advantaged in any way about this is that this would basically Force grayscale to sell to one of basically sell their Holdings to one of these if they got approved first because it would just be like otherwise they would wouldn't have be able to exit very easily um and like all the creditors and stuff would just push dcg into selling it because like that these funds would obviously want those funds immediately sir do you mean selling the underlying assets or selling the actual product like actual gbts the underlying assets like dissolving the trust selling it and returning the proceeds and returning it to the the right well like dissolving it and you basically you get a BlackRock chair and for that that makes sense so you should rewrap all the underlying assets and yeah and the argument for the only reason I said this is all that there are a lot of people who who are like trade that the spread the discount to nav for grayscale we're this was their thesis was that the reason it's going to zero like people are think it'll converge is because the court system will take forever but if this gets approved basically the fastest thing that could happen is actually some type of force acquisition like this this is where I don't know but this is what people who love trading do BTC spreads were saying so like I have no clue if that's like uh you know they they were very informed on this or this was like a you know Reddit style conspiracy theory yeah it does feel kind of like a a slap to the face of dcg of like even about you know why we've had some of these defaults and why they're kind of a position that they're in it's like people getting trapped underwater in uh uh the gbtc trade um which obviously they have you know facilitate through through Genesis and now it's like well you know even if you basically are you know allowed to have this ETF conversion that would have solved the problem in the first place uh you know you don't actually get to benefit from it because uh you know BlackRock is sort of sweeping it out from from under you and like pretty much collapsing the value of grayscale so it's like they just can't uh win to an extent right and just to be extremely clear right gbtc and the grayscale products have been a toxic Financial product that tens of billions of dollars to flowed into over the last couple years you know the fact that you can't redeem from the product and you're charged exorbitant fees two percent to literally just total Bitcoin or ether that's not a good Financial product and the only reason it worked is because at one point it traded for a premium due to supply and demand and balance and assets rushed in but like fundamentally the grayscale trusts are a toxic product that have not been good for the investors the industry and it really was the root cause of a lot of the things that blew up right 3ac and the Ripple effects and just you know it's been an absolute Calamity and really like alternatives to gbtc and the grayscale trust should have been approved a long time ago and it would have been healthier for everybody would have been healthier for investors healthier for the market healthier for competitors and it's just really sad that there's never been any actual competition on that front and the only product that's been traded is a toxic product that's such a good point Robert like so much of the damage over the last year could have been avoided if this product basically was arbitraged out of existence it's a it's a testament to the fact that market efficiency creates so much more stability than than you know maintaining these inefficient markets I do feel bad to some degree for I do feel bad to some degree for grayscale because clearly grayscale they are in some sense the people who push the envelope with the SEC to force their hand to have to approve I mean again we might be jumping the gun but to approve a Bitcoin ETF and it seems overwhelming that they're not going to be the beneficiary of that um that said they cut they got paid plenty in the years that they essentially had a monopoly on being that you know exchange traded product the interesting detail about uh I don't know if you guys have any color on this the interesting detail of why the SEC has claimed that they've rejected all these previous uh Bitcoin spot products is because they don't have these Market surveillance uh you know Market surveillance agreements and BlackRock supposedly has this this is the one thing that the one place where they diverge from previous applications and the same thing is true for Wisdom Tree and for Invesco is that they have the surveillance Island sharing agreements in place it was always a little bit unclear why this mattered that seemed like always a little bit of a red herring given that Bitcoin is such a massively traded product everywhere in the world um you know the the degree to which you can actually have these surveillance sharing agreements with the biggest spot Market which is binance presumably is you know the way that the way that we calculate the indices for what the spot price is is also you know uses a bunch of different exchanges so I don't totally understand the details of why this was such a sticking point for the SEC but it seems like now it's been overcome uh and that that should at least address the nominal protest that the SEC gave to all the previous products that were in place so in one sense having having a spot product as well as a Futures product so there's a spot spot ETF usual ETF Fusion ETF although technically you could get access to bitcoin exposure a Futures ETF is just a much more complex product it does weird things when the Futures are going to roll over and stuff and it's just not as retail friendly it's not as straightforward as just a super low cost ETF there's no rolling there's no fanciness there's super low fees because it's just a big pile of Bitcoin that you can hold on any either US exchange well I mean also the other Advantage they had was like it is on the few ways to express crypto exposure in a retirement account which seemed to be like one of the biggest drivers of volume rants huh yeah I'm more surprised the vanguards of the world haven't you know or like Fidelity right if they like built a custodian like you think they would have tried I think Fidelity has a custodian no no I think they would have tried to make aetf oh yeah because they have so much captive investment retirement like customer a customer base that's easy to sell to instead they went for all these like weird stuff like little backed maybe forgettable exposure but you know uh but like I mean you know obviously their custody and stuff has done well but I'm just surprised they they you know someone like them who seemed to have first mover Advantage didn't you know wasn't one of the names we saw are there any stats for actually how much is in custody at Fidelity in crypto assets I know be interesting yeah so the other thing about this ETF story is obviously it's it's caused Bitcoin to cross 30k eth is at 1800 uh markets are are rallying on on this news basically to a level we haven't seen since April the interesting thing is you know the sentiment shift seems really dramatic basically a week ago we assumed that crypto had just become Untouchable by U.S institutions and now all of a sudden you have even larger us institutions who had not mess with crypto seriously in quite a while now all of a sudden entering The Fray and signaling some seriousness about uh thinking this is a market worth going after the other side of that news is that last week there was a story that a16z which of course is one of the largest Venture funds in crypto I'm sorry the largest Venture Fund in crypto um they were creating a new office for accency crypto their crypto arm in London and claiming that they believed that London was going to be the new crypto capital of Europe uh and perhaps that there was going to be more and more Founders leaving the US and moving over into the UK what do you guys think of the story about you know London potentially being this new crypto Hub within Europe or potentially siphoning Talent away from the US especially in light of what we're seeing now this week well I mean first of all it's entirely plausible right the primary argument being that even after everyone has filed ETF applications over the past week there have been zero actual signs of any regulatory framework actually moving forward or any additional Clarity whatsoever moving forward you know seeing all these institutions get excited is create a lot of Hope but nothing is fundamentally changed last week to this week besides a ton of Institutions demonstrating their interest in this but there's always been interest in having crypto Financial products you know the UK and a lot of Europe and a lot of Asia is actually creating a regulatory framework for crypto2 flourish period not opacity and like questionable things interesting they're actually moving forward and trying to be welcoming and encouraging of innovation and I think what led to a16z you know creating a UK office is the fact that all of the most primary us-based businesses in crypto have already over the past couple of months started moving offshore coinbase has started moving offshore Gemini has started moving offshore like all of these things that we think of as like the U.S Bedrock of crypto have been moving offshore in response to regulatory overreach in many cases and you know that's we have an exact opposite environment in the UK you know the Prime Minister was touting the fact that you know he's trying to create like a crypto-friendly country and over time if you're an entrepreneur deciding where you're going to create something new a ton of evidence that you should be doing it in the UK or doing it in some other country that's like extremely welcoming and so you know I think Andrews just sees the writing on the wall and sees that there's gonna be more and more entrepreneurship you know having a focal point in the UK or Europe in general and is trying to you know skate to where the puck is going and change their approach you know and you're probably going to be correct there's probably going to be a lot more investment opportunities for them you know for entrepreneurs in the UK and Europe so I think it was a brilliant move I think they're doing what you know capitalism and regulation in the U.S have forced them to do and I think they're doing it because they're profit motivated and they see the writing an interesting angle on this is I I agree with you it's very clear the UK is trying to position itself as being this New Haven within Europe um I I kind of imagine that look when you're at the scale of a16z it's also you can you can sort of hedge a little bit and say like look you know I mean right now it's basically only one partner who's going over there the rest of the team as far as I know is still Stateside um you can hedge a little bit but also I feel like part of it you know so there were there was these hearings last week uh at the house Financial Services subcommittee um and they were basically going through some of the some of the recent events that were happening in crypto and this thing about the um about A6 and Z going opening an office in London this was brought up a couple times as an indication that like hey this is a sign that we're messing things up right we have the biggest Venture firm in crypto now going overseas and talking about how great the UK is as opposed to the us as being a a place to to fund startups I have to imagine that part of their motivation for this was guilt-tripping the US and it seems to be working to the extent that you know it's one thing to say Well they're going to Singapore they're going to Dubai like they sound kind of shady to an American Congress person but if you tell a congress person like oh no London is stealing our jobs and they're taking our investments in our startups and you know these smart people are going over there instead of over here the the fact that it's it that it's the UK and obviously our relationship with the UK is such that we we don't want to lose to them in particular I think this is actually a very brilliant move at the low cost of just you know opening an office and moving one person over do but well I I I guess my question is like has it been working like you you made it sound like there already has been I mean I feel like there were a couple nice PR articles and like the prime minister so I'm talking about the way it came across to Congress people they brought it up hearings yes several times during the hearings as Venture Capital firms are moving overseas to the UK because we do not have a regulatory framework that is the way it's being kind of digested by Congress which is great well I mean the reality is entrepreneurs have been moving out of the U.S for years and no one has given a [ __ ] like frankly like it's amazing that you know every time people have been like entrepreneurs been moving offshore and it's like well it doesn't matter you know just you know two guys in the garage who cares but like as soon as a venture firm does it it's like oh my goodness the Venture capitalists are moving offshore now we have to pay attention but like this has been happening and like I don't think anyone in Congress cared one coinbase and Gemini and like the biggest businesses were the ones who actually are the job creators moving offshore it's just you know it's a little bit annoying because like you know people have been like making a stink about this by like trying to demonstrate the reality of how much more difficult the US was for a foundation for innovation in other countries for years now on the other hand investors do more lobbying or like more targeted like it's not it's not like it's like no it's not like it like randomly happens I guess with that thing right it's like the companies are usually a little more inept at being able to do that type so because it's not in the DNA of like the founder to be like yes I want to go Lobby like and these companies are naturally more suspect yeah yeah it just like never works that way right right Tom you were gonna add something yeah I was gonna say I mean I think the entrepreneurs are really the ones to focus on here like you can still invest into European or British startups from the US like nothing precludes you from from doing that but obviously if you want to base your operations and team um outside the US that's obviously much more important and where your bases is is uh much more important to how you think about you know a regulatory or which regulations you fall under so I I agree it feels a bit uh showy but I mean I guess people are paying attention and there's an encourage us so that they can tax it later like yeah so it was good to see the UK kind of taking on the Singapore strategy which I guess kind of the UK is becoming more and more in the Singapore of Europe where it's sort of this you know it's like okay we can kind of get away from EU governance we can kind of set some rules make it attractive for Capital flows um otherwise like domestically there's not that much going on um well the rest of their economy is kind of like in Decline right now so yeah yeah yeah like so they're very much taking the Singapore strategy of just like let's just have great governance and great you know kind of financial capital and besides that like yeah otherwise things are kind of a mess well also they haven't had a a Premiere who is a mercantilist until recently right like they've kind of had these like bozos for a long time as their leaders I mean so have we right like the US has had bozos too but I'm I'm not trying to it's not pot Kong I think Trump was very mercantilized actually yeah Stanford or is there something uh deeper on your mind there well I don't know I mean he clearly worked in finance for a while I feel like he's much more attuned to this than Boris Boris can't even like tie his shoes correctly like it's it's kind of a it's like not even of course with no dummy let me say that Boris was actually even though dummy he was he definitely had Street smarts he but Boris was like LBJ I don't think he was like uh you know trying to do the Singapore strategy I Boris was not just like some LBJ he was actually an incredibly intelligent literate and thoughtful politician like I don't think he gets enough credit in that regard but like he actually was incredibly smart he certainly didn't seem like it when he was in office I I agree his like history like looks good but I I I'm I'm certainly not a Boris fan let's say The Chopping Block will pivot into UK politics yeah I I'm following zero of this I've seen so long actually can I ask can I ask you guys a question like of all the British companies that you can think of in the last two years which one do you give a [ __ ] about in 2023 and there's only one I can think of personally which is transferwise Deep Mind deep Vine transverse yeah those are like the two I it's I actually kind of hard to think of that many British companies this is why they actually need to encourage Innovation like I've read a crazy stat which was like you know the amount of new IPOs you know in London is like anemic compared to like historical averages there's just like no new companies really going public in the UK and when they do the returns have been like mediocre like the new issuance has been like really really bad and hopefully we can pull up some stats or something on this but like you know that's the leading indicator for saying like hey we need to like rethink this and open our doors to entrepreneurs and capital and like get this Mojo going here in the UK well this is the Singapore thing too right like if if your local economy and your demographics and like your trade relations are kind of crap but you can compete on being like hey this is a great financial Market on which the IPO or to attracts and like set up your headquarters here it's kind of what Dublin has been historically especially for tech companies like obviously that is I mean that's more of like tax Arbitrage than it is like actual about governance and financial markets but I think I can I can see the UK nestling into that kind of a position and using that to solidify its importance internationally because otherwise I I think I think London the UK broadly has been kind of fighting against its its decline for the last 20 years and I feel like at a certain point you have to definitely not 400. war of 1812 was like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay all right fine fine but um at a certain point you kind of accept that okay we're just like kind of a Lonely Island with bad demographics and like you know and we still fund we still fund our our Royals accesses with public yeah exactly I mean that that stuff is all very bizarre to me as well but once you accept that and you're like cool what do we do with this you know you sort of take the Singapore attitude of hey we don't need to be the center of the universe but let's like find something that we can be really really strong at anyway it's a good sign well I I I do think they have an extremely well educated stem populace for for this kind of thing compared to like virtually any other candidate for trying someone trying to do this so I think they're in good shape there I mean I also feel like France was also trying to do a little bit of stuff like this but then Finance had an office in France or something or yeah just kick out by dance yeah apparently they just yeah but there were all these people saying like France is the future for crypto and like clearly I don't know that was because people were saying that D5 was the future of Finance but then all the same particular defy French D5 people from 2020 all were Shilling on Twitter in the last six months being like Oh look like buying's coming to to to to France is like the greatest thing ever and like hey living there is amazing and like look we're gonna be like the crypto heaven and it's like ah really I don't think so France is not bacon that's the lesson yes um okay so so my last question is are are you gonna move there haseeb you gonna move to what would it take what would it take like what would you need to see for it to be like all right I'm I'm going to Britain I'm gonna yeah I mean first of all Britain I mean not to hate on any I don't know if any listeners are in the UK but Britain is just like it's so it's so like the weather is so crappy it's so depressing people there are just like unfriendly I I I I would really fight going to the UK I feel like Lisbon would be more doable I could do Lisbon and then like you know commute or something so here's the thing if you remember before covet the standard game for D5 Founders or Founders in general would be you you have a team in the U.S you go to Switzerland and that's where you incorporate and you do your Ico and you do your blah blah um and then you might have a tech team in the U.S but there's like you know this sort of legal separation between the token issuer and the tech team I would be very surprised if something like that does not continue in one form or another unless the SEC is extremely aggressive about establishing U.S Nexus which so far they haven't been quite so aggressive um on like where the tech people are it's more about you know if you advertise here if you you know do stuff domestically and you attract us customers excuse me most of what they care about I I would assume that that's going to continue in in shape if it doesn't and if we see that basically people are like look I have to move everyone to the UK and that's the only way that I can do this then I I would I would need to see it for at least a year and a half right by the time we see the 2024 uh presidency rollover and we have some some clarity on whether or not this regime of being anti-crypto is going to continue in the U.S that would probably be the moment where I can really seriously consider making a move otherwise it feels um it feels potentially transient right there have been a lot of places that were that crypto hub for like a year and then it kind of moved over and people moved on because people in crypto obviously very mobile right the fact that people can even be thinking about going to the UK means that they can be thinking of going somewhere else a year later the the that's that's the way that I would think about it but um the reality too is that there's still going to be a lot of activity that is uh in Asia rather than in Europe right so I think if you're Andresen it naturally makes sense to like hey the look we kind of covered the angle phone market that's kind of always been our bread and butter and the reality too you know to be honest you don't need to be in the UK like Tom mentioned to actually see UK deals right like we yeah at dragonfly we see deals basically from any anybody who speaks English you can get your deck to us via Twitter or via Gmail or whatever uh and so it's traditionally been the case that whether or not whether you're in the UK whether you're in Germany whether you're in you know Australia you see all the same VCS right because everybody kind of lives on Twitter and they don't necessarily know where you are until they actually you know get on the call and ask you so I I don't think that that really changes that much of the calculus for a venture capitalist unless something really dramatically changes which is possible but I think it's too early to say so the the other big news last week you know speaking of all the stuff going on with regulation it was about this firm called promethium so this became a bit of a Twitter Witch Hunt hullabaloo so last week when the house Financial Services subcommittee did their hearing on digital assets uh they they had a number of witnesses that they interrogated about you know what was going on in the industry and one of them was this gentleman from a firm called promethium which is the first SEC approved special purpose broker dealer to trade digital asset Securities okay so what the hell does that mean special purpose broker dealer is basically a broker dealer license we can trade you have some special abilities that normal broker dealers don't have uh that's my understanding they were the first and only one that's ever been approved for digital asset securities now the problem with this is that digital asset Securities as a concept do not exist there are no registered digital asset Securities so uh this person you know basically they went on stage and they were kind of uh they're basically like an SEC shill effectively they were advocating for the importance of the SEC being the the regulator of choice for the digital asset industry they basically backed the SEC and said yes everything in crypto is a security all these tokens are securities they should not be uh traded by retail investors they should they should register and file disclosures and all the stuff uh they're all these scams in the industry and the industry needs to be protected uh retail investors need to be protected from the industry and uh but then as he got interrogated by Congress Congress started pulling out some of the Congress people who are asking them questions they're pulling out some weird stuff about his exchange so for example uh they raised a 50 million dollar reggae plus to issue a token just kind of weird because there is no token and their website has been scrubbed of any mentions of a token they raised 48 million dollars with uh wanchong which is a group all affiliated with a with a fund called hash key that invested into them and uh they now wanchang hash key they have connections to the CCP which is kind of strange and and they they mentioned that they went through uh an investigation by sypheus which is the group that checks out these kind of weird you know International connections um but nothing happened their broker through which they raised this 40 million dollars was a group called Network One financial securities which was the broker behind the Long Island blockchain Iced Tea pivot has a track record of a ton of regulatory violations basically super Shady for whatever reason now and the most obvious thing that's very strange about this company is that you can't trade anything on promethium now what I mean you can't train anything you cannot trade Bitcoin you cannot trade either you cannot trade stable coins you cannot trade Solana or compound or whatever actually ironically enough they list Compound on the site as though compound is something that you could trade but you you can't of course because compound is not registered with the SEC as a digital asset security so there is nothing actually that can be done with this platform and so there's a lot of uh weird questions because there's some connections from the team to people who work formally at the SEC or work with various agencies so now there are questions of like why did the SEC approve this guy with no real track record no real business uh no real ability to trade anything and have this person go in front of Congress and basically say this is so great the SEC should uh should do everything why can't you just do what we did the best part you forgot the best part everyone except Promethean who has a law degree got a law degree from a place that that is not um accredited by no marketing I thought that was the best part of the story yes so um it's a really bizarre situation and a bunch of Twitter sleuths Matt Walsh in particular were able to track down a lot of this information uh after the hearings but basically the entire internet is now Awash with people trying to figure out what is going on here it's super super weird conspiracy theory conspiracy theory so you know you're talking about how like hey the SEC was like the one who like tried to nudge BlackRock maybe they did this as a way to because they got so much bad press from Promethean they're like BlackRock go go go distracted I mean it's entirely possible you know I know it sounds crazy but it's I don't know what is if that it's not that crazy yeah I mean the blockchain association just filed a foia request so the SEC is going to have to share exactly what led them to decide to approve this this group given all the weirdness behind them and also the fact that there there was really there there doesn't seem to be any business plan as far as one can tell even though they raise a giant pile of money I don't think the issue is approving this group I think the issue is approving this group and not approving anybody else including reputable businesses with long successful track records like coinbase that we're trying to get approved to be able to get these licenses and approving promethium but not existing entities with credibility and a track record and all of these things that's the part that boggles the mind you know I I think there should be approvals for organizations like Prometheus I think there should be way more of them I don't think promethium which is like you know red flags out the Wazoo should be for whatever reason the only entity that's ever been giving this type of license that's the astounding part listen the red flags are comical but I think that the core Point as you're mentioning Robert I I don't even know that it's so much that okay promethium got approved and other people didn't it's more that the story the SEC is telling is that if you just come in and register then you can run this business in a legal way well this is what that looks like this is what the SEC thinks that you're supposed to do you're supposed to do what promethium did and launch an exchange that cannot trade anything literally there's no asset that can be traded on this platform so what is the point of them securing the special purpose broker-dealer when it basically means that their business is is is dead there is nothing that can be done on this platform they have to sit around and wait for the SEC to approve other digital asset Securities so that they can be traded on this platform without any knowledge of what those will be or whether there is even a path for the digital assets that people want to trade like you know the SEC has claimed that Solana is a digital asset security okay how to Solana register there is no there is no explanation there is no story there's no path it has never happened um so that I think is really the Crux of the problem it's not just that hey why did you approve from atheists and not approve coinbase if they told coinbase well you could just do what promethium did that is a non-answer that is basically saying look you must you know don't do your business it's essentially a way of it's a sort of kafka-esque double speak instead of saying no you can't do this with that it's a sold bound token to be non-transferable it was a bad joke about like hey like I bought this thing you can't do any trading with it but look I can show you like I bought this thing like a soldier okay all right all right it's a pull app for showing up at the sec's office yes and paying a lot of money but they're the only ones who got that yes that's the other thing one of one one of one right right yeah so the the other story from the um kind of regulated exchange side is this exchange called edx the edx they were funded I believe last year by sitsak uh Citadel Securities Fidelity Schwab as well as Paradigm and Sequoia um and virtue and a few other groups and they are now launching a basically like sort of a tradify exchange so it's a it's a non-custodial exchange but when they say non-custernal they don't mean defy non-custodial they mean non-custodial in the traditional sense which is that there is a custodian that will hold your funds and they are just the you know basically they do the uh the actual trading and the execution the matchmaking but the the clearing happens on your custodian um so this is a members only exchange this is not something that you can just you know show up install the IOS app and start trading um this is something basically for financial institutions to be able to trade uh they can trade Bitcoin ether Litecoin and Bitcoin cash which they're now I guess there's some confidence now that you know ether is not a security I guess because it's being traded on this platform any any thoughts on this one I don't know if anyone so I I think I I have a hot take that that maybe maybe you you may or may not agree with which I think any Venture funded Exchange in that's targeting traditional Finance people has completely failed in many different levels like everything from the Eric Reese thing which like never [ __ ] took off the you know the Lean Startup is about making the Lean Startup is about a book by Eric Reeves about like how you should like be very uh minimalistic when making a startup he didn't take his own advice he uh he took 10 years to make this exchange that has like negligible market share at best and it was called like the good exchange or something right yeah something like that long-term Stock Exchange very very small Angel Investors oh yeah I mean their market share is abysmal they raise like a ridiculous amount of money it didn't work all of these kind of like people who were in 2017 raising money you know like finance and then sort of FTX we're the only real survivors that made real exchanges and neither of them had like tons of venture funding on off the ground but then there are these people who raise tons of money in 2018 to do crypto exchanges and some of them were institutional somewhere in dot dot dot all them kind of hit that hit the hay uh I think the other thing is like anyone who offers Bitcoin cash is just never gonna make it like who the [ __ ] who the [ __ ] trades Bitcoin cash what are you doing just like taking the other side of Roger Vera's bad loans like always like I don't understand the Bitcoin cash part is a mystery it does seem a little um Off the Mark for what institutions in the US want to be trading but um I don't know it doesn't cost anything let me tell you I I want I once recently had The Misfortune of looking at Roger Vera's Instagram and so I I'll tell you you're always taking the other side of Roger ver you're increasing his his lifestyle Habits by trading Bitcoin cash I see I mean I agree with you that uh these do not have a good track record obviously almost all these institutional exchanges have belly flopped immediately the difference now might be that a lot of these institutions just might be scared to trade on coinbase at this point and this might be the moment that there is there's actually enough legs of this thing that especially with the custody rule uh now you know getting closer to being enforced by the SEC as well as the the you know the the frontal assault on juendes there's at least a path to be being able to create enough liquidity for this kind of thing to potentially work um I do think that the Venture returns are probably not going to be there I mean this was funded in like uh early 2022 I think so it was near the height of the market that that this company was funded so I doubt this is going to be a great return for anyone even if they are successful at gaining institutional traction within the US you have to bet on the market growing a lot among institutions for this thing to really be a U.S based institutions U.S based institutions like not yeah like I I it just like feels a little too little especially if the exchange is only doing matching like matching at high throughput is not something that like you earn one percent on right like exchanges are hard and have like a moat and market share because like they do all the things right now like they do the custody and the matching and the settlement and uh everything right well they're supposed to be Ed exposed to actually open their own clearing agents they're not going to use Apex or something like that so like I I I they're trying to go for that vertically integrated plate to be fair it's just like the licensing is like you know you're not going to get all of them at once you're gonna have to do it incrementally but and that that they have said they want to do that so I I will give them credit for that it does seem like they're trying to that makes sense all right I think that I think I mean we'll see what happens vdx I don't want to be too uh I don't want to guess too much because I think the thing just launched so we'll see how things I just I don't understand how you think you're gonna make money with Bitcoin cash listed you know like yeah there's so many other things I would offer I would offer like Lido what can you offer you can't you cannot offer Lido are you serious no no like Steve not not lied over the token okay okay uh I mean if busd is a security according to the SEC would not steth also be a security you got to take chances and risk Bitcoin cash is not a risk I mean look I I don't agree but I I really think that I mean this is kind of it the only other thing you can add is Doge right and then maybe stablecoin sure that Doge even seems more famous like this is just such a boomer exchange they didn't even like try to attract anything that younger buyers would ever want I mean look this basically minus xrp this used to be the coinbase lineup pretended nothing happened like great uh look Litecoin I just tweeted about this yesterday Litecoin still does more volume than Solana or polygon or you know almost anything in uh that that people actually use the Litecoin is still like coin I'm fine like I'm fine Bitcoin cash is the one where I'm like I mean Bitcoin cash a bit of history but you know yeah cool last story I want to get to and to ruin this one uh this one especially for you so uh last week there was a big kerfuffle in defy around Ave so Ave of course biggest uh on-chain lending Market um there is a token called CRV which is a token of curve protocol and the founder of curve Michael igorov he had a big outstanding loan he borrowed 60 million plus of stable coins against 288 million CRV which is worth about 180 million so he had 60 million borrowed against 180 million of collateral now the problem with this I mean it's a pretty healthy loan uh all things equal the problem with this is that there's only 850 million CRV in existence and about 300 of that 850 million was locked into this loan meaning that if this loan were to be liquidated for whatever reason if the curve price were to collapse um there is absolutely no way that any of this stuff could get liquidated for anywhere near what the market price would be just because of how you know it's almost like a third of or maybe more than a third of all of the outstanding CRV was locked into Ave in this single loan so uh Gauntlet which is uh Tyrone's company which I don't know maybe you want to explain what happened from here Yeah so basically you know we spent a lot of time monitoring these protocols and seeing like what hey like how much margin should they allow for a particular asset um and you know what the interest rates should be and stuff like that based on a bunch of different sort of math factors and how the markets are behaving off chain how the market Supreme on chain how much liquidity is in certain protocols how much of the liquidity is locked in certain protocols no astrology the only the only the only thing that's uh in common between what we do and astrology is the num as a prefix of numerology as a subject not report the status of mercury anymore on chain you can't pull it in I'm sure I'm sure that does you can you can write a right now I'm sure that exists somewhere um so basically you know one of the interesting things about Ave V2 is it doesn't really have Supply caps so the the new versions do and so because there's no Supply cap for especially for assets that were some of the earliest ones listed um they kind of aggregate supply over a while and igorov uh in a lot of ways outside of being in the press for his new houses um also is probably one of the biggest most active borrowers in all of defy in like every protocol like any single lending protocol that exists you will find his addresses no matter what like he moved he moved you know he he King made some some very random like uh tiny uh fixed rate lender in response to the survey thing actually uh the other day but so so long story short it's it's kind of curve is is one of the assets that like Ave grew a lot on and so the community is actually extremely fond of this asset it sort of has sentimental value to them because like during defense mental value there's sentimental value we're not removing it is my point right like like it's kind of a badass to have you know for you can go through the governance proposals of many people including us being like we should stop allowing borrowing remove it do all this stuff and the Ave Community is actually has a lot of voices and a lot of them got rich off curve and so they they have this sort of like we could never get rid of curve there's like a little bit of that tendency you can sometimes see in people okay um long story short there was this point where curva could do was like basically non-existent so like even though egress positions net Health Factor so Health factor is like how much uh collateral you have divided by how much you're borrowing and so the higher it is the better because it sort of says like you know your collateral if you default on your loan at least your collateral is worth at least significantly more and you're over collateralized and most things in D5 are over collateralized and uh the most things that are real that don't blow up NAFTA add that caveat after Luna and so you know I think as people were freaking out about this one thing um we did which is we we put up this proposal that failed but it it it had the exact intended effect which is the proposal was to like restrict borrowing and basically you know like force the uh user to to adjust their position or take a loss and in the process just the act of The Proposal being up led to igorov de-risking his position and then telling the block that he de-risked his position because he saw the proposal so defy governance you know I think is very different than than other Dow governance in crypto because it's very focused on these types of quite quite precise events um but anyway the main thing is curve liquidity wasn't there so even though the the collateral Factor looked good if it had to be liquidated and you sold all that curve you would cause the price to go down so much that the loan would spiral was there an estimate of like if the the position was liquidated what would it actually be worth yeah I think we in in some of the Forum posts we put our simulation estimates and then like the realized estimates um over time but I think it was like around 40 cents was 42 cents was the the worst and 42 cents but this thing was like more than 2x over collateralized so it would have been you know it wasn't 2x it was 1.55 and also igorov you know very um interesting person but but I would say he uh he he's he's probably one of the smartest users in D5 if you track his addresses he's constantly like rebalancing his portfolio to like stay at this particular Health factor and I feel like he just has a script that's doing he's just like he it's like always in this one band but clearly he's rebalancing without taking it in liquidity into account which is why people are freaking out and so the interesting thing is putting a proposal that can make it hard for him to to adjust his position suddenly makes him delever and then like it then like the market move the other way so it was it was an interesting kind of case study of of governance in that sense uh in the sense so that the gauntlet proposal was to freeze the position not allow him to not freeze his position freeze the market so people yeah yeah so the market can no longer grow it can only contract yes exactly exactly exactly and so by doing that you make it hard to do these rebalances that that he was doing a lot of and so so then he was like okay I should lower my risk in curve terms and you know if you followed on chain stuff he was like withdrawing a bunch of fracks and a bunch of steak teeth and different assets and using that as collateral and those are much more well not the frax part but the because the frax was for fraxland but the stake Teeth part is a much more reliable piece of collateral so like at that Health Factor if you had a liquidated a bunch of steak beef it would have been fine there's tons of liquidity for it ironically in curve but he also I mean repaid a little bit of the loan right like a few mil I think he said in Discord he like was Liquid enough to repay the whole loan if he needed to which is I guess kind of a gift but he did he did just buy these like 40 million dollar houses in Australia so and that is true and like the memes were all about how like Ave is going to be a real world asset exchange because like it's secretly collateralized by igorov's mansions and stuff like that wow that is fascinating the really interesting thing to me is why why do you think the Ave Community rejected the proposal well because I I there's a philosophical thing against freezing and especially for curve I think like there have been a couple times that we've done freeze proposals that have worked like whereas like the market was like like around the usdcd peg um we send a bunch of uh freezes on Avalanche um because Avalanche had native usdc and like the native versus synthetic usdc pools were completely out of whack and it was like impossible to liquidate a bunch of them and so the community then was like very open to that but but again I there's something interesting about the flavor of of Community Driven Finance where there is sentimental attachment to certain assets like like there is really it is or sentimental app apathy or even like you know anti-antipathy in the sense of like people not putting tether anywhere in default right like that's that's like a unspoken rule almost a sort of weird sort of lore astrological law let's say um but but but my point is uh you know that there's a lot of this stuff and and really you know understanding the the needs of these communities and this happens at normal lenders too for the record like in the real world where they're like let's say I'm a commercial real estate lender uh and Commercial Real Estate is in the dumpster right now yet it's kind of hard for me to start start doing loans in something I don't know because my underwriting process doesn't work or I'm like kind of not you know so so sometimes you see similar types of behavior where people have some attachment it's just funny in this case more because ninety percent of the revenue from this is coming from this one person who is also the creator of the tokens right right it's it's interesting because you could look at this and say kind of in the way you're describing of like look this is why direct democracy for something that's as technocratic as an on-chain lending protocol is kind of weird because people are going to make these emotional decisions about oh no CRV I made all my money like it's very nostalgic so let's not liquidate despite the fact that it's literally one dude borrowing like you know basically buying houses with his CRV position oh the best part is the loan is almost like is the close to the sum of the property value yeah exactly that was like the best part he like bought a bunch of houses if you add those up the loan was only a tiny amount of margin over that yeah the other side of it now if you if you think the other side of that you Steel Man um why why is it that these people rejected this the Steel Man of it is that okay maybe the the collective intelligence of Ave is that look Ave is not playing a One-Shot game the way that Gauntlet might be modeling this as a one shot game of like oh okay the risk of default is this blah blah but when you have a great borrower who's been borrowing with you for a long time and a bunch of other Protocols are going to take a signal from how you treat that borrower when that borrower is taking a lot of excessive risk is that look you can say cut you off you know look you're out you're out of uh out of bounds of the of the loan contract get the [ __ ] out and you know we're not doing business anymore or you can say like look I understand where things are going you're having a tough time like I'm going to extend you a little bit of extra all I have to say is people in the beginning were not like that right they they were once they should actually started we can give them credit that that's what was going on through the collective intelligence of the Ave governance commitment I will I will say it it didn't quite start that way it started with the like Panic free is now and the most important thing from our perspective was like hey actually if this just works as a a thing to get the user to change their behavior then it kind of already did you don't even need the freeze Market yeah very fair very fair in Old School Bitcoin um academic blend there's the thing for this called a feather fork and feather forking is this idea of like a group of miners so like a big mining pool telling everyone that they're going to reject a particular fork and if there's a sufficient size the probability that other people will try to continue on on that fork they measure their EV and it goes to zero provided the pool size is large enough but it doesn't need to be 50 it's actually less and so this idea of like hey the feather Fork the minority can scare the the users into before it sort of had this it reminded me of that and that I thought that was kind of funny it's a little bit like sending a strongly worded email you know where it's like it's not quite the same thing as putting someone in default but it's sort of like hey we noticed that your position it's a little bit like a three arrows default right where like you don't actually put them in default but you just sort of like Hey Joe but hey that stuff works but you know three hours clearly uh has seemingly come back from the dead according to the internet speaking of them I mean they had a New York Times puffies you know but now they have a new fund does everyone know any details about it I just saw Twitter hullabaloo but I don't know actually what anything about this one there three AC Ventures it's new it's not three I see it's three AC Ventures that's right that's right which is the part of their book that obviously did the best is uh I feel like I feel like I would change the logo to the right like 3ac and then add a D in parentheses next to the C in a a v there's so much that you can do to make it to be to be like to take the humor in stride about 3ac coming back from the dead but it seems like they were just very you know just is it kind of I I I would instead uh I think that they should make something called three AC Adventures where they take everyone on tourism tours through all the fancy exotic locations there it's a way to see Bali Adventures yeah it sounds pretty good what was the fruit that they talked about uh there's like oh you just gotta eat strawberries or something what was it I missed I remember in the New York Times it was fatty pork belly but I don't know yeah that was one of the things they talked about that's one of the things they talked about anyway all right I think we're up on time um but uh we'll be back next week hopefully uh hopefully things are are turning around for our good old Pals in the crypto industry until then thanks everybody all right
