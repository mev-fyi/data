think about the fact that in recent months and in the past year we've spent billions of dollars taxpayer dollars to try to lure and incent the return of semiconductors to United States for national security reasons I'd hate to see us make that same mistake with respect to crypto I'd hate to see innovations that were either originally or largely developed here in the United States pushed offshore and for the country in 30 years to be spending even more money to try to lure that industry back after it's had a tremendous record of success in other markets that's one way in which I think about

greatwall Chief legal officer at coinbase and Rebecca Reddick Chief policy officer at polygon Labs welcome Rebecca and Paul hi Laura thanks for having us hey Laura thank you there's been a flurry of regulatory activity targeting crypto over the last few weeks before we get into all the details around the many different developments let's just talk high level give an overview of what you think is happening here is there coordination you know is there some kind of strategy you've seen that you see going on is there like one end Target that they're all aiming at what do you think is happening I'll jump in to start I think there are two things happening one I think there has been a long discussion about additional regulatory Crackdown on crypto some of it probably was taking a while to wind its way through the various agencies and Regulators in DC but I do think the end of 2022 with the implosion of FTX really cleared the path for a lot of these regulatory actions to move much more quickly especially because Congress while they're work well there are a number of great policy makers working on various pieces of legislation relating to different aspects of the of the crypto markets and the crypto ecosystem will not be able to take those as actions as quickly as The Regulators will be um but I do think um the other piece of it is nobody sort of expected crypto to have this you know clean entry path into sort of changing all of our paradigms and decentralizing and things like that so I think some of this was inevitable but I do think that as I said FTX really sped things up in terms of the speed and the validity with which some of these regulatory actions could come through yeah if uh you look back over the course of 2022 there's three arrows Celsius and Voyager and all the rest left kindling on the forest floor there's no question FTX was the bolt of lightning that set set things on fire the other thing I think that we're seeing happening now is that you've got a number of regulators under tremendous pressure to do something to show that they are reacting and responding to the events of the past year and if you combine that at the same time with a long painful downturn in the crypto Market you just have a perfect storm or combination of events which in many ways makes the actions we've seen over the last week or two entirely predictable sorry one other point I'll put on it is I think what we saw through 2022 was this idea you know they were all at every conference you'd see panels like institutional adoption of crypto you know the institutions are coming and international Regulators like the financial stability board and the bank of international settlements had put out a lot of different pieces of research that said things like once crypto starts touching the traditional markets we really have to start being careful because you know this is an unregulated asset class as of now and the volatility in the markets May really tip things on the traditional side and so I think to Paul's point when we really saw FTX and sort watched it and heard about how it had fanned out into some more institutional players there was even more impetus to really crack down as Paul said through some of these other Regulators so one thing I noticed neither of you said and I'm seeing a lot of this on Twitter so I have to ask about this is that on Twitter it seems like a lot of the crypto Community finds that a lot of these regulatory actions are either kind of overreaching they're not appropriate they're like The Regulators feel like they have to do something but it wasn't really the right thing you know I see people mocking the regulator saying oh you didn't save me from you know FTX stealing my money but now you're going to prevent me from making money via Kraken staking or you know whatever just those I that may not be an exact quote but you know that those kinds of sentiments and basically saying The Regulators are just doing whatever but it doesn't make sense and the stuff that they should have been paying attention to they didn't so you know do you think that that's a valid kind of criticism that we're seeing from the community I think it's valid to ask why so much activity seems to be focused on one-off enforcement actions that look by by definition backwards and retrospectively on events that have long since happened and I've already hurt people in real ways I think what a lot of people are are asking in that same spirit is where are the rules that info that could and should inform how we ought to be keeping customers and investors safe prospectively now we for example coinbase have been calling for rule making now for months and months we filed a petition with the SEC back in July we heard nothing we filed comments to our own petition raising additional questions that we think could and should be answered to keep consumers customers investors safe still haven't received any answer and in the meantime we're seeing the enforcement actions continue again in a sort of ad hoc and one-off way that doesn't really do much to keep people safe which is I think what most people actually want to see happen I I tend to agree with Paul on that and I think what people are reacting to is what Paul was saying so I think the overreach question here is okay we had a singular enforcement action against the way Kraken had set up their staking as a service and then we have a subsequent um statement by chair Gensler where he says this should be an admonishment to anyone who does staking as a service right and coinbase did put out a statement afterwards and I don't want to steal your thunder Paul so I know you'll talk about it but you know instead the way we do staking as a service is fundamentally different and there are other parts to um the complaint which you know distinguish either the types of disclosures that may have been enough that certainly distinguish staking as a user or you know in a more crypto native way just on a blockchain network and so I think the statements that really do cause fear uh in the crypto ecosystem and again with retail users because the statements you know may happen and then chair gunstlers on Squawk Box the next morning talking about it and really speaking to maybe not even users but what we'd call normies you know just traditional people who are in the financial markets and the message they're getting is crypto is bad crypto is for criminals and so I think that there is this massive chilling effect even through these one-off enforcement actions I think the other piece of it is enforcement actions are not presidential law they don't set the law what they do is they say this set of facts and circumstances we the SEC thought was illegal and the important part to take away is Kraken to not admit or deny liability they settled to you know have some finality and some certainty around it so they can go around conducting what other other parts of their business they believe are important without going in for a long-haul fight with the SEC I think the other piece of it that we need to take away is a lot of companies have just settled because what they've seen is these long protracted litigations so the Ripple litigation is a great one right that's been winding its way through the district court only for years about whether xrp is a security or not and people don't want to you know there are some great people who do want to fight and I and believe that they are in the right and I support doing that 100 but a lot of people don't want to do that just for business reasons and so these types of enforcement actions even if the you know industry players believe they are right will just settle and move forward to call it a day and so then you use those settlements as some sort of chilling effect when they don't have real legal presidential value and I think that may also be what people are reacting to as well so what you're saying is sort of like any program that's a set of exactly like Krakens kind of knows okay we need to change it but then the question is for any for any other program that has any different features then it's a question of okay well now are we in the clear now are we in the clear and there's no Clarity around that is that okay that's exactly right and the the complaint against Kraken does give some some nuances and some details of like it's different here and this is different but that you what can you take away from that if you go get a you know a Wells notice or a subpoena or something from the SEC and they say well you should have taken this away from the Kraken complaint you don't know if that is true or not or you say well I took this away from the cracking complaint and this SEC can say well that was wrong that's not the right interpretation so it doesn't give any true regulatory Clarity unless as you said Laura it's set up exactly so it's he the way Krakens was even there of course we're still talking about allegations a complaint nothing that's been proven in a court of law nothing that has any binding presidential effect so even the presidential uh value of of the complaint against Kraken is really only to give some limited insight into how the SEC views that particular staking product or program it doesn't give any insight whatsoever as to what the law actually is and that's the problem when you rely upon a regulation by enforcement regime instead of noticing common rule making that's required by Congress well so I don't know if you guys want to have a moment where you kind of try to analyze this suddenly because my next question for you was going to be whether or not you think that there's any broader implications you can take from the settlement for either direct staking mean just like a solo Staker for centralized exchanges offering sticking as a service or for decentralized liquid staking providers such as light or rocket pole did either of you feel like you kind of could come away with any rules for any of those based on the settlement well when we looked at when we looked at the settlement and and did our level best to look at how the Kraken products were characterized in the in the complaint it became very clear to us that kraken's products operated in a particular way and in ways that were very different from others taking products like coinbases for example with coinbases staking products there's no question about who owns the assets as part of the service title always remains with the customer it never passes to coinbase it never passes to anybody else and so a primary motivation as we surmise from the complaint simply doesn't apply in a host of other situations there are other important differences for example with the Kraken staking product there seemed to be a particular concern with the ability of customers to get exactly what they had expected in terms of rewards in terms of commissions and fees and so forth that's not an issue with other staking products like coinbases or the simple fact that the the reward Awards to the extent they're earned are set by the network there's no there's no discretion there that's just basic Network math and the commissions that coinbase sets are fully disclosed in our help center so at all points in time customers understand what to expect so you know there are important differences that distinguish other products like coinbase is from what was at issue in the Kraken complaint but we do think that beyond that there is a broader question of just how far is the SEC willing to go and an year to go to cast a Paul over all staking to raise questions and cast aspersions about staking uh in general and obviously staking is a very important part of the proliferation growth of many different projects and networks and so even where as in this case we think we stand clearly separate and apart from what was at issue in the cracking case it's very important to coinbase and many others in the industry to speak out about what we're seeing because that Cloud that's being cast those questions and dispersions that are being thrown about can often be as damaging as a complaint or or a verdict in District Court yeah and to sort of build on what Paul was saying again this is all we can take away from allegations and a complaint that have not been admitted I do think the complaint does make distinctions with user staking on its own paragraph 39 of the complaint says the crack and staking program has several features that differentiate it from staking and earning rewards on your own so they do think about it from an individual perspective and paragraph for 44 does the same thing it says the returns that investors receive from the crack and staking program differ from the returns that an investor could expect if the investor staked directly and then it goes on to say some other things so I do think it's the sec's complaint here against Kraken and let's keep it narrow is focused on a centralized actor providing a service taking custody not making disclosures that the SEC thinks are appropriate but I do think that the SEC at least in this complaint alone and Paul's right we've heard Rumblings about how our Regulators are going to go against individual staking but in this complaint alone it at least shows the some willingness to distinguish a custodial staking as a service program from users taking on their own and I think that's a really important distinction okay well one other thing that I saw people kind of laughing about was when announcing the settlement SCC chair Gary Gensler urged crypto companies to come in and register and in response Jesse Powell the former CEO of Kraken and the founder and a disclosure Kraken is a former sponsor of the show he tweeted oh man all I had to do was fill out a form on a website and tell people that staking rewards come from staking wish I'd seen this video before paying a 30 million dollar fine and agreeing to permanently shut down the service in the U.S how dumb do I look gosh and then he put a little gas emoji and then a little light Emoji so who's right here like is genser rights should Kraken have registered and if so like register as what or is it kind of what Jesse then later tweeted which was he he wrote and this was about the custody role that was being proposed he wrote Step One require registration a custody crypto step two don't let anyone register which which actually I think Hollins Belton made that point on my show a couple years ago but anyway so what's going on here well Laura look whether or not Kraken should have registered or anyone else should register for their uh for their products is an entirely separate question from whether anyone actually can register and the suggestion somehow that registration is simply a matter of going to a website downloading a form and completing a few Fields is to put it gently laughable these are complicated products there are real challenges in terms of fitting these very new technologies into some very old structures and the reality is that for most new projects in particular putting the central exchanges to the side from them registration isn't a practical option given the burden the expense the number of lawyers and accountants that are required in order to complete even a basic filing that you know it's important to to not lose sight of just how impossible it is for most to comply with the rules even where they're interested in complying with rules now Central exchanges like coinbase and others we are extremely interested in complying with the rules that's why we we do we have very recent experience registering with the SEC of course because when we went public in April 2021 we had to complete an S1 and and go through that entire registration process so I think there's a fair and reasonable conversation to be had about where registration ought to be required and what rules ought to be established again ideally through a public process that's transparent for registration but let's not minimize and dismiss serious work and serious burdens on Ordinary People by suggesting that all they have to do is click on a few links on a web page and be done but you know even that aside I think the word we have to focus on and what Paul said is impossible and it's not impossible just from a burden perspective lots of companies and it's you know a lot of them are large and have very large Revenue models can pay lawyers and pay the fees and spend the time the burden itself isn't what we should be focused on right now and as you mentioned Khan said this on your show a long time ago I was in private practice for a long time um representing crypto companies lawyers have been tweeting about it recently if you take a client as outside counsel into the SEC or if a client goes in a company goes into the SEC and goes to corpfin and says I would like to register the typical refrain and Paul may have a different experience but the typical refrain is we're not sure what to register you as or we're not sure how to register this product and so the impossibility point that Paul made is not just about the cost it's about the the fitting new paradigms into these old rules and then you may get a you know a Wells known as their subpoena later from the enforcement arm of the SEC and you say well I tried to go and register with corporate and they told me I couldn't do it so I think you know that is more the disingenuous point and it goes back to what I was saying before about this PR tour to go tell uh you know in a video um the American people registering with the SEC o like filling out a Google form is is disingenuous because it is a much more complex product and it is a much more complex process and it is especially for products like new Innovative technologically based products like crypto that were not contemplated back when the Securities laws were written in 1933 and 1934. so if you guys were to come up with a wish list of what you'd like to see from the SEC to kind of fill in some of those pieces that you say are just sort of being left blanket at the moment in terms of like a framework for operating within the the bounds of what is legal to uh to them what would that look like or the good news for for me and for coinbase is that we don't have to come up with a wish list we've actually published our wish list when we when we petitioned for rulemaking last July and raised something like 50 or more um separate questions that we think need to be answered again in a public transparent open process in order to strike the right balance between yes of course protecting consumers protecting investors on the one hand and at the same time nurturing innovation in an important emerging industry to give you an example or two of questions I'd like to see answered as part of a public rulemaking process I want to start with where where Rebecca pointed us just a minute ago for crypto projects and for issuers the disclosure requirements um that would apply in any registration scheme need to account for some of the very unique features of crypto both positive and negative on the positive side so much of the activity and actions of the project when it comes to crypto are publicly available on the blockchain don't require any particular new set of of disclosures and schemes beyond what people can observe for themselves and we think that's a real positive on the negative side the the because the registrations that have been pointed to involve you know the same level of accounting and other disclosures that you would expect of a of a company looking to go public we think there needs to be some recognition or or accommodation for the fact that most or at least many of these projects are self-funded at the time that they would have to register or are receiving their first rounds of funding and so there just needs to be an accommodation I think for the burdens on issuers because you know an exchange could register as a national Securities Exchange tomorrow but if they don't have assets to list because none of the asset issuers are able to comply there's nothing to achieved there we think it would be a hollow and empty Victory so those are at least a few of the ideas I'd like or issues I'd like to see confronted in a rule making process there are many many others as well I'm gonna give a somewhat contrarian answer which is I don't want to I do want to see rule making from the SEC on some things but what I want to see more than anything and people should remember rules promulgated from the SEC can change Administration to Administration that's true of a lot of regulatory bodies we've seen that you know with the OCC and rules that were put into place that were then rolled back when the administration changed I really want to see a robust Market infrastructure bill that lays out a good system for how centralized crypto actors should go forward and thinking about this technology for sure and then rules can be made within the bounds of that bill but I think the legislative process is really where we should start and I am hopeful because there are a lot of very motivated policy makers on the hill who are working on different bills on different aspects stable coin Bill we saw come out the market infrastructure bill I think people are really thinking about but that's where I want to see people put their efforts right now and then we can see rule making within the bounds of those bills all right we're going to tackle um another big topic here and this kind of starts with um a sort of confusing set of actions at least to me being a non-legal person so we have the SEC I guess issue a Wells notice against paxos at the same time that the New York Department of Financial Services asked paxus to stop issuing busd so do you think that those actions were coordinated and what was the intention here is it something that has to do with stable coins themselves or is it really as I saw a lot of speculation about a way to kind of get it financed and cut it off from like US dollars or the equivalent um you know what do you think was kind of going on there it's pretty hard to imagine or to believe that actions announced nearly simultaneously weren't coordinated in some way but even if that weren't true I think the fact that you have multiple agencies at the state level and at the federal level all interested in the same issue certainly suggests that that the stable coins that were issued by Pax as the busd were attracting a unique amount of attention for for important reasons now I will say that nydfs the Department of Financial Services at least based on what's been publicly reported which is of course all that any of us know focused on some very specific issues that were separate apart from the Securities Law questions that we've been debating when it comes to stable coins across crypto the issue appears to have focused from DFS perspective on diligence was was paxos and is paxos properly examining who's on their platform who's gaining access um to the coins and so on and so forth and separately paxus's diligence on binance and so those topics of course stand separate apart from whether or not these were actually Securities what we've seen I think those in in this instance is another example where um State Regulators have an important role to play and are demonstrating their their ability to properly supervise um these these markets regardless of whether or not there's Merit to this particular case or not I think the fact that you've got State Regulators stepping in is something that people in crypto should be paying very careful attention to even as we're all being drawn to the um fireworks coming out of the SEC on a daily basis but I do want to back up and explain why the New York Department of Financial Services looking at paxos at all which is the New York Department of Financial Services regulates paxos I believe is a trust company and I think coinbase is also a regulated trust company which I assume will come up later in this discussion under the New York State regime and being a Trust Company the easiest way is to liken it a bit to being a bank it's certainly not a bank and I don't want people to be confused by that but I do think it's an important distinction and once you are under the DFS regime you are subject to regular examinations by a state regulator they are very onerous you have a very high bar of requirements both on the financial side and on the Cyber requirement side it's a very strict regime so you know what happened recently that may have brought questions about binance even more to the four maybe what has motivated DFS because it's not that DFS woke up one day and said oh we don't like binance because they have clearly been regulating paxos for many years paxos has been going through clearly successfully examinations and frequent contact with DFS so I do believe that there's probably something more binance related that has my that has potentially come to light and agree with Paul that I mean Regulators within the United States both at the state and the federal level do coordinate amongst themselves frequently and so there may have been some real coordination here we'll never know but we can only speculate on that but I think it's important to understand where DFS was coming from it's not like they they had always been regulating them unlike the SEC who doesn't regulate paxos at least today uh you know from a regular standpoint yeah I think that's exactly right Rebecca if I can just add one other quick Point Laura I I think if you take a step back and um and look at this particular example it's reasonable to ask why are we all guessing as to whether or not there's coordination here why why isn't why isn't that a matter of public record it seems to me that if there are legitimate and appropriate concerns that are shared by state and federal Regulators they should be perfectly willing to share them in a transparent open Forum so that we all can understand what those concerns are and there won't there won't be any mystery about whether there's any kind of Shadow coordination campaign going I think the fact that we're all guessing and speculating and trying to read tea leaves um speaks to a failure in the system that relies upon one-off enforcement actions rather than a public rule-making process and so it sounds like both of you feel that kind of the main purpose of this had to do more with binance than stable coins generally or do you see any broader implications for stable coins in general sure I'll give the lawyer answer which is it depends um not all stable coins are created equal a lot of them look very different and I think that's why there was a big push last year to build out a stable coin Bill to bring some uniformity and some certainty around it both from what backs these stable coins the amount of reserves the you know the necessary disclosures and the like I think that chair again star has made some comments to say yeah I think that some of these uh stable coins will be regulated as some form of security or at least under the Securities laws but I don't think he has made the same type of sweeping statements he's made about all tokens all tokens or Securities or almost all tokens are securities the same way about stable coins I think that there are nuance distinctions and hopefully those will apply as as we go forward more than anything and I'll just sort of keep hammering this home I hope there's legislation that distinguishes what is and is not a security and how stable coins should be regulated going forward yeah I think the differences do matter when it comes to stable coins the fact of the matter is if you're talking about USD backed stable coins the argument that they somehow qualify as Securities under the current case law and the statutes that constrain the sec's jurisdiction are pretty weak and lawyers will happily debate those until the cows come home I think though that there very well could be other types of products other types of algorithmic stable coins for example that raise more interesting questions around whether or not they qualify as Securities but again it's important that even if the complaints are narrowly drawn and the cases are specifically focused that the rhetoric around this lore doesn't expand into a sweeping condemnation of an entire asset class in a way that chills Innovation and unfortunately that's exactly what we're seeing and that's the concern that I have that even if the cases themselves may have mirrored in certain instances or others that the rhetoric itself does lasting damage to it to an asset class us and an area of innovation that's just getting started in a moment we're going to wrap up this conversation around stable coins but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible 3.8

references to how stable coins could depending on how they're structured have some resemblance to for instance money market funds which I think are regulated as Securities so do you see his point there and because Paula just sort of seemed like you were saying uh it sort of stretches the imagination to imagine they could be regulated that way but I wanted to hear yeah your take on if there's any certain types that you feel might be securities yeah well as I said um I I think the arguments for USD backs table coins are particularly weak at the same time there are certainly other types of stable coins that are in market and are being developed every day that may raise more interesting concerns and and like what features what would make you think that they might I I think that yeah to to the extent that you have expectations of profit for example being driven by decisions made by providers or issuers that are entirely in the control of those providers and issuers that aren't disclosed that uh are subject to whim and change and then ultimately reflect an asymmetry or disparity in information I think it's appropriate to ask questions but the the sweeping suggestion that I believe the chair has made in other contexts Rebecca is right in this particular case the the issues I think have been more narrowly addressed um aren't helpful they aren't helpful at a time in in a point in our industry's Evolution where these products are still being built tested and evolved so there's just I think a lot of opportunity here to be more thoughtful in addressing legitimate concerns um analogies are always helpful money market funds and other things I think are useful as ways of understanding and framing these new products and services but we shouldn't suggest to American innovators that this entire asset class may be off limits because what those American innovators are going to do is take their Innovations elsewhere and that's not something anyone I think in this country wants to see happen yeah and and I think when you're talking about this money market issue Laura there there are I think it was referring to you know in potential investment companies but there are really strict percentages of how these investment companies worked the Securities act that investment company act that regulates investment companies lays out a very prescriptive set of rules so you'd have to look at each stable coin on a case-by-case basis to see if what these stable coins are backed by if they're not fully USD or USD equivalent back meet those thresholds in the Investment Company act which all I can't remember them off the top of my head but there are very specific percentages jumping off from some point that Paul made which I'm not going to be able to phrase it the way he did because I don't remember exactly what he said but it just reminded me of this lawsuit against terraform labs in dokwan um so I don't remember pulse phrasing but basically it was something about the value of of that stable coin being dependent on you know these other people or or something it wasn't exactly that but the point is that obviously you know in the complaint we can see that the SEC is asserting that UST which whether or not you call it a stable coin it's up to you but as you know a long thing called the stable coin um and their argument was that basically because it was connected to Luna which they said was a security and the price of that depended on the price of Luna that that was why and if I've you know butchered that explanation then please feel free to correct me but um so is that kind of what where you were going Paul like I didn't know if that's kind of what you were thinking about like any kind of algorithmic stable coin and frankly my kind of mini question within that question is then which fracks fall under that because frax is you know not quite exactly like Tara it's you know more collateralized so so I think you got I think you got the basic Channel logic right uh Laura from my perspective as I said and as I think Rebecca alluded to as well the details of each coin in Project matter and so um it may it very well may be that one could construct an algorithmic stable coin um under certain um circumstances that really do implicate the federal Securities laws and the fundamental concerns that lie behind those laws which is again to take a situation where an investor is at a fundamental disadvantage in terms of understanding the operation of the project and the discretion retained by the people running the project in those circumstances there may be a reason to apply the federal Securities laws in the way that the SEC has suggested in these cases but that's not a reason to suggest even casually that somehow all stable coins now may be subject to the federal Securities laws because the implications of that are significant stable coins are not a corner case um uh use case when it comes to crypto they are an important part of the crypto economy they are in many ways I think the most successful and certainly the most prolific example of product Market fit right so I think that language matters and I think that Precision matters we'll see if as we move forward certain stable coins in fact are deemed but not by a regulator alone but by a court or by legislators as Securities but we're not at that point yet we're still very much early in the process let's jump to your Tara Point um Laura because when Paul was saying you know if there are stable coins that somehow give you um you know an expectation of profit and you think well that is antithetical to the title stable coins because you're just expecting to get you know one to one but what the SEC complaint against okon and terraform Labs alleges with respect to UST is that they Market it as a yield bearing stable coin and the reason it was yield bearing is because they created the anchor protocol for deposits of UST and then marketed the 19 to 20 yield all of which was generated by centralized actors and that's what the complaint goes on to say that the yield really came from the same types of this lending activity that the SEC took issue with with block fire right for example in that where they were taking user assets and finding different ways to deploy it to be able to give the users the promised yield and I think chair Gensler even said somewhat recently like if you're using the term yield you should really think about where it's coming from because you're probably creating a security something along those lines and I am sure I'm paraphrasing but it was a really sweeping statement and so that's where this comes from I don't think all algorithmic stable coins necessarily would be categorized as Securities again like it goes through it but frax or other algorithmic stable coins which hold its Peg theoretically through some um software uh or you know smart contract based system wouldn't necessarily be a security under the same Theory as UST because UST really was much more part of this scheme right it's not that it was UST alone there is this language under the Securities laws and in the case law that if you create a scheme where there's an investment where there's an expectation of profit then you've created the investment contract so it's that whole thing together that is what really created the scheme care that the SEC believes violated the Securities laws so right now if a client came to you and said we have this idea for a stable coin what would you advise them in terms of either how they should structure it or how they should not structure it based on what you read in the complaint against terraform labs in dokwon and and Beyond structure Market as well structure and Market I should add even before you get to the complaint we have a coinbase of course been a reseller of usdc for some time now and our experience with usdc I think you know offers some important lessons on what we think any responsible stable coin issuer ought to do in order to make sure that people have confidence for example reserves a huge topic with respect to stable coins and disclosure requirements around reserves we think that's a you know a a basic requirement that not only is something that consumers and investors ought to expect but that helps to Foster confidence more generally that when someone for example is is putting a dollar in and getting a stable coin in return that that dollar is going to be there when they want to turn that stable coin back in and get the dollar back so disclosures super super important we also think it's very important for stable coin issuers to be extremely clear about title and and the way in which title operates in and ownership operates because that also seems to be something that has quite reasonably on this point I'll give the SEC credit you know been an object of of interest and concern the last thing I would say is that and this breaks my heart to say this as an American I think any stable coin issue or ought to first ask whether or not the United States in this current climate is necessarily the best place in which to develop the project in the first instance even a short a while ago I might have not even paused on that point but I think in this particular climate with rhetoric coming out that seemingly sweeps in all sorts of stable coins regardless of all the careful work that people put in to be fair and transparent it certainly suggests that um Perhaps Perhaps other jurisdictions are worth at least looking at and are there any particular ones that you think are getting it right and are good for entrepreneurs well whether they're getting it right or not Mika the markets in crypto asset regulation which is the very comprehensive set of regulations in the EU which have already passed the European Parliament they haven't been enacted yet um they are expected to be enacted and finalized in April have a very large set of robust rules for stable coin issuers very clear clear on disclosure requirements clear on reserve requirements the reserve requirements are very onerous so um you know that's something to keep in mind but you at least will have certainty and finality and there is a rulemaking process through the EBA the European banking Association or Administration that will allow stable coin issuers to go and say Here's the how we think you we can implement the rules that are in Mika so there is a process by which there's a clear set of laws and regs you know what they're going to be they won't even be enacted by the way like effective until 2024 so you have a lot of time for compliance under Mika if you're setting up your stablecoin now or your stable frame project now so there is that and then the UK just put out its consultation on crypto assets on February 1 which also has a very set of robust recommendations for stable coins stable coins already constitute a finite a financial instrument under UK laws and they are continuing to promulgate laws and regs under their current regime in the UK there's no certainty or finality yet in the UK the way there is under Mika but the way this crypto asset consultation looks like from the treasury Department they're very very similar to Mika where they're focusing on centralized actors first and they are pushing decentralized actors and defy and things like that down the line and taking feedback on all of it you know it's interesting right um the UK and EU are not the only examples but they're I think excellent examples of how to get the rules right look at the process that they followed look at the promulgation of proposed standards the the opportunity for public input the rigor I mean the raucous debate in some cases right Rebecca around some of these topics companies like coinbase agreed with a lot of what we've seen in Mika we didn't agree with everything but there was a rational process that involved lots of public input and it was transparent you don't see when it comes to the UK or the EU a lot of scrutiny by lawyers of individual complaints or allegations or speeches by particular Commissioners in order to glean what the rules are going to be on a going forward basis the contrast between that and what we're seeing in the United States I think is um pretty damning in terms of you know how our country how this country has been going about setting setting standards now let's talk about the sec's proposed role around registered investment advisors that want to store digital assets or to use a company to do that this proposed role would require those rias to use so-called qualified custodians and there's only one crypto company I think that fits that bill at this moment so um the way coindesk put it was that the bill would largely push Ras to use non-crypto companies and I was wondering you know what your thoughts were about this proposed role well I'm not sure which one company you're referring to because coinbase certainly um has been a qualified custodian we are qualified custodian the day before the proposal was made we were qualified to sitting on that day and we're going to be qualified cassette and going forward and so um in some ways okay so maybe I saw ROM alawalia tweeted that only Anchorage fit the bill but maybe I misinterpreted his tweet but anyway he may have been referring to uh the there being only one Company Anchorage that is OCC or federally registered but the rules specifically recognized that state chartered trust companies like coinbases can in fact qualify as a as a as a custodian which we think is actually an important Vindication and I again what credit where credit is due applaud the uh the SEC for for that recognition but the fact of the matter is that the rias are going to be subject to new standards um in how they interact with QC with qualified custodians and at least as we are reading the you know the proposal um it seems pretty clear that there is an extension or expansion by the SEC of its jurisdiction over not just Securities assets but non-securities assets as well and this raises I think some important questions about you know again the rule of law whether or not the jurisdiction is properly constrained whether the agency is recognizing that it doesn't just have free reign to sweep in whole chunks of the the crypto or digital economy because it can so even though you know we thought that parts of the proposal were productive and positive this is a big deal for crypto and it's something we're all going to pay very careful attention to yeah so to put a gloss on that Dodd-Frank with which chair gun stores I think intimately familiar because he was chair of the cftc when Dodd-Frank was enacted did give the SEC power to regulate investment advisors and the custody of their client assets over all custody of any assets so this loan does you know this new proposed rule alone is not what expands the sec's jurisdiction over being able to regulate investment advisors Dodd-Frank definitely did that and we can say that there has the QC and the Ria rule hasn't been examined I think I could be wrong but at least for 10 years something like that and there's been a lot of talk about changing these types of custodial rules especially because there are a lot of new types of assets and not just something like crypto but there are lots of different type of types of assets that registered investment advisors hold or invest in now so some of those things we have to say are positive right that's consumer protection that's within uh the sec's jurisdiction I do think this is not retail users right the investors in most registered investment advisors are large sophisticated investors right it's what we call LPS so the idea of investor protection here does relate to much more sophisticated impact investors I love coinbases very positive spin on qualified custodians and because they are a Trust Company under nydfs that is a very reasonable interpretation I think there has been another interpretation and I think this is where ROMs tweet comes from about Anchorage which is well only if you're a federally Chartered Bank can you be a qualified custodian now based on the way the rule has been written and uh I think there has been speeches and commentary by a number of the Commissioners saying and including by the chairs saying the State Banks should not be allowed to be qcs because they're not meeting the same standards as the OCC chartered Banks and the like and by the way Banks can do it and we're totally happy for them to be qualified custodians and then chair Gensler uh referred to the fact of this joint statement between the fed the FDIC and the OCC which said nationally chartered Banks should not be allowed or should be very circumspect about engaging in any type of their business with crypto assets so while it does in theory look like there's a path forward under this rule that you could still have qualified custodians who hold crypto assets under the Prudential Regulators who they have said oh well Banks shouldn't really be touching crypto so it's sort of this backdoor way to maybe cut off the ability for registered investment advisors to have qualified custodians who hold crypto I hope coinbases right because I think that would be a way that you'd really cut off funding to the entire industry and I I think you know we have to really think about whether that was intentional or not there's another important actor in all this of course which goes beyond just the federal regulators and the rias and the coinbases of the world it's the states themselves and I think one of the interesting things to really focus on as this Rule and again it's a proposed rule at this point we are at the very beginning of a very long and I suspect difficult road ahead I think we should all pay a lot of attention to what New York and other states are going to have to say about the quality of their supervision right because I think Rebecca is exactly right there was either an explicit or at least an implicit I think editorial in The sec's Proposal about how effective or frankly how competent states were to to protect these assets or make sure that these assets were properly uh protected in general that usually doesn't go unresponded to when it comes to um one one jurisdiction and its Authority versus another so very eager to see that debate take shape as well I do think on the expansion of jurisdiction the one place that is interesting to think about is that the SEC actually doesn't regulate qualified custodians directly they regulate registered investment advisors so and all assets that they hold but this almost seems like a way to regulate qualified custodians because they lay out a certain set of requirements that any qualified custodian has to meet for the registered investment advisor to use that qualified custodian so this is that's really the expansion of jurisdiction that comes into play it also regulates what contracts should look like between registered investment advisors and qualified custodians so um it's now putting new requirements on contractual arrangements for qualified custodians which they didn't have before so that is an expansion or a way of you know sort of back door regulating qualified custodians that didn't exist before so one thing that Rebecca alluded to earlier was that some of these different actions kind of cut crypto off from the banking system or at least kind of shrink the Avenues you know in which they're connected and there have been a couple of Articles making this exact point uh one in Bloomberg and one in the Wall Street Journal about how Banks basically are getting the notice that you know they need to tighten up on their activities with crypto companies and I was wondering you know I'm sure you've heard there's some people who equate what's going on here to operation choke point which happened earlier in the Obama Administration and was an effort to basically kind of shrivel up certain industries that it did not approve of so do you think that that's what's going on here well I think that at some point these actions line up in a way that you have to wonder is it all just a coincidence and I think um beyond that you have to ask why are why are we confronting restrictions withdrawals debanking of legal recognized highly regulated companies in this country there are all sorts of fair questions to ask about the operations of different firms in crypto and I would point out outside of crypto but the notion that somehow the way the right way to constrain activities that give rise to concerns is to cut off their oxygen or slowly deplete them of oxygen which of course in the financial world there's no more important source of source of oxygen than banking services I think that's something that is as much as anything explaining the strong reaction we're seeing not just inside of the crypto Community but in the broader Financial Services Community as well that's a dangerous precedent and it may be that crypto is is currently the object of that a particular approach but if the government gets away with that with crypto what's to say and what's to stop them from getting away with it as tell a whole host of other legal safe regulated Industries in this country that happen to be out of favor with policy makers you know I think that I'll I'll take a little bit of a soapbox on this and say the US has been a leader in Innovation for decades right there have been a me and I'm talking way way back when we're thinking about electricity or trains or things like that and there was always resistance to those new Innovations too and there were always grifters and frauds all those things happened along the way uh honestly there's been a lot of talk in the EU that Mika came to pass the way it did because they that a lot of the European member states felt like they were left behind for web 2 if you really look where the large Tech Giants are today I think the biggest one like Spotify is maybe the biggest when you're looking at the EU and there are no other real large Tech Giants out there in the EU now and so what I'll say from a just a broader perspective that and I know I'm sort of been saying this throughout this episode but the best thing we can do is get some legislation into place so as Paul was saying we don't have to speculate about what's everyone trying to do what's gonna happen next and I I don't want crypto to all go overseas a lot of it has Electric Capital has put out a great report and I know you did an episode about this Laura but you know it showed that there has been continued Innovation and developer activity that's being pushed offshore from the United States I don't want to see that happen um I want the US to keep its place as a great place for Innovation and a place where people can come and really meet out their dreams and things like that um so I'm hoping that that's not the intention that there is a very sort of understandable fear post FTX especially given exams proximity in DC to people uh and some you know questions that have legitimate questions that have been raised thereafter so you know I I am hopeful that there is a big turnaround here and that the industry stays vibrant enough and stays strong enough throughout what is going on now um which is a literally a day today because we saw another sec enforcement order come out today against a you know a basketball player who had done some promotion of crypto assets so it's really a day-to-day thing right now that's going on here but I do hope the industry can stay strong enough um to meet this out and to be able to continue to you know grow in the United States as well yeah hilariously it was the same ethereum Max token that they had gone after Kim Kardashian for um you know one thing in the kind of run-up to this episode when we were just sort of emailing about what we were going to discuss Paul you said something about how you were concerned with the National Security implications of sending crypto Innovation offshore and I didn't know what that meant and maybe Rebecca started to allude to that but yeah what does that mean National Security I'm not sure how they related well I'll share what I what I mean by that and I suspect in fact I think I know Rebecca has views on this as well based on our comment I I would say that um look the fact of the matter is that in the last 25 or 30 years the United States has had an unfortunate history of pushing Innovation that was originally uh developed here in the United States or substantially enhanced human as it's to other countries and jurisdictions and seeing those Industries not only survive but Thrive overseas never to return what's a good example of that think about semiconductors think about what what this country contributed to developing the semiconductors think about how much of that industry moved overseas and also think about the fact that in recent months and in the past year we've spent billions of dollars taxpayer dollars to try to lure and incent the return of semiconductors to United States for national security reasons I'd hate to see us make that same mistake with respect to crypto I'd hate to see innovations that were either originally or largely developed here in the United States pushed offshore and for the country in 30 years to be spending even more money to try to lure that industry back after it's had a tremendous record of success in other markets that's one way in which I think about the National Security implications of what we're seeing coming from the SEC and elsewhere today the other way I think about this too is that and I think we all need to think about it in these terms if I can suggest that the The Innovation the talent Rebecca alluded to the fact that we're seeing so much developer and engineer activity taking place outside the United States that Talent is part of our national infrastructure in an important way and so to the extent we want to continue to attract and develop that Talent here in the US not just for purposes of building great products and crypto and web 3 but more generally we need to create at the very least of hospitable climate to say nothing of a welcoming climate for these types of projects and networks and right now I don't think we're doing that and I think if we continue down this road we're going to see ourselves repeating the same mistakes as we've repeated over and over again over the last three decades I mean I think there is a there are legitimate uh National Security concerns most of which are there are other jurisdictions that are building out so first of all the U.S has been systematically debanking itself in other uh developing countries right now so where we might have had a banking presence or somehow push the US dollar we've been taking ourselves out of developing countries the country that comes in to take our place is China and in most of these countries and one thing we know um although we may not know you know details about where they are but they have been developing a cbdc and they are far ahead on it um certainly than when we are now there are certainly lots of legitimate concerns about cbdc's especially on the Privacy side and so it is understandable that we are not there so I am in no way saying that we need to be building out our cbdc program right now and there are there's a lot of work going in both at the FED level and with a number of um you know members of Congress who are seriously examining cbdc's but I think the National Security concerns really come with if we are pushing this offshore and if we are debanking from other places then the question is who steps into either our shoes or who steps into a place of power that we may have been in before and yes the US dollar does have sort of a worldwide hegemony is too strong of a word but it is a very strong currency International nationally and I don't think we want to lose that and crypto is so Global it is borderless and I think if we think that some ban or otherwise you know true squeeze on it in the United States is going to long-term protect consumers I think we do have to take into account concerns that Paul and others have raised about what that will mean for the Primacy of other um countries that we may not be as that may not be as favorable and maybe National Security threats to the U.S so I know it's a little bit Grim from the National Security side but I think that's a real issue that we need to be grappling with and both policy makers and Regulators need to be thinking about that as well as they're making you know policy for crypto in the U.S yeah the one thing I would have to say about that is that I do think that in terms of the more like permissionless Innovation um obviously those people aren't going to go to China um and I would imagine if people had a choice they wouldn't chew I mean maybe some of them might be forced for economic reasons to choose like a cbdc coming out of China or whatever but I think most people would choose something where you know they're not going to have to um you know deal with all the things that you have to deal with when you're dealing with the Chinese government those are two separate issues where software developers go I agree it's not China right where you're going to go you could go to the uh you can go to the EU you can go to the UK there are lots of great crypto companies in both places including and especially in the UK that's more like develop permissionless development I'm saying what are what are what do we need to be thinking about in terms of really squeezing on crypto in the US from a national security perspective and it is that uh if we don't take this this technology seriously from an innovation perspective it may compromise us from a national a security perspective but I agree those two issues are very separate and no I do not think software developers are running in China um and one other thing that I wanted to follow up on uh you know is something I I think it was maybe Rebecca who made this point earlier just about how the SEC has kind of already changed its stance between the different administrations obviously under Jay Clayton we had uh Bill Hinman who is the director of Finance make a speech saying that ether at that moment was sufficiently decentralized and then now chair again sir keeps hinting that he believes ethers a security so I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the differences between the two secs and then where you think things could go if you know somebody else comes in to to head up the SEC because you know I I keep reading these news stories that chair Gensler maybe is angling for a different job so what's your take on how all that might affect crypto it depends it depends who's in there right um I I think that and it depends on you know who the next Administration is in theory chair Gensler has I think he's served for two years and he would have have three years left but if the administration changes two years in most chairs don't stay under a president who didn't appoint them and I would suspect chair Gensler would leave if the you know the president changes and then the question is who you know who would a republican appoint to come in um but if you're against their leaves and you know President Biden is still in office or a Democrat is still in office I think we have really no idea what could happen next you could have someone even more aggressive as we you know saw from chair Clayton to chair Gensler so and anytime there's there's there's there's change in leadership of course there are changes and priorities that's understandable that's reasonable um I think markets generally adapt to that but when it comes to crypto there are so many basic core issues that are being managed seemingly at the whim of a single person or a particular group of leadership and you know to Rebecca's Point that's why we have legislation in so many areas of the law to settle these questions so that there isn't such a dependence on one particular leader or Administration or another on fundamental basic topics like what what is an agency's jurisdiction what is the appropriate Market structure for a huge and growing asset class we can manage change just fine but but it points once again to the need for legislation or at the very least rule making um that that is informed and is that is sustainable and is durable so that we're not having to reverse course and change investment decision priorities simply because somebody's elected to move on in their career all right well last note that I want to end on is just Esther purse keeps making these descents and they're quite pointed and I wanted to just quote from one of her mic drop moments here this was her descent to the Kraken settlement she wrote a paternalistic and lazy regulator settles on a solution like the one in the settlement do not initiate a public process to develop a workable registration process that provides valuable information to investors just shut it down and so clearly you know the SEC isn't fully aligned internally on all these issues um you know obviously the the chair you know has the final say here but I imagine we're going to keep seeing you know a lot of discussion and perhaps some zigzagging uh from The Regulators and the government when it comes to how crypto is going to be regulated um but this has been such a great discussion where can people learn more about each of you and your work I'm on Twitter I'm Rebecca reddig1 uh and uh you can hear some of my thoughts and ideas there and I'm at I am Paul Grewal on Twitter and and if you go there I I hope you'll be inspired to join this debate these issues we've been talking about Laura are not just things that the coinbase is in polygon Labs of the world should care about anyone who cares about consumer protection Innovation the future of web 3 needs to be paying attention it needs to be getting involved all right well it has been a pleasure having you both on Unchained thanks so much
