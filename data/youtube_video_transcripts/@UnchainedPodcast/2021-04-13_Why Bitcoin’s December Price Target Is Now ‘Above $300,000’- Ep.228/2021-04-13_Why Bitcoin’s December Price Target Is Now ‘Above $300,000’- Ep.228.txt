i-n-d-e-x-e-d dot finance hi everyone welcome to our panel it starts with the charts my name is laura shin and i host the podcast and video series unchained i've covered crypto for nearly six years and was previously a senior editor at forbes where i was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full time our two guests today are peter l brandt futures and fx trader and author and publisher of the factor report and willie wu on chain bitcoin analyst and writer of the bitcoin forecast a market intelligence newsletter welcome peter and willie hey it's good to be with you laura good to see you again willie likewise looking forward to this peter let's start with you to get the big picture on what is happening with bitcoin you recently tweeted bitcoin is undergoing its third parabolic advance in the past decade and i think you have been recently saying it's even undergoing a fourth now and you've said to see that number of parabolic advances is extremely rare and even historic so can you explain why it is so historic oh sure i i'd like to laura um your production folks have a chart that shows the parabolic advances in bitcoin an accelerating market that is accelerating the acceleration and you know i've traded for 46 years i've studied charts over really centuries i'm kind of a chart nerd i love charts and somebody would have told me that there would be a market during my lifetime that would not only experience a parabolic advance but experience four parabolic advances not just on an arithmetic scale but on a log scale i i would have bet my life against that this is just unbelievable i i you people get caught up in the daily motion and the daily moment moment of bitcoin without realizing we're seeing a market advance unlike anything we've ever really seen before to have four parabolic advances on a log scale in the course of a 10-year period is just unheard of i i would challenge anybody to find a price chart of any asset or any commodity item that has gone through this and so we're really really witnessing history this is history in the making this is something that history books will be written on as a trader it's just unbelievable that i can participate in a market that is going through a situation like this this is uh this is just spectacular spectacular ride and everybody that's involved in bitcoin can know that they're really taking part in history uh you know willie will better describe really the under opinions of history and what it really means in terms of real world finance monetary system and so forth that's not my specialty i'm a chartist i'm a trader i'm a chartist but as a chartist this is just something so special i really can't even express it and just briefly before we turn to willie can you also define a parabolic advance for the members of our audience who aren't familiar with these technical terms sure i mean we all know what an uptrend is in a parabolic advanced lore is an advance that accelerates over a period of time not only does it go up steadily but it goes up in an accelerating manner and we can find all kinds of stock charts that have had one or two maybe two parabolic advances on an arithmetic chart but to have a parabolic advance on a scale on a log chart is just spectacular and so willie how would you put bitcoin into a historical context as an asset yeah it's an interesting one because um i see bitcoin more as a new technology rollout and we never see new technology being traded on a live market before bitcoin's the first time we've had that you know the internet exploded onto the scene and we had a whole lot of new technologies but you'll notice that those startups that were um forging those technologies they were not listed on a stock exchange till very much later into their maturity phase so here in bitcoin we've got from x number of months into it from 2009 we had a live price of bitcoin and you just can see the crazy volatility in that market and that that is normal for a um burgeoning new technology anyone who's been in a c-level start-up will know how schizophrenic the ups and downs of that ride is the next you know one day you're on top of the world and you're going to conquer the world and the next day all doom is here and you're not going to survive the next month and um we've had a number of these duties in bitcoin even through the first 10 years many years into it so um what we're seeing here in my eyes is this new technology finding price discovery in a phase that we've never seen before and peter just to draw out one more comparison between crypto and traditional markets much has been made of how crypto trades differently because it trades 24 7 365 across global markets and also because of how the movements are often affected by memes and i wondered how you would compare the way bitcoin trades to the way different types of traditional assets trade well i i guess how to break that down in two ways laura one way is just from an historical perspective the magnitude of the advance the nature of the advance in bitcoin is is really can't be compared it is in the class by itself of course we have some other crypto coins that have had a similar uh move but i i think in my mind uh bitcoin's the legacy it is crypto uh crypto is bitcoin bitcoin is crypto and obviously we do have some of the other coins and all coins and so forth and so we can't compare it but in some sense we can uh you know it's interesting you work for forbes uh the editor of forbes in the 1920s there was a guy by the name of richard w schaubacher schaebacher in 1934 published a book which lays out the classical charting principles that chartis used today he was it was the author he was the author of classical charting and so the types of chart construction that he wrote about 1934 we see on a regular basis in bitcoin you know of rectangles head and shoulders trend lines all of those things not only apply to bitcoin but really characterize bitcoin from a cl as a classical chartist i think bitcoin is the purest market there is and so you know it complies with what i know to be history in terms of classical charting but at the same time from a more broader picture from an historic picture it's it's one unto itself all right so now let's turn to discussing this current cycle which i think in some ways has dep surprised some bitcoiners even at the same time that they knew all along it would happen and willie in one of your recent newsletters you wrote quote bitcoin is undergoing the largest supply shock in its history the steepest price rise seen so far in 21 has been supported by strong fundamentals and then you wrote my macro top target has now increased to 300k and previously was 250k can you elaborate on what you meant there uh going back to the supply shock um we've just never seen in the history of bitcoin so much of the coins being scooped up and bought and locked away by very strong holders of the coin um and we can see this from tracking the flows of coins out of the exchanges where typically people um you know speculate or buy and sell their coins and they have a set inventory some of which is um allocated for speculation and we've just seen an unprecedented amount of depletion of that inventory if you look back in the 2017 bull market we we saw like a five month depletion of inventory and that was enough to propel um the bull market of 2017 right up to the 20 000 from what initially was about um one to one and a half thousand dollars when the inventory depletion uh ended and now we're kind of in this zone of the 11 12 months of inventory depletion we've not seen this before and you can look on chain and look at the holders and you can see the wallets that the holders the behavior of the wallets by the holders and there's a category where we turn a liquid these guys are just accumulating buying and accumulating without any history of selling and these guys are just hoovering up the coins so there's a real supply shock there's there's less and less coins each week that goes by that's available to be bought and so obviously there's a mismatch between demand and supply and that has launched the price vertical and for some technical traders that do trade indicators on the the price fluctuations though or screaming over overbought overbought overheated whilst if you look into the ledger and see the the demand and supply of the coins by fundamental investors you can see that it's fully supported and so i run a um a very simple model it's called me it's a mean reversion model which is in simple terms as a moving average on the market cap all-time moving average and you can use that to predict dops it has protected every top in bitcoin history and so currently that top target is launching upwards and at the start of this year january it was zoning into a area of um 200-300 000 by december and december of this year is typical to what we would expect for the end of a bull market if we get that not saying that will happen this time around but if we do top out in december that target now is lifted to above 300 000 because the trajectory of that upper band of that moving average well um that's really exciting and so earlier when you were talking about all these holders who are buying moving the bitcoin off exchanges into wallets that do not really have a history of selling who do you think those groups or people are it's very unusual because normally what you expect is as more retail comes in more moms and pops ordinary people off the streets they tend to buy their coins and hold them on their exchange wallet because it's just a very easy experience um so we've had this general trend of more and more coins being stored on exchanges like the coin bases of this world is a very easy to use experience um but in this particular cycle we're seeing huge amounts of coins move off exchanges and being locked away under their own custody and that's the signature of institutional players coming in and high net worth individuals they tend to store their coins under custody and in cold storage so those clues and just the sheer uh size of the purchases uh you can see the size of the withdrawals coming out from the exchanges um they just really point to institutions scooping up coins so it's it's very very unlikely it's anything else but the institutions and by that you mean like tesla microstrategy the the corporate treasurers that are buying bitcoin or are there any other institutions you would include in that bucket yeah institutions is kind of this is kind of a menagerie really because in simple terms it's just um coins held by a custodian for a whole lot of people whether that's um you know tesla and their shareholders or fund managers so um it's it's looking like we've got hedge funds coming in um we've got the the corporate treasury um by you know led by michael saylor and microstrategy and now you know the latest as being tesla uh but you know we've we've also seen announcements that it's pension funds as well um grayscale cedar they had a lot of strong buying from there i've just seen that new zealand has announced that they're one of their um funds for pensions has had bought into bitcoin in october so yeah across the gamut there's all sorts of institutions buying right now it seems like the word is out that bitcoin is now a valid investment alternative to gold in these times and so then if we were to zoom out and kind of look at bitcoin in its trajectory of let's say like historical adoption you know like if we were to look back uh 50 years from now and and you know look at this moment in time then where would you both say bitcoin kind of like is currently in its historical adoption period well i have a question laura i'd like to ask willie because his comments really i found really super interesting because i don't really dig into what happens to coins as they flow into the blockchain they get taken out of exchanges he that's his expertise not mine but what i have noticed looking at the exchanges in terms of the bid offer spread what happens on the bid what happens on the offer side is oftentimes when a market blows off and we hear some people say this is a big bubble we're blowing off a bitcoin's a bubble there are characteristics of a bubble one of them is that markets go up fast with bids there's aggressive bids that take place in the late stages of a bull market that kind of blow it off and all those bids come in and chase the markets fomo what we know is retail fomo takes place within the whole market this market is very different what i've noticed is is the market's not necessarily going up on aggressive bids what's happening is an offer comes in and just immediately gets taken and so this nature of the bull market is such that what i see is whenever something is offered it's just taken immediately by somebody who's willing to take the offer so rather than going up on bids it's going up on ex on higher offer prices higher and higher offer prices that may sound like it's there's really no difference to people who aren't familiar with how markets behave but for me as a as a technical trader that's really significant because it shows me that there are big names there are big deep top pockets that are saying we're not going to chase the market but whenever something gets offered we're willing to take it and that kind of resonates very well with what willie described yeah so you're saying that whenever there's a um a big offer on hand large enough for a very large purchase to come in they'll take it because there's not a lot of offers that size that's on the table and they're just waiting for whenever there's an offer they'll take it yeah that that's interesting you know i have another question for that i'd love to ask willie and you know willie refers to bitcoin as a technology which it is but the interesting thing for me is in those cases where i have seen an asset or a market or a commodity have the kind of parabolic advances that we're seeing what they have been primarily is currency markets they've represented the destruction of a currency a money a monetary system they have been the currency against the dollar so in other words how many of these currencies can one dollar buy we saw it in the german mark uh in the 1920s your your production guys may have a quick chart of that it's not a very good chart but it does show it uh we've seen it in third world currencies in africa and third world this is marks for us dollar in the 1920s uh and and what it shows is we went from kind of late 19 teens of five six marks per dollar and then we go into really the destruction of the mark at that point which was obviously connected with with a previous political structure but we saw the mark become worthless and we've seen that with third world currencies uh african countries latin american countries and so when we look at bitcoin beyond just being a technology but being a form of money the only other charts that i can see when i look back in history that had us have a similar parabolic move have really been currency charts that have been the destruction of that currency i'm just curious as to how willie relates to bitcoin uh also as a form of money as a monetary system because monetary systems are the only places where i've seen charts that have a similar parabolic move well that's it's absolutely fascinating fedex because like i look at this chart and i go yeah that's exactly right i'll flip those currencies and i'll go us dollars per bitcoin and that's essentially what we're tracking um this destruction of fiat currency as bitcoin starts to suck in that monetary base um i think what we're witnessing here is the birth of a new monetary base which is no longer based on fear it's based on consensus agreement that this has value and this thing is a value that can be stored online digitally moved across borders within seconds and so it's an internet internet age technology it's a new internet age monetary standard and it's one that is going to keep up with the world's needs into this digital age if you think about what happened with the industrial age um we moved from essentially commodity money um in you know gold to over copper and we moved into trading currency like paper backed by this this um this commodity and that was really for um uh to keep track of the industrial age economy um obviously it's too slow to ship bars of gold around the world um so now we're in a digital age it's very very similar in there like fiat is just so slow and broken um if anyone that thinks um fiat works well they're only using it in a local stance with within their country once you start to do cross-border payments it's very slow it's very painful and so um it we're in this this phase i think that um is that we're moving and crossing deeply into a digital age and um to go back to the first point that laura posed you know where we where are we now um looking if we were pan as the future and look back we're currently just barely above two percent of the world having exposure to bitcoin um even fewer that are actually using it to to transmit funds most people are holding it to get exposure but it's growing you know this this thing has been growing for 11 years non-stop at doubling every uh 12 months so that puts us at 4 then 8 and so forth and we're currently on track for 1 billion people having exposure to bitcoin as an asset class in the next four years so by 2025 one eighth of the world population will have exposure to this monetary base so it's happening very very quickly um and in terms of internet era like where we are right now it's equivalent of 1994 for the rollout of the internet and i believe from memory someone might be able to pull it up it's where in the next four years we're going to teleport into 2005 for the for the internet rollout equivalent which you know if you think about that like 94 was very slow dial up internet very few people used it but it was growing quickly and then 2005 we had everybody on facebook the iphone was just around the corner and the internet was available to everybody on the planet if they they needed it um so uh yeah the next four years is going to bring a lot of changes to the financial system that's for sure and why do you think that timeline is being sped up for crypto is it because we already have the internet built now is that why you know you were saying the sleep of 10 years in the internet um the era is going to be accomplished in five years in crypto yeah new technology is built on older technologies and it's um the propagation of information goes faster and faster so you know if bitcoin could be built on sailing ships and we can transmit transactions on a piece of paper which you can actually do um obviously it would take uh months for that piece of paper to transmit to another continent but now we can transmit that in milliseconds across the internet and so um so that's speeding things up and you'll see if you plot the the um progress and adoption of um new technology we call this s curves because that's max how how much penetrate the rate of penetration they are slow at start at the start they go exponential and then they kind of take profit as you reach saturation those s curves are long and flat and slow for you know the earlier technologies like radio um then tv and then we had you know um i guess what do we have mobile phones and internet and so each curve became faster and faster and so um it's it's a natural it's natural trend that um this technology um bitcoin expands faster yeah it's it's probably the biggest thing that's happened to um money since the invention of money i would say um it's it's not just a one in a hundred year thing it's a one in humanity event yeah i i would agree i've also heard you make comparisons to um the way bitcoin trades or the way people invest in bitcoin to shares of internet startups can you talk a little bit about how those are similar and or different i i think i've kind of covered it earlier in that you know the the trajectory is very very upward like a seed investor um you know i put it this way when bitcoin um was around even say four years ago and the times before that the first six to seven years everyone said this thing is not real it's a bubble it's gonna pop and um no one gets 10 000 x return than such compressed amount of years like that's that's a tulip bubble but anyone in technology that has invested in seed level startups with evaluation of maybe typically a seed level startup has varied at six million dollars at the at the start and if they go ipo and then become the next you know uber amazon or or so forth you are now talking in the tens to 100 billion dollars of valuation so and that journey takes um around six to ten years and so right there in new technology investors at the seed level are very comfortable with the idea of getting 10 000 x on a winning technology and um that's essentially what we're seeing with bitcoin um those types of gains are very very routine in new technology rollouts the only difference right now is that bitcoin just so happened to have a publicly tradeable price that everybody could see and um retail anybody in the world had access to buy that asset right at the get-go and interestingly the institutions the smartest money in the room um they weren't allowed to because regulatory bars um prevented them from actually directly buying the asset so it's a kind of flipped the whole thing on its ends where bitcoin was open to um everybody else except the big money so i find that very interesting you know the interesting thing for me well is when i first got involved and you're involved in bitcoin long before i was uh my involvement began in early 2016 when uh the founder of real vision ro paul sent me a chart of bitcoin you know i get an email from a rob has a chart of bitcoin it's like february march of 2016 and raul says you're a charter speaker what do you make of this thing and i looked at it and i heard about bitcoin kind of in the periphery i understood it existed i didn't know much about it just thought it was just a currency currency money that would become another beanie baby or pet rock and i look at this card that he sends i go wow this is crazy and that's when he introduced me to his exchange i open an account i get involved in bitcoin it's like march april 2016. initially for me bitcoin was a chart then bitcoin became just a trade you know as a trader in the us i've always measured the wealth based on u.s dollars right i want to collect u.s dollars i want to look and know that my us dollar worth goes up in a steady rate and maybe has some jumps along the way and so bitcoin was just a trade but i think really within the last year my mindset has really changed is that bitcoin is where i would have wanted all my wealth at some point in time i really look at it very different because if my goal as a trader has been to accumulate more us dollars what that now tells me is i had a wrong i had a wrong goal because my goal was to accumulate the weakest asset in the world the most depreciating asset in the world and that's u.s dollars and so i my mindset really changed within the last year in terms of moving from bitcoin as a trade to bitcoin as as a measure of wealth want to get exposure to the top dfi and crypto projects but don't know where to start

at least to my mind what you're saying is that bitcoin maybe is maturing a little bit uh you tweeted recently about what you were calling an orderly bull trend saying that the 2015 to 2017 bull cycle saw eight corrections exceeding 30 percent two of them exceeding 40 percent and then you wrote with the exception of the march 2020 smash the december 2018 to present bull trend has been extraordinarily orderly so far so what would you say is the significance of that well i i think willie pointed that out is we have major institutions major trading operations investing operations who are just willing to take offers off the table and as a result of course you know no market goes straight up day after day week after week month after month so we have volatility we've had close to a thirty percent or right around a thirty percent correction at one point another correction of 26 that's not the end of the world markets have corrections that's what markets do they go up they go down the the important point is what's where are they going on on a more sustainable basis you know to me i've i'm starting to look at bitcoin as we all talk about the evil central bench everyone's talking about the central banks destroying the monetary system and i'm starting to look at bitcoin as a as a pow asset and that could mean power of the you know it could mean the money of the people the people's money and and so bitcoin is really the currency of the world of the world population is you know it it's a pow but we're prisoners of war to the central banks and all of a sudden uh bitcoin is our own answer to fiat currencies and i think that's what's reflected in the fact that there's so much interest to actually own that currency i love that actually because there's there's actually a bitcoin specific term pow which stands for something very particular to big point so at first i was like wait what is he talking about but we don't have to get into that has to do with the mining but anyway willie what were you gonna say i was just saying that yeah it's like really going back to the first chart of german marks against us dollars we've been trading to stack more german max in a time of hype inflation um versus stacking more bitcoin i think that um if you be anyone who's been in the industry long enough starts to have that sort of mindset shift and and suddenly you realize wow this is real this is the new monetary standard that's the measuring stick in which we start to measure everything and i mean certainly when i i get us dollars or any kind of fear i feel like this thing's a hot potato it's gonna it's not gonna be worth much so we had like 25 30 percent more coin more us dollars being printed in the last year alone um so i think most people are really in their mode of really um packing it somewhere whether it's real estate stocks or um or bitcoin um and to that point there's about 500 trillion dollars of assets in the world that um people are parking money into as a store of value and so that is the um that is this scale of capital that um bitcoin is going to take bites out of you know we we like to call um bitcoin this digital gold like it's this really nice to understand thing that traditional asset managers traditional investors can turn grasp but really gold only 10 trillion dollars and only four trillion dollars is um useful financial means we're like bitcoin's already a quarter of the way there and it's not going to stop you've got like stock markets that are near 100 trillion dollars you've got real estate which is like 220 250 trillion dollars most people that hold these assets aren't looking for a house or two or five to to live in that they're holding it as a store of value so once you get a glimpse of something as easy to access like bitcoin without the trouble of holding assets like real estate um it's going to take a big chunk out of that so um there's no way bitcoin is going to stop at the market cap of gold which is 10 trillion it's going to go a lot higher which means that we're going to be going into the millions of dollars per coin is which is kind of hard to believe right now but if you look at the share fundamentals and stretch it off over the long term that's how cheap bitcoin is today and that's why the institutions are buying it and they're buying it because they think it's going to be as good as gold but it's going to go a lot higher i have a question on that willie you know when we when i look back at at bitcoin as a student of price you know we've seen big run-ups followed by 80 corrections we've seen that in the previous three parabolic advances that were violated we saw bitcoin set back between 89 and i guess my own sense is that we've seen the last 80 percent correction and i'm just curious let's say we go to your 300 400 000 mark by the end of this year what is a big correction in the future as we look forward and might assume that bitcoin will take a rightful place as as a global reserve currency so to speak or a global reserve asset so to speak what kind of volatility do we see five years from now 10 years from now it's a it's a really good question um i'm not sure and the first step of it is once we top out i'm not sure how far it will fall back this time under the current situation um we typically see you know an 80 pullback um 300 000 plus 80 pullback kind of brings us down into the um the 1 trillion range and i can see right now the price discovery of bitcoin is very very strong in this zone around 1 trillion you can look at that in terms of the price in which coins last moved on the network and it's really clustering strong at this zone of one trillion dollars and you'll look at all the past bull markets you can see as you roll back the clock you get this very strong cluster at the base of the bull run which is what we're forming now and then we go really high and then it's almost like when we top out we come back to revisit that that very strong cluster bounce off that as is a rejection of that low before we move into the next um bull market if that pattern plays out then yeah maybe we go to 300 we come back down to the zone here um but i'm not sure um like i kind of visit the staff one month at a time quarter by quarter sometimes just on what i'm seeing through demand and supply on the ledger there is a general trend downwards and it is a crazy predictable trend downwards and volatility i think actually you know like we're we're due to start to um drop down into the the lower volatility range that well i don't have the charts right off of hands but i think it will surprise a lot of people how low the volatility can drop and beyond a certain part of a size of um capital base you know volatility drops to zero because it becomes the new monetary base if it does become this unit of account obviously these different variations on that theme it could be part of a basket of assets that becomes the new monetary base but ultimately the volatility will drop very very low because it is the new monetary standard part of it peter i wanted to ask you about something that you wrote on twitter where you were criticizing the people who have laser eyes on their twitter profiles and you call that the single most bearish factor for bitcoin why is that well and i'm not a barracks in terms of all of a sudden we go into a bear market what i'm talking about is there are certain things that as somebody who is an owner of bitcoin i know people use the word hotline i i just can't go there mid 70s i'm not sure i can adopt the the vernacular of the the new technology or the monetary system so i i still get referred to as holding i have the l before the d instead of after the d but yeah i mean over enthusiasm on any market is always kind of uh warning not to turn from a pull to a bear or to liquidate long holdings or it'll liquidate an established position but it indicates people are it's gotten a little frothy and you know all of a sudden when i saw people who i respected on twitter as as seasoned reasonable investors all of a sudden with a new picture with laser eyes i kind of go well let's stack back a moment here i actually even i even uh direct tweeted a good friend of mine who's uh really a fine investor and has been very very constructive for bitcoin for a long period of time and just said hey you know redo your picture will you please it's scary because you know more people put the laser eyes you know that at least the market's going to get choppy for a while i'm going to stop going straight up so i think you know we need to be alert for that type of thing is when people start pounding their chest in public i own bitcoin i own bitcoin look at me i have laser eyes yeah you know that's always going to be a sign that the marxist police gonna take a rest all right yeah i was just so curious because obviously that is something all the bitcoiners are doing and um i thought it was kind of fun that you took a contrarian stance to that um so to wrap up i wanted to ask you for the aspiring chartists in the audience what particular metrics or trading patterns it is that you think are worth paying attention to and why well i mean let me start off by saying i i think bitcoin charts extremely well but it charts extremely well for somebody that wants to look at the forest and not the trades is you know somebody who's looking at one minute charts five minute charge ten minute charge i i've noticed those are not really reliable charts you have to look at bitcoin in terms of chart construction at least on daily charts if not on weekly charts you know you can't look at it every day uh every minute you you've got to really step back and look at it a bigger picture and that's an advice i would give somebody don't get so involved that you're buying and selling bitcoin 10 times a day look at bitcoin from an historical perspective this is not something to be playing around with it's something to be owned and so i think there's danger of people uh getting too short term in bitcoin because at some point in time they're going to get shaken out of their position and that's when bitcoin really has a period of strength and so i think holding l before the d is the thing to do but for those who really are interested in charting i bring them back to the 1934 book by uh the the senior editor of forbes magazine richard w schaubacher who wrote the book technical analysis and stock market of profits excellent book but it's a great primer on the type of chart construction i've seen in bitcoin which is uh triangles uh shakeouts trend lines head and shoulders and that sort of thing by the way i do have a a chart uh there that you have on the current chart outlook for bitcoin i just want to point that out before uh we end here but i you know on that chart what i'm really seeing is i think that currently bitcoin in this current bitcoin bull market from a charting standpoint were were the 2015 to 2017 bull market was in the april may period of 2017 it's kind of where we're at and that shows that i think we're at that midpoint pause where in 2017 bitcoin swirled around for a month or two before we saw the final move up and you'll note that the midpoint in 2015 to 17 bull market was at about uh one half 60 percent of the total move if that's true you know really that points to the type of price level that willie's talking about that 200 000 plus is really where this market would take it if this chart interpretation is correct and willie what about you i kind of agree with where we are in that market um the yeah that's really interesting you trade bitcoin on any any time cycle is it's possible whatever floats your boat really you can trade the small time cycles and get a feel of how the markets work on a micro level um bitcoin is interesting because it's the only um asset in the world other than the other cryptos that has a blockchain but it is actually the only one that has a blockchain that has capital flows that is organic and so um you know i have a partnership with glass node and they provide about over 300 charts which those 300 metrics and they measure different parts of the network um and the whole industry um the capital flows going through it and so it's almost like an ecg um that's hooked up to this animal called bitcoin and um it's a kind of a um you know detective story of like whoa what's happening here let's check uh wales buying is it institutions is you know what whatever's happening this week or that week um you can come down to a diagnosis probable diagnosis and so um that's the new thing with bitcoin is that we have this open transparent ledger where we can visibly see what's actually happening and then you can kind of translate that and make predictions or explanations of what's actually happening with the the price chart which will then sort of express itself through technical trading patterns because traders are trading around these very specific like patterns so there's fundamental demand and supply on the blockchain and that'll express through these technical trading patterns and so um if you're trading bitcoin a full picture would be on chain analysis with the technical and mating the two together and um and then you it's that's that's a new thing within um cryptocurrencies really yeah and what i love about the way willie um you do your analysis is that you come up with really creative ways to describe it like whale spawning season when you saw the whales coming in and buying up a lot of coins or recently i noticed you have been tweeting about what you called the rick astley score which i'm sure people can figure that out um but yeah it's very fun following your analysis for for that reason um all right well this has been so fun thank you both so much for coming on to the crypto to the real vision crypto gathering thank you for having me
