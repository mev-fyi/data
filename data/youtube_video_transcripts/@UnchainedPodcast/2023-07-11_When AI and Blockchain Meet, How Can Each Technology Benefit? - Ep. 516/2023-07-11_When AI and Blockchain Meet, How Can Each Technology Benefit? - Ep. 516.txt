intersection of crypto and AI here to discuss are ilyapolosukin co-founder of near and Jason Warner founder at poolside welcome Jason and Elia thanks Laura great to be here thank you let's start with you Ilya you have an extensive history in AI um from before you got into crypto and in a way it's actually how you got into crypto so why don't you tell us you know your background in AI for sure yeah so before kind of doing a startup journey I was for about 10 years working on in machine learning and actually started my career there and my now claim to fame is I worked at Google research where I let a team work on natural language we've done kind of a lot of work across the Spectrum which has launched actually on google.com and a few other places on Google Play and as part of it I worked on tensorflow which is machine learning framework that Google built back in the day that kind of started a lot of the open source innovation in machine learning as well as I worked on attention is all you need the Transformer model that now power solves the chat GPT mean Journey stability and other kind of innovation language models and image generation I then left to actually do GitHub co-pilot style startup in 2017 trying to use Transformers kind of in 17 invent where we just built them as a startup called near Ai and because we did not have Microsoft money we ended up trying to be smarter and using a lot of kind of students around the world to do crowdsourcing to build a better data set for kind of a language to code kind of descriptions to kind of functions and we faced this challenge where we needed to pay people right this was students and students don't have bank accounts frequently they were from countries like China Russia Ukraine which have some monetary control again 2017 and like it's been a challenging to just like pay them for the work they were doing and so we started looking at blockchain as a way to facilitate Global Payments which what blockchain has been touted as a solution for and so kind of in 2018 as we were trying to explore this we realized there's no solution that's really trying to address kind of the Simplicity of usage as well as kind of would power it at the scale even that we we need it and so that's kind of what gave birth to near protocol because we realized we can solve that problem and then hopefully build a bunch of things on top and so that's you know that started Journey since 2018 on protocol on blockchain side but obviously you've been keeping track on the eye side and now involved this advisor and some other efforts on the eyesight yeah it's fascinating actually because if I feel like it's actually a very similar story to Ryan Armstrong's uh start in crypto which is that he had been doing payments at Airbnb and he realized oh wow you know making payments across 200 different countries around the world especially because you know sometimes like somebody's visiting like Bolivia but they're like from Iceland or whatever he realized it's so challenging and then that you know he learned about Bitcoin and you know now obviously he's the founder of coinbase so Jason what about you what's your background in AI um so I'm mostly growing up through what I'll call uh building platforms so before what I'm doing now which is co-founder of poolside I was a venture capitalist well ignore that little phase of my life for a little while here and before that I was a CTO at GitHub before that Heroku before that canonical people Ubuntu Linux so it's basically been devs and platforms but while at GitHub inside the office of this ETO while we were doing a bunch of incubation projects I had a small team that incubated go co-pilot as Ilya mentioned uh you know his first foray into this and they didn't have so funny so we had Microsoft money at that point and uh openai Microsoft Store you guys just can you define co-pilot because I don't know what that means sure you have co-pilot which is the AI coding assistant that's pretty popular and also the very first one that came out with the name copilot now that there's a copilot for everything out there and looking at sports scores and uh so you know that was in 20 I want to say 2020s when we started that work and 2021 when we launched on beta but we I've been trying to build that when I first got to GitHub I want to build two things I want to build what will become GitHub actions what will become GitHub co-pilot so it's kind of like the ending of a long a long journey while at GitHub and now I'm doing something called which we call poolside which is the way I describe it is simply open AI but exclusively focused on software and that'll go into a couple different directions here and then illy and I got connected when do we meet Ilya was it 2019 or 2020 as well yeah and uh you know we've been talking about the overlap between the two blockchains and AI as well in recent years as well so it's been fun with that but yeah AI primarily blockchain peripherally and when you say that poolside will be focused on software you mean it's an AI That's focused on coding as opposed to like giving you all the best tips for you know where to go get drinks in New York City on a Friday night or something yeah we're not going to tune it for any of those sorts of sorts of things and uh and definitely if you know me as a person and what I would actually care about too definitely don't care about where I'm getting drinks in New York on a Saturday night but I definitely will care about how how efficient the python are or Erlanger is running all right so this is not an AI podcast I am not an AI expert so I just need to have a set some ground rules for the discussion how would you guys or at least for this discussion how would you define AI and the reason that I'm asking is just like as kind of a consumer watching this it feels like all the buzz is around the AIS that are built on these large language models which is like very language-y but then in my head like blockchain stuff is very numbers based so then I was like hmm yeah how do those come together and I obviously have read a little bit about the different things but to me it didn't seem obvious at first some some of the stuff around like dials and whatever it that made sense but you know when you use the term AI in this show like what do you mean or what are the different things you could mean yeah I mean I think like just to set the stage right the AI I think people always call AI something that's like feels magical and then when they stopped feeling magical they like figured out the proper term for it so machine learning has been like a proper science that like for example I was doing in everything from credit score to when you type things on google.com when you type things in your on your phone to when you slide up and you see suggested apps everything using machine learning like literally every single action you do right now is using machine learning in some shape or form I'm pretty sure like right now with like this recording there's multiple sound processors that are running there's video processes that are running there's like package optimizers that are running which are using machine learning and so so AI really has been this thing that's like kind of the next thing that machine learning or whatever cannot do or we wanted to do and and so until we like get there and then it becomes a proper term and that's why this large language models now have a term large language models uh is now becoming Zone you know kind of a field subfield and so then people you know now dreaming about what's the next thing about AI will be but I think AI is just this term that like whatever whatever is like magical that computers can do that you know is getting them closer to how either humans or like superhuman kind of ability we call that AI really that and then everything else like everything we can really explain becomes its own term right there's the information Theory there's all kinds of things actually that became that came out of AI over past almost like uh I think 60 70 years of AI from existing that's the joke I use is that if it works right now it's uh machine learning and if you're raising money it's AI and so everyone in the world already experiences this as Ilia pointed out in various ways but the large language models are something that kind of emerged you know this is called in recent years and that is what we that that next wave of AI is kind of riding on and you know we've gone through versions of Cycles with AI already in like the 2010 ish era 2015-1617-ish era and then this one and so each one had distinct phases just like even in crypto they went through distinct phases and this one is you know largely going to be defined by the large language model breakthroughs that particularly openai had pushed with uh GPD three and four and we saw at scale all right yeah I was going to ask you something that I think you answered it because I have a friend who actually was a writer for Siri and so I was going to ask you if you thought of Sirius and AI however in I know Apple secretive so I feel like even weird just talk about the fact that this friend of mine worked there um but and I won't name the gender of the person um they started in 2011 so maybe like when I was gonna ask you do you think of Sirius and AI you're talking about like an earlier iteration where there was a human for many humans you know kind of feeding the AI but yeah would you consider that an AI I mean it's definitely a machine Learning System yeah and to be clear like there was in 90s there was expert systems which were also like language based expert systems that back then are called AI which now nobody would you know touch with it but but they were actually powering like medical systems for decision making and things like that and actually their failure led to the big AI winter where nobody was Finding AI because like everybody was too excited about it and kind of it didn't live after expectation so very similar to crypto lives and and been running way longer too it started in 60s so all right so if you're just being as broad as defining it as machine learning then that means like you can apply so many different types of machine learning to crypto so of all the different types which ones are you most excited about when it comes to the intersection of AI and crypto so I think like worst kind of stopping on the large language models because they are the kind of this recent Innovation and the interesting thing is like it's for the first time that computers went from needing a human to interpret what they output to being able to communicate directly right it went from somebody kind of needed to be like professionally trained to understand the output to anybody can talk to and that's why it's really exciting and really powerful is because you have this transition and so now going back to kind of web3 broadly speaking there's a number of areas where this intersects so I would start with generic marketplaces of resources right so I mentioned we started because we wanted to use blockchain to pay people for our like data crowdsourcing tasks and so this kind of example so there's data there's compute and there's kind of model architectures and ways to train things those are kind of quote-unquote resources that they're used in machine learning that blockchain is a really good Marketplace kind of facilitator that can open up and really create a better liquidity right so just give you an example right now if you want to get like a GPU cluster you need to like commit you know 10 million dollars at least uh to one of the cloud service and you need to negotiate with you know some representative it's it's not a like very efficient market right and let's say you did get this but you're not using it there's no way to like facilitate renting it out for someone for like an hour right so things like that is where blockchain can already become a really easy facilitator to kind of really provide those resources across data model like model architectures can and compute and and I'm sorry you were saying like paying people but also it felt like you were saying crowdsourcing as well to do crowdsourcing you need to pay people right so crowdsourcing is a way to kind of facilitate like I need this work to be done and I need to find somebody who is like skilled and uh willing to do this and I'll pay them for doing this work and Jason what about you well I think like going back to some of the central premise of I'm going to say blockchain here too so let's say it's like you know it's permissionless and trustless like let's go back to those two things there so theoretically as everyone has pointed out on the internet whenever you're talking about a blockchain someone would say well this could have just been a database at some point too and Etc et cetera yes like technically I guess that's true in many situations but that doesn't adhere to those two principles of permissionless and trustless plus of some other Central things now I think when we're talking about AI in particular particularly this wave of AI there's a lot of things where those two elements could play a really interesting role so Italy is talking about marketplaces but there's provenance of data and there's ability to get information in and out of these things where the permissionless and trustless is important because otherwise we're talking about how these things have to be essentially administered uh so if you're talking about data as an example somebody somewhere always has access to these things can manipulate and whatnot so it depends on your views on what those things could the potential challenges with those those sorts of things so right now as an example we don't have any idea um Providence of any of the sort of things that are going into any of the open AI language models we have no idea what type of data went into this now if that's an important aspect of what we want as a society for how we're going to evolve in the future well how do we do that in such a way that it's auditable and traceable and we can understand how these things evolve again we can go back to like okay well we can show you the books and all that sort of stuff but it turns out that we already have a system in place where we can say if you just put it here we can all look at it in some sort of way but that's just one example of the way in which we these things can work so it could be embeddings you'd be ways it could be all these different things that we talk about along the way then as Ilya was talking about you know Resource Management which is a particular issues right now because I'm literally going to the most Central of all Central authorities trying to get GPU access at the moment because it's the most precious commodity in AI is how excuse going so I'm going to the nvidias and the Googles and the Amazons and there's 30 people in the world that have access to the type of compute that I need at the moment to go build these things and you know what does that really look like in a world that's a much more efficient and you could basically have GPU spot marketplaces where we can just kind of come in and use it if we need to and then rent it out if you bought access to it or whatnot it's a very different world you know and if you build these things around that now again people talk about well that could just be a database it can but then you're putting a lot of trust into people and a central Authority and you know depending on your views on that what does that mean and so like where you were going with it sounded like you were saying transparency is something that blockchain Tech could help bring to AI what came to my mind was you know you've seen those news articles where the AI reflects the biases and prejudices in our society is that what you're talking about like helping to I'm gonna use an artist's example here because because I think like when we talk about Providence of David what the training date is it can get into a really nuanced area really quickly but right now the simplest way to think about this might be just mid-journey style image generations and what could have gone into that and there's it's a gray area right now there's a lot of this stuff will be tested in legal Arena here soon I don't know what that means mid-journey style Generations what what is that a mid-journey is an image generation like generative AI image generation model that will if you tell it hey make me a pirate sitting on the moon holding a banana literally it will understand that and generate several versions of this image that you can manipulate and say okay now make it more of like 60s retro style and it knows how to do that sort of thing but it only knows how to do that because of how much data is ingested other images and things of that nature so in some ways when we talk about attribution like how does it know that from that particular image what inspiration is it drawing from because it is drawing from other images some of those might even be copyrighted some of those might be whatevers it would be interesting to understand how it knows which one of those things are and you know no one's doing this at the moment because it's actually a pain in the ass to go do but you know if that's important in the future there's an easy way for us to go achieve that as well I would turn that around on the other side as well right now open Ai and Journey oldest companies they also need to decide what are things that are good and bad they are actually making decisions for things that this model should not do and so we're getting into a single company pretty much deciding for 100 million of people what's good and bad and we know how that went before with social networks for example and so this is kind of extension of this problem and this is going back to what we've been building in blockchain space right it was Dows governance and really trying to figure out how to create an open inclusive way of deciding on things we can actually have this Taos to be driving kind of training data collection that specifically tries to de-buy us and find the consensus on what is communities things kind of good and bad or safe or not safe aligned with humanitarian values or not right and use un principle we've all for that and like do that in an open and transparent way so everybody already sees exactly what are the rules versus right now we don't even know where like the edges of for these models are I was gonna say this is actually something that I felt for a long time because I've worked in the open source Community for you know going on 20 years at this point but professionally probably the last 15. and one of the things that you do when you open source your code but not your decision making process is people can look at your code and they can say Okay X I understand that I understand why Etc but they might understand how you made decisions to come to these things so in an interesting roundabout way open sourcing your code actually can lead to a lot more scrutiny because people will then start questioning the decision making process or who who made the decisions and when and why and all that sort of stuff and you know five years on working on Ubuntu with the Debian and Linux Community we always a constant thing and so there's a world in which you could then take some of those things as ILY was pointing out and put them in the system and it's open for everyone to go and spat those sorts of things like hey this is the rationale or this is how we're going to do this or this is the rule system that's going to be in place for this and again like you know no one's actually done this fully to an extent but I do think that there's a world in which somebody somewhere is going to see that opportunity and say hey I don't want to have to be in a position where I'm going to go defend each one of these things just find a way to go put that in there and let people inspect it understand what that looks like just to draw this out for me because my question was like what areas are you most excited about where Crystal and AI come together so what you're seeing is if you have a self-funded open source project like you can fund it with crypto and then that will allow all these decisions to be transparent is that that's not specifically what I'm talking about though that would exist I think the where I would be most excited about it is being able to show more Providence I think at the moment like I would like to be able to show where some of the data came from so you can attribute it back to Folk folks in the future you would use the blockchain to do that yeah you can yeah you can you can say hey these are stick all the data there and you're gonna say this is in the the series of data blocks that allow me to that were using this generation as an example like saying like or inspired this or helped uh on this and you know at the end of the day it's all just data Oh no I got it okay well so I wanted to now ask probably this is a more pull side question but I'm sure Elia has ideas because I was reading that ai's help coders do their work but I didn't know like is that just you know like JavaScript or something or could they even do like salinity smart contracts or any kind of smart contracts what are you seeing in terms of like how well AIS can do the types of coding needed to run blockchains yeah all those are anything is available any type of code is available in most of these systems I haven't specifically checked on solidity but I'm assuming it is I've seen two so I've been to a lot of hacking sounds recently two of the winners of two different hackathons were using opening eyes API to do solidity auditing so they were fun with this in solidity code like using the API pretty much conditioning it with specific things as well as feeding it with some other static analyzers but also like describing like what kind of vulnerabilities this would generate on our side like I've seen people actually using it to write rust smart contracts for near as well at least like somewhat common set of problems so when when it's doing that when it's auditing and it's catching bugs that is just based on what's already known right or if it's machine learning could it ever like uh with the chess thing or the the Go game like could it go beyond what humans have already figured out or will it only ever because it's only like being fed you know what people have already figured out what's the limit yes it knows about those things but from the past but the idea here is and this is where I think everyone's kind of racing to is that it will go beyond what people have known now like how we're ever going to be able to achieve that you know depends on your views I think we're going to be able to do that and go beyond but you know I I do think that what Ilya is describing here at the moment is most of what we're seeing today is Generation like functional generation and inspection and in reality what it does is it knows more about the broad swath of like all the solidity code that has ever been done and the docs so it can catch these things and at some point it is going to be able to test this and say hey this is where you know this is specific to what we're trying to do at poolside because we're focused on code and software in general but we'll be able to test the outputs you know uh we'll be able to say this is good code or this is runnable or if this is insecure and it's it's a future version of a thing so we've not seen it before but we know that it's secured because it breaks down on these rules or the testing environment that we have shows that it's probably vulnerable to these things I also wanted to ask because like news articles that I was reading just made me wonder you know we've often heard about for instance crypto trading Bots and then I was just like wait so is AI is that just a new word for what people have already been doing or is this somehow like I didn't really know what's the difference between a crypto trading bot and then using AI for crypto trading because like suddenly there's all these articles on using AIS for crypto trading I'm like is that different from before are they just using a different word now so I think I mean machine learning been used for trading probably like as soon as somebody did machine learning there's actually What's called the first real applications because you can make money super quick on this so like hey awesome and we can make money so yeah machine learning always there I think what people are doing now is being able to ingest more signals from language so for example you can read dark news articles or analyze transcript of this podcast in real life like you know catch some of the project names or whatever and potentially make some decisions based on that all of that has been done like Wall Street has been doing all of this like just with a less sophisticated models right like I mean I've been doing natural language from 2010 this was you know early early years of natural language so generally speaking it's just like more sophisticated models they understand better the language you can kind of inquire it and the other thing is bringing that use case as well up because this is the first time you can talk to computer right in a way this allows to have two things one is you know blockchain is a lot of code and numbers in the way and trading it as well is just a lot of you know numbers and things and so what it allows to do is it lowers a barrier for kind of people being able to come up with more sophisticated models without needing to really build all the code or strategies or structures and actually have this conversation with kind of the bot for example to describe the strategy right so imagine we're like discussing you know it would make sense to buy low when you know some bigger whales are buying like this sounds simple but like implementing that and making that actionable you know before would require like building out a team of 10 high frequency Traders right now you actually can't have this conversation with for example like one of the systems and potentially it will build a strategy and start executing it for you and so expanding that you know now to defy G5 right now is pretty complicated for a lot of things right Beyond just simple swaps imagine you can describe like hey I want you know take a position in whatever is the latest high yield pools is right and it can like iterate over all of them find whatever how you take the position and stuff like this it kind of provides a more natural interface to this somewhat complex still ecosystem and I think like that barrier will actually like AI will actually help like language models specifically will help to lower barrier to access some of those things both not just on trading side but also on using side and kind of interfacing with blockchain applications yeah I just I just want to insert a caveat which is nothing we say here is financial advice I don't want people to like whip these up and be like I'm gonna make a killing and then they like lose a bunch of money or anything but anyway Jason no no you're going to lose more money than you're going to make in some of these cases but um for what it's worth whenever I hear a bot I always think that there's machine learning behind it I just assume at this point when someone says but there's some sort of intelligence and automation that makes it that way as an example there's Bots emerge in all these different systems and really what they're doing is they're taking past data sets or blah blah blah trying to understand what they're supposed to do in the moment and SO trading Bots are not anything dissimilar but as Ilya mentioned large language models are going to change those again but also in the crypto space what do they have is do they have access to open access to the data sets as well as the other systems where a good example here is if you want to use non-crypto systems and you're trading go to go to trading view as an example I mentioned purely as an example here by the way and obviously but you could use gpt4 chat GPT to say hey I know nothing about Pine script I think is what they use but I do want to create some sort of trading algorithms help me write these wanted to write them and you can put them into trading view as an example but then what you can then do is extend that out and start to do this now the difference between that and like crypto which is like you're using this in the stock market stuff is you don't have the same access to all the underlying data sets so if someone could do the entirety of this in the crypto space and then you could also find a niche much easier too because you could be off on some Far phone platform that doesn't have a lot of xyz's and you could really make a killing if you understand how to wedge yourself into a certain system all right so in a moment we're going to talk about the intersection between misinformation and AIS and crypto but first a quick

misinformation from AIS but I'm curious yeah for your thoughts on like how exactly that would work yeah so I would start with that misinformation is not even a eye problem right this thing has been existing you know even the the basis of crypto right the Byzantine fault tolerance is based on the misinformation [Music] so so generally like the Byzantine General's problem right and so like generally speaking like this is a human problem not AI problem that AI is just becoming a tool to really kind of efficiently create a lot of items information or like very pointed content or create you know generated content that looks very real but has for example wrong facts yeah and in case anybody doesn't know the Byzantine General's problem is basically when there's different people they don't necessarily all trust each other and it's something about like you want them to act together in concert even though they don't trust each other is that yeah like there's potentially like up to one third of them that are malicious and trying to like propagate some information that's not true and you still want you know your army to kind of execute correct orders the consensus of blockchain is based on that where like up to one third of validators may be malicious trying to like really attack the system and you still won the whole blockchain to come up to a consensus like on you know order of transactions and money spent on okay decisions made on chain I'm just saying like the the source of the misinformation is you know Spanish like thousands of years it's like as as soon as people started talking they started spreading yourself for me and so I think like the in you know the even with generated like images now the reality is the Photoshop you know photoshopped image existed before and it was like cases when it was presented in court like uh altered images so I just like want to set up the case because a lot of people say like oh AI is like you know creating these information it's like that's not true like humans creating misinformation they're using this language models as an image in like generative AI as a tool to create misinformation and so the question is like how to address this challenge with our I call it Society operating system and our society operating system runs on language we communicate with language we have like all the government kind of systems run on language and so this is where web3 comes in website has cryptography has reputation has all those things that kind of tie together and they provide the tooling to for us to actually authenticate the content the link it to the its creator or authorizers or kind of create reputation around the content Source right so for example let's say this podcast was completely AI generated how do you know that how would the listener know that it was a generated or real people we three actually said yes we actually participated and so the way to do that is for us all three after it's recorded to sign the kind of hash of the whole podcast and say like yes we participate in this and this is indeed content that we've been members of and potentially it can be actually like edited with AI to like make it sound nicer to have better images Etc that doesn't matter what matters is that I say yes I authorize this content and I put my reputation in the and so to do that we need cryptographic signatures we need kind of identity that ties all of the things that I signed with so you can see like what I've signed and we need a set of tooling that when you do listen it on for example podcasts or Spotify or whatever it says yes it's verified and indeed signed by the right people so that is kind of a system that needs to exist and like not just you know for podcast is a good example but you know this needs to exist on a government level because there will be like artificially generated filings you know companies that don't exist that are run by AI you can have politicians that are completely artificially created that are talking to people through instant Messenger right and describing their policy exactly adjusted to that person and they would not even know that and that's like all possible now just like to scale the level and create it a lot more personalized and so using cryptography and reputation kind of all those pieces that blockchain is you know powering would allow us to really kind of create a more trusted environment and reputation-based environment that we don't have right now this is so fascinating to me and obviously because I'm a journalist and I really care about facts and I just really hate misinformation and think it's corroding democracy and all things like that I couldn't help but think okay so let's say that this system comes into place and then really reputable Publications like the New York Times The Wall Street Journal The Washington Post LA Times whatever they start entering things in the blockchain they're using their reputation I mean I just thought of these really famous incidents where reporters were making stuff up like there's a famous case of a guy named Jason Blair there's another one Stephen glass and there was also the case of the New York Times Reporter who got the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq wrong Judith Miller so then what do you do when like a reputable source is stamping misinformation or I guess misinformation I feel like is more intentional and then well so in some of those cases yes the reporter was doing intentionally but in some of them it was just a mistake so then then how does that work what do you do in that kind of situation so important part now is that it's Unchained right you can inspect right so you can go back and see for this reporter for example have they said something already that was marked as incorrect or you cannot get out of this and say like oh I didn't say it or whatever go and edit it post factor so you have now reputation attached to each kind of source the reality is everything's subjective right and so although like yes we won facts but like at the end it's subjective and so repetition is subjective to some extent but you can study like now there's objective facts that you can inspect that cannot be like retractively changed then the other thing is let's say you know as a reporter you probably have sources and so now if you have this cryptographic and reputation system you can actually have a zero knowledge proof of your sources without revealing who they are right let's say you have a white house you can prove that hey you actually had somebody in White House that told you this without revealing who they are but like revealing some fact about them and and things like that right like now you can have kind of a lot more information being plugged in into this reputation and then at the end it still would be a subjective like you know some people watching Fox it doesn't matter for them if it's not true all the time I mean I don't know I'm just as an example and like they've kind of continue watching Fox right that's what I'm saying in some ways reputation is subjective but like at least you can have the facts and you can study them and you can observe them and you can have systems and browsers and apps that actually show you this kind of summary about reputation is like hey this journalist you know like out of the last three articles two of them were flagged with some not correct facts for example by the community that you're following let's say you follow one of the communities or fact Checkers and they're like hey you know we've flagged like multiple facts are not correct and stuff like this right like you can have this composibility now of different pieces and communities kind of coming together and informing things oh wow I love so much about this and I think you kind of addressed a question that I had because I'm sure you're very well aware and we see this it's not just news organizations but for instance presidential candidates even when one source like tends to be uh repeating misinformation more frequently than another one people still they just believe whatever they want to believe and they kind of don't care if one is like proven over and over again to be spouting misinformation so a couple of things so first of all my thought was oh but what if the people who just want to believe whatever they want to believe are start attacking the reputation of the factual ones is there a resolution for that or is it simply that because you have the sourcing you can see like okay actually all of this does check out where's the other like it doesn't have as many things that check out or or what I mean I don't know if we would be able to fully answer the question but I would say this think of it as a hierarchy at the bottom like what blockchains would be incredibly good for useful for is like facts like straight up like identity as a good example is Ilya a human or not like can he prove himself to be a human etc etc then going all the way all the way to the top would be things that require some amount of interpretation as an example does that make sense like hey you've got to be able to juggle a couple of different things together and whatnot you're not going to be able to do as much in with that you have to actually build some other systems on top of the base level systems to be able to do some of those things but the point being that you could build those systems on top of each other and again going back to even as Ilya said some of the start with the business team generals problem and thinking about this going back all the way to when we're everyone will start first start talk about blockchains with Bitcoin and others what it was is trying to take trust from a central Authority and so swap it out to a publicly transparent something or other and if you think about just that one motion you know going back to Identity here is I'm a U.S citizen so how do you verify that I'm a U.S citizen you have to go ask the central governmental Authority but what if that was instead over here in a publicly verifiable transparent system that's an interesting amazing ability to go do and you could do that for other things as well so verify that Jason was a CTO at GitHub you have to go look at my LinkedIn then you have to go call GitHub but what if that was not the way in which we had to do this now there's just think this through for a second we think why is uh Sam Altman looking at World coin and getting this off the ground for what does that mean what is that supposed to be about all that sort of stuff and I guess you know playing these things through this is why they I think that there's interesting overlap between these two types of technological movements let's call them but each of them has become shrouded in their own weird I don't know what to call them but idiocy might be the best way which is AI is going to be used to generate all this bad spam on the internet and this is terrible content all that sort of stuff but let's just be honest like a lot of the stuff that go ahead's going on the crypto for the last or web three for the last three years is it was just like straight up ADC scams and whatevers of the world and it was not what the obviously the base of the system was supposed to be intended for and we're throwing out baby for the with the bath water in a lot of that situation there do you see there being some kind of Remedy once misinformation does get I feel like so much will need to be built out for this Vision to happen like I almost feel like what we're talking about is minimum 20 years from now if not like 30. so a few things one is so we've been building we call a blockchain operating system which is a fully cryptographically kind of reputation-based everything from you know blockchain itself and using all the blockchains in the webto ecosystem to front ends to kind of authenticated the content you see not just us lens and other score building details are social like we are all building the substrate for all of this like it's not that far away I think it's more about like how do we how do we bootstrap the adoption and I think this is where we just need to show more examples where if it's not used it's going to be not great right I mean I think getting it used on a society-wide scale that's what I'm talking about 20 years and and that's what I'm saying I think actually it will happen faster because of like people will start using AI for misinformation for creating spam and kind of generated content that is like malicious and intent like this will become a motivator to actually start using like we already see right Twitter is doing rate limiting because the kind of scrapers are running wild right like this is this is already beginning of this thing right like same if you search for I'm aim language model on Twitter you'll see all of the Bots very much that are posting that like hit this you know the rules that like not allowed but like this is just things that we see that are like pretty much errors of that bot but like all of the other rest of the Twitter is being generated already that's a reality the content explosion is just starting but like as more gpus become available as more of this link open source language models become powerful this is just gonna escalate right again like the the podcast fully generated this is like next year this is one where I I think about this quite a bit which is Billy and I have this conversation with private a bunch but part part of this conversation which is how weird the future is going to get like how fast things will happen how weird it will be how many things will be generated even if it's 10 real 90 generated or 50 real 50 generated there's going to be a lot of things that just get generated positive and negative and then going back to like what we've just experienced in the last wave of the crypto and now that we're particularly in the winter here uh I feel like the focus now particularly like this is one of the reasons why I like what Ilya is building with Pagoda near which is blockchain operating system because it's a focus on the fundamental problems and solutions that would back to the original premise of the Technologies as opposed to going into the very speculative Natures effectively financial manipulations and stuff like with all these different systems that felt like a really weird side path where a whole bunch of people can make a whole bunch of money but it wasn't focused on what this is going to do for society and this is again what Ilya is focusing on is how this could be useful for society and how we can build applications on top of it and that Focus now with what is going to happen should emerge out with some really entrepreneurial people saying like well this is the real problem this is the real solution let's figure out how they overlap together it's it'll get interesting and I my hope my hope my hope is that coming out of this crypto winner people are using these Technologies for these reasons as opposed to just again speculating with VC money so that everyone can walk away and buy a boat and we're building something real and name it much wow I had to ask also you know we talked about how you can use these right now to audit solidity code and things like that obviously we've seen so many hacks in defy I think for 2022 it's like more than three billion dollars worth and I just released an episode where someone had proposed circuit breakers for defy to help prevent them but I wondered could you create an AI that would in real time do something to either help prevent these attacks or or you know whatever and and it's not even just the active withdrawing money but even like the economic attacks where they're manipulating prices and stuff like that so I mean like folks like Gauntlet and others uh they're using machine learning to do this stuff right right I mean it's not always like language models per se because a lot of it is not based on language a lot of it is like understanding time series of prices understanding the movement of money and this like a lot of folks are actually using like what's happening on testnet to detect if there's a hack gonna happen on mainnet like so all of this is like Predictive Analytics type things already happening there's a lot of smart people doing this kind of work it's just maybe not as like hyped up as uh whatever new plugin to chat GPT that can be explained in seven ways right if you want to think about every time you hear a word bot just think that it is actually already using some of this technology just maybe not the specific large language model portion of the technology um you're not you're directionally correct uh you may not be in a specifics but this is this is why people are doing these things already and you know there are going to be again going back to it's going to get weird you're going to see people start building these things out quicker I think though too you're going to start seeing people who are manipulating systems more and you're going to see both protective measures but also adversarial measures emerge more as well so one of the things that I I do think about on a regular basis is what happens when all of these systems are available to anybody and any random person could generate a bot Army and right now we know that what's happened on the internet with a lot of that has been a nation state level for manipulations for various reasons but you know it's also gone down to lower levels where it's like well-funded organization has created by armies to go do and manipulate Etc and then you know spam creation Etc so it's still funding but imagine when one person could theoretically create these things on the Flies super fast so this has nothing to do with specifically the overlap between the two but the point being that like it's going to be possible for the barrier to entry for a singular person to do these things is going to drop towards zero on a you know infinite timeline but sooner rather than later in my opinion and which means there's going to be negative things from that not nearly just positive things but very negative things that we're going to all have to kind of watch out for and hopefully build Protections in place for yeah maybe to bring back to the default example so that that bot you can use using openai API to find vulnerabilities in solidity code you can use it now to find a lot of the common vulnerabilities that do exist in existing D5 deployed projects so what this means is the kind of challenge being that the circuit breakers and like I've been talking about having circuit breakers in D5 as well for like over a year the reality is like this needs to be deployed first before we deploy D5 right and those circuit breakers also needs to be ideally economically guaranteed where somebody's underwriting and actually monitoring this like for example someone's audit firms need to actually take kind of sounds at risk and become an insurers of these protocols and like that all needs to have like that's the adoption part to kind of really start preventing some of the bad things happening as Jason mentioning that like it's becoming let like you don't actually need to even know solidity potentially to start like generating attacks on Smart contracts soon right like imagine that it will soon be happening so to your question of like how fast this adoption will happen I mean we're getting to a level where we have all the tooling it's now more about like whoever launches things need to be thinking long term and kind of creating the right structures to protect things versus kind of throwing things out right and this is true about content right like this big big Publications you need to start thinking about it as well and kind of protecting like you know signing and protecting the content they're producing in such a way that you can build things around that and build these reputation systems around that all right so this actually brings us full circle to back to like what we were sort of discussing kind of at the beginning but we didn't go into depth and this is like when I was doing my research I felt like this is where I was kind of finding the most interesting stuff but I feel like Dao's and AI are sort of the place at least where I thought like oh there's like a lot of potential here so Ellie I feel like that's where you were going initially when you were talking about the crowdsourcing and crowdfunding yeah but I feel like there's other things too so I don't know why don't you guys just talk a little bit about all the different ways that you think Dallas and AIS could work together so I think I really really interesting part is and I also intellectually it's interesting to think about and I think we'll see this very soon is let's imagine we have an organization that's run by AI right so instead of a CEO being a human you have a CEO being an AI right and they have a mission they have you know set of kpis and goals that they set out to do and they actually allocating work to people to do within that company legally wise we cannot do that right now right like in in the physical world but on blockchain this is actually pretty easy to do we set up a dial the dial you know coordinator is an AI model that produces tasks and pays for them to people and you have you know shareholders token holders whatever the you know interest holders in this dial who actually are setting up kpis and making sure that AI is on on point and kind of doing the things it should do that structure is like very possible you know very soon like I'm I'm expecting you know somebody I mean there's like few technical things that you to be built and I know a few companies that are doing this right now and we'll see some of this happening where you can have a project that's like kind of coordinated by AI based on the kpis that the community has set out and it's kind of you know splitting the work and you know analyzing the results and kind of deciding what to do next and you know it will make mistakes but so as humans and at the same time it will be way more kind of cold-hearted in a way with sounds of decisions and not biased with some of the things I think it's interesting to think you know expanding that in a few years forward and beyond that we talk a lot about you know ai's taking over the world like people love this like Terminator story but the reality I think will be economical not kind of existential it will be because AI is actually better at coordinating humans that humans are because they're not biased because they're kind of can observe everything and can process all of this data at the same time like we economically will want to work for AIS pretty much as like better boss like makes us more economically successful than kind of this existential AI becoming evil and wanting to take over the world so I think that that's an interesting concept for me oh just help me for a second because you know as we mentioned earlier there have been like prominent AI scientists who come and said oh these models are being trained in a way that they're reinforcing a lot of societal prejudices so you're saying that it's an AI where they're only gonna yeah the community is becoming it's pretty much like governance body right like you know they can decide if it's doing the wrong thing it can decide if it's like should be you know fine-tuned for a different thing they can literally say like hey we need to Source these types of data to find to to adjust the AI model to be better at that or not do this or you know be less biased about that they can you know commission pretty much crowdsourcing data using again blockchain to actually get more training data for this model to become better at specific tasks and yeah but also I felt like where you were going to is that since the AI will have a certain set of kind of goals or parameters that are more numbers based then it's just a simple thing almost like a a check of you know did the DOW manage to do this or did it not or like which dial members did it versus which ones didn't that kind of thing yeah it's like it's way less about you know any any kind of observable parameters uh and a lot more about like work has been done and kind of you know just very transparent very like kind of egalitarian or meritocratic approach then you know as a human we strive to be that but like we always fail right that's just inevitable one other thing that I wanted to ask about is that I was also reading you could do the reverse where you could have Dows that manage AIS and I think we had kind of touched on some of these issues before you know when Jason was talking about like the transparency and different things like that but do you see anybody working on that already or because you know we have like robust Dow infrastructure I'm not as close to anything going on in the arena so I don't know if anyone is actually using this at the moment so maybe Ilya in his hackathons have seen more of these things than than I have oh yeah have you seen anything I mean people are definitely trying I think the the missing piece right now on infrastructure side is kind of right now there's like two types of models there's either like fully centralized models run by you know open AI Google or like fully open source model that like just runs on edge and so there's no kind of this way to run some of these models in a I call it under consensus right so in a way that like you can prove on chain that it's correct right so some people are trying you know there's for example a way to convert uh some of the machine learning models into ZK circuits but it only works for kind of smaller models and ZK circuits is what is there an outlet circuit so like you can you can run a model and then prove that the output is indeed the output of this model oh okay yeah so people are working on infrastructure for that and this is kind of precondition of any of the like Dao and machine learning interacting actually like trustless way outside of this like what you can expect is more like a dow commissioning pretty much somebody to do something with a model and then getting results back right so this is more like hey you know similar to how that was commissioned somebody to go do something in physical world right and validate the results later but I think the interesting part for sure are mooring like around either augmented humans kind of in their day-to-day work right and kind of interfaces and creating a better interface or in this like making AI now become more of a coordinator role or kind of a pilot versus a co-pilot role yeah I feel like what that combination could do dow managing an AI would address like I'm sure you guys have heard you know people will say things like you know I mean it's like what the FTX stuff you know they were always trying to mitigate against AIS doing something really potentially adverse to humanity and I feel like that's what a lot of the fears are around the more closed-sourced AIS and even things like World coin like people just get nervous about certain things that aren't well known and it's only like a small number of people that know them getting too much control so I feel like if it's something where it's more public and like the community feels that it has control of it then it could mitigate some of those fears so one other thing I want to ask about was both of these are super emerging areas of technology and they're definitely not well understood by regulators and lawmakers and Elia I know that you have some thoughts about how you see parallels and how they're being regulated and you mentioned to me an interesting idea about how they could be used to kind of regulate each other so what are your thoughts on that yeah so I mean I think the similarity here indeed that like there's sort of emerging technologies that like literally changing every every year you see like a completely complete shift from what it was before you know regulations don't move on that speed and at the same time like what we're really trying to do is to protect consumer protect the markets protect kind of the people and like that that is the core part and then around that hey we already have a lot of the regulations around products and around internet and around just people doing wrong stuff right so like that all exists and it's just kind of you know the point about blockchain has always been like hey on the edges you already have all of the regulations that are happening right like people doing the wrong things like they already fall under the existing you know everything from money laundering to it doesn't matter which tool they use to do that and same on the eyesight when people doing malicious things like creating misinformation like there's already laws against that it's not like a new thing like same as like you know doctored images to present at the cases and so or misusing copyright information or whatever and so on the other side like what do we want to protect well so I mentioned right using blockchain for reputation and identity and same actually even for blockchain space itself like we're not using blockchain to to actually have the identity of people who are building blockchain right like we're not used in like the tokens launched are not kind of cryptographically signed by people who launch them there's no like security reports that you know produced by Auditors are not cryptographically signed and and put in blockchain so like all of this video information organized properly can be the the way to really regulate it and for that Regulators should be just using this technology because it's actually designed for for a lot of this use case of like keeping track of you know records making sure that everything is authenticated allowing Community to inspect it very easily allow other external tools like imagine you know you open your wallet and if you want to transact with an address that is on some lists right it like automatically shows it because that list is on blockchain right and that to add to that list you need a community vote of the interested part of the parties that are involved in these decisions same you know if you're trying to transact with a contract if it doesn't have an audit right your wallet right away shows you that this contract does not have an audit and like are you sure you want to transact going back to some of our earlier points already the core basis for what blockchains would be good at would be a remarkable Boon for society if we could use them that way so think about like even just like phishing attacks and emails that come in or text messages or whatnot like we haven't really fully used them there's you know this again going back to like one of the reasons why I like liking it with Ilia is he's focused on making these things possible as opposed to just trading monkey pictures on the internet which is yes people are going to go do and stuff but like ultimately like it's solving a real societal level problem and if we use them that way we can actually Advance real needed things that are going to benefit everybody in the world to a degree so but we got to focus on them build them and we have to actually understand how they're going to be used so going going back to the regulator point on this which is on both sides of the fence no one who's going to make up any of the rules or regulations fully understands these Technologies and they're they don't understand the implications of the Technologies not the core into line but what's a positive or negative can happen with these things and so they rely on Experts to come in and talk about them and all that sort of stuff but this goes to age-old problems of like incentive structures and so somebody going in front of Congress and saying hey we need to put all these things in place for large language run models at the moment like well let's just be honest that's a very selfish view of the world for that one particular person we need people who understand these things I'm going to go into like a slightly different tangent to Ilia here and just say I think we need showcases for the technology uh that will help folks understand these things so right now in like what Alias described is there's a lot of practical that exists on the crypto side of the world but within some theoretical for some of the I the things in place and I think we have to understand like that technology music is showcased the capabilities need to get showcased so that people can fully understand that because Ilya is smart enough and everyone who's listening to this is likely smart enough to understand and extrapolate out what Ilya just said that it goes oh yeah I can see how that would be useful but people who are not immersed aren't going to be able to see that so they're only going to see the moment you know if we can move what is possible in the moment we can showcase that sort of uh thing so again I I hope people listening to this start to focus on those problems because those are real things that will advance the state of the art in a society form I mean for sure speculation is just a huge part of the crypto community at least for now so I don't think it's the majority of my listeners but no this is actually something that I get I get really bugged by because obviously like it was encouraged for quite some time because you can make so much money but imagine this too like half of these VC firms just to show that they were quote unquote in the uh the community hired people who with Anonymous identities on the internet and like in one of them was famous for saying we don't even know who this person is well that was absurdly Reckless absurdly because the technology that they're supposed to be investing in is one of those things that should show them that they could actually prove who that person was and Etc and they didn't even go through that process they just hired a random avatar from Twitter and it's it's silly like in the moment like now retrospect to talk about that but they should have been showcasing what is possible with this technology too in my opinion yeah I mean to mention like another example is you know using the technology will allow to ensure that all the money are staying in the right place there I said they're saying not being reused in different places by editing some code and moving them around accounts right like this is this is like like that that's the part is like it's it's been encouraged to build stuff on top that are not really using the technology and allowing to speculate versus actually using technology and like we you know there's actually projects like orderly which are you know all of the custody is on chain and you can inspect everything while all of the trade like for example execution and and order book is off chain for performance and for so like stuff like this is possible it's not like it's impossible to build and Performing things it's just like it's been encouraged indeed to do a more I mean I guess Reckless with ways of doing things but again like I think to point to bring back to the regulations what's important here is instead of saying like Hey we're going to regulate this more I call it language right hey we're going to come in and say like there'll be you know you'll need to come to us and register for this and that and the other right and this is true about lab 3 and AI right they're saying for AI right now if using more than this much teraflops for your training of your model you need to register and it's like well that makes no sense right first of all the capabilities that will emerge from lower than that like you nobody knows what they're all going to be in a year right this technology is evolving like somebody with open source the weights will leak like it none of this makes sense right versus saying like hey you know we ensuring that like even if there's like super powerful model it it is like cannot actually affect us in any way because we have this cryptographic identity reputation and then on the other side we're registering the right things automatically through a blockchain and like augmenting it with more and more information from external sources because it's transparent Rich data is being used Etc that's the way to go and again like Bose four web three and four Ai and for the three side you can use AI to explain to everyone else like what is actually happening right to actually interpret the source code of the smart contract in natural language to explain what transactions have been happening right now when you open a meta mask and you see a bunch of bytes that you're signing that cannot be you know the real world right like we should actually explain exactly what you're signing in transaction and we can use for that again like fine-tuned model to explain it so like all those things just like coming together really like reinforcing each other but they need to be used in the right way and really focus on that versus focusing on some of the other things and I think like to even go further on this too though ilya's saying what we're talking about now particularly I'm obviously closer to the AI regulations side of the fence but I I'm close enough to the crypto side too to talk about this it's all this weird kind of performative regulatory stuff so go into the teraflops example here it's like sure whatever you can do that and have someone ought to do but we don't know the capability of that's going to be in a year let alone 18 months or two years Etc and so it's all this performative classic nonsense from a regulatory perspective when in fact all someone has to go do is understand and go build some of the systems that can showcase what would be possible to go do and have these conversations publicly in a way from a transparency perspective so again going to where the data comes from the problems and all that sort of stuff well the system exists existed for us to register data sets and two and say this is what our training data sets look like and go ahead and order them or the weights or whatever blah blah and we understand that but yeah I mean I see what you guys are saying I just think some of because at different points it seemed like you were kind of referencing you know like what happened with FTX or whatever and I I do feel that some of the problems that you cited I don't know really how you would use blockchain technology to resolve some of those things because there would just be the sheer number of things you would have to build to make that possible it just seems it's built like we have a project that's literally a as performant and as easy to use as centralized Exchange but it does it does and assets are all Unchained and it does not only proof of reserves but also like liabilities going out because everything is literally Unchained like it's in smartphone it's like it's like the G5 decks but with the speed and execution of of centralized exchange well you know you should do a partnership with coinbase or something to show how this works or you know binance might be up for it since they're in regulatory hot water yeah I think there's something binance wants that in this case here well I mean yeah assuming they want to keep their business they probably need to you know give an apple to the teacher anyway we've spent plenty of time on regulation and we're running long I do want to ask you one last question though which is obviously we've now seen a flurry of activity around the application of AI and blockchain or crypto so kind of in the next year what are different things that you're kind of keeping your eye on like developments that you are interested in following I mean from my side I I do think the AI coordinated dials are really interesting and I'm expecting some first results like you know to come out everything from you know simple AI based tissure management to more maybe like coordinating people to do some activity in real world I think that that would be really exciting to see and and they are will be governed by the Dao members right so to your point Dow members will be kind of ensuring that this AI is operating within its uh kind of mandate and you know potential should be virus so I think like that we'll see probably this in next year kind of first first examples of that working and I'm I'm pretty excited about that you know I'm focused on obviously getting my first model Margaret for poolside and making sure that that it's it's already beating state of the art which is what our expectations are based on some more early model runs but also if I'm particularly paying attention to anything is going to be how the regulatory conversation is coming down and who is particularly who is in it and how to help push that to a good spot from the AI side of the fence all right well this has been a very fascinating discussion thank you both so much where can people learn more about you and your work Twitter IO black dragon or check out near.org for blockchain operating system and Twitter Jason C Warner Twitter and then a landing page at the moment but poolside.ai will be there soon perfect it's been a pleasure having you
