hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the show that reveals how the marquee names in crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines and gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon i'm your host laura shin a journalist with over two decades of experience i started covering crypto five years ago and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time unchained and unconfirmed are now published his videos if you're not yet subscribed to the unchained youtube channel head to youtube.com c unchained podcast and subscribe today crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto earn up to 8.5 per year on your bitcoin download the krypto.com app now today's guest is willy woo on chain bitcoin analyst and writer of the bitcoin forecast a market intelligence newsletter welcome willie hey laura great to be there this was quite the week for bitcoin and crypto in general with paypal announcing that it will allow its 346 million customers to hold bitcoin ether and other cryptocurrencies as well as use them to pay at paypal's 26 million merchants at the news the price of bitcoin shot up briefly flirting with 13 000 what do you make of paypal's news uh yeah wow it's it's very much um significant uh if you were to look at on chain exactly how many people are actually holding bitcoins in their wallet currently there's only 23.4 million holders one chain and if you count the exchanges there's 101 million um active unique accounts um so if you look at paypal it's almost five times that it's 487 million so you know there's this absolute um unlock to the mainstream market here to access bitcoin uh way in excess of what we currently have in numbers before that news broke you had been tweeting a bit about how bitcoin's price behaviors have been changing one of your tweets showed a chart of coin dormancy against the bitcoin price and you tweeted dormancy is a measure of old hands selling out it's interesting to see old hands reliably sold tops until this present cycle they sold the bitcoin bottom at three three thousand four thousand dollars they are selling right now so when you say this this present cycle what time period are you talking about and why do you think the behavioral behavior of all chance is changing yeah this this is the current cycle bitcoin cycles every four years because they're happening that's kind of the impulse of um of uh supply reduction and so we get into these four year macro cycles and this particular cycle is interesting in that uh we had the first um derivative exchanges with the likes of bitmex are introduced in the tail end of 2017 and with the crazy leverages these guys can do on these exchanges they um they have dominated the volume on against um you know the the organic spot markets where people would normally come in and buy their coins and move them off into their wallets so when you've got this outlier volume um on derivative markets where traders come in and trade against each other they play a whole lot of strategic games you know defensive lines i i liken it to playing a game of gridiron where you're going for yards and you're trying to push the other side over and then they back trace and so we're in this era of derivative dominance where it's trader games so you'll see that if you look at the chart of bitcoin um we had this very nice organic um movements in price that was very reflective of fundamentals of investors coming in and since 2017 the italian of 2017 really coming into 2018 and until now we've had uh a crazy whip saw in the price action it's like you can see it the 6 000 sort of band that we had in 2018 and then it plummeted down to 3 000 that was all trader games on on uh derivative exchanges and so what i think's happening is that the old hand whales the ogs that brought into bitcoin way back when and they're obviously highly capitalized and they've always been other cell tops they are not currently equipped to play these very sophisticated um trader games that are happening on tourism exchanges and so they're not selling the tops they're selling the bottoms right now and so i don't fully understand you know when you talk about this kind of game what is it you know just from a toddler perspective it should be you know something straightforward you buy low you sell when it's high so what is going on exactly that's keeping them from being able to do that you know there's obviously as a hodley you're going to organically buy and hold for a long term sort of hold but if you're on these derivative exchanges all you're doing is making bets long or short the prices go one way or the other and if i'm correct i make a lot of money and so what actually happens is that if you see for example um the general market the general traders which are the unsophisticated traders they may be going long and so if you're the the winner um you're the whale on top of the exchanges and the winners tend to be one percent of the market uh according to bitnext 99 lose you are the guy with tens of millions of dollars of what we call ammo um to be able to push the market one way so for example if everyone's going long and i'm that one percent well i'm going to short it and i'm going to sell and i'm going to sell i'm going to sell i may even sell on spot exchanges to to push the price down and i'm trying to push the price down below the defensive line of people going long because if you're going long you're betting on it going up but you do have this um lined in the sand where if you're wrong you're either liquidated or you have a stop loss where you're going to sell out both both cases you're going to sell out so what the whales do is they they counter trade you they push the price below your defensive line and at that point you have to sell in and then suddenly the price plummets and then um they'll scoop up at the bottom and they win and so you know that happens whether you're long or short the the 99 will lose and this is a terrific you know casino game with with very very smart sophisticated players um that have now entered bitcoin and it is completely breaking havoc with the organic price of bitcoin and so you were saying so when when did you start seeing this happen because you know from your tweet it seemed that you were saying that before this cycle old hands would reliably sell the top so um you know when when did this period begin and you know is it simply the fact that there was not a way for these whales to use this leverage in this way before okay so um that makes that italian 2017 i think it gained significant volume by the tail end of the early start of 2018 and so that created the vehicle and i'm not saying these whales onto the exchanges are our og whales that bought you know when bitcoin was one dollar or ten dollars these guys are very sophisticated players they probably come from wall street um they know how to trade on margin which is everything that's happening in traditional wall street finance so it's a different game it's a different game and we've been in this era since 2018 it's been two years the interesting thing now is with the likes of uh microstrategy and the cohort of um ceos and board of directors offices of companies that are now currently scooping up coins and putting them into their own wallets corporate wallets personal wallets that we're staying to get a swing back into the organicness where spot volumes the organic buying and holding volumes are now starting to come back against this derivative game and also we've got the cftc starting to regulate the unregulated derivative exchanges like bitnext so we'll see pressure there uh and the yeah i think this is a very short era of two to three years and we'll come back to an organic like price discovery of bitcoin in a moment we'll discuss how this should impact the way the price in bitcoin changes but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per year on your btc download the krypto.com app now to see

yours now in the crypto.com app back to my conversation with willy woo so as you were discussing you feel like with the i don't know if the uh how to describe it whether it's like the power or the balance of i guess where the market is determining the price you feel like that that's swinging back to the spot market so what effect do you think that will have on price moves in bitcoin so we'll see less exaggerated price moves um and like yes it'll yeah essentially it'll be less exaggerated um i i think a lot of people are losing money because they're getting freaked out by these very large whip soil prices and so ultimately what happens is that we'll start to lower volatility um you know i did a study a long time ago maybe 2017 showing that bitcoin was on track to be the match the volatility of the most volatile fiat currencies like the new zealand dollar us dollar pair and that was completely wrong because these derivative exchanges came in it would sought the price and volatility went to the moon and so volatility will reduce and that will encourage um um of the the organic investors to come in um obviously as volatility reduces the risk starts to reduce and obviously bitcoin is an outside sort of outlier gainer it's like a startup that's accumulating on its adoption s-curve and so what scares people is the crazy whip saw of volatility and that was exaggerated by these sort of derivative games and so the risk starts to drop for um investors and you mentioned that you feel like you've been seeing the purchase of bitcoin by these big corporate treasuries like microstrategy and square how are you discerning that okay so uh it's it's very hard to track and the best i have right now is that if you look back in the history of all prior bull runs you'll see the sort of dip in the the stock the bitcoin stocks the speculative stock that's sitting on spot exchanges and so um that is a sign of new hodlers coming in and buying those bitcoins and moving it off to cold storage and hotline and so that's a very consistent pattern we saw in 2016 before the moon run of 2017 we saw it in the 3000 4000 bottom of 2019 and currently we are seeing the mother of all um scoop ups off these spot exchanges and moving into cold storage it's never been this long it's never been this amount um it's currently nine months and it's still being scooped up and i just see a little dip right now meaning uh post um post paypal there's a whole lot of people buying and moving it off to hodling so um and then put that in perspective that's um a quarter of a million bitcoins moved out um probably they paid around two billion dollars for it so two billion dollars of money has come in buying those coins so yeah that's what i'm seeing that's that's um what's driving this current um bullish activity and it's only just begun and how are these different shifts in the market affecting the business of various infrastructure players uh yeah that's an interesting question it's like uh you know i'm an investor in a few um infrastructure players and um obviously i get information um of the the attraction and what's been very interesting for me is that months and months and months ago we're already at all-time high of user activity new users coming on board higher than the 2017 december top and so the activity that's going on underlying um this industry is at already all-time highs when the coin was valued at 20 000 so obviously that's a crazy fundamental bullish um signal so recently you've been tweeting about how much the bitcoin price moves for every dollar invested and i wondered how do you calculate that and then based on that what would you project for the price of bitcoin over the next year okay so uh coin metrics was um very well known for doing this metric called realize price and um it's realized cap you can map it back to price essentially what it is is looking into um the blockchain and seeing when um toddlers bought their coins figuring out what they paid for it and then you can figure out what the market paid for their coins and i think that's roughly in the 67 000 zone right now um and so you can track what people have actually put into bitcoin through that metric um and then you can also track the um actual um valuation of bitcoin's market cap so between the two capitalizations and you can see that the change in in capital coming in versus the change in market cap growth through these two metrics and obviously the ratio of dollar go up per dollar invested and that that's sitting currently very roughly estimated there's areas in it but it's 3.5 to 1 and it's and the interesting thing about it is that it is ramping upwards all prior bull markets was very static this time the dollar in four dollar increase is climbing and what that means is the reflexivity is increasing and that's just a big fancy term for as price goes up the hodlers hold on tighter they don't want to sell it's the first time we've seen that and in terms of what that means is that um if bitcoin needs to be a one trillion dollar market cap um macro asset bucket all macro asset buckets are valued in the trillions of dollars we need roughly um 200 billion dollars of influx of capital to push us there and that's roughly 50 000 um for bitcoin huh okay like by what a year from now or it doesn't make any predictions on a price target it just says this is how much money that needs to come in um and okay right it's just based on when we see that amount of money come in that's right and we've already seen at a very minimum um two billion dollars scooped up off the exchanges uh we have five trillion dollars in corporate treasuries that are sitting in cash needing to hedge from inflation and money printing we have 8.5 trillion to 9 trillion dollars in sovereign wealth funds that are needing access to bitcoin just to have an optimal portfolio so and i believe this is the cycle where the very first sovereign rail funds will come into bitcoin um they've been researching this for well over a year i know what makes you say that and when you say this cycle you mean what the for the over the next three years or yeah so this cycle started um you know the bitcoin top happened in um december 2017 and the cycles are four year cycles so that means that 2017 plus four years is 2021 2022 within that time ban we can expect this to happen and what makes you say that you believe that sovereign wealth funds will start getting into bitcoin in this time period just conversations within the industry all right well we'll see um how this plays out um before we go i wanted to also ask about uh bitcoin's nvt ratio which is the network value to transaction ratio because you're pretty well known for frequently analyzing that and i wondered if you could first of all explain a little bit more about what that is and then um talk a little bit about a recent tweet you made that bitcoin's price was at an nvt ratio equivalent to the white swan price bottom from black thursday during the initial part of the pandemic and i just wondered with paypal's news this week if that has changed or if you also feel like now it's um still a good time to buy yeah okay so um obviously it's a it's extremely great time to buy [Music] so mvt was the first um on-chain signal where you could say buy here salvia um and so essentially the easy way to understand it is the price it's the equivalent of the price earnings ratio for bitcoin in a company you have stock price you have earnings in bitcoin it's a store value asset like gold you do not have earnings but we do have is underlying invest activity like new investors coming out and there's a constant churn and the higher you see that churn the higher the velocity of this bitcoins moving to new investors uh the more fundamental activity in the network so it's a ratio of them the valuation the market cap to that that that activity and that creates this price earnings ratio for bitcoin and um what you want to see obviously is you want this p e ratio nvt to drop low if it drops low it means there's incredible amounts of investor activity that is not yet reflected in the price and so mvt ratio um it it plummeted into a buy zone in the covered white swan crash i think most of that was derivative traders getting wrecked and it pushed the price down there was not much activity on chain between hoddlers selling out and it was the perfect time to buy if you wanted more exposure to bitcoin and currently the amount of activity going on in the blockchain of new investors coming in is through the roof and it's pushed that ratio back down into that zone where you know it was a grossly undervalued for um only a few days during the crash and now we're in the same zone but it's driven by incredible amounts of organic buying investor activity that's not yet reflected in the price and we're only seeing more activity now with the the the paypal um announcement and um a lot new people not a lot new more people coming in i'm actually seeing this on the matrix right now there's a lot of new participants coming in so um yeah just it's it's it's perfectly a great time to buy if you're in it for the you know the year or multi-year period okay one last question you mostly cover bitcoin and have said that you don't cover ether because you don't consider it as investible but i wanted to ask what you thought of what ether would become whether it would become more investable with staking coming on with ethereum 2.0 and also the potential adoption of ethereum improvement proposal 1559 which would entail the burning of transaction fees okay so i'm not saying it's not investable i'm just saying that it's got a very very short back trace of of its performance and in risk adjusted returns [Music] the theorem is more risky but it's higher returns and risk adjusted returns it slightly underperforms bitcoin um therefore i think it's fine if you want to do like a macro hold in bull cycles you swing into ethereum you get the outside outsized returns and then you're going to expect some outsize losses in the bear market so i think it's perfectly fine for that even if you want to hold multi-cycles that's fine as well because it performs roughly like bitcoin but it's very untested it's the back trace is ridiculously small compared to the length of bitcoin that's been over 12 years i think is it 12 years now yeah almost 12 years for bitcoin ethereum's very new and we barely have one full cycle four-year cycle analyzing that in terms of ethereum two the problem with ethereum two is that it's sharded and so each one of those shards has not got an idea of what's happening on the other shard and in terms of plain english what that means is ethereum one this entire d5 space that is exploding based on um financial apps and decentralized exchanges they're all interoperable i can go to one site and trade one erc20 for another i can get tokens from that from the liquidity pool i can go to another app and i can um lock that in so there's a very interesting experimentation going on and and it's it's like a network effect that's building between different apps ethereum two suffers from this because the shard spaces you get scalability but you can't have these apps interoperable between each other so i feel that that's a significant problem and we've got other um you know networks that are coming up like celana we've got particularly radix i'm excited about in that it's scalable also but you can build the um the interoperability between these apps um so i think there's going to be stronger competition for ethereum two i think ethereum one will continue to do well um because it's got that store of value um narrate narrative that you know that's building that's building it's not hard money as much as bitcoin but that is building ethereum two is a little bit less tested you do have the staking coming on of talking to a friend founder of steakhound which provides liquidity for people who are staking he's estimating maybe you'll get a 10 return by putting that into ethereum and locking it up which is not to be um you know underrated but i think there may be you know 10 percent it might be out performed by other um other networks um what was the final question around the then oh it's just about the ethereum improves improvement proposal 1559 in which some of the transaction fees would be burned potentially making it deflationary yeah that's uh that's um that's taking a book from the latest learning so yeah that that helps a lot for sure um that's that's proven that's what we've learned from other tokens where you burn and reduce supply so in that regard it's bullish in terms of its utility and people needing to be on it um i think it has some problems and it it's yet to be seen so um let's see what happens all right great well i've really enjoyed talking with you thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed that's awesome being fun reconnecting laura yes don't forget next up is the weekly news [Music] recap thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline crypto to come to paypal bitcoin bounces paypal announced wednesday that it would add support for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the first half of 2021. the company plans to let its 346 million customers purchase and store the virtual currencies in its online wallet and use bitcoin ether litecoin and bitcoin cash for purchases at its 26 million merchants paypal also plans to expand support for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to venmo in the first half of 2021. for the time being paypal will not give users access to private keys or the ability to transfer their crypto to other accounts on or off the platform this decision was met with expected criticism from the crypto community however cinema ventures partner adam cochran it speculates that paypal chose to do this because quote right now they want to profit on spread and need to get robust aml in place for transfers my personal guess is that they also need to get the proper fraud protections in place so they don't get eaten alive by fraudsters stealing bitcoins from their platform the bloc's ryan todd notes that paypal operates in many jurisdictions that are not crypto friendly and so this move could force tax regulators to consider de minimis tax exemption exemptions for paying with crypto reading between the lines of the investor relations release in which the company mentions working with central banks and exploring other use cases todd also speculates that this is the first step of a larger plan to expand in essential bank digital currencies and stable coins after the paypal news the price of bitcoin saw a substantial rebound to thirteen thousand dollars as of press time on cnbc thursday morning billionaire hedge fund manager paul teeter-jones who made news earlier this year when he invested in bitcoin compared investing in btc to putting early money behind tech companies like apple or google he said quote bitcoin has this enormous contention of really really smart and sophisticated people who really believe in it i've never had an inflation hedge where you have a kicker but you also have great intellectual capital behind it when you short the bond market that's your inflation hedge you're really betting on the fallacy of mankind rather than its ingenuity and entrepreneurialism so i like bitcoin even more now than i did back then jones said next headline are filecoin miners on strike several major filecoin miners have halted or reduced their mining power since the network's main net launch last week the blame for the slowdown is filecoin's current economic incentive model which many miners feel is not in their favor because it does not give block rewards to miners immediately but instead vests over 180 days most of the top 10 minor ids have significantly reduced the amount of storage power they've contributed during the test net a major file coin miner lee bai rejected the idea that the reduced mining power was an organized collective strike saying quote it's not a strike it's just a better strategy given the current economics with more potential cell pressure when there's no adequate circulating fil at a steady price range it's not lucrative to pledge a spot fil for a future fil whose price could be lower in a twitter thread monday protocol labs founder and ceo juan benay called the miner strike nonsense he said quote in the last two weeks we the devs recommended to many miners to slow down growth rate to match their token flow or pause until they can afford to grow steadily he continued there are many people hoping to get rich quick with filecoin without contributing value to the network that's just not how this works this isn't what the protocol rewards we already have huge capacity and don't need much more yet the network must now focus on making that capacity useful by storing valuable data for users next headline fed chair powell continues to ponder a digital dollar federal reserve chairman jerome powell said during a panel discussion hosted by the international monetary fund on monday that the us continues to evaluate central bank digital currencies powell said a cbdc might improve the broader

were regarding criminal activity with a vast majority from u.s regulators of those the fbi made up 30 of such inquiries homeland security investigations comprised 17 and state and local regulators accounted for 16 next headline dc digital currency groups state of crypto 2020 digital currency group's annual state of crypto report which polled the founders and ceos of its 150 portfolio companies paints a picture of an outperforming industry amidst the covet 19 pandemic and resulting economic shock waves 2020 has seen bitcoin volatility nearing all-time lows in the last half of the year as signs of a global economic slowdown have exacerbated local currency devaluation fears in emerging markets while one in five executives cited remote work and operational interruptions due to covet as a primary challenge faced in 2020 one in four also felt that a global recession would have the greatest impact on digital currency adoption as for the greatest risk to the industry 51 cited compliance and regulation as an impediment to sustainable growth respondents cited the rise of d5 as the most bullish development of 2020. those interviewed seemed unconcerned with the ebbs and flows of token prices noting overall protocol development and business growth as boding well for the industry's future they also contrasted the defy surge with the ico bubble of 2017 noting that talent and professionalism are more productive and ethical than before as for whether ethereum would remain the chain of choice for d5 response was split with 51 of respondents saying yes and the rest saying they were unsure or no next headline defy audit firms are overwhelmed with requests given the numerous exploits and unaudited d5 contracts so far this year it's perhaps no surprise that audit firms have been swamped with requests from d5 projects the demand has been strong despite a swift pullback in the d5 markets with most tokens falling 19 in the last month firms such as open zeppelin have said that they've booked clients well into 2021 with quote governance tokens token clones of varying quality making up much of the requests audit firm kwan stamp which disclosure has been a sponsor of
