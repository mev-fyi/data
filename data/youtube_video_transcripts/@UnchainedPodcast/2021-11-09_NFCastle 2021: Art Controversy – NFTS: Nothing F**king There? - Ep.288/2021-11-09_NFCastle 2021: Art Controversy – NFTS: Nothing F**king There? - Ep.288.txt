[Music] i all before we begin just a quick reminder that if you want to pre-order my book the cryptopians idealism greed lies in the making of the first big cryptocurrency craze you can do so at bentley cryptopians that's bit.ly c-r-y-p-t-o-p-i-a-n-s and second today's episode is a really fun and controversial panel that i moderated at nf castle put on by the czech noble family the lobkovitz family at their palace in prague castle this panel was called art controversy nfts nothing effing there the speakers were maria paula fernandez co-founder at jpg kavita gupta co-founder of fintech tv oliver helsman rosenberg an artist and g-money nft collector this discussion is definitely one to remember given the surprising and sometimes even shocking stances of some of the panelists and as i mentioned last week i am excited to tell you more about the lopkovitz family and why they've turned to nfts in a future episode but for now enjoy this super fun discussion from nf castle buy earn and

dot io unchained to start earning nodal cash all right well this is going to be a really fun panel because as we all know since nft's burst onto the scene they've been doing uh pretty much nothing but creating a lot of controversies and there's a lot to cover um why don't we just do a quick spin around the panel so everyone uh can make their introductions should i go first yeah go ahead maybe okay um so i am maria paula i've been in the blockchain space for a while i got to know nfts in 2018 where i brought i also bought my first ones and i didn't think it was a big deal but i was super interested because i'm interested in culture and it sort of solved the problem with provenance in the art world then i continued researching about them i published two papers i am still working a blockchain infrastructure i serve at the board at golem so i didn't think this could have become a business until this year where nft started booming and i started my own business that's called jpeg um or jpg but we pronounced the jpeg as you know web3 natives and yeah it's a curation protocol so super excited to be here thank you everyone for having me yeah thank you laura hi my name is kavita gupta um i started my journey in crypto back in 2013 but i think ethereum is what made me realize a lot of excitement in the space uh for nfts uh i was very fortunate uh which feels now to be a part of the first ever standard paper back in end of 2017 early 2018 which a lot of people actually a lot of people over here would know the first time when we did the standard paper we got bashed by half of the crypto community so because the most of the people felt like how the asset collateralization is going to work on it but i'm very very excited to see how nft has come up in the space we also did one of the first checks into the top nft companies today with openc dapolab dada soreir etc and now i recently launched my own early stage venture fund delta blockchain okay thank you laura and thank you to uh william jr for inviting me here to be with you all uh my name is oliver halsmann rosenberg so i'm a gemini i have like multiple personalities so i'm an artist and i'm an estate manager and i'm a tech startup founder and i can talk about all those projects extensively but i've been doing art and technology since 2000 and for 2005 doing interactive pieces with communities using pre laptops set up in streets in cities and we would ask people to come to the laptop and we draw their dreams and wishes live for them so i've always been like engaging in what art and technology can be and also from like a philosophical sense i write papers about you know consciousness and the metaverse and quantum physics and spirituality and identity so i'm just approaching this space from from so many different angles and also as an nft artist myself i started making nfts like a year ago so lots to say about all this and i'm g money i'm a collector in the space uh investor i currently run in vc infrastructure fund with delphi digital and uh just an all-around nft advocate okay and so for those watching in the live stream also gmoney asked not to be on video so if you are just hearing a voice coming out of nowhere that is who is speaking all right so let's just start with a super basic question and this one has sparked a lot of conversation pretty much throughout the life existence of nfts but what are nfts are they actually valuable cultural objects or are they just a new vehicle for speculation oh yeah expound on that i mean why not so but but like do you think that nfts will retain their value like all you know because right now in ether rock or not right now but as of like a month ago which by the way if you don't know what an ether rock is it's basically a clip art of a rock and they're different colors i guess but it's just clip art and the cheapest one as of a month ago was going for a little over three million dollars so um you know i don't know what you want to say about do you really think that an ether rock is still going to be worth 3 million or more in the future i didn't say that um i just think that people are actually you know like we are talking about a new universe you know you however you want to call it metaverse or any other less cringe sort of denomination we're talking about you know a future where people are deciding their own mediums of exchange and within these mediums of exchange nfts have happened to be you know the prime and most covetable asset and it happened with spices before maybe cardamom was hot back then and then you know people decided to adopt cardamom and paid shitloads of money for cardamom and it didn't have to make sense it was about you know the value that people gave to the spice or to the rock or to the punk so you know and obviously because that is culture you know exchange exchanging stuff between people and creating economies it's part of the culture and growth culture i as well at the same time so why not both things you know um i would say uh exactly what paula actually tried to say is uh the value is defined by the market right even for a currency a gold or platinum it is supply and demand and it is what do you really like but i think nft overall for me get divided into two categories one is play and earn and the other one is collectible now play and earn is completely going to be driven by gaming and metaverse industry more than just speculation when it comes to collectible i think demand is speculation why is picasso much more important than 10 other artists right somebody came and decided this is way more valuable than anybody else and this is going to be uh the base price for it and i think for eth rock uh i have been actually waiting to see if eth rock value going to go down but the more people in nft comes in looks like that art still has way more value uh then a lot of new interesting metaverse project coming out so i don't see at least uh for one or two more crypto winters for the ether prices to go down laura well but you know i find it interesting what you said about the picassos because i feel like the view is that there's something kind of inherently valuable in a picasso and the italian the talent of that person that created that cultural object in a way that i don't think you could really attribute to ether rock so yeah i mean so here we have an actual artist and then right next to a collector so i'm curious to hear yeah i i'm gonna give you an artistic answer um which is i i'm gonna zoom out a little bit and look at nfts more like a means of communication we're living in a new like mythological age and i see it's it's the myth of decentralization that's happening and like the nfts are like the medium of distribution of this idea and this concept if you look back through the history of culture mankind has always been using art to communicate something and and art has been married to technology through from cave painters or you know in the last co caves figuring out how to get palm prints to stick for 60 000 years or whether it's you know sculptors or the pottery wheel and just the advancement of the different tools uh to create like permanence to a permanent record of something so you know no matter what the content of the nft is itself it points back to the blockchain and what is the blockchain it's this decentralized david versus goliath like mythological time period that we're living in now and i think we can get into the nitty-gritty about like which art is doing what with what technology but like the zoomed out view i think nfts are you look at the homer's odyssey or gilgamesh's um or even even the bhagavad-gita like these are like chanted songs that are like repeated through repetition and like all these transaction on the blockchain and the repetitions and the minting of multiples it's all like it's all reinforcing this concept of like the blockchain and as like this new form of communication that we have as a culture to communicate with each other so the art is just like one example now of what it is and i think it's fascinating and i'm so excited by it but i also think there's like a much larger narrative happening that we're all participating in whether we realize it or not and actually but before we turn to gmoney i do want to ask you though because you were saying when we did the prep for this panel something that is nowhere near as kind of high fluent as what you just said which is you were like oh i got this grant to do nft's on polygon which for those of you who don't know is a side chain on ethereum where essentially the fees are just so much cheaper so it's like much much cheaper to mint nfts and you told me that collectors said that they weren't going to be interested because it wasn't on ethereum itself and so to me that says something about just how nfts really are more about status right because it's showing if that's what they're interested in then essentially they're trying to say oh we have the money to buy nfts are in ethereum where the fees are high am i wrong like what's your interpretation of and can i just quickly add which i added during that time that i was so hurt because we are early investor in polygon and you don't think polygon is cool no no i i love polygon and i think we'll get to this later and i know you have a lot to say on the like status flexing but like just to wrap up the polygon the polygon part like i think okay for the green aspect on blockchain like it's smart to like find a low-cost transactional environmental environmental friendly alternative to ethereum but i also realize that by by making a theory because the gas fees are so expensive for ethereum it keeps a certain level of market entry you know not everyone can enter into the market so because polygon is so inexpensive people are getting spammed airdrop polygons so that's why there was a disdain against it not because of the technology at all like i think it's a great technology i think they're going to be around and maybe not so much in the art space but as a blockchain layer 2 protocol like for sure polygon are like a great alternative but i know you have a lot to say on ethereum yeah so um i guess one thing as a collector the reason why i prefer ethereum over other chains is just because the provenance of it right um so much stuff has already been on there besides just nfts right it's a very secure protocol why wouldn't i want my art to be on the most secure protocol out of anything out there that i collect and i do think that there is um there is status in art right whether whether the art world cares to admit it or not you know if you're spending 100 200 million dollars on a painting it's not necessarily because it's the best painting of that period it's because there's a story behind it it means something to you and your counterparts and you're trying to show that off right so uh nfts if nfts are about flexing they're about flexing just as much as the contemporary art world is as far as i'm concerned yeah well i wanted to ask you about this really funny tweet that you tweeted so basically um crypto punks were originally on ethereum but when they showed up on solana there was an investment group that tweeted about how it spent a quarter of a million dollars on one of these rare punks but was it but was on solana and you tweeted back at them imagine going to chinatown to buy a fake chanel bag and then tweeting about it so tell us what you were thinking when you tweeted that well you know like i personally as a crypto punk holder uh i loved it because any any other like you don't go and buy fake products of something that is not valuable right so if you're willing to spend money on a fake version of something that means the real version is worth a lot right so anytime uh somebody will do a copycat project like they do on a bunch of all these other side chains where you see all these crypto punk uh projects pop up uh it just reinforces the crypto punk meme right it makes crypto punks that much more valuable because you have people telling that narrative uh but like i just think it's funny because it's like if you wanna if you think that that will be the story behind crypto punks isn't necessarily that they're these cool like 8-bit digital pictures it's the story behind it you know the community that performed naturally around it the the group of people that you know like i'll admit like when i first found punks i thought they were ugly right and now like i look at like the punks that i own i'm like oh that's that's a beautiful punk like i really like that one right it's like they like there's like this really like intricate community that is really involved with it so when you're sitting there and you're buying like a knockoff and then bragging about it like i just think that's that's really funny because like people like i said if somebody buys a fake bag or fake something like they don't brag about it they try to hide the fact that it's a fake but isn't that a little bit against maybe the democratizing uh ideal of blockchain like that's why everybody everybody likes to claim that that's you know one of the reasons that they got into this and so if you're just trying to keep things rare and like only first in group like how do you kind of uh yeah but i mean that's that that's the nature of the project right like they made 10 000 of them and they weren't gonna make any more right like it's that's just that was the concept of of the whole project itself right they they didn't say they weren't like oh we're going to make 10 000 and like we'll keep on releasing more over time like nouns is a great example right like they make one every day in perpetuity right and that's like that's the rules of the that's the rules of that game right and so it's like when you sign up for the game or you sign up for the project to be a collector like these are the rules if tomorrow larva labs announced that they were making ten thousand more crypto punks like i'm sure the market would tank for for crypto box but i think i want to add to uh another layer to it isn't it also about the provenance like the ownership rights and the ip rights associated with it so if i created something and i am the creator or the owner of it and then some new chain comes in tomorrow and just copy paste it without having me or my dao associated with it how is that even blockchain world legal i mean why are we talking about intellectual property when we are actually building on the base of crypt of cyberpunk's ideas where intellectual property and is not gonna be a thing i don't think that's actually the right way to see crypto punks i do appreciate a lot you know the initial crypto punks and it's about and uh you know he has said it so well it's about the community that's around them it's about you know the fact that they were the first ones and taking a little bit more into you know the philosophical sort of realm um there was this guy a long time ago uh his name was walter benjamin he created he wrote a book that was an essay story that was called the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction and basically what it proposes is that an artwork can be reproduced infinitely but uh the original piece retains the aura and the more it's reproduced the more the aura is diluted so that's the way that i see crypto punks versus binance punks or solana punks or you know whatever chain punks you know the original crypto funds have that aura have that community you can't take that away from them you know the others like intellectual property or not they can change it a little bit and it's not gonna be intellectual property anymore but no no i wasn't talking about intellectual property i think it's more about the ownership rights on nft like the whole idea of nft but what does the ownership actually on nfcs give you i mean that's why i was going uh to that the whole idea of the nft if you read the original standard paper all the whole ownership rights or the provenance right is between the creator how many pieces you are doing and then using the blockchain the idea of putting it onto blockchain is to basically having that whole ownership chain built on there so that tomorrow uh if you have a really really like one of the rocks which is now a very expensive piece you can have you can know whether this is an original one or this is the fake one you can still create a fake one we're talking about fake ones you know they not only have the that provenance but they they also don't have the community and everything associated so there's two parts of the whole thing of course there's the ownership part that's you know public publicly on record forever uh all the attributes of the blockchain you want to give them but there's also the erratic sort of permanence of the actual you want to say something yeah i just think the zoomed out view is that there's a lot of new people in the space that don't know that the original punks were on ethereum and they're just like oh that's the thing to get oh it's on solana like they don't real so there are people behind these launches that are taking advantage of newcomers into the space and it's not unique to crypto punks it happens in mecca verse and all whatever project even with the board board api club there's you know so what it is is there people that are taking advantage of newcomers in the space and because not taking advantage it's giving them the ability to purchase whatever they want and give them the subjective value but if you buy uh you know a board ape on solana that doesn't come with the ip that the board will they sleep at night like will they be like i think they will be happy you know they just have a neighborhood the owner if you if you have the ownership of an nft and you get the ip rights as the owner and then someone just minced the same thing on a different chain then that new buyer is going to think that they have the iep that creates confusion right that's all how do you know you have a fake currency till actually somebody doesn't come and prove it but if that currency is still getting accepted and has a community behind it it's a currency let's take it to the time where you couldn't afford designer bags but you really wanted sort of like the vive around it and you bought the fake design i had no problem okay that's what i could afford well you know like some people would buy the fake designer bugs and you know pretend they were that because it's it's a little bit of a larp as well you know and this world is about you know flexing wells and you know pretending things there's so many people out there like in crazy places like san jose or elsewhere pretending they have money and you know having groups of things is actually you know more pretending and that's their whole existence so we shouldn't really judge them you know no i think what oliver is getting at though is the fact that you have people it's almost like when you fork a project right and like the the fork isn't as it's trying to take advantage of the same meme that the original project have and so somebody that doesn't know any better is buying in thinking hey i'm buying a crypto punk right it's a cheaper version of crypto buck but it's not a crypto buck right but i understand what you're saying in the sense that the provenance is on chain right like to me provenance is key right like we're moving towards a world that code is law right at some point there won't be ip law that that gets uh handled in legal courts down the future and we're like setting the road for that but like we're not there yet right but like right now if i'm coming into the space i'm like okay i can buy a crypto punk for a thousand bucks you're not buying a crypto punk like you're you're getting scammed right like you're our job to protect people you know this right but then at some point then at some point what you're you're inviting for regulators to come into the space and say hey now we have to have hard consumer protection laws if we can't if we can't regulate the space ourselves well clearly if regulators can't actually you know figure out anything about our space i don't expect them to figure out the difference between that doesn't mean they're not going to try again that's your first controversy laura congratulations this is the perfect segue because i was going to ask next about rug pulls and there's been so many rug pulls in nfts as well and i mean you just said that like it's not your job to protect people but i mean some of the stuff is like really you know pretty i mean terrible you know promising like yeah so yeah i can't remember what was iconics where they proposed oh we're going to do this like 3d thing and then people just got emojis i mean it's like terrible or the one where they sold and then like five dollar t-shirt for for but there was another one where they literally um swapped the file and they it was photos of rugs which is like terrible they did that i mean it's like it's awful like it's really a conceptual piece to me so so you think that like that should be allowed like um raise your hands if you have never been rackballed in your whole crypto life if you're a crypto native you have never been ratballed no okay i'm proud of you i have um and i've been in crypto for almost four years working five years working and i had to make mistakes and that's how you learn as well you know in the real world also you know no one's going to protect you you know like banks will say that they're going to protect you but then in the end they're going to be the ones that they're going to screw you the most so really like if you don't build your own thick skin who'll do it for you and so and what do what the rest of you think like should there be no protections for red poles and like i don't know it's self-regulatory i think it's it's a fact of life right they're going to be rugbles here it happens but what i mean we can try to stop that as much as we possibly can or try to educate people uh as much as we possibly can right like not you don't not everybody needs to learn the same lesson the hard way right like if and this is you know when people get hacked they always share the story of how they end up getting hacked so more people don't get hacked right like it's it's a sad fact that there will be rug pulls but like what can we do as a community to make that better over time i i think it's a combination of both right of course there are going to be fake projects there are going to be projects which even after being fake gonna get a lot of reputation for one or the other reason gonna have big community but i've seen different behaviors from this community which has sometimes pleasantly surprised me and sometimes like maybe that's the way um i think there was a project which one of my friend who's in the audience actually was telling me about that somebody took an open source code from one of the nft project copy pasted it 90 of it and created a whole dao and an nft project around it but when the original artist actually realized he complained and the dao for the second project made the founder to share 50 revenue with the first founder you know so they and it's like three weeks back actually when it happened so i think there are going to be more and more dao oriented sort of like uh legal supervision which is going to happen which is amazing because that's the core of the decentralized crypto world but there are also going to be issues which thou will not be capable or informative enough to be able to do it and i do feel like the more regulation gonna come into the space the more ownership rights we're gonna uh really value uh this is gonna get better but i also uh funnily do agree with you that uh when we're gonna have projects which are gonna be copy of something or 20 copy of something uh i think at the end of the day they are your expression if you don't call exactly the same like if there is uh some silver change in crypto punk and you call it crypto silver it's a new project but then at least you are not comparing it to the original like and then i won't judge them i promise no for sure but also what you said about you know dao's coming into the scene and deciding what's right and what's wrong in the context of you know a dao being sufficiently decentralized and not just like an elite club which is really important i think that's actually the key you know if we can create dows that are sufficiently decentralized and able to make their own decisions and do the social condemnation for the users that are getting scammed or or are just dumb or they just want to flex then that's actually you know a really pretty decent world yeah but as an artist what do you think thank you um you know look they're they're fakes they're fake paintings in the art world i just saw a netflix documentary about this gallery that had to close in new york because of all the fakes that they were selling you know dyor it's a big acronym in the crypto space do your own research it's a rite of passage i think you know talking about the like zoomed out mythological thing you know okay you get burned and you learn and everyone's in the discords and everyone's sharing like hey watch out for this oh yeah that like mecha verse did a fake like pre-launch page and if you connected your meta mask it like pulls everything out or like don't open that you know if anyone gets air drop this token don't open it because it has some malicious code that like empties your wallet out so there's there's just a lot of it's a very open space i think that's the beauty of of the whole crypto nft world is that it is a lot about community and you know and then people get exiled and if they get doxxed for being behind a project they did a rug pull it's like game over you know so it's going to happen but that's part of life and wow this is definitely like the crypto anarchist panel like we don't have because i i don't know i feel like in crypto itself and in d5 there was a lot of talk about self-regulation and like i think there actually were a few different self-regulatory bodies that said they were going to set up and you guys are all like no people just you know tough luck for them if they get screwed but there's good things coming out of all of that you know when when uni swap got vampire attacked and then we all got rat pulled that was not fun um i was you know we were all part of you know the sushi farming crazy fever but then actually sushi reorganized understood you know that was and they they're actually a fully fledged business right now they have a fully operational decks miso is a you know a platform for auctions that's functioning um you know they had some obstacles as well but it's going really well they have onsen as well so you know good things can come out of all of that yum is another example you know founded by actually one of jpeg's co-founders um they didn't get root rag pool but there was like a main flaw in their code and you know huge mess happened but then yam reorganized uh based on the community that they had created and now it's also a fully fledged project so you know the thing that i believe from like you know and not from the crypto anarchy side but more from the like we are super flexible and also have temporary amnesia side is that you can create things out of almost nothing because there's so much going on in the space that yes there are rock pools but at the same time people tend to forget and then it that's time to build for you it's still time you can create your own things you can reborn projects there's a great capacity for redemption and for a accepta for acceptance of that redemption so yeah you know nothing is the end of the world in

things have happened and it still marches on but i do wonder you know there have been some other controversies like around kind of a form of what we would call insider trading but i don't know if that term applies because at least in the us it specifically applies to stocks but there was the head of product at openc who was um caught kind of like trying to uh profit from what he knew was going to be featured on the openc homepage and i'm just curious like you know uh what do you think are maybe some best practices that the community should adopt or should their is it just common sense or like you know um yeah what's your take on i mean obviously i'm i'm not a fan of it right like i think that that's an internal decision policy that needs to be made at openc and any of those marketplaces i'm i haven't really thought about it that much because i'm not an internal policy maker right like i think it sucks but i also know that like when i buy stuff um i try to do my own research especially now that i know my wallet gets tracked and people will see me mint something or buy something and buy it just because i'm buying it regardless of maybe i'm just buying it because i'm like oh like i like the art right like i just i think that this is cool like whether i think it's gonna make money or not irregardless uh but i know that i have to i have that responsibility to people because i'm a public figure in the space of people like tracking my wallet and i think that all these marketplaces and organizations need these founders need to make decisions being like okay well i know that this could be market moving information and we have to develop policies internally for it a lot of it comes down to ethics like you said it's not regulated so there's no necessarily breaking the law but you know it's ethically dubious at best right and it's like how do you want to be perceived by the community and you want them to trust you right because once especially as a marketplace if they if you lose that trust then people just won't want to transact on your platform and you're going to lose volume over time so you know like these are ethical decisions that need to be made but they do have long-term consequences to each business owner and but do you also one question is do you feel that this kind of thing makes nft's financial products and should they be regulated as such then you'd want to regulate i mean i think everything in the world is an nft so if you want to relate i mean it's true right like you're wearing a shirt i'm wearing a shirt if we were to exchange shirts we don't have the same value right so they're non-fungible wait well and right if we exchange the shirts they don't have the same value like yeah like you're wearing a shirt right now and i'm wearing a t-shirt right if we were to exchange our t-shirts right we don't necessarily have that the t-shirts themselves don't have okay yeah so we have different values of our t-shirts right so they're non-fungible right so the my thesis is that over time as the world becomes more digitized they will be coming on chain as non-fungible tokens right because everything in the world is non-fundable so if you want to regulate nfts you have to regulate pretty much every industry and commodity and product in the world wow um can i go back to your first question where we i think we talked about openc um i it is a very what i'm going to say is a very unpopular um like stand but i want to say in this particular case in just this particular case i don't think the individual did it knowingly when i think of insider trading coming from trading flow regulated background when you think of insider trading you think of insider trading it's something which you have planned through which you have done it with steps by talking to somebody like there is a whole process around it in my in my completely personal opinion uh i feel like this is someone who got super excited about a particular product bought it and then whether he knew it at that point of time or didn't know it at that point of time that this is about to go on the main page but this is actually going to increase his value or not to the extent but for 18 this is a very good learning lesson for the rest of the nft community it's not a big amount to be honest if i would tomorrow have to do insider trading i hope i'll do it at least four thousand eat but i hope i add some value but like for 18 whatever happen to the individual who is actually one of as as much as i know about him directly or indirectly a very very hard working individual that happened and unfortunately or whatever happened in that case but i believe that it did open the floodgate of talking about insider trading but then to the core of your question in if there is a value associated with any product whether you are buying a milk from the street whether you're buying a burger from a restaurant if you are paying anything to that there is a value associated with that there is also expectation of a fair game associated with that so of course you expect that fair game does it has to be regulated all the way to sec cftc level at this part when we are still figuring out what nfts are and what is actually going to be the future and potential of it i'm not hundred percent sure i think what hurts the most is that they were so dumb you know a good op sec would have so you think what he did was okay it's just no no no i think it did i think it's bad but what hurts the most is the bad upset um it's the same with the case that we had this uh this past week um you know everything traceable to ens addresses uh in a world where we know how to be anonymous how when when we don't want to be anonymous we also know that you know it's just as if you know they were you know they were naive enough i think you think i i think he's a smart enough guy right i personally really think he just really didn't think that it is going to be perceived as insider trading whether that was a smart move or not and i'm not trying to defend that people should do insider trading if this is an insider trading wait but so you know him personally is that what you're saying and you have i mean i know the guy it's not like i was with him when he was doing this is that how is that how he presented it to you i'm sorry is that how he spoke about it no no no but i think this is the way i see it knowing whatever i know limited about the guy first hand or secondhand that i don't think uh in this space if you are so such a crypto native and you want to do as she's saying some sort of a fraud first for 17 18 and secondly not even a single attempt to mask it whatsoever just doesn't even make sense in a practical space okay well you know this actually goes to another question that i was going to ask about which was about privacy i mean like what's your take like g money when you were saying that people are now following you like what uh do you have kind of like your own private other address that no one knows about or do you feel comfortable just no i i definitely have an unboxed wallet right because i also know that um you know like i said sometimes i just want to mess around and i think something like i want to miss something just because i think it's cool and whatever i don't think much of it um i will do something in there or if i want to trade something i'll do something in there but like um i'm very cognizant and i think this raises like a really interesting question of because things happen on chain and because things are on chain forever right like your ethics matter so much more in crypto than necessarily the law right because whether you know obviously at this point in time there's no laws regarding nfts and insider trading or whatever it is i think what was done was wrong i i know that if i was in that situation i wouldn't like there's no the way i see it is like there's no amount you have one reputation and there's no amount of money uh that will pay for that reputation but like i think that this is like an interesting part of the world that are of the movement that we're currently in where it's people realizing that like you have to hold yourself to like a higher an ethical standard right because people can view your actions on chain and that's what's going to matter in the long run whether it's illegal or legal in the court of the law okay so i also actually also wanted to ask a question for oliver just about creators because earlier today i was talking with will who was on willpapper who was on the previous panel the creator of adventure gold and he was saying that when he had some ideas on how to do more venture gold for additional communities that i mean he said some of this was probably unjust but people were sending him death threats and other people were like threatening that they were going to commit suicide and i mean that's kind of crazy and i was just curious like you know even when you talked about building on polygon like how do you think about like your um your responsibility to your community and and how you kind of either preserve value for them or you know um and and but then also as we talked about earlier pursue the democratizing ideals of blockchain technology right right so gosh there's a lot to talk about here um so let's talk about value let's talk about like we're all talking about like we're all here because pretty much that people sail right i mean let's get let's be honest about it everyone realized okay money you're like crypto nfts and then everybody wanted to jump on board so when i saw that i realized okay here's a big opportunity to create a a marketplace taking that energy and that excitement around nfts and teaming up artists with charities and doing like a charity marketplace and making that a dao so that we can like take this energy and still release like amazing art but that we're like supporting people on the ground doing the work because in 10 years if we're all have the you know genesis this or that nft and the world is like in climate crisis extreme like who cares about any of this right so there's an opportunity here to use this technology and all the like amazing aspects of it to help support what needs to really be happening outside of this like interest bubble and i think that will like essentially that will make more people support it when they see that it's actually reaching out it's not just enriching early investors but it's actually going out to support you know the rest of the planet in this moment and then i'm doing another project that's like um it's kind of like a surrealist game kind of similar to loot but also similar to like board apes with the ip where i'm just creating this this addition is called a perpetual epiphany galactic travel agency and i have all these assets that people can get from their like passports to luggage the suitcase and it's basically like a choose your own adventure thing but i'm i'm trying to give away these assets to the community so that they can then build and do something inspiring instead of just having like a profile picture from a project but it's like okay now you have like the passport and the luggage and like the boarding pass and this planet and this thing and all the artwork is like gan based it's all i'm very interested in like uh artificial intelligence stuff so i'm like in that project i'm trying to like give my creative work to the audience that they can then create something outside of me but then on the flip side of that um i manage my grandfather's photo archive and i have to be like very careful to not give up his ip and find like innovative ways to make nfts of his photographic work where i'm not selling it to someone who thinks that they have the ip so then my brain has to totally restructure and think okay i have these like physical objects like what can i do interesting with like this physical object you know how can i bring this into the metaverse so then i'm like very interested in like metaverse stuff so there's so many ways i think there's just so many opportunities we have outside of just putting an image like uploading a jpeg to these platforms and saying it's an nft and putting an edition number on it like it's such an innovative time and like i've just been nerding out on like file types on youtube because there's so many like interesting file types that like open c can't even necessarily allow you to upload so anyway we're just at an innovative time i do actually want to ask about this question about taking physical world objects and making nfts of them because obviously you know william here is trying to do something similar with uh you know the collection here but how do you do that in a way where like for instance g money would you feel comfortable at this moment in time that if you bought something like that that that would be secure and and you know that you wouldn't get rug pulled or you know like what are if i bought a physical asset linked to an nft i mean it it already it already exists there are like people and artists that have created like physical works that are linked to an nft people did his uh his everydays right like there was a physical part that was linked to an nft but they have since a lot of them have been broken apart um i think it's a really interesting case study we probably uh the tech probably needs to get a little bit better with regards to linking that physical in a tamper-proof way to the nft uh but i'm really excited about it i definitely think it's gonna happen actually it recently happened in india uh the the old uh the royal family of jaipur uh took some of the old pieces from the palace and then they did the nft but they actually gave the option with different price points that you could also have the physical piece basically transported to you which you can just keep it in the storage and only have the nft piece basically displayed or they can keep the elk they can keep uh the physical piece there which you are so so-called like donating it for to the museum but then they will never be another nft or more than particular amount of nft ever be printed of those pieces so yeah but i mean like if you were to buy one and then the relationship would be broken between the physical art and the nft like would that concern you like do you still feel like that nft would be valuable or uh i mean uh for these old pieces which is by uh ravi rahman which is like a big indian painter from 16th century they said that the original physical piece is so-called with this money donated to the museum and so the physical piece will continue to be there and they did three nft for one piece for that particular piece and you're never gonna break the physical piece for sure i hope but uh yeah and uh uh one of my friend actually bought one of those pieces and i think the idea that before there was not even a chance for anybody to display that piece because it has always been with government of india to now somebody uh authentically can have it in their living room is actually exciting i mean also just there's so many like when this whole afghani crisis was happening i wrote to a director of the museum i was like hey let's go into your archive of like afghani jugs and like take something out of the basement that's collecting dust and make it into an nft whether you do a 3d scan of it or a photograph of it and have that money go to like support people in that country right now like there's just like there's just such a wealth of like uh like in real life assets that can be creatively integrated into this space to like benefit people and you know also creating like metaverse objects where there isn't a real physical object but you're creating an object that can then be brought into the into the metaverse is also just another interesting use case where is this a real physical object i i did an nfd project where i i had a leaf i painted on a leaf and i meant to that as an ft i said if you buy this i'll send you the actual physical leaf which is going to disintegrate over time and then you can choose to resell it and send it or keep it and it was this kind of conceptual experiment like well what's the real art is the real art the like fragile leaf that was painted on it or is it the photograph of that which is alive on the blockchain forever so it's just like it's a very playful space and that's also as an artist that i want to bring to this conversation is this set it's such a new space and i think you know when my grandfather was collaborating with dali it was like playful it was just like it was about what can we do today you know like how can we wow people and there were no rules it was like rules are out the window so i think the most innovative projects coming out of the space are like the nouns project you know where you're just minting something every day and it's just you know the auction base per day i mean just for me the coders are the the beethovens of the future you know they're the ones who are who are writing these these codes that are so fascinating and when we in the first panel we were talking about you know who are the real who are the real dalis in the space or the real beethovens and it's essentially i think like the technologists you know this is like a technical a technically based you know art form and i think that they're just some genius technologists out there and it's a very collaborative space too so i think it's gonna be you know about the team we heard about on the second panel the investor who only invests looking at the team so it's just this idea of people coming together in this playful spirit like it doesn't have to just be about like finance and valuable and you know it's and i think the most interesting projects are going to be the most playful and innovative and those will become the most valuable over time because they were the most innovative and it wasn't just a market grab it wasn't just some celebrity coming into the space doing something to make money it's just somebody like saying hey imagine if and like to me that's like where the real magic happens in this space status now i don't know if you have noticed i have friends who have eat rock and cyberpunk and their biggest problem in life is which one to show off on their display picture so i think there is a lot of status associated with it yeah i i think nfts at heart are really about status but okay we're gonna do a quick lightning round we have two minutes left uh what about energies and climate change does that concern any of you uh actually yes uh but i think i don't know how many people know like maroon 5 the famous the famous band uh so smartly did their nft with a dao for all their followers with just five dollar n who could decide that every nft they would sell which climate charity should that money go to and i feel like there is so many different ways of doing those but then as you were talking about that big artist coming into the space to make money you also have uh maroon 5 doing it completely for the chef for their charity and letting people decide which one is a good one and i think that was so successful they were able to move multi-million dollars within a month of their launch i think there's also a lot of misinformation on hopium around climate change whether you know layer two solutions so that if two is gonna fix it and we're all gonna go green actually no one has the required knowledge um i've yet to see any big vc or any big nft company to you know have proper climate scientists coming into their team and advising them and giving them proper knowledge and you know maybe not uh what to do because it's such a hard problem but at least you know to back up all the  that they're saying with you know a couple of actionable items or facts um i read one of my collaborators he was brilliant you know one of the vcs was saying okay what can we do about climate change and the nfts and my collaborator said it actually boils down to basic uh chemistry questions that you're not answering and no amount of money can give you the answer unless you put the work and connect with those scientists and we have not done that so you know just to try to guess things because we read it in a brochure or at the guardian or we watch too many greta toomberg speeches it's not fair it's not fair for them it's not fair for us because we get burned at the stake as well and it's really annoying to be part of like a harassment campaign so i think you know since we have all this capital flowing why don't we hire the people that are able to you know give us at least you know decent answers yeah i love that i also agree there's not enough data go ahead just you know elon musk love him or hate him you know all the miners moved out of china the bitcoin miners and they went to texas and now texas is all of a sudden talking about renewable energy because elon musk said i'm not going to be into bitcoin until it's 50 renewable also el salvador just made bitcoin their currency and they're doing thermo dynamic volcanic energy so i think if anything the crypto space is like leading pushing the the green agenda and i think it's great and i think more pressure should be put on it because this is the most innovative space i think the smartest people right now are working whether they're like fintech defy or coders i just think the kind of the mental energy of this time period is operating in this space so why not make this an issue and let us solve it as like a community we are out of time just adding one more start very quickly canadian green canadian green mining company is now actually delivering renewable energy driven heating system to 1100 uh properties in vancouver out of bitcoin mining residual emerging interesting okay good a nice positive note for the future thank you all so much this was a really wonderful panel and we're out of time all right thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
