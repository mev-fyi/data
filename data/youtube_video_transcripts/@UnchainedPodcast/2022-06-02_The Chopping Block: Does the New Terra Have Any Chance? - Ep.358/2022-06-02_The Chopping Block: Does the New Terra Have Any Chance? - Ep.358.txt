hello everybody welcome to the chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we've got tom the d5 maven and master of memes next up we've got taroun gigabrain and grand pub gauntlet uh we'll have joining us about halfway through robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound he's in the middle of something but he'll be joining us and then we have myself hasive i'm the head hype man of dragonfly and today uh subbing in for robert because robert couldn't couldn't make it during the first half of the show we've got laura the ceo of the show as i know she loves to be introduced quick caveat the four of us are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice three even life advice three three two three the three of us the three of us laura is not an investor as she often likes to remind us she is uh she is a journalist according to herself um so you're you're in uh according to yourself you're in mallorca right now uh we're doing my orca i know and please excuse me because you guys there's like all kinds of pandorium happening here um but yeah i i caught covet and so i could not fly back to the us today like i had originally planned um i'm not very sick uh which is good you know frankly just gonna enjoy a little bit of extra beach time i'll have to work this week but at least i'll be doing it in like this really cute beach town yeah i feel like it's sort of like a blessing from the universe you know i just get this like little extra time because ever since my book came out i have been like busier than ever before i think i mentioned this when i came on before so yeah kind of nice for me frankly i hope it's pretty mild is it yeah it is i had like aches uh the other night and then i like just slept 12 hours that night and then woke up and i basically just have a cold now and that's it okay well i'm glad it's not too bad but your voice sounds kind of raspy which actually works well for you i feel like it's actually pretty cool okay it's probably also because it's so late here it's after midnight yeah it probably sounds just just the hour to start talking about luna uh exactly exactly so okay so luna so it's it's been um we actually had some comments in twitter people telling us why are you still talking about luna but unfortunately they do it to us they force us to do this so um for those of course uh last episode we talked about the collapse of luna with kevin joe and we sort of did a bit of a play-by-play of exactly how ust ended up collapsing so in the interim um a lot has happened that i think we should probably discuss since it's it's the uh uh it's kind of the defining event of this month so there was a proposal that was passed that doe suggested uh called the terra ecosystem revival plan and the idea is that they are going to launch a new blockchain called just called luna or called terra a lot of people are calling it terra 2 slash luna 2 but on on coin mark cap it'll just be called luna from now on and this is the basically regenesis it's the second birth of terra and there's going to be a big air drop to oh sorry i should say there was a big air drop to previous holders of luna as well as some of the people who kind of got wrecked through different parts of the ecosystem some of the airdrop went to also staking derivatives so people who had exposure to luna even if they weren't holding luna directly but there have been a number of issues there were a lot of complaints about the governance process there was a lot of complaints about the airdrop being miscalculated that the terror foundation had to go back and kind of issue some meio culpa's about some of the the airdrop having numerous issues where people who were supposed to get some didn't end up getting some and and so on and so forth but the big thing is that it has it has it has mostly succeeded i believe the the fully diluted market cap of the new luna luna 2.0 is something it's like 6 billion last time i saw i think it's like 8 billion now it's been it's been moving up yeah yeah so it's been it's been gaining some momentum so it's obviously it's a far cry from what it was before where you know previously it's ftv was very high i think like 40 billion or so but now you know it's it's a respectable showing and there's a number of of projects in the ecosystem most of which were spun out of the terraform labs which is the company behind luna are involved in building on top of terra two but we've also seen a big migration many of the projects that were building on terra too or sorry they were building ontario originally didn't did not decide to stick around for terra two and so many of them are shopping around for a new home so uh as terune you were mentioning last time a lot of the other foundations whether they be the solana foundation or avalanche or polka dot they're having engaged conversations with some of the new migrants from luna and so it seems like this thing surprisingly has gone off reasonably well although there's always been some mistakes going on in that transition the big thing that i've been hearing chatting with some of the folks from the terra ecosystem is that it seems like tara is doing everything they can to try to sabotage the old chain so the old chain is now called luna classic and there have been all sorts of issues with luna classic as the community has migrated away from the original luna onto you know luna 2 and so some of the things that we've seen and i'll just be really brief because there's a lot of detail in some of these stories so first that mirror protocol suffered a massive exploit related to their oracle that ended up draining a significant amount of capital and is likely to drain more there was also apparently a 90 million dollar defy exploit that was also also on mirror that was unnoticed for months that has only now recently been uh uncovered by a gentleman by the name of fat man which is a great name i guess batman tara fat man tara there you go and yeah apparently there are uh this this bug was fixed quietly by the team behind mirror but there was no acknowledgment of this actual bug until fat man was able to uncover it and describe it on on twitter so but broadly speaking i've been hearing a lot of antagonism toward luna classic where the luna team or foundation has been trying to as much as they can try to decommission things that are on luna classic and push all activity toward terra two so it's been an interesting couple weeks to see the machinations of this migration to terra two what have you guys been seeing what have you heard and what do you think about this new regenesis of terra yeah it's interesting to see how quickly people are willing to get this thing going again like if you look at the tara twitter feed it's all about like all the new exchanges that are listing territory territory perps like all these kinds of things i think one of the things about this in my mind was unlike a lot of i guess forks that we see of l-ones like an ethereum classic type situation the state was not preserved it was like a full re-genesis and so you know you don't get all the old applications from tara not that again they would make sense as tyrone pointed out without ust most of the time but it's like you know really trying to start from scratch like get people to redeploy versus like oh we still have the old you know uniswap clone that you you love and it's just on this new blockchain instead you have to point your you know wallet over to this new thing so i'd be curious to see if they can win people over or get some new stuff i saw they had like a phoenix decks thing which would be rebirth so it's kind of like you know trying to get people over on luna but yeah i'm not really sure i did see one also funny thing on on twitter which is called luna rebirth but yeah there's a very famous trader gigantic rebirth which you know bet very heavily against luna so it's like this kind of weird you know kind of funny i don't know uh coincidence but yeah i'll be curious to see if they can actually like rebuild a meaningful state from from from sort of scratch again i mean it's it's weird because it's now a redefinition of luna as just being a pure smart contract platform because of course the ust component of luna is gone like they're not reconstituting that at least not right now so it's terra as a competitor to ethereum solana avalanche uh polygon and it's it to me it's it's not really obvious where they're going to get marginal demand from so i'm sure they're going to be able to have the you know some of the folks who decided not to migrate away continue building ontario but where are new people going to come in like what's their edge what's their story other than that we're around and we have some tvl so that that seems a bit of mystery to me yeah everything i've read is just like oh it's the same chain minus ust which of course that's pretty much what the old chain was entirely about and i haven't read anything saying like you know in all the competition in this space here's what sets this new chain apart granted i also have been traveling like crazy so it's not like i've been falling super closely but it was something that i was wondering it was like this is a very crowded space so how are you differentiating yourself and i haven't seen anything like that the other thing is that i was surprised by how quickly doe kwon began posting again i know multiple people you know have been talking about this but i guess i kind of expected he might be a bit more humble but i clearly was wrong um i think other people on twitter were frankly surprised by that um and in general like you know um i guess i sort of felt that maybe there would be like more of some kind of effort to make it seem like more decentralized or like less reliant on you know certain individuals in that community so um those were all certain things that yeah just kind of surprised me i i definitely agree with that it kind of feels like look if at this point this is the this is the hail mary to try to make whole the folks who lost a lot of money in the ust debacle and so it has to go right right and this is also the the only chance that a redemption arc in a sense is for them to kind of make this thing work so i understand why from joe's perspective he has to go all in here he can't hedge his bats he can't it's going to be cutesy about it he has to go aggressive so i i think that feels sensible to me but of course you know what i've heard from some folks who are who we're building in the terra ecosystem that uh you know the tfl is giving out grants to folks who were in the territory to stay in and not to go shopping around to other chains now of course the tfl doesn't have the resources it once had so it's hard to be competitive with a avalanche or a solana or a near if you know you just your entire ecosystem just blew up but they're they're competing on level ground they're trying to do the exact same playbook they were before with respect to their one competition yeah and i know that delphi has a different role here but i felt that their tweets were you know being more measured and saying like look you know we we can't necessarily say we endorse this i forget the language they used but and granted like i said i know that they have a different role from doe so you're right maybe he just has to like keep that sort of upbeat like i believe in this i'm going to build this kind of attitude but you know delphi's stance definitely seemed more measured and reasonable given everything that had happened i didn't think it was interesting in the um blog post they really tried to position it as like community-owned tarot there was no explicit carve out for tfl in the in the regenesis and obviously they own a bunch of luna they own a bunch of ust and so they implicitly got an air drop but it wasn't like oh the tfl is going to get a bunch of luna and then everybody else gets an air drop it was you know a true you know sort of fair launch even distribution quote unquote yeah i mean i think the hard part for someone like delphi right is like delphi labs was probably the biggest grant recipient from tfl effectively right they were built they built all the they built mars they built ash report they they had like pretty much i'd say i think labs in particular i think delphi wrote a blog post about how like basically labs took 99 of the losses for them and you know i think uh i think it's very hard to convince these teams who you've convinced to like tie their moor their ship to your dock for two years that suddenly have to have had everyone lose everything all at once suddenly continue to stay and and we've already seen so like for delphi basically i think mars said they're moving to osmosis astroport unclear but they didn't deploy on on uh start like a bunch of people how to deploy forks it's actually an interesting opportunity for someone who's like you know wants to make a quick buck of like just redeploying all these tara protocols that basically we're like hey we're not going to go back because you know the ust state is too valuable to our protocol that it doesn't make sense to redeploy right to astral port like every single pool was like 18-month ust locked so i think that there's sort of an interesting dynamic going on there i think that also the overtures made by pretty much every other chain to luna developers and luna teams will i suspect be extremely successful now the biggest question is how the cosmos ecosystem i guess can rebound from this because in a lot of ways they really really tied their ship to ust part of it was ideological right so you if you talk to kind of the you know og cosmos people who are not jay so ethan or zaki obviously the two kwanz jok dokwan and jae kwon both will forever live in twitter infamy but it's a tale of two quans but but uh i i think i think there's sort of this interesting thing with when you ask like more on the people on the development side who are kind of still involved sunny zaki and ethan they were all sort of no matter what like even if they were all like hey luna is still unstable they still kind of had to keep supporting it because it was literally the only driver of growth and then it it did work for six months right like yeah it did it did really surpass in a lot of metrics from everywhere else so i think replacing that is going to be quite hard especially for the average you know djen type user who's gonna be like oh well this cosmos thing blew up last time like why would i put my money back in this again and i think that there is there's this interesting like consumer protection angle that hey we want we we we're not going to let usdc come on cosmo so we're not going to make overtures to circle to have usdc deployed on cosmos which is effectively why it's the only one that has no native usdc i mean i think now they're trying to rectify that and they kind of were like we only want this like free money that you know doesn't that doesn't have like any tethering to the existing financial system and that was sort of one of their core values so i think it's going to be interesting to see how they redeem from that agoric even though they've been taking kind of you know they've been taking the slow approach to building it they actually have a really cool system but with is that isn't it also uh usd aren't they also you know i i think the kava hack the kaaba the fact that kava set their oracle for usdx to ust equal one was not good that was it was not good no no it's not nail in the coffin like like i think they they they still have a chance for sure i do think that like the problem is they they have again there's this consumer protection angle like if people lost money in in minting uscx because of the fact that the oracle was mispriced and they got liquidated anyway you know are people going to come back like yes people do come back in crypto right we know that people love taking infinite pain i i think this is a level of pain that we haven't ever seen obliterated all at once you know like yeah no it's uh you make a great point which is that beyond just the the the the facts of exactly what happened in the terra collapse there's a kind of stink now that's hard to erase from tara to and i think it's one of the reasons why it's gonna be very difficult for them to attract new entrepreneurs and new developers to build on top of them you may be able to retain some of the old community but then it's a real question of like what is a community worth like how many of these people will actually be able to bring in new retail and new entrepreneurs and new builders because ultimately that's what little one blockchains are about they're about taking a shot at building the future platform that users down the road are going to care about not just the people who are here today are going to care about and then the other question is that like how much of that stank rubs off on cosmos now i i tend to think that it's in the long run it won't be that much just because of the fact that most users don't really know like if you're very technical then yes you'll have some understanding of like okay you know ust was built on top of cosmos decay and then osmosis had a lot of exposure to it and blah blah and they all made these decisions that ended up looking bad in hindsight but i think most users are not thinking that way and you know if for example i'm trying to come up with a tortured analogy but you know if if there was some company that attached itself to myspace then myspace you know imploded most people aren't going to draw you know if you're living in the valley and you're thinking about you know the the the kind of the chess game of startups then you might think oh man these guys who attach themselves to myspace what idiots like they'll never be able to tell that i i think most users have no idea i think one difference between crypto and myspace is that the wallets are very branded to the chains you're using right and so in cosmos is case the interesting thing for for for the rest of the cosmos ecosystem is probably the best m a deal in the history of uh crypto was was osmosis buying kepler um and then kind of like really vertically integrating and probably building the best wallet ever i i will stand by the following assuming kepler is a better wallet than phantom and metamask by a long shot i just think it has figured out the cross chain ux perfectly compared to the other ones are like you have to sign 50 million transactions they don't hide all the call data like you know if i try to my mom's relatively technical user who uses metamask but she has had trouble basically bridging and so like i just generally think like i i don't think she could she can use kepler she had definitely a lot of trouble using metamask to use optimism for instance so i would say that like kepler i think is like really hit it out of the park and the most important thing for cosmos uh is that the terra wallet even though it was sort of a very widely used wallet it was not the mo is not the most used cosmos wallet anymore like kepler really took over and so right i think that in and of itself is a little bit of a saving grace right because kepler's not branded luna or tara right right right and that was all a sort of interesting thing because tara had the first big cosmos wallet actually one of the first big cosmos wallets and so most people with seed branded as terra and associated with terra but you know my my point is like you could have had something where the terra wallet was the most used cosmos wall and almost every other cosmos app was used through the terra wallet that would be horrible for them right you know you do does that make sense like there's a different brand risk here with the with the wallet to chain connection that i think like from a consumer standpoint like does sully brand image yeah actually tyrone because of your comments before about how you felt that um osmosis and kepler had the best ux i did have sunny on the show on with the one that actually came out today we actually recorded it before the whole terra implosion i obviously had a switch of the schedule to to include all that so so this is coming out a bit later but the point is that he was saying on the show that he felt that having ust in that ecosystem made it hard for other applications to compete because they couldn't like use natural yield because there was this element in the ecosystem that had this artificial inflated yield so i actually wonder if now in a way this might like help the cosmos ecosystem more because then there won't be this kind of like weird element that's sort of like causing kind of weird market dynamics for some of the other apps that are trying to compete in that ecosystem so who knows and frankly the fact that it happened this early probably better for the ecosystem as well yeah yes and no i mean obviously the the fed does the same thing with the federal funds rate so you know if the if the fed raises the federal funds rate to like five percent then that affects all sorts of private actors in the markets who might otherwise have a lower rate of return on what they're doing so it's true in the real world too although we've been in a low interest rate environment for a very long time it seems like we might be you might be exiting that but yeah it's certainly true that what you do in monetary policy at the base chain affects people upstream it has to but that's kind of the point now if you if you set monetary policy badly you create all sorts of weird effects which is exactly what was happening in the terra ecosystem was weird effects that ended up causing this this stuff one one weird kind of analogy of like anchor plus terra is is sort of like imagine if the central bank also was a commercial bank that took deposits and now had like this incentive to create the auroboros because they were like on one side handing the deposits on the other side controlling the sort of rates for the deposits and this has happened in a bunch of countries that has and it hasn't worked out weimar germany is a great example of when the central bank started like opening retail banks that this is in fact why in in germany until very recently the post office was like the biggest bank in in in the country the dutch post bank was really yeah used to be the highest highest deposits in germany so there were there have been some remnants of this type of stuff that like uh so so from the consumer side i think there's a lot of lessons to think about how like wallets and protocols are associated and you know what that will this will be a good lesson to us of like whether whether like people there's like this affinity that's different than say the myspace thing because like oh if the wallet was really branded to that chain then like people start thinking like oh this chain is bad versus oh this app was bad well so speaking of learning lessons the other thing that's happened as a result of the terror fallout is we are seeing prosecutors starting to sniff around so there was a report that korean prosecutors are now summoning the employees of terraform labs the company that is behind the creation of terra and asking them a bunch of questions about their involvement i've heard that there's also a probe going around in the u.s as well although you know the details are still a bit hazy so unsurprising that when you see a situation like this head's gotta roll like this thing was global news you know it was a cover of the wall street journal it was just massive massive story it's now to the point you know when i talk to lps every single lp asks me about tara and it's the one thing that everybody knows to talk about same way like last summer the one thing everyone knew to talk about was solana this summer the thing everyone knows talk about is terra why did it collapse and like what does it mean for the industry and it's got me thinking a lot and i'm curious to get your guys take on this about you know we touched last time very briefly with um with kevin on the idea of was terra a fraud because or as you say it was usda fraud because one of the one of the questions i get all the time from lps and i think this is often the way in which it's framed in the press is that terra was like theradose and there are all these comparisons to consumer protection investor protection of like how can we create more disclosures how can we stop this kind of malfeasance from ever happening again and tom you made the point last time that everything about tara was actually out in the open everything was totally transparent right the the deposits on anchor the yield where the yield was coming from you know raising money into the lfg the funds they were using to protect the thing how the mechanism worked everything was out of the open it was all in smart contracts it was all on the website everyone knew this ever i mean not everyone obviously there are many people who are sophisticated enough to understand it but all this was out in the open so the question is should naturally there's going to be an attempt to try to punish the people who were involved in the creation and the and the promulgation of usd do you guys think that is good or bad we were talking about this a little bit um in one of our team meetings too around like this being also maybe reminiscent of of gfc and like not wanting to criminalize failure that also just creates this massive you know chilling effect on on the industry and i think i guess as i sort of said earlier like this was super transparent no one really you know lied no one made misrepresentations around what this stuff does i think externally outside of tara you know there were the there was a story actually about stable gains which was like this yc backed startup which is basically a front end for anchor people were wiring in dollars initially they were converting to usdc and then eventually stable gains converted those to ust to get more yield to skim off and then sort of collapse on the back end i think stuff like that where they actually went through and they like change the terms of service they try to obscure this from people there might be fraud there but i think in terms of the actual protocol tfl like it was all pretty transparent i think also some investors obviously you know i think maybe misrepresented or overplayed how um safe this was and downplayed some of the risks but it's hard to say that anybody lied or anybody totally obscured what was actually going on on the back end i think maybe only the the thing i would point out is around the reserves we still don't have a ton of clarity and uh how the reserves were used to defend the peg um not that that i don't even know that makes a material difference in terms of the outcome for ust or for luna but that does feel like maybe the the worst part of the story is just you know with four billion dollars and crypto so went poof and we don't really know what happened to it yeah i mean the story of crypto has always been that you know people try to solve insanely hard problems and they mostly fail until someone succeeds right there were you know however many attempts to create decentralized money before bitcoin succeeded and you know the same thing there were many attempts to create you know kind of generalized computing platforms before ethereum succeeded and there will be many more attempts to create decentralized stable coins that don't require the the the backing of real usd and they will continue there will be more attempts to do this because it is one of the holy grails of crypto but it may continue under a very different pretense if the idea is that if you fail you get punished and we will throw the book at you and find every possible way to make your failure even more you know discouraging to the folks who will come after you i i'm not going to be popular with the other people on this chat for saying this but i think investors should be allowed to be sued for this uh to some extent like there is a sense in which the in the theranos case you could argue that there was information withheld that caused this sort of consumer harm if consumer harm is your like the basis of your legal system's form of punishment but i would argue here that like the there's like a a whole an ecosystem of of that in some cases in this scenario that happened especially i would say to some extent more the traders and the venture investors the trading firms have started becoming venture investors quickly i i do think there was certainly some of them were misrepresenting things quite dramatically anybody you'd like to call out tarou no i don't think there's anyone i would like want to directly say but there definitely were there definitely were people who were very unnamed training firms who were very involved a couple of names came to mind based on the description no no no i i'm not trying to to basically say you know the ones who are subpoenaed because like they're already you know they're already i think there were there were more there were more in asia that were really described you know i would say in like korea and singapore there were just a lot of people a lot of funds are just like oh yeah like you know pushing these kind of front end products the way that i have described at lps is that the reality was luna was more wework than it was theranos it was a dramatic failure but those are the only two examples of fraud that we can come up with well no wework wasn't an example of fraud it was an example of incompetence and what investors would would be like uh like well they you could argue that that the lps would say that hey that's like masa being incompetent which is in their mind equivalent to like you know the the theronous thing no but i agree with haseeb the the sin here was hebrews and definitely wework and tara fit that much more i i don't agree that tara was was a kind of therapist and i i think like fraud is really difficult to prove and so maybe an investigation would turn something up i have never looked into this you know the the bar for that is like pretty high and given all of dokwan's swagger on twitter i would be super surprised if he actually like you know internally kind of like knew or or was convinced that tara would collapse just from the way he spoke it seemed like he was fully convinced that he had made it he was like a gazillionaire and like was set for life and you know this this was his baby and his big success that's how he seemed so i would be super super surprised if like behind the scenes he was like oh this is never going to work and you know i i would just be surprised one thing from the financial crisis is a lot of the people who are kind of like high swagger apples were the only ones who are convicted or like actually had legal trouble because they were just easy targets for regulators yeah if you're unsympathetic yeah dude you're gonna get the i think like don't don't underestimate in financial crime like how much of the fraud case does sometimes revolve around who can be made an example of the most easily and are were they an like in a clear way that like it just it's easy to convince a jury yeah but i just don't know then excuse me if the charge would be fraud itself because if he was fully convinced it would succeed then how is it a fraud you know so that's why i agree with you yeah to see yeah i agree that there's there's a sense in which this is this was not really a fraud in the traditional sense it was just more uh for for the protocol itself right the protocol itself in some sense is you know it worked correctly but i i just i would just argue that financial law the way it gets enforced at least in the us is quite weird and people all the time can get you know you know the shkreli case is a great example a case where someone effectively actually made their investors money so like from the perspective of like exactly how he he got in trouble like it was sort of this very weird case to turn it into like a like a sort of mix of consumer harm and fraud and so i i wouldn't be surprised and obviously him being an made it very easy to construct this kind of roundabout case so i i wouldn't be surprised if like we see a lot of that where it's not call fraud but like the trial gets represented in the media as fraud and like it will never like most people will just think it's that even if you know technically it was like this like very obtuse thing yeah i think that's very likely is that it probably won't be the big charge that you really want but there's a feeling that something must be done you know it's like don't just stand there do something for you know uh any kind of prosecutor in this environment so we'll see something and i think there's a good chance that it ends up becoming untenable to pin it with a really big charge and so it's like oh you lied about this one really specific thing that we're going to nail you on and it's going to be like some slap on the wrist but it ends up wasting everyone's time and attention that would be that would be my guess but it's more about sending a message right and feeling like hey crypto is not this like lawless place where consumers lose a lot of money we feel like we did something and the consumers feel like something was done and so therefore we can all kind of agree to move on collectively and is that what you think it would be because you know before the sec was trying to go after dokwan because of i guess synthetic assets in mirror but you know they don't have jurisdiction i guess because he's us or not a u.s citizen in this case it would be like some kind of consumer like like what do you know what the charge would be or have you seen any commentary i don't know my guess is that prosecutors are trying to figure out what can we like what can we possibly charge on this thing i don't know what crime is involved here but i'm sure there's something in one of these books that we can that we can accuse them of also not not to make a hard pivot but we did bring up wework and i hear that adam newman is back in crypto and by back i mean i by back i mean started i'm not sure what i'm not sure with back and forth back in the startup game yeah yes yes so we heard a story that uh adam newman raised 70 million from a16z for some kind of carbon credits on the blockchain something something i don't know does anyone have color on this one i tried reading the a16z memo and it was mainly a personal story about carpet i was like i was like wait i don't understand what this company does i was like this sounds like what happened last time is that the announcement of why we're investing was a personal story i think i think personal stories justifying investments in things that are difficult makes a lot of sense sometimes sure sure but i do think it was very unclear i also heard this rumor from a friend of mine who said the same team minus the newmans were pitching the idea like four months ago five months ago and like did nick say they were involved or something and then like something changed so i don't know what happened in the last four months but it sounds like it sounds like this this team has been like hustling on this idea for a while and then they got a little star power to help out i see okay oh oh wait wait wait so meaning they weren't like hiding their involvement and then suddenly decided not to but actually they brought them on board to like help them get investment i think i suspect it's the latter not the former i thought he i saw the screenshots of this old deck that show the team without ex everyone except that that's amazing that having adam newman involved would somehow lead to investment okay anyway i i'm clearly not a vc you do not understand investors if that's confusing to you yeah it really doesn't like the biggest failure of all time but anyway okay okay whatever i don't know if it was that bad if you think about it yeah i mean it's still like a several billion dollar company it it's not theranose right like it it's closer to uber no at this point than i i think yeah during 100 right i mean clearly adam newman is a bit of a nut job but yeah he built a really fantastic company like when you go around you'll see we works all over the place i i've i've used a rework in the last two weeks you know sorry for sorry about the barking uh no worries um okay so before you have to run because i know you you have to hop off early this one i i felt like you would be able to give some good color so cftc held a round table on ftxus making a proposal for a new approach to clearing the settlement of trades so the idea from ftx is like hey you know all you guys who separate out you know your clearinghouse and your custody and you know exchange all into separate entities that's the way it's done in the traditional financial system that's kind of dumb what about the idea that we verticalize everything and one party does all of them and this was a big pitch to the cftc cme was a was at the table cme is chicago mercantile exchange which is one of the largest exchanges in the world and uh the cme basically started yelling at ftx calling it you know ridiculous and claiming that they were going to take advantage of consumers who didn't understand what was going on and so there was a bit of a back and forth and some roasting that was going in both directions between ftx and cme tarun you're you're a lot closer to this from your trad five days what are your thoughts on this whole drama i just generally think i get what ftx wants to do it makes obviously from a technology standpoint clearly makes a ton of sense i think the boomers though who are in charge are just generally against 24-hour trading like fx has 24-hour trading minus some tiny blips and the fx market has had a lot of like weird behavior fx is also just like a very bizarre market right because it's like there's only certain primary dealers who do all half of the market maybe more of the market trades per day so like what i mean by that is like let's suppose i'm microsoft i have microsoft subsidiary in europe and every day for tax reasons i need to like get my revenue outside of the us into ireland right so i need to like sell dollars by euros ship it over and in the process of doing that i have to be like hey i need to like sell i need to like sell a yard or a billion dollars like basically you know you you're like okay who wants to handle this and there's usually only like four or five banks that will do it so you go the banks they they do this trade they there was a whole scandal of this like post-financial crisis about how like all these banks would collude and they would like tell each other like hey look morgan stanley would say microsoft is giving me a billion goldman would say facebook threw me a building billion and they'd be like okay let's agree that like we're gonna charge them at least this much so it's like as a fee the the goldman guy in london is the one who who went to jail for tom something so anyway fx has this weird thing where because there's not really a jurisdiction that guides the security like the the european leg and the eu us lag might differ on what they consider insider trading for instance actually they do and so you get all sorts of very weird stuff but it is technically the only 24 hour market and a lot of the weird stuff there you can argue that on a smart if it was actually done on chain for instance that you wouldn't have that there's just like a single consistent block but like i don't think i've ever talked to people who are like as averse to using technology and still use blackberries as like a lot of the people involved here so like i just feel like it's going to be it's it's a hard uphill battle sam's not exactly a sympathetic character i think to a lot of them for a variety of reasons probably mainly alameda but like i i just think that like they're it will be an uphill battle i i i i wish them luck like obviously it should just be this electronic thing and like why am i like why do i have to deposit five different brokers to like do just like one trade between exchanges like stuff there's like all sorts of middlemen in the middle but just kind of like the pharmaceutical stuff in the us where it's like completely non-transparent pricing you don't understand like why certain warehouses why like when you go to your local pharmacy even though there's a warehouse that's like three miles away from you that has the drug your pharmacy actually has to get it from like this like a huge ring of pharmacies that send it back there's all sorts of weird middlemen stuff going on here and the middlemen are they are boomers too so like i just feel like it's really hard to convince these people to change the electronic trading boom really was in a lot of ways like for for equities the reason that it actually had they had to like just accept it was like people just started making exchanges on their own and just started trading and like soon tons of the volume tons of volume left the regulated exchange which is sort of what you see in crypto so i think if you make this argue you can try to make the same argument but i i i think it's going to be hard but i wish them luck there i mean there are popular arguments against 24-hour trading right like matt levine talks about this where it's like it's just hard for dealers to be online that like for that amount of time and so generally it's like you see worse liquidity in the market and so it's sort of like in some ways self-defeating versus just like having run everyone who wants to make a trade online for like a small amount of time every day you really deep markets everything settles and then it's sort of over versus like trying to trade when your markets aren't super deep or like requiring people to be uh you know posting liquidity constantly this seems like such a bizarre argument to me right because like look if it's not in your interest to improve liquidity at a certain time it's like okay well lease is better of some liquidity than no liquidity right if most of the trading activity happens at 5 p.m or whatever it is then fine it happens most of it happens at 5 pm but at least like the people who want to be in the market can be in the market and there's not this like weird cottage industry around after hours trading and this thing and people better yeah as much as i love matt levine as a writer i generally think he has like very boomer technology takes and like a lot of it has to do with the fact he didn't work in electronic trading right he was a derivatives lawyer at goldman that's a very different thing than like working at tower right like if you work at tower or jump there are there they have 24-hour coverage like every team is quoting wherever they can like this is not a problem you have an international team that's distributed and like every single trading firm can do this this is just a like very boomer bank nonsense thing in my mind of like these people who want this like very you know yes there are all these mistakes that can happen but it's crypto it's like even less likely in some ways you can at least analyze why they happen post hoc like you can't even really do that when you have like these five million brokers who don't who like don't publish any information and then like after they only publish information on the sec is like hey like we think that like there was watch trading like send us all your records like come on like what are your thoughts on the uh the poor farmers angle um which is basically like look if you look at what you know a lot of people are trading futures farmers already sold off their entire rights to their farms to cargill like are you are we seriously the koch brothers already owned most of this like agricultural future it's like glencore and the koch brothers like why do we even care about the individual farmer like they don't even they don't even do this themselves they go to all these brokers right like it it it this is all uh uh a very strong lobbying arm like that's what i would tell you i i agree i would just curious if you had any other thoughts this idea that like the the farmer the poor farmer is going and sitting on interactive brokers and like he's like he's like in the tractor like selling a future like what idiot thinks that's a world we live in in terms of um the like condescending attitude the boomers have or or whatever it was that you were saying and like how the traders kind of know better um did you guys see that little clip of when sam bank van fried got upset at how condescending i think it was somebody from cme was being about yeah people who use his platform and he was like i'm a little offended here you know the people who use my platform they definitely know much more about these contracts than you do and you're pretending like you're trying to protect them and i mean he said it a lot more politely even than that but still you know it's kind of a tense moment and i don't know if you saw the previous one well i didn't see it but frank chaparra tweeted a little clip of it but when the cme guy was asked by congressman ro khanna what a blockchain is he he was like a blockchain is a node and then like goes on using like word salad crypto basically um trying to make it i mean he must have heard a definition but like didn't actually know the definition and so just threw a bunch of words together that made it sound like he knew what a blockchain was but yeah blockchain is not a node so i thought it was funny i i i had this friend who asked uh one of the gpt3 thing like you know where you can ask it a question that will generate a like an answer for you like what a blockchain was and it was about 100 times better than the cme so we should just replace some certain people with gpt3 i guess is what we've learned i was just going to say if people have more questions about this i did have chris perkins president of coin fund on my show discussing it and he used to work at city and um knows all about this and like actually supports the ftx proposal and he spent you know 20 minutes explaining the whole thing so you can check that episode out yeah so the i mean the political economy of this doesn't look great because the decision being made by the cftc is ultimately you know they feel like they're very beholden to an entire system that doesn't want ftx to do what they want to do it might be better in some holistic sense for everyone involved but you know regulatory capture being what it is i think it's i i feel like the odds for ftx are not good tyrone how would you how would you handicap them i i also would say i i give it like 20 percent the luna timing was horrible right ftx has been preparing for this for a long time i think like the pressure from the luna stuff is just going to basically kick any of these things down the road like you know it's going to be like the bitcoin spot etf it's not going to be like like come on if we can't get that approved do you think they're gonna do this much of a change like i agree with the sec for cftc but it's like it's still it's still like going to take a while i'm more bullish on what kind of like the way the euro dollar happened where like some other country made this product and then it grew really big and then people in the us were like look like you can't have this if we don't like get this rule change but right now the u.s doesn't feel that way about crypto i don't know exactly what it is that's not giving them that imperative i just don't feel like ftx has like the boomer suit enough boomer suits yet it just takes a while to like hire those people get that you know like i don't think the the swamp is easy to walk through without boots fair enough all right well we're running toward the end of time um we were going to talk about the optimism airdrop shenanigans but uh in the interest of time we have i don't know if we can cover in two minutes i i guess i just wanted to end on um you know i think last time we uh we were talking about the the the collapse of terra and kind of doing a postmortem on it but we didn't have a whole lot of time to really delve into what it means for crypto now that we've entered into this broader bear market right so we're now pretty pretty firmly in this in this new territory where we're seeing much fewer product launches trading volume is down across the board we're seeing a lot less retail engagement you know most most assets in crypto are down 50 60 for the majors and then below that it's things are down 70 to even 90 um and of course even even steeper if you're tara how are you guys thinking about the present moment how is it shifting your perspective on what's happening in crypto soul denominated magic eden nft volume shockingly not going down yeah i i i this little twitter thread talking about this where it's basically like you know if you sure if you look at the prices there it's just sort of this broad drawdown and you assume everything is sort of going down the same amount in the sort of the same way but if you if you look there are interesting pockets of outperformance of things that are doing well one of them being ether soul denominated you know nft volumes looking at nft user numbers like all really impressive stuff that is structured to do well in a bear market people taking on more risk like these you know dovs like you know these these dows that are selling bonds or some bond issues coming up over the next few months stuff that like makes sense to do in a bear market is doing well but of course the hyper leverage super speculative trading that everyone loves in a bull market is not doing well so i think it's like too dooming gloom to say like everything is dead everything is is dying it's like you've got to kind of pick and choose and look to find those things that are structured to work well in a bear market and maybe be you know less attractive in a bull market i mean i love the take but are we moving the goal post a bit to start denominating no i don't think so at all because because because i think nfts are a particularly unique asset in that they're one of the few crypto assets that's not dollar denom stable coin denominated all right it's actually kind of crazy right like the average new user to crypto in 2021 probably traded in nft like i would guess that that is like 40 right those people had to learn how to buy ether soul like things yeah that was not true before before but how many of them how many of them are denominating their reserves in ethersole right that's the real important question the ones who got rich off of trading that they're they're still living in that ecosystem keeping it up it's like they are net new users like i think like don't forget that if you think it's so important then why aren't they trading in stable coins because you can technically do that on all these platforms but people choose yeah yeah no that's a great question and i'm really curious how long it's a change in consumer behavior for some cohort that we that i think like that cohort is like the key consumer to understand right the question though is like the you know nfts were able to grow to the extent they were because there were marginal new people coming in and being willing to buy and sell these things right um increasingly you know the the ogs the people who are there from the beginning they denominate their wealth in ether or in soul or whatever um the the new user who's like oh this nft thing is really exciting and i i'm you know we could get moon paid to like buy me an nft so i can you know show it off to my celebrity friends that person is probably denominating like they're not thinking the way that you're describing which is denominating no no no the difference is before it was whales now it's hypebeast it's hypebeasts who would like go like on you know like heist nobody and like those people are denominating an ethan soul that is a new demographic that didn't exist in this industry right like and and the fact that they're building their own economy around that that is that is something that's green shoots so the question is like what are the products that are on that yeah i mean it is the only thing right now in crypto that is denominated purely in the native token for whatever reason it's nfts like it's the one element of crypto where crypto actually acts like currencies is in the nft marketplaces which is crazy and and it has new users like who are not necessarily like have been around care about the original privacy reasons the kind of internet philosophy like none of them care about the philosophical things so that's like an interesting well do you think that that will continue let's say three years from now do you think they will continue to be priced in the native asset look i'm not i'm not here to to to to try to shill music nfts or whatever whatever people like that's going to be asking you to make a an intellectual prediction yeah yeah no no i'm just making fun of the music nft people because they're really it feels like very much like mean girls they're just like really trying to make it happen and it has been a rough slog for them but like don't you guys think that the reason that they're denominated in the crypto is because nfts are all about status and like you know the way that's reflected is you know to i don't know somehow like putting it in dollars like that is nowhere near as cool as if it's denominated in ether soul and especially especially youth in particular and the fact that that price was set by whales and that the reason that it's denominated in ether soul is because people got in you know on on the ground floor when it was cheap and then now they have like tons of whatever this coin is and then so the newbies they want this status and so that's why they're willing to pay in in that coin because nfts are about status that's a that's a good theory as i've ever heard but but it did attract new users right whatever whatever the thing whatever the the way it is yeah and they're chasing status and the way they achieve that status is by paying and eat their soul like the whales like the way it's like being like a yeah imitation whale be like mike be like the whales like i'll also see one last thing the the the chat is really asking about the optimism thing so if if we have five two minutes we should okay all right let's shoot for the optimism thing so real quick so optimism today was launching their airdrop there were there were a bit of snafus around the optimism airdrop so first off uh so for those are enough optimism is alert to optimistic roll-up they've been around for a while they're kind of the second in command behind arbitram for uh tvl they uh announced their airdrop but um their airdrop they unfortunately had a lot of issues with getting the airdrop up and running so first of all i think it was a few weeks ago they ended up calling a lot of the list of potential airdrop recipients for folks who were perceived to be bots or perceived to be gaming the airdrop but the when you when you looked at your airdrop when you looked at the airdrop that you were eligible for apparently their rpc endpoint went down or kind of spazzed out and got really weird so it started telling people that although they were perceived to have gotten the airdrop had been eligible for the airdrop they then started telling they weren't eligible for the airdrop and so a lot of people mistakenly believed that their airdrop was been pulled from them now second the contracts were deployed long before any of the announcements were made and of course many people were monitoring for the for the contract and so a bunch of people started taking their tokens out selling them the you know the the price discovery started taking place with a bunch of folks getting early in and dumping even before the actual website to claim any of these things was actually available there was an announcement by the exchanges they were going to list optimism today even though the team themselves didn't say anything so the whole thing has been a little bit of a show and a lot of people are you know kind of fish shaking about it i don't know that this will you know by the time that you listen to this podcast it might be so many days in rear view mirror you're like okay whatever i mean that happens with every token launch i i kind of take the view that this doesn't seem like a big deal to me but everyone's talking about it today so i figured we might as well do uh for the hat to that i don't know i don't know if anybody else feels more strongly about it but this feels like a standard clumsy token launch yeah it feels pretty clowny but like i think generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyway so it's like you know i don't like it it's like wait hold on we might need it we might need to disentangle that why are airdrops pointless well i mean like what is the purpose of the airdrop i i don't really feel like i've ever gotten a good explanation of like what this is supposed to be for other than maybe creating a small float creating some community goodwill thanking people but then people go out and like game it anyway and so it's like you know ultimately the products where it lives and dies almost by itself and this is almost sort of like a a marketing stunt or way to breed some community goodwill but like you know i think if you look at you like try to draw some sort of correlation between the quality of the airdrop and the like the outcome for the for the product there's there's probably zero correlation between the two so i think a lot of teams think about our airdrop and plan on it but like ultimately i feel like it's it's just so you know window dressing well yeah right before um we hopped on my assistant made the point that probably a lot of the people that were gaming things and interacting with the smart contracts because they realized that they were already live were the whales and so the whales probably benefited a lot and made a lot of money and then now once kind of more retail users who don't really know these things get in then the token price will have dropped and they'll be left holding the bag so that's actually one reason why it does matter yeah i mean it's an air drop right so i mean does that mean again like these kinds of things happen pretty much always right even if there's a even if it was done fairly there would be people who are running bots that like instantly take the airdrop and then sell it faster than anyone can click buttons so yes it's true it could have been better i don't know i i i think these things tend to get overplayed in terms of their importance to the long-term success of the project like options will be successful if they build a great layer too um i think how well their airdrop was executed doesn't matter that much in the in the bigger scheme of things i guess a disclosure optimism investor the main thing i would say is i do think layer twos are all launch and go launch tokens and the success of all the future layer two tokens is sort of predicated on like the market appetite for it will somehow depend on how well or poorly just went i think a lot of the rpc stuff was kind of bad in some ways just in the sense of like it would it i think you know there was a lot of there were a lot of people on in on crypto twitter who were just like solano sucks like rpc endpoints never work avalanche sucks rpc endpoints never work so i do feel like there's a little bit of like that that that fact that like hey look the lyre two that is vitalik approved like somehow didn't like wasn't able to get around there's like this weird thing of like there was like and did the sequencer also go down for a tiny amount of time but i think that was way shorter than the rpc problem was a big problem because there were all these other contracts you could call that work fine and other other endpoints you could go to so i think the main thing was just like i i i i just kind of think like there is a little bit of like social salt there's a little bit of um desolinification needed uh in like i just don't get why people are always like on each other like oh your thing sucks because your rpcs didn't work or like because it's like you know like every new one of these things is hardest to build like and like the no  no on launch you're gonna have so anytime you make fun of someone don't forget it will happen to you too eventually i hope joe quan is listening that's the karmic force of the world you know yeah do quan might be a slightly different story but i i but i completely agree with tyrone like this this happens to everyone and i i think it's like incredibly not a big deal although yeah it's annoying at the time that it happens i give anatoly the most credit of of everyone for this because for some reason he is un he does not get he does not yell at people which is i and doesn't go like oh your thing sucks like all the time which you know i you know i think a lot a lot of people are always like you know ready with pitchfork to be like yours doesn't work and it's like especially you know i think i think a lot of e3 researchers not e2 devs these two dads understand that it's difficult to launch e2 researchers love just like going and ribbing on all these things and i'm like you guys are just when you have your problem like we did with the beacon chain testnet stuff the robson thing like you know i i don't know why can't people just not be dicks about this yeah no everyone everyone gets their day in the well everyone gets their day in the well like i agree you know anatoly is probably a little bit more even killed than some of the other people when when he's getting attacked but i do have to say sometimes his spin when solana has issues and then he's like oh well you know back in the day bitcoin had a block time of blah blah blah and i'm like this is not the same like like don't try to compare solana to bitcoin everyone is at fault i would just say he does not just go out of his way to like constantly be like your rpc failed you suck like yeah now now that we have brought anatoly and we did we did uh challenge anatoly over twitter to come on the show so we'll have to bring him on next time uh now that the i'm hoping that next time there will be no more luna to no nor luna news for us to work through and uh we can start focusing on other things so that uh that'll be a good a good follow-up to this i i i do know the soul the sun is the opposite of the moon so if if he's on the show can't mention the moon all right i guess uh i guess that's i guess that's that um all right well let's let's wrap it up guys because i actually do have to run uh thank you everybody for tuning in and uh we'll see you guys in a couple weeks you
