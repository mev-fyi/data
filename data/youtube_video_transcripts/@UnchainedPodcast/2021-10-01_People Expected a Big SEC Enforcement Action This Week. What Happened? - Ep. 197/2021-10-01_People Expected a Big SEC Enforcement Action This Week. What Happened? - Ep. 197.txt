nodle.com to start earning nodal cash today today's guest is stephen palley partner at anderson kill welcome stephen hi how are you laura great nice to have you so there was some regulatory news this week but i think many of us were expecting bigger enforcement actions from the sec and or cftc than the ones that we actually saw so why do you think we didn't get any big enforcement actions well i don't have regulatory telepathy so i can't i can't see into any of those agencies of course i can tell you that um investigations they take a a particular what's the word that i'm looking for they have a particular trajectory so you start with something called a matter on drink query or a muay where the sec basically asks some questions to figure out if there's a potential violation that then moves into an investigation an investigation can take a couple of years sometimes we saw that for example in the ripple case where it's clear that for years before the lawsuit the sec was undertaking confidential non-public investigation of ripples so it may be that the cases that the sec may or may not be investigating in the i think perhaps in the defy space or related to yield products they may just be an early and early stage and the the commission may not be ready to make decisions and to bring charges it's also uh certainly possible that cases where there were sort of graver harms where there were fraud related issues as opposed to a failure to register issues took precedence that's all speculation on my part but that's um those are some of the thoughts that i have on that well at this moment in time certainly i think the space really is watching what's happening at the sec and from various statements that chair gensler has made it seems he's quite eager to regulate the space what areas do you see him or the sec in general particularly wanting to target i think that they are likely to follow the lead of or follow a path that state regulators have taken i'm speaking specifically of block fi and looking at yield related products i think that's one approach i think they're also trying to really wrap their heads around and understand defy and the challenge in that area is that they are in doing so applying circa 1930s rules to technology that doesn't really neatly fit the descriptions things like in exchange for example or security and perhaps don't actually neatly align those efforts might not neatly align with the policy sentiment or purpose behind the enactment of those statutes in 1933 1934 and 1940 post the great depression but i think that's what we're going to be looking at we're going to be looking at the sec and other agencies evaluating new types of financial technology and figuring out if they fit within current statutory and regulatory rubrics yeah i did see an interview that former chair chris john carlo did with coindesk where he did say he felt that there needed to be new regulations and that the old ones don't really apply here so um i actually have a few more questions for you about that but in a moment i i want to cover first the crypto lending issue because we also saw that coinbase talked about how they had sought out permission to launch a yield product called coinbase london the sec said if you do we're going to sue you um and then also in addition to block fight there's also state regulators going after celsius and i did see that so the coinbase land product involved usdc the stable coin and frank shaparo on cnbc said that there might be concern that usda sees itself as a security since it's not one to one to cash but backed by multiple assets and i was just curious kind of what your take was on the theory around what happened with coinbase lend and you know if you had any thoughts on the usdc theory well i mean what happened with coinbase land is the founder went on you know rampage on twitter attacked the sec called them sketchy because they got sent uh you know they got senate wells letter basically a letter saying tell us why we shouldn't sue you for violating you know securities laws i don't think that wells letter was ever made public so we don't actually know what the full investigation was of those things usually come at the end of a non-public investigation so i think in the end um you know they might have they must have decided that they didn't want to spend two or three years in litigation with the sec maybe it wasn't in the best interest of the company's shareholders and so they dropped it i have heard talk of certain stable coins so uh stable coins that are not fully reserved and there are some that are fully reserved with dollars and bank accounts i have heard talk that some of those things may be under close scrutiny by the sec as securities and um i wouldn't be surprised if we saw some activity in that space i think that's actually quite good news for stable coins that are fully backed and that are transparent about their backing okay so maybe frank's theory is a good one and so that could be quite interesting to watch play out because obviously those businesses are doing that for their own business models to make that something that is worth them uh spending time on i think in fairness to i don't want to say necessarily in fairness to the sec but i think some products that exist are easy to fit into an existing rubric so a stable coin that is not fully backed uh that has um an unclear backing might be something that we can understand why there might be scrutiny of that and why that might and the views of state or federal regulators be a security same same as so perhaps of certain yield products i think the problem is when you get into more esoteric areas more decentralized products when you move away from the block fish and the celsius and the coin bases to fully decentralized protocols where you don't have a centralized order book or you basically have you have matching by an algorithm those areas perhaps some of the older securities regulations and laws don't make the same kind of sense the technology is just is different i don't know if i agree with john carlo that that means we need more regulation maybe and call me crazy maybe we need less regulation in certain areas or maybe we can rely on existing laws about fraud or misrepresentation maybe there are things that don't and should not fall within the um the rubric or the within the uh scope of traditional securities and commodities regulators because they're really not those things that's that's sort of my thinking on that and wait and i'm sorry when you say that you mean for the decentralized versions or for even the centralized ones um i i'm less skeptical of regulation of um centralized platforms using existing rules because they do maintain things like centralized order books they are doing things like aggregating customer capital reinvesting it somewhere else making money on the spread between their investment return and what the consumer gets maybe that's fair game i would say uh decentralized protocols where there is not a centralized company you don't have a public company you don't have a centralized order book you're using an automatic market maker algorithm using liquidity pools i'm perhaps a little bit more skeptical about the application of conventional existing securities laws to those things i'm just not sure that not only do they not fit those statutory regulatory frameworks i'm not sure if you went back to congress you know in 1932 and described this stuff that they would feel that it was really within their ambit so i'm skeptical of extending securities or or commodities regulators power to regulate you know purely peer-to-peer transactions that are facilitated using algorithms that exist on the blockchain why should that be within gary gensler's uh scope okay well you know he did write a letter to senator elizabeth warren basically saying that he probably does need more regulatory power to go after such things but i'm going to ask you about that in a second but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible do you love sports collectibles or fantasy sports so rare is

conversation with stephen pally so speaking about what jurisdiction the sec really does have here as we mentioned chair gensler did kind of request uh more power and i just wondered like do you think at this moment that sec does have all the power it would like to have to regulate the space or no he wants much broader power so i don't think i don't think he feels that the sec necessarily has the power that it needs to regulate defy for example but i'm not sure why software creators people who are making platforms that allow individuals to transact with each other on a one-to-one basis using software i'm not sure why the sec should be involved in that and it is galling i think to many to see very wealthy former goldman sachs sax banker sending letters to a very wealthy uh senator talking about consumer protection when that consumer protection recently prevented uh us persons from being part of a major air drop basically free money so i am all for regulators uh countering and battling fraud i'm all for companies that are centralized uh or platforms that operate order books being within the scope and ambit of those circa 1930s laws i think it's questionable whether they should apply to decentralized finance when it truly is decentralized and i think that it it's actually contrary to the consumer protection purpose that was behind these protocols to prevent consumers from you know transacting on a peer-to-peer basis using liquidity pools using algorithms perhaps it's crazy but perhaps there are parts of our financial world that we don't need regulators to be involved in and that's all the more so when you're using platforms that have where transactions can be seen on the blockchain and where code is available on github which is you know certainly not true for i won't name them but any of the large banks or financial institutions in this co in this country so i just want to give some context to listeners because as i'm listening to you speak about this what's remarkable to me is that you're sort of kind of i would say one of the lawyers who are more skeptical or in the past have been more skeptical of things like icos and of tokens that different projects wanted to launch um and when i say that you know they were saying that they wanted them to be decentralized and so i'm just curious to know kind of um what is different for you between those projects in the past that you were skeptical of during the ico craze versus like the d5 space now i'm still not a fan of centralized icos token sales right and if you want to do something like that you need to you need to comply with existing securities laws i'm also not i'm also not um suggesting that anyone should break the law my point my my arguments are more directed towards policy and they're more uh sort of a normative evaluation of policy and what the law should be than what the law actually is and i was around practicing in 2016 and 17 and i did live through the ico craze and most of those projects were about self-enrichment of a small group of people i don't think that that is what the significant d5 platforms or protocols are about so my i'm not opposed to innovation right in and of itself when it's useful and i can see that our securities laws and our commodities laws maybe don't need to be stretched further than they already are they work just fine in responding to icos you could make the argument that in some cases enforcement actions may have hurt consumers hurt purchasers i know well anyone who knows me or seen me write about this on twitter or elsewhere i'm not necessarily a fan of ripple or of xrp i think that is a project that for the most part benefited a small group which is why there are control person claims or individuals were were named in that lawsuit however there is a point to be made that if you shut something like that down for a failure to register uh claim um you will hurt individual consumers and if the purpose is to prevent people in the market from being hurt i think that you have to balance that against uh you know the purported uh harm or violation okay so going back to the d5 space you know as we've been discussing it's quite apparent that sec is eager to regulate the space in a way that is kind of more similar to the way the traditional financial world is and that it wants to go after intermediaries and obviously d5 protocols are trying to replace intermediaries with software um but i'm sure you're aware a lot of people on the outside look at defy and say oh these these developers just want to avoid regulation and that's why they're doing this so what's your take on that if you have regulation that applies to intermediaries right and that exists in order to regulate intermediaries if you can create a system that doesn't require intermediaries why should you still need that regulation now there are certainly people in d5 who are out to get rich and are only in it for the money but cena if you look at something like if you look at an automatic market maker function when it is and i'm not going to name it i'm not going to call it any projects by name but that functionality those algorithms are very very different than the sort of centralized order book or order matching that you had for example in the etherdelta case which uh you probably recall from a couple of years ago which was supposedly a decentralized exchange but it really was not uh so i think you know if something is different it should be treated differently so i mean without no i mean what we can name i think different examples here because for a lot of these places the companies that built the protocol then also did built a front end and so you know in that sense like do you think they truly still are decentralized well i mean it's a uh that's an argument that i think the sec is going to contend with and you know there are certainly some companies that have done that but there are also you know groups of decentralized developers who are loosely organized who have done this and you it is possible to exit here's here's a another way to think about it i don't think that anybody would argue that a protocol in and of itself on the blockchain is an exchange right it doesn't it doesn't fit by its terms within the definition of an exchange in the exchange act it's not a it's not a marketplace it's not a it's not a location where people come together uh to trade but you can let's step one step away you can use something like etherscan to interact with those protocols i don't think there's any argument that ether scan is an exchange you can also these protocols are also available um anybody can build a front end so i guess the question is if you have a front end that simply provides functionality and allows access to what is truly a decentralized protocol that no single person has control over how is that an exchange is that is a website really in exchange is that really what congress meant in 1934 i'm um i'm on the fence about that i i i can see uh but i think there's a strong argument that it is not and we need to come to terms with the fact that technology is different and with different technology we need different rules i'm fully in favor of anti-fraud power and enforcement acts actions that that target fraud i also i've come around to commissioner hester purses safe harbor i think if you have a disclosure regime and the age and the commission has strong anti-fraud enforcement authority maybe that gets you where you need to go without imposing a regulatory regime on technology uh that doesn't fit it okay so yeah i mean it sounds like you know obviously the fraud piece i think is necessary but maybe some there needs to be i guess like some definition or some bar that projects need to clear in order to be thought of as decentralized and that would kind of true yeah okay so we're gonna have to see what happens with that but last question for you sure how would you say the sec's stance is affecting how developers are working in the space do you see them leaving the us or are they just trying to develop their projects here in a certain way or what you know i don't know what else that's a really great question i mean i think you will see people leaving the u.s or going satoshi right basically being totally anonymous this is kind of funny but i've i've had potential clients recently in the space reach out to me and they don't want to give me their name nobody else knows their name and you know it's problematic like basically my response is listen in order to represent you i do have to know your name i'm going gonna need an address and a phone number and um you know it's um i can't disclose that like i lose my law license if i did that but i think there is a genuine interest in uh full decentralization and there are some you know pie in the sky idealists out there uh who really believe in sort of an ethos of financial freedom and full decentralization there are also people that out there who are in it for the money so but i do think to answer your question a little bit more neatly uh you're definitely seeing people thinking about leaving the u.s or also you're seeing projects geo goip block the us and block vpn including some you know d5 projects i understand that one inch has done that i believe that dydx uh goip blocked the us from its airdrop so you will see americans losing out on opportunities and i just don't know that it's really the place of you know no offense to congress but octogenarians in congress uh stifling innovation by imposing the wrong rules uh new technology there should be rules of the road for sure uh but you know the life of the law is not logic it's experience as a jurist said 120 or 130 years ago that should be the case here too and we should take the experience of defy and of emerging technology look at it for what it is and determine whether or not our existing regs actually work or if this is something that needs space to grow and breathe okay well we will have to see how all this plays out thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed it's my pleasure don't forget next up is the

click select nft three connect to a wallet like metamask four choose the nft you want to use your as your avatar and five enjoy staring at your ethereum check mark mason nystrom an analyst at mastari described nft verification along with twitter tips which allow users to tip in btc as the first steps in creating the twitterverse he noted quote that all of nft and twitter is filming at the mouth to verify and showcase their beloved avatars he went on to add quote the value proposition of these status-based nfts is greater when combined with social media once individuals have verified nfts there are groups tiered perks spaces and other features that twitter can combine to build an even greater platform read monopoly as the publishing twitter has not announced a release date for its nft
