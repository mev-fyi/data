with the code Laura Link in the description today's topic is El Salvador's use of Bitcoin here to discuss is Nelson routa journalist at El Faro in El Salvador welcome Nelson hi Lara thanks thank you so much for having me in the last year El Salvador made some historic news by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender we're going to dive into everything that's happened since then but first let's set some context listeners of this show may not be familiar with you or your work so before Bitcoin became part of your coverage what kind of journalists were you well I've been a journalist since uh 2013 have been doing this for nine years uh and I started out my career covering Judiciary uh there's always a lot of GTA things going on in El Salvador uh so I started with the murder beat occurring gang violence occurring police scoring uh the Attorney General's office Supreme Court that kind of stuff and then I transferred to a father seven years ago uh which is a an independent newspaper smaller newspaper so you kind of have to to do a jack of all trades uh kind of thing there so I started out doing more political things and more things related to immigration and basically focusing on on human rights violations and I I was doing a lot of uh coverage of Civil War trials in El Salvador um so the first time I've heard the word Bitcoin the word crypto was from Mr Jack Millers in a Miami Conference in 2021 and I I tried to brush it off because I'm used to Now by I'm really used to Mr naibuke's antiques by now it's been three years but five days later I was at the legislative assembling watching and a midnight session as the Bitcoin law was rushed and approved so it wasn't really a fast learning curve and I've been covering the implementation of the Bitcoin low for a year now and so you you said that the first time you heard it was Jack Miller's seeing the word at the conference so you were just tuning in because president was there I didn't tune in I saw it afterwards in social media and and and it was a surreal experience to hear from uh foreign air from this you know this why this Gringo uh young kid telling us that we six millions of us would have actually another their whole monetary system of our account was going to change overnight essentially so that was a pretty I would not recommend uh that that kind of shock Doctrine or shock therapy and you talked about President bouquet's Antics as you call them so before Bitcoin became part of his identity what kind of politician and president was naiba Kelly it was kind of uh bolsonaro meets Trump but with that uh but really into technology kind of guy that that's that the best description I would give he's he's a really like a populist like a traditional Latin American populist is really popular in El Salvador and he he the presidency by a landslide in 2019 and he won because he capitalized the sentiment against uh what you know people might call like the the drain the swamp kind of narrative we're going to clean the politics I'm I'm I come from this same parties but I'm not one of them I'm of the people although I am a millionaire that kind of uh populist kind of kind of thing so since the beginning of your presidency we became aware and we saw more of more of his authoritarian Tendencies I I think people really saw him uh in in in in this uh series of photos when he invaded the legislative assembly with the Army and tried to try and pressure the congressmen and woman to approve a loan for security for his security program so we started seeing more and more of this but Nikola was approving June 20 2021 uh was announced in June 2021 approved a couple days later it's announcement and it came into effect in September before that there was an essential element that it's that he won the the super majority in the legislative assemble his body controlled the Legislative Assembly which allowed him to effectively control two of the three branches of the state and then with that power he illegally acquired the control of the Supreme Court in El Salvador he demoted the Constitutional Court he demoted the attorney general and so essentially there was no democracies uh counterbalances you know it checks and balances system that's what allowed for decisions as the Bitcoin law to pass as swiftly maybe people don't realize that and I I've actually talked about this with several foreigners because now there's a lot of interest uh from the crypto war in El Salvador and they said well you need a strong man to do that and I said yeah but that's not Democratic and that was not allowed by salvorian law itself so let's also um just flesh out what the picture of life in El Salvador was pre-bitcoin from a financial situation what would you say was the financial reality for everyday salvadoran's pre-bitcoin maybe I'm going ahead of myself here but I don't think it's changed that much uh uh on Fourth uh the population is basically leaps uh is poor it lives under with less than ten dollars a day which is I think the measure that most uh multilateral organizations use to measure poverty um there's a lot of talking about banking their own bank and and there's a lot of that talking on and from The Narrative of the government of the president saying oh yes only 30 percent of salvadorians have bank accounts and and so 70 of the population doesn't have which is true it's it's it's it's uh it has been measured like that but I I would say that there's a reason uh behind that it's not just the lack of access to banking institutions is the reason is the economy itself people usually earn what they use they they don't have savings accounts because they are essentially useless most of the time and most of the people don't have anything to save so if you gave every Salvador in a savings account you would give them um a tool of course but most of them use what they they earn what they need every day and don't have their resources to have you know like Investments or or stashing away money to use in some other thing or it's it's not really like that the majority of the population and the transactions happen in cash because it's essentially a subsistency economy well okay so you alluded to kind of just how quickly everything happened in terms of El Salvador um first proposing and then adopting this Bitcoin law so describe a little bit what that experience was like you talked about how it was a very learning a steep learning curve for you just give us more detail on what that time in your life looked like I think for all of us this was a Saturday in in all of a sudden we're on Saturday scrolling through Twitter or social media and we see this this dude Jack Millers who who was very stronic in in that appearance he he put on the the jersey of the Salvadoran national soccer team and he cried on stage and he said he almost beats his pants because of the invitation of President bukel and then president himself appears on the big screen and says we are adopting Bitcoin as little nobody knows what Bitcoin is I mean I I hadn't heard of it ever this was among the the the the Bitcoin fever of 2020 2021 right but here in El Salvador it it was just uh marginal thing maybe a couple people knew about it and and all of a sudden uh we saw that you know and as I told you I thought this was going to be one of those things that bukela does and his histronic and he looks for the rewards on social media in terms of likes and and possibility I I didn't think I had to put much attention to it I just went on with my Saturday whatever but then three days later we were at the Legislative Assembly I remember distinctively because I was watching a soccer game of the salvorian national team and then he they say where we we're going to pass Bitcoin law tonight so my editor calls me and says hey can you get down there enough okay so stop watching the game and it was funny I I why I mentioned the game because uh this is what I wrote the soccer matches uh have a 90-minute duration with a 50 minute pause in between the law the Bitcoin law spent less time in the financial Committee of the legislative assembly then the the soccer match lasted when they introduced they introduced the the the the bill the soccer match was starting and when they passed the bill and they finish all discussions the law the match was still going so that that's how that's how I describe it it's it's how can you change the monetary policy for six billion people with so little discussion and and what happens is that they control the super majority so they control how much they want to discuss something or not want to discuss something and the law was presented at like seven in seven PM in in by a couple minutes past midnight was already approved and was going into full effect three months from them so really you you saw this confusion thing because the other thing that happened is that while the Congress was approving it there was a Twitter space going on and the Twitter space was hosted by Mr Nick Carter who is I think his under has got them there some heat recently because he I don't know he he he's he's not a Bitcoin Maxi anymore or something like that but he was hosting this Twitter space and he was allowing people uh to ask questions to president bukele and to one of his brothers so we didn't have a cell borders didn't have access and this was a Twitter space in English for American investors or Venture capitalists or or whatever and they were given that giving out more information in that space than we were getting at the con at the assembly so I actually I was at the assembly I was watching the discussion as they passed the Bitcoin law and I tuned out of it and I put my headphones and started listening to space because it was more valuable in terms of the explanations of what the law would uh uh imply the example that I always go to is that a congressman in the floor was saying this will not be mandatory while pressing buchel was saying the Twitter space no it will be mandatory McDonald's will have to take your Bitcoin you know so what's your take on why that was why was he explaining this in this Twitter space to primarily non-salvadoran audience but not necessarily doing too much to explain it to Everyday Salvadorans because Allah because a lot of the Bitcoin law is not meant for Salvador Lawrence and a lot of the Bitcoin Allure and the Bitcoin PR stunt is not for salvor and it's for foreigners it's for attracting for investment it's for attracting tourism it's for different reasons but because essentially president he's not dumb at all he knows about it he knows that people don't stash away money to invest that every day Salvadoran doesn't wake up every day and has five thousand dollars fund and says hmm what am I going to invest today this is not the reality of our country so a huge part of it it's not been for some Lawrence it's a law meant for other people but it's paid for by Salvadoran taxpayers and it seems like he doesn't necessarily need to convince salvadoran's because he can just get this made as law as you mentioned today that majority he controls the power so it it he he doesn't really do need to do any convincing he they can do whatever they want I mean imagine if the U.S was going to get rid of the Supreme Court Justices which I figure a lot of people want to do now uh on the list especially but you could you do that within an hour no because it's it's not a democracy there are procedures we did that here in an hour the first day that they took control of the super majority they got rid of the Supreme Court justices they got rid of the Attorney General and they replaced them all by loyalists in one night so where you you they they have been using this kind of powering like that the same thing with Bitcoin they are they changed the monetary policy of the country in one night and it doesn't affect his falling but what are the interesting about Bitcoin is that even though bukele still holds like 85 87 percent of approval in in the majority of polar and all polls Bitcoin hasn't drawn from that popularity so on the contrary Bitcoin is really not popular the reason Paul's saying that uh 71 percent of salvadorians don't see any benefit from the Bitcoin not to their own economies only two out of 10 support the decision to adopt Bitcoin and it's the same people that says that they approved president so they like him they like what he's doing they just didn't buy into these crypto fever and what was the initial reaction at the time when they announced that they were going to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender was there excitement about it or interest or like you're saying now that people just feel like it hasn't really done much but at that time was that different it was very negative because it it pulled or it drew from a collective trauma that we'll have which is dollarization the dollarization was also an imposed measure we are on the on the dollar since 2001. and it had been an old idea from the the elite the right-wing party that ruled El Salvador during 20 years but they didn't have the votes they nobody controlled this super majority nobody in El Salvador has had the super majority in assembly since I think 1984. so they they didn't have the votes and what happened was and this is a a funny anecdote I hope I don't get a little too much of off topic but what happened with the congressman was caught during a he he had a DUI and he actually shot the policewoman while under the influence of alcohol but the he he had a special protection he couldn't be arrested as a normal citizen so they took the case uh to a political impeachment case to remove his protection and then the right wing party negotiated with his party he said Okay We're Not Gonna remove his protection for this case but you're going to give us the vote for the dollarization so that's how it happened in the polarization I think was approved in November 2000 and came into effect into January 2001. so it was a really Swift move so people were really there's difference between dollar and Bitcoin of course people were used to Dollars there's three million sublawns in the US we are used to taking remittances people there's go back and forth all the time but there was a collective trauma because our national currency changed basically overnight and so so people said this will be like dollarization they will take away your dollars and we will only have this Bitcoin and this Bitcoin it's not even a coin it's it's you don't have bills of Bitcoin that I think was what triggered the initial reaction and then the other thing it was volatility people might not have understood because people might not understand what Bitcoin is now but they immediately knew this is a currency or this is an asset that can really change lanes can can change its price can drop its priority or increase its price in the matter of hours so I might have the equivalent of three dollars to have lunch by eight in the morning but by the time it's lunch maybe I won't be able to buy my lunch so people were really not attracted to that part and then there's so there was a lot of rejection actually Bitcoin was a huge part of the largest protest that buckele has had against him which occurred on September 15 2021 and on the Independence Day it's the largest protest so far in his government and it was supported by the Bitcoin adoption and other factors but the rejection of Bitcoin bill can play the role in that oh wow that's that's interesting um I'm going to ask you a little bit more about that in a moment but I did want to ask you so you know as you said you had never heard of Bitcoin until a few days before this was adopted so initially you know kind of let's separate it from your perceptions of what president bukanely was doing and you know whether that was going to be positive or negative for El Salvador but did you have any opinion or perception of Bitcoin itself I was really coming out of ignorance I mean I I didn't understand I remember a particular colleague from angress here who is a French American colleague and he understood some of Bitcoin because I don't know he he's a narrator or something and he started explaining us uh to me and my editor what this was what this coin was so so we really struggled to understand there was not uh an education effort and and the or public officials didn't really understand what was going on they they passed the law but I don't think the majority of them or or a lot of them knew what they were talking about I mean there was people talking Congressman talking about how Bitcoin is good for the environment when a lot of critics says it's not because of of the energy you use in mining or you know really rhetorical really saying nothing of the sort um so I didn't really have an opinion I I just didn't really understand what it was and because of that I didn't understand why the president was uh intending to use it and the first people we started to hear from didn't really uh do much to to heal or to or to alleviate your concerns I mean the first people that we have here leading a Bitcoin delegation was Brock Pierce who is eccentric who is a former Child Star and he led a Bitcoin delegation and we were like hmm this does not seem like like we did not see you know suits technicians economists uh people it's it's a really uh eclectic crowd so it it we went from ignorance to a skepticism to to outrage to okay let's really sit down and and talk to people who cannot explain to us what this is and what other people in other parts of the world use it for but that certainly took a while and you talked about how you feel that um part of the motivation on the Kelly side was that he wanted to attract investment in tourism would you say that this Bitcoin law has succeeded in those goals no no absolutely there are no hard data that we can rely on to say hey this is what has happened the government talks about uh an increase in tourism in a three percent increase in tourism but there's no way to to connect they're directly connected to the Bitcoin law because other things happen in the world that are affect tourism like you know the covid-19 pandemic they're they're lifting the the the travel restrictions the the economic recovery from the the effects of the pandemic uh so there's no way to really correlate it just to the the the Bitcoin Factor itself it has drawn a lot of attention but there's no hard data to draw from and then from the economic perspective the government talks about I remember clearly because the what there were a series of Bitcoin conferences in November last year in in San Salvador so uh one of the presentations was from Athena Bitcoin this is a company of ATMs that helped in the implementation in cyborg so they they argued that in cyber had recovered 10 on its economy thanks to the Bitcoin which is essentially not true it has recovered in in 2021 there was a 10 increase because in 2020 because of the pandemic was a decrease of nine points so in reality you're talking about a two-point growth in the economy which is pretty normal for Salvadoran standards and it again cannot be directly correlated to bitcoin I was at the an event commemorating the first year of the of the law last month uh with a series of crypto companies you know the crypto companies that have installed in server and they talked about having generated 113 jobs you know server which is not this this is you know it's okay but is it worth the cost of a public policy that has cost itself tolerance at least 200 million dollars so it's do the math how much each job of those has costed us so in the in those two terms I don't think uh the returns of Investments are clear to this day yeah and I wanted you to elaborate on another point that you raised in a New York Times op-ed that you published recently where you also mentioned that the timing of some of these announcements occurred around the same time as some other scandals involving his administration were occurring so talk a little bit about what happened there day before the Bitcoin law was announced it was announced on Saturday the Friday before President bukele had dropped out of an agreement with the OE OAS the organization of American states he had set up an anti-corruption committee similar to what happened in Guatemala with this you seek for those familiar with it so this committee had started doing Revelations and and uncovering Corruption scandals mostly related to pandemic buys which were as scandalous here there was a lot of corruption at one point the Attorney General's office the former Attorney General's office said that two-thirds of the of all of the pandemic contracts were under investigation so this was on on Friday he drops out of the of the committee he and and he says okay we are going to to to we are going to um drop simply drop out of it which was had been a campaign uh promise from from buckele so the next day he announced Bitcoin in all of the attention all of the attention that I've been talking about uh his dismissal of the Court his dismissal of the Attorney General he's dropping out of an anti-com anti-corruption movement it's gone it's you're talking about Bitcoin you're talking about how Innovative this country is and how bold this experiment is and how this is continued to happen we we publish uh a couple months ago we published an investigation with audios of a lava Kelly cabinet official describing his dealings with the gang members and and in conversations with gang members with MS-13 gang members and describing how he had uh essentially took took out a leader that's asked in extradition by the US government and took him to Guatemala so bouquet didn't and it still hasn't it it still hasn't commented on that investigation it hasn't said anything nobody from his administration did and he took to tweeting about Bitcoin because there was a committee of central bankers and economists in El Salvador at that time so Bitcoin has been used as a PR stunt Bitcoin has been used as a distracting movement from bucale from other corruption and Scandals you know and he talks about Bitcoin when he doesn't want to talk about other things and that's what I I say so and I know for a crypto audience and I know for a uh from the crypto point of view this is such a a historic moment in the game theory if Bitcoin is going to be the currency of the future we were at the first and and yeah but you cannot if you only go to that part of the story and ignore what is happening not in the future but in the present you know Salvador then then you're uh doing a disservice to the Salvation population and you're basically spreading propaganda from a government which is another and one of my main points when I wrote that New York Times article aren't Bitcoin are supposed to distrust the government aren't Bitcoin are supposed to get to to want to separate money from the state so why is it that they are so enthusiastic about a government an authoritarian government in a third world country that adopts it I I mean it it should be the other way around or at least it should be taken with a pinch on of salt you know yeah I actually wanted to also call out another contradiction which actually a number of people in the Bitcoin Community also mentioned such as Alex gladstein of the human rights Foundation or Jerry Bruto of corn center there's a bit of a contradiction to boot County championing the adoption of Bitcoin by El Salvador given that you know as you mentioned he has these authoritarian Tendencies and yet Bitcoin is a type of money that's not controlled by the state and so in that regard you could almost say that it would weaken his power for El Salvador to adopt it so I wondered if you you know had a theory about that or another contradiction which I've also seen called out which is that like Bitcoin is often seen as this money you know as a path for Freedom you know out of control of the state and yet in this particular law as you mentioned it is mandatory that businesses accept it there's no choice so what do you think explains these contradictions I think if you have a normal process of by proving a law you would have been able to see these conversations you know to to hear about economies to hear about Bitcoin experts there's a lot of talk about who goes throughout the law and and Jack Miller said he had a role other people said they they also have role but we would have these are discussions that should have happened before the law uh prove that that's the the and that's the thing and I didn't understand what was all the rush about except that you needed to create news and headlines quickly because you wanted to change the conversation you want to take control of a conversation but those are all contradictions I think I ever I've heard Gladstone and I respect tremendously his his job and I have heard and I've read about uh the the Bitcoin being uh some sort of a Troian horse uh apparatus two authoritarian States and that might be that yeah but what confuses me is that buchelli is like feeding the Trojan Horse to himself like you know what I mean he's sending it to himself so that's the part that I'm a little bit like wait yeah because I think the the element that's missing in the training horse theory is that Bitcoin is a Grassroots movement it's it's it's never imposed from the top down it grows in the uh as a Grassroots that's a horizontal movement so that's what I don't see I I don't see it working and I think that in order for it to work as a throwing a horse to avoid the the the regulation there's an uh a tremendous need of Education that tremendous need of of understanding that for instance if you use the government-controlled wallet the chivo wallet for me it's essentially a surveillance apparatus because you're actually giving access to the government to all of the transactions which is antithetical to Bitcoin in so many uh different ways so so you need education to understand what a self-custer is you know a self-custodial wallet not your keys not your coin that kind of thing and that's a level of understanding that most salvadorians don't yet have because there has not been an education effort from the state it has just been thrown on to them like a sort of app like like chivo was uh essentially replacing Bank apps for the majority of supplements but it presents those contradictions I I believe that uh it's not the case and you know I get a lot of heat because I'm I'm a crypto skeptical I I I I I I own Bitcoin I have used it I have reported and I have paid for beers and things in Bitcoin but I don't see it as a solution to salvoran in immediate needs I'm not talking about and I don't want to go in I I don't know enough about the realities of other people of you know like what they do within Nigeria or Lebanon or you know Belarus I had an interesting conversation with about this in the hospital Freedom Forum a couple months ago in Norway uh so the thing is I'm talking about El Salvador in in in in the matter of the fact is that in here it has not solved any problems and it has not done anything more than create headlines positive headlines for the president in international media all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the impact of the law uh in the last year but first a quick word from

Bitcoin as legal tender that the largest protest that boot Kelly experienced were about the adoption of Bitcoin so why do you think that that was the thing that motivated the largest protest so far I think in that moment it was uh the the dropped that overflowed the cup you know it it was the culmination of things it was the Bitcoin law resumed so many of the things that the Salvadoran opposition doesn't like about ukele he's authoritarian Tendencies he's unconsulted public policies the way that he deals with the the government's uh Finance the the complicated economical situation the disregard for Salvo Lawrence the in the his love for show boldness and in in in grandeur and and platform so so there were a lot of things in the mix but this was uh disliking Bitcoin was something that people could rally behind that everybody had different stances uh but in this Bitcoin thing we the the thing was we don't really like it we don't want it and we think it's going to be uh something that's going to grab our money so it I think it it was in that moment a bonding factor for the opposition because uh opposition is really they don't really know what to do and it's really hard to know what to do and and you know you have people in the right in the opposition you have people in the left you have people kind of scattered all over the place so Bitcoin proved a Union Point like the dislikeness of Bitcoin proof that you need a union point I I don't think it's so much like that anymore but in that moment it was something that reunited all the characteristics that the opposition didn't like so as we mentioned there hasn't been a lot of uptake but there was a survey in February by the National Bureau of economic research that said about 10 of people users did continue making Bitcoin transactions after spending the initial 30 stipend you have any sense of what people are using it for or who's using it it's it's it's very hard to say Laura because there's not widespread use so my people do a transaction here and there and and where those transactions continue to happen onto this year I don't know I think it I think the same service said that uh the the chill wallet up essentially hadn't had any downloads uh this year so it's really hard to say and and the uses that the government promoted it for also hadn't haven't happened I mean by every measure that the government said this would be ahead it hasn't uh they said that they would it would become it would make remittances cheaper permittances are like 20 of Salvation GDP because of our large diaspora hugely based in the United States uh so the way people collect their their uh remittances through banks or through services like Western Union and this this sort of thing so with Bitcoin with you or if you have achievable it in the United States and that you are here you don't pay fees or in the same goes for other apps like strike or or other kind of things but what their central bank is telling us the the statistics is that uh less than two percent of remittances are going through crypto wallets so despite the promise and the you know the guarantee of savings people are not really using and I think a lot of it has to do with how the chivo was rolled out there were a lot of people who lost money because of of transactions that didn't the the weren't recorded that the issues with the functionality between big bit converted transactions from chivo to other ecosystem or to other systems um and people imagine if people initially project this out of ignorance because they didn't know how how they work and the first experience that they have is as disastrous as the first weeks of chibo wear are you really going to rely on such a system or such a device to use uh or or to to yeah to to use your money or to withdraw your money from if you lose 50 dollars it might not be a lot for you know a venture capitalist or or an investor but for people who take the remittances and are such an important part of their life and their sustenance yeah you're not gonna risk it yeah I did also see that the Central Bank of El Salvador said that only 1.5 percent of remittances went through digital wallets which was obviously a really low figure and it's surprising though because I do know that places like Western Union and stuff they they take quite a large percentage so I I personally would have thought that there might be higher uptake did you have a sense of whether even just that initial 30 distribution was something that had any kind of impact on either the perception of Bitcoin or just positivity toward the new law nah uh the the the the the I think people essentially saw them as a subsidy as another government handle the government hand gave uh 300 on our checks during the pandemic and then they also have gift baskets it's not their appropriate word but they they were handing on groceries to people in need and they were actually delivering the door to door so people essentially took the 30 subsidy not just away uh as the government intended to incentivize the use of Bitcoin but as a subsidian so people would take the treasures and go to the grocery store or you know buy a meal i i a a good meal of fried chicken for the whole family or there were even people who were saying outside of the chibo ATMs they were saying like uh I can give you the cash if you transfer your balance I I will only charge you for uh for an uh an amount so a a relatively small secondary economy there but people weren't interesting in in Holiday you know or or in keeping their Bitcoin or even transacting in it they were just interested in cashing out and what about this Bitcoin city which is supposed to become some City for crypto enthusiasts that would be powered by geothermal plants at a nearby volcano has any construction big in there or begun there or has any of that come to pass or do you have a sense of how serious that effort is uh it's a serious as the the Bitcoin City in Senegal that that that they can call Akon City you know and and you we should ask the people about in Senegal how that is going now I I think that part especially the Bitcoin City part is it's it's the the most spectacular of the PR stunt that the bucale government has uh done with Bitcoin I mean uh the the the idea El Salvador for first of all summer is not a self-sustainable uh country in terms of energy we uh are connected to the Central American grid with we import energy the Cyber country doesn't produce enough energy for itself let alone powering a whole wakanda in the eastern part of El Salvador second of all energy is not cheap enough or it's not cheap uh in what Bitcoin miners look for is essentially cheap energy and they they might have that in places like Texas or Arkansas or places which have a good electric grill and not a lot of demand because unpopulated parts of the country Etc we don't have cheap electricity because a part of the electricity price is back to a product that's derivative of oil so the it's essentially the prices of oil that drive up the prices of energy in salvor because a part of the production relies on it so we don't have cheap energy so in the case that we would have volcano that was enough to produce energy I think the first priority should be to make the country still sustainable but this doesn't happen overnight this is why I tell you to disappears done because president bukele was in that Twitter space saying that that that explained the Bitcoin low when it was being approved and the next day he said we just discovered these new wealth of geothermal energy and we're just starting to design a whole mining Hub around it it's not true it's it it it we haven't seen plans for it we haven't seen technology for a study is technical nothing not a geothermal energy saying yes this is what we're doing and most of all this cannot happen overnight anyone who knows anything about geothermal energy will tell you that a plan will not be constructed like that and will be operating by the end of the month it's it just doesn't happen like that so that's why you should take it with a pinch of salt and you should take present bookable for what he's a politician and a Savvy marketer he he will sell you the moon like I think he will be he would be able to sell you know eyes to to to people in the Antarctica but what part of that is true and and becoming true so between City on top of everything I just said is relying on the budget for it will come from this Bitcoin bonds that will be sold and and for several months now have been in over demand according to their promoters to people like no Samson Mao or Max Kaiser they say that there's huge demand so why doesn't the government put them to sell now now that they they say that the market conditions are not ripe I I I suppose they they are write about that but we'll talk about the Bitcoin bond in a little moment but I actually also just wanted to ask one additional thing Bitcoin Beach is an area that has put a lot of energy into adopting Bitcoin what's your sense of how much Bitcoin is a part of everyday transactions there and in general what do you feel the significance of Bitcoin beach has been it's a really good PR stunt and it's a really good PR effort but I will invite anyone who comes to bitcoin Beach and is astonished by the fact that you can pay for a coconut uh in Bitcoin across the street uh I just go across the street I don't know don't go to a far out part of the country no just cross the street from the hotel that you're staying in Bitcoin Beach and try to pay there in Bitcoin and then then let's see how this is uh affecting widespread adoption yeah I mean there are a lot of places that will take your Bitcoin there but it don't lose the fact that this is a tourist place the crypto tourism is for the the this whole idea that was floating around a lot of years in the crypto scene that is hey what will happen when we are able to buy goods and services with Bitcoin well you can do that now in El Salvador in certain parts but it's part of the gimmick I would say I I I don't they they like to talk about a circular economy but what happened in El Sante was a Anonymous donation that started going around and people understood as subsidies and yes maybe you have some crypto enthusiasts there and and you have a an allocation effort there but it but essentially you're uh in Bitcoin Beach you're more catering to the tourism than on Bank than banking their own bank it's it's uh you for for in order to do that you would need to go to other parts of the country and I think there are other more interesting efforts in that sense in this album right I'm thinking about financial Cooperative in a CO in a town called zakate who actually take services to people in far out places in the country but in terms of Bitcoin Beach I think there have been a really good part a really huge part of the communications effort for the government and they and and I think they are really rather comfortable in that position and I mean good for them I I don't say it as a bad thing but in terms of spurring widespread adoption or or or making uh education to other Suburbans so this grows and grows I don't see it happening not right now so now let's talk more about kind of the country's financial situation there has been the situation with the IMF where the IMF has urged the Salvadoran government to backtrack on the adoption of Bitcoin saying that it posed a risk to financial stability we've had ratings agencies that have cut their ratings on El Salvador due to its precarious finances and as you mentioned boo Kelly had this plan to issue the world's first Government Bond backed by Bitcoin it was supposed to be a one billion dollar Bond so describe like a little bit about what that meant and then why you know you think it's been postponed I think the Bitcoin Bond was the vocale government's strategy to monetize its popularity among the Bitcoin Community they tried to appeal that they did this huge over-the-top Beachbody uh back in November uh with bukele appearing out of uh like in a kind of metaverse character with an outer coming down of uh UFO with the AC DC playing hard on the back and so so that that that's his you know his gimmick his uh he tries to sell himself as his Raptor Rockstar Superstars or who who happens to be a head of state but the reality of the country is that the financial needs are bigger than Bitcoin are precede Bitcoin I don't agree with people that say that Bitcoin has caused the country to go and to bring off the fall that's just not true I just think Bitcoin hasn't helped as much as they said it would so the Bitcoin Bond experiment uh was supposed to go online it was announced in November it was supposed to go online on February I talked to Paulo Arduino who is the chief technology officer of tether you know tether is is such a huge part of the crypto industry but it's also it's part of a web of companies they included with Phoenix so they were pretty much ready to go they set up an office here in San Salvador and and just things have been stalling and stalling and I what up I'm hearing about crypto actors and and other actors in The economical scene is that the interest has cooled down that there's there's just no not so much interest it was really from the financial point of view uh really weird product if you bought traditional Bonds in El Salvador at the price of the wear now you would get a lot of more interest or a a lot of more benefits than buying that and also it was appealing to bitcoiners and why would you buy a bond uh from there just from the financial point of view if you can just buy Bitcoin if the if the bet is that the price is going to the Moon to a hundred thousand to a million why you don't just buy Bitcoin instead of a bond except that you want to be you know charitable and help a government and be a part of it and have like a souvenir but just from the strict numbers point of view it doesn't make sense but the the reality of the country is that it it has very precarious Financial situations and I thought because IMF is not just cold shouldering the Bitcoin initiative IMF also uh likes other things they they want transparency mechanisms and they want to put pressure on the Democratic side of of of the president and everybody knows that IMF has a lot to do with the U.S departments of Treasury so it there's a political uh interest in there and I think buchella saw the Bitcoin bonds as a possibility and they saw they they said it pretty clearly as a possibility to finance the country without the IMF um I mean when we argue about these things people say oh why do you defend the IMF why do you love it we don't love them if we know who they are we've read the history and we know what kind of things they do to countries I just don't know if the alternative of changing from the IMF to private loners with uh with I don't know what conditions and and would let much less Clarity we know what to expect from the IMF it's not good but we know what to expect we don't know what to expect if for loners would be you know private investors who have bought this these bonds but I also think that the the people who are potentially being the targets of this product saw it for what it was and that's why the interest hold off and I um you know for in order for you to go to the market and and sell bonds you need to be over subscribed you need to if you're going to issue a billion you have to have at least 1.5 billion in offers I don't know if that the the the the the the the the calculation of the government that they wouldn't have that or if they would have put a billion for sale and they would have only say like 40 of it that would have been perceived as the markets as more more damaging than beneficial so I think this all kind of plays out on why it has been has been installed uh but the reality is that it it hasn't happened and and there's nothing being constructed in the place where Bitcoin city is going to be as far as I understand I think El Salvador also now has an 800 million dollar Bond due in January so given that the the Bitcoin Bond hasn't happened what do you think will happen at that point I think the government will find a way to deal with the the generally Bond but the thing is a lot of finalists in The Market says that when a country comes to say well we're going to be able to make it to January it's not a a thing of if it will default but when it will I mean you you can pass the hurdle in January but when will that hurdle become again and El Salvador it's not about it's not just about January come September it starts have an 18-month period where there are several uh loans that they're being matured and bonds that need to be paid uh in a situation that is not ideal for example and that has been accumulated by years old debt yes but also support by the the spend and the the incontrollable span of the booker Administration so they need to find a way to deal with it yeah the government says there's zero possibility that the country will default other people Bloomberg says uh that after Sri Lanka El Salvador is the number one candidate to default next and and this is a trend that we're seeing worldwide so nobody knows what will happen in the future I don't think the country it will probably not default in January because of some signals that we're seeing but the the financial situation does not I mean life goes on after that maturity that that Bond matures in January and the the whole situation the financial situation is not going to be sustainable it doesn't look that is sustainable at the long term and at the rate of the Kelly government spends so I I think that's basically that's his Achilles heel that the of his administration his politically unvulnerable doesn't seem to to lose any Steam on the polls his popularity doesn't decrease but the economic situation is it is going to be where uh where things crunch for him and the population I think so another issue was that El Salvador reportedly spent about a hundred million dollars on bitcoin to buy a total of it's slightly less than 2 400 Bitcoins now the value of those Bitcoins is about 47 million so it's a loss of more than 50 million dollars and as we've been talking about you know El Salvador is deep in debt it's owned dollar bonds are trading at 35 cents on the dollar so what impact do you think that the loss in the value of the Bitcoins will have on this whole financial situation the first thing I would say with that Laura is that we aren't really sure if we have spent the 100 million dollars in in Bitcoin I mean what we have from president buclair tweets uh that says we bought Bitcoin but we never have seen a receipt we don't have the the address of the wallet we don't know if he has sold Bitcoin he remember he saw he he's he actually built a pet hospital and he said that he had done it with the earnings of Bitcoin and maybe I'm just naive and I don't know how well this works but how can you make profits of Bitcoin if you're not selling the coins uh so I I don't know he's he explained that it was some sort of accounting trick but then the finance ministry said no for building the hospital we did sell some coins so you have bought this amount of points like close to 2400 how many of those did you sell to build the hospital have you sold anymore I mean this is so a huge nebulous thing which again is anti the principles of Bitcoin of transparency and open sourcing and and I mean we should be able to know what the government is spending on we should be able to to see what the government is spending our money on because people like to say okay money it's all all our money it's all our tax base or or loans that we will eventually have to pay as a country so that that's the first thing I would argue but in the event I think in the unlikely event bukel has bought all the Bitcoin that he has announced to have bought the other thing is a matter of priorities is a country where a fourth of the population is poor is it morally correct to buy Bitcoin which is going to be an investment in the future but it's taking away resources from projects that are needed now not in the future I don't know maybe this is why I always argue maybe Finland should buy Bitcoin and experiment with that maybe you know Sweden or uh Switzerland they they should experiment with that but a country like El Salvador where a couple of weeks ago we had floodings in the emergency area of the largest public Hospital in the country or where I know the hundreds of people immigrate to the United States every day because they don't have economical opportunities here or there are hundreds of students thousands of students that don't get admitted because there are not enough positions in the in the university in the National University every year or the where teachers are in this in these conditions is a country with those conditions supposed to be spending on a speculative asset that might or might not come reap benefits in the future I think that's a question worth asking so in addition to the values of the Bitcoins that El Salvador owns losing their value obviously um now that Bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador the loss in the value might even affect how salvadoran's perceive Bitcoin or maybe it's just something that really isn't on their radar even though it has technically been adopted as legal tender so do you feel that seeing the loss in the value of Bitcoin has had any material effect on how Salvadorans perceive Bitcoin I was in a small town maybe 20 30 kilometers away from Salvo or a couple of weeks ago and I was talking to a farmer who was he he has a couple of a piece of land where he cultivates like bell peppers and tomatoes and things like that so as I asked him he he was an immigrant he was he spent from 1989 to 95 in La his kids are now in California and I said hey uh what do you think about Bitcoin and he said I don't really like it I I I'd rather have dollars and I think I made a good decision now that Bitcoin is really low and I was really surprised that 76 year old man who said uh kind of saying I dodged a bullet there because I didn't get into it it's there but when I usually go around the corner because I'm so deep into this crypto coverage I I I I ask around kind of tongue-in-cheek saying Hey do you take Bitcoin uh in waiting out what people were going to say and some of them are nice and say hey no thank you or and as long as they are trying to say oh yeah we haven't gotten around to accept me yet but people really it it legal tender and it's mandatory according to Allah but it was never enforced like that and and that's an important person I think an important part of why it's not important like that because the government should be able to could do it and and they have proven they have this authoritarian pain that could make us all accepted but they saw that this is unpopular and because really concerned about his polls and he said if I try to impose do you imagine that that dystopia of policemen enforcing people to accept Bitcoin because this will liberate you this this didn't really happen buchella himself found a lot of opposition from the crypto Community uh on the part of the being mandatory and impose imposed currency so they didn't really enforce it and people nowadays kind of just brush it off I mean yeah it's legal turn tender is mandatory but almost nobody does transactions in it so uh yeah whatever that's kind of the basic attitude so in general what would you like the Bitcoin Community to know about the difference between the perception of bitcoin's impact in El Salvador and the reality if if it does something for the Bitcoin Community is that it enforces the the fact that this should come from the people the the the the isn't this a movement that comes from activists and people concerned about a Dozier State and privacy and people who are being prosecuted by the states and trying to separate and gaining more freedom from the government so what happens when a government is the Enthusiast well El Salvador is the only example I think I don't know how things are going in central Africa I mean imagine that that's a whole different reality but in here it doesn't really work when it is imposed maybe try and do efforts of people adopting it voluntarily willingly and not because we have to and the other thing is that uh there's a whole construct of Bitcoin being this tool for Financial Freedom in the world might be the case in other places but what I always say is Financial Freedom does nothing for salvaders if we don't have political freedom freedom of expression uh we are now the country with the most with the highest per capita incarceration rate because the government has arrested like 50 close to 50 000 people in the last three months is the freedom the Bitcoin promises only financial only monetary are we going to be put against a corner with all of our other Liberties taken away but we will have Bitcoin so that's good and we should be thankful for it that that's the thing Bitcoin cannot fix El salvoir because the problems are bigger than this and I really would encourage the bitcoiner and the crypto Community to be more skeptic about the government and as you like to say don't trust what the government is saying but verify and so as we said at the beginning when you started covering all this you didn't really know anything about Bitcoin and you've had to go through this big learning curve so I know obviously so much of your coverage has been about El Salvador and its relationship to bitcoin but I'm sure along the way you've just learned about Bitcoin itself and I was wondering if we can just separate out everything you know that we've been talking about El Salvador and what's been happening with Bitcoin if he were to just look at Bitcoin what is your opinion of it now I think it's an interesting technology I think especially if you would you if you were to do it with transparency and you have a clear goal and you and you have a I I control the environment I mean I mean like a control way of doing it not not rushing it into it or not spending like a madman who caught the crypto fever I think it has interesting possibilities is the possibility of sending remittances with lower fees than the traditional service interesting and important for salvadones yes it is should we invest or or explore the blockchain technology for storing digital information and for digitizing the the the the public records I think yes we're cool it's interesting I'm I'm not saying economy and I again I don't want to deny how people in other latitudes use it but the whole experience of how it has happened in El salvor it's a hard trauma to recover from and not only just for me but for all Suburbans I've talked to people who are enthusiastic like good people who are really into this and enthusiasts about Bitcoin and and they go out into the country science and try to educate people to use Bitcoin and they say that before the Bitcoin law the main problem was that people heard Bitcoins and thought about a scam and nowadays they say that the the the after Bitcoin law the problems they encounter is that they talk about Bitcoin they think Bitcoin is chivo they think Bitcoin is going to drain their money because of what their prior experience with chivos has been so I think there's also a really interesting lesson of how governments can help Bitcoin maybe stay out of the way if you don't know how to do it properly I I I think it's early stages maybe I don't know I have a couple of Bitcoin wallets and I have I I still have like the equivalent of ten dollars if someday in the future I'm able to buy a Tesla with it I'm gonna be very grateful of Bitcoin but we'll we'll have to wait and see all right well this has been an extremely Illuminating conversation I really appreciate you coming in the show
