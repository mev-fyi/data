this crazy crypto universe obviously at the intersection of it all are the media folks and the PR and reps reppin these companies trying to get the word out and then the media folks who are trying to sift through that which is real and that which is hype and so we'll be exploring a lot of issues that face folks on the PR side of things and the journalists side of things and so we have some of the top folks in the space from both PR and media Iowa each one introduce themselves starting with Lee Quinn I'm a business reporter at coin desk hi I'm Jill Richmond I'm the SVP at spark chain and I also and the co-founder of an organization called data which is the digital asset trade association my name is Trey ghetto and I run a PR firm called ditto and probably half of our businesses somewhere in the crypto blockchain and ICS face my name is Lauren and I'm a crypto journalist and I host the podcasts Unchained and I've confirmed and I'm Francisco Chaparro I'm a finance reporter at Business Insider covering crypto market structure and a few other things that are less interesting than that before we stop over here I was talking to Jill about you know where does the onus fall right when it comes to fraud and other issues that you know have popped up in this space you know do media representatives of these companies have a responsibility to sort of make sure that you know their clients aren't not necessarily engaging the various activities but you know you know high P type gimmicky type stuff or is it to shine light on important stories so I'll let Jill sort of kick off what her thoughts were on that oh yeah sure I mean I think the biggest issue so let's look at the ecosystem a little bit right so on one hand you have all these publications that are actually not essentially regulating themselves and are seen as top publications in the crypt space and are happy to take pay-for-play press releases and treat them as as newsworthy and what happens with all of these companies is these companies use them as optics they put them on their website you know they say such such publications sponsor you know is given them kind of the stamp of approval in the repeat publication and I first think that it's the responsibility of the publications themselves that need to be a little bit you know self regulatory so to speak right and it's it's kind of part of the entire problem within the ecosystem and then I think we sort of landed somewhere around being worried about what's happened to the press release right that the press release may in fact be completely dead because I asked you where you get your information and how it works during your during your day and the reality is press release isn't it well so because it's not the most effective way to communicate in a space because Trust is some point relationships are so important and a press release isn't really a person right you know when I am looking for a story I'm looking for something that I can press and at the end of the day that's a you know maybe it's one line in a Twitter DM or maybe it's a quick phone call from someone I know really well we're joined now by excellent reporter from Barron's and you care to introduce yourself and maybe weigh in I sure AM obvi salesman I'm a reporter at Barron's writing for the magazine and website on stocks and economics but also increasingly about crypto and blockchain and yeah it's a it's a tough space to cover I think that it's been really fun building relationships in the past year I think that yeah press releases don't necessarily make much of a mark because you're sort of always starting from zero but if if I can sit down with someone for 15 minutes get a sense that you know that their project is something worth worth following it's more likely that maybe you know down the road I'd write about it I think that you know it's writing about ICO is or writing about projects before you sort of watch them develop can be really difficult I mean you know so let me let me take the other side of the argument then which is one thing I've learned I like working with all these ICS we're talking earlier is is most people out there crypto like have no idea how a story gets written like we all talked about like they're like us so I write the story for the reporter we're gonna write it together and I was a former reporter at the AP in Dallas and so I've always thought like a press release is for the press and I do think probably like people here like wondering like what do I do like how does PR work and I do think the the press release has a purpose besides trying to get a story it's also about educating your community right so if you're in an ICO and we've got you know X thousands people on telegram and you need to be like keeping in touch with them I think it's okay to write like good press releases we're gonna be at this event we're speaking here we have a new adviser and it's just so what I've seen it's like the icos are using these as just content opportunities to keep their community like updated on what they're doing and a lot of times I like I'll never even send it to a reporter one of the issues your health well one thing I want to go back to is this pay-for-play issue that's going on which is I really think that the crypto media needs to take responsibility for the fact that there are a number of publications out there that focus exclusively on the crypto space and what they do is they take pay-for-play which means that they take payment for articles to be published that are not marked as sponsored they're not marked as advertisements and that's why sometimes you'll see this coverage that is like clearly sketchy that hasn't dug deep into what's going on I've seen people comment like well what about wah wah like you know kind of pointing out the the areas where they didn't you know where the reporter neglected to mention like oh by the way they're also doing this sketchy thing over here and the reason is because I know behind the scenes what's going on is that they're taking money for these protists and that they're you know obviously then not going to publish anything we you know that as the as one of the leading or I started to write this like investigative story about it but I'd like to money things I was doing it forms it never got to publish it just hasn't gone to the masses yet why have these you know we all know the names right we all know which semi trade pubs she's talking about right but how did they get that credibility and what is our job as media professionals to sort of chip away at it and and to make sure that do we all only right and so I think therein lies some of the first like the first problems right because as Laura rightly points out you know you've got these publications we all know that there behind the scenes there's credit a lack of credibility and a lack of protocol on the lack of all of the above but the rest of the sort of the rest of the population who's trying to you know educate themselves about projects about cryptocurrency about the you know about you know the business stories are reading these publications and they don't know that they're not credible and I know is there is there's a question of values that are within the organization so yeah yeah I mean like we definitely have things that would be like quote-unquote fake news and maybe we can recognize that but readers can't but we also have some players in the space that are trusted and respected that aren't doing the due diligence that they should and so there's a lot of confusion right like there there is no clear-cut standpoint about what is sponsored content in the space that the way that there are and other kinds of of branded content if you read a fashion magazine you very clearly understand the relationship that Vogue has with these designers but you don't understand the relationship that crypto publications have with the company is themselves yeah so again I'll probably take the other side to this again which is like earned media alone isn't gonna solve your problems or like is it a solution to whatever you're trying to sell and I think I'm sorry what is earned media like I offer you a client to talk to and you write a story it's just non-paid okay I think a PR phrase right that people like what does that mean so so on one hand as a PR person though I have to play in the murky waters that that are that exists and so wait why I think I think you can put your own rules out there and be like I'm not gonna engage in paper play order right well you can have that standard yes because I think that's one of the thing I mean arguably you know the first thing that happens what I'm sort of sitting down with the client is you know where where do we think that paid plays within this entire strategy and I'm often lights mean you're doesn't need to know it doesn't I don't want it playing within the strategy I talk about the table isn't it the outlets responsibility to sort of create those standards maybe not necessarily the business folks or really just you know getting paid yeah I wonder clients you something like across media we're seeing the sponsored content it's becoming a thing right the New York Times has that corpse has been like me maybe publication they but it's clearly marked as exactly I don't see why you know you but they don't run those TV show they don't run those websites they don't run those publications no they do it like like BuzzFeed that you know they were their own team doing that no I mean like the PR folks who are getting their clients paid media you know they don't run those they don't call the shots to have those indications of know but they can choose to respond certain adding we don't that is Mark sponsor versus you know saying oh we declined to have sponsored content and is not March sponsored that's like that's Shady they couldn't they can choose to say we're not gonna do that for our clients like if the project is really good enough then the project wouldn't mean that kind of great coverage yeah but that also gets into like what the media does and doesn't cover the media doesn't always cover good projects right I mean there's lots of good projects there's no way to cover every every good one out there so if if again like if 50% or 75% of what I do is like honest earned media and then there's a podcast over here that you know it's all pay to play and I have a legitimate credible client and is it marked paid question no a lot of the podcasts are not paid they're not marked paid yeah but most of the credit they really excellent experts don't don't think you have to do that so can we just talk about like what the media is there for a minute because I feel like we talk about it like it's the Mossad or the FBI has if we're all coordinating together and has a secret initiative I think a lot of people in crypto Twitter would think that in the you know makes me think of the question that I was going to raise which is you know you see throughout the Twittersphere the you know the fart and the you know a lot of anger towards certain outlets that have interesting graphs tweeted at all hours of the night I won't name the me the organization but is there a focusing now on the journalists are some of them not doing their due diligence where are they sort of missing the ball because there is sort of and and maybe it's chilling out a little bit now but ever since I entered this space writing about it a year ago there is a really broad skepticism much more so than of like I see a journal or you know CCN as an example there's much more skepticism of CNBC coin even coin desk and yes and cider then there is are these other things is that something that we're doing wrong or what do you think is the impetus for that yeah I mean I think on the other side of the spectrum what I worry about is when some mainstream media kind of hype things too much because here we have these like everyday investors that are buying this stuff and they don't fully understand things you know I thought people might know that like I think there are very legitimate questions to raise about XRP and I've had people say to me oh but it's the third largest crypto and I'm like now they're one hundred billion units people think like oh it's cheap because it's less than a dollar and they don't understand it can be overpriced at 80 cents or thirty cents or even ten cents or you know whatever they don't get these things and so like I sometimes see some of the coverage where it's like boom the price went up and like you know they make it sound like it's so excited as hell you borrow a little bit like oh no no like please point out like these are all the ways that can go wrong or like you know there's there's just a lot of nuance in this space in the system it's when I see things like headlines I just got really worried like people are going to lose their money on this stuff like you need to be careful how you cover it has that ever snow right in their stories that you know cryptocurrency investing is very risky right hello I was part of the group that like instituted that I was like I think we should put something in there just to like make people realize but this is a very new space I'm like you can very easily lose your money so something's a good point for like you too though is that most of the stories you all right don't really have like someone that's like bearish they don't have like a naysayer and it right it's like to goldman guys start amazing company and that's the entire story there's no to be sure in the lawyers there's no source that says that's bad journalism so what you're saying is there's bad journalism and i agree with you it exists i always try to get somebody on the upper yes so why this project might be you know [ __ ] or something yeah why it might not work out or but I think what you're pointing out about this fear about there being again bad coverage and overhyped coverage click Beatty coverage again really points back to the concept of what media is and we need to remember that it's an industry and we can all make fun of CNBC only one but the fact is they're paying salaries and that's a business strategy and so we think about you know it's the media's responsibility to this it's the media's responsibility to that it's immediate responsibility to pay our employees and to me it's a business model it's not exactly so maybe it's we goose it still goes to the heart of a business model problem right yes you know during your day and whatever time you're trying to push out a story how much time do you have and I think it's it's certainly one that needs to happen as soon as you're doing a story Laura I know you do excessive and really good coverage making sure that we're getting all in the angles of this story I've seen many outlets and I wonder if it's just because it's a matter of you know incentives are not aligned financial incentives are not like to the jerk you know for the journalists to do that additional diligence coverage third party in from a mean right instead of just covering right market in the market cap right is that your experience you know it depends on what audience you're writing for I think everyone's audience is very different so my audience I think there are a lot of people very skeptical of the space so it you know if you come at it with that understanding I think you write about it understanding that it's a high bar for your readers to clear to say that this is something that's worth watching so I think that's really important I'm talking about like the audience that you're writing for and how that impacts what they do right if you're writing you write for an audience that they come to you for high-quality content and are not coming to you for everything every day we're talking to the general mainstream public you're trying to get as much out as you possibly can and you're actually selling the audience to advertisers right you are not you sell the product of content most media companies sell the product of audience and so that will drive completely different kinds of stories it will drive clickbait these stories it will drive stories that don't require that kind of they don't get that kind of fact-checking that they need because their objective is not to serve the audience is to serve an audience whatever they can do to get that audience and a lot of these issues though they're not really crypto specific they're down to the day when we think about you know maybe the hyperbolic in the space yeah yeah it's really just you know shining a light on some of the issues that exist in media today how do we get those views how do we get those clicks but like you said yeah I think maybe amplified a bit yeah thank you about underestimate readers because I do think that they do go for quality mm-hmm you know so I wouldn't say it like they only go for this stupid headline I don't think they only go for a stupid headlines no not at all I children why are so many stupid headlines being written yeah well that's what I want to I'm the moderator there's all different kinds of audiences right so there are definitely audiences who come with a very thoughtful approach and there are audiences that don't so I do think that some audiences want high quality content I think some audiences don't understand what it is they're looking for with high quality content and that's can I ask a question which is Laura do you feel like you write for a very sophisticated audience or that you think you think the podcasts are really or a little bit more of a sophisticated audience well so the podcast probably are yeah but when I wrote I tried to write for you know a broad audience yep and definitely certain articles really really really took off and got a lot of views so I don't think it was like the kind of thing where only sophisticated people could could could come and understand them and know there was something else I was gonna to see earlier Oh which was just like you know when we're talking about kind of like only writing a story that's basically just a headline and like doesn't go into the nuances like I think you know that's dangerous also because you have to remember that no reader is as into this world as we are so if you don't try to get those nuances in they're really not gonna get them you know like we may know all these kind of ins and outs and you know that not everything is like a foregone conclusion in the space you know that like the coin really could fail or aetherium could feel or whatever but they're not going to get that and so I do think about why it's important to like get those there's a little responsibility to be more explicit about some of the things that we take for granted I think I think that's right moving more towards the PR side of things to focus on all aspects of the space and a pretty simple question but for folks out there aspiring building some sort of project what do you think is you know key to helping get their message out there from both the PR perspective and the journalist perspective if someone came up to you said how effectively get on a coin desk or business and saidar or barons or on Laurens podcast what is the answer to that question well I I mean we had this conversation so I would pre mean conversation but I think for I always tend to look at the company and then focus on the people right so it's a lot easier for me to tell the story of look this person came former PayPal executive doing X Y & Z former you know credit quiz credit suisse try you're doing etc etc let me let me happens to have exceptional industry knowledge and are now entering a new space to solve a very specific problem it's a lot easier for me to sit down with journalists and go hey as you said by the way Frank I just want to let you know so and so was that PayPal was an executive at PayPal is doing X Y & Z and you're like oh really interesting that is a lot faster to get to you than it is to write you know a really long pitch story about the company and also in it it starts to generate the entire credibility piece which is like this is something this is a company these are people these are founders will understand the problem that they're solving they've been in this industry for an exceptional mental feel like I'm taking very how these things but that is at least that's sort of the first is it more about the people for you when you write about you know thinking about there's more profile like pieces as opposed to you know Jamie Dimon pontificating at nauseam what is it for you that attracts you to writing a profile Friday is it the people right those are two very personal specifically I think I was gonna be really tricky write a profile has to be somebody who already has clout in the space it's already got a lot of traction behind them already has a resume that gets people's attention but if you have a project that doesn't have a high profile person and you need to do the work and if you're doing something really interesting and you actually are changing people's lives and actually serving customer needs then I will do my best to give you five minutes of my time to sell me on this like to convince me that you deserve coverage even though other people haven't covered you before and I found stories that I felt like we're really great and I'm glad I gave those people the time of day because before they came to me and tried to get me to pitch XYZ software they went and they had a group of people and they actually solved their problem yeah so and I think like I mean not everyone has it like a PayPal executive on their on their team exactly so what are you doing you don't so and here's what's crazy too is like these people come to me and they have started a company that like like potential clients yeah like new business new client that starting company no one's ever heard of before like you ever talked to the press before no so they've never talked to the media before there's like zero like awareness at all and then all of a sudden they're like can you get me on Lauren's pod can vision and so and what's even funnier is that the industry that they're trying to change like through blockchain or whatever they don't really have any experience in as well so like we had that we did this like I co out of Brazil and and and they were was impacting kind of like how we invest for retirement and the first time told them was do you have like a financial spokesperson like if we're gonna be reaching out and talking about like you know how blockchain can help in investing like you need an investment expert so I think the first thing y'all should do and you're thinking about like oh how am I gonna get media coverage is I think you make sure you have like a credible spokesperson and then I think also like and you know I mean I work with you all the time I think it's also about just being a good source you know when Jamie Dimon says something right like send a reporter like five smart sentences about what you think that means right like when they're breaking news happens in crypto and it's always the same thing it's a hacking it's Jamie Dimon bitcoins up or down and it's Goldman Sachs dude interesting spanks and like it's the same for stories every month and so like your ability to likely think about like saying something smart and giving it to a reporter and like helping them by giving them value like I'm sure you guys get emails all the time and if you're emailing a reporter and you're not giving them any value I know please don't do it send them something smart like explain to them in like three sentences like what you're doing if you're if you're pitch to a reporter it's like over three paragraphs it's just it's just not gonna get read on a second I just like throw something out there you don't even have to write a full email if you can tell me in bullet points that I need to know I like that maybe other reporters don't I do I do know well like slide into my DMS

learn more I see a question in the audience and since I am slightly in charge I will take the question what's the question well there's some really great journalists on this panel I'm much thanks I think that they're I think I think the problem was if I can opine for a few minutes or a few seconds I think the space early on you know the the problem lies in the fact that traditional media outlets with the exception of a few folks didn't really pay enough attention to the space and identifying projects outside of you know maybe in 2016 Bitcoin somehow went up to a thousand dollars or something or whatever the price was at that point and it would get one article maybe now we're seeing I mean I followed Jonathan he's a he's a traitor on Chicago as a newsletter I mean there were times over when the thing was running up to 20,000 that 70% of the newsletter would be crypto news so I think what happened was there was a void right back then that was filled in by the youtubers by the tweeters by their you know who's it's what's ever you know blockchain Joey blockchain whatever and and the media the traditional media wasn't paying attention doing their details but it's a new snottiness getting right it's just there's only so many reporters that can like come into this space at a time and its new and so there are new reporters there's a growing number of reporters and so I think you're just gonna see the coverage you know I think mature and probably be more robust you know over time well be like a hundred more Asians in like five years God willing so I just want to because we're gonna actually put this on a podcast I just want to recap what the critical question was which was I guess somebody emailed me about it was like a kind of a scam that you were trying to tell me about like page yeah I thought like pay saying that it wasn't real so I might remember this I'm just people just as people know because I do get so many messages I literally get like a million messages I like I can't even get to explain how many messages I get and there is so much noise and because I'm busy doing things I may not read your email as you know closely as I want or have time to investigate there's a lot of these investigative things they take a lot of time that's the other thing stuff my plate is already full at that moment which pretty much any week he will find me with like a super super full plate so that's why unfortunately like I do get notified about scams I do get notified about a gazillion really interesting projects like all kinds of things do I always have the time to you know put into it that I wish I didn't know unfortunately Addo the really interesting thing though about the crypto space is that that was figured out like pretty pretty quickly no and what took a month okay but there were some other ones where I've been notified about things and then like within 24 to 48 hours I will see something you know the community figures it out so maybe that one took a little bit longer but but it's also like I mean sorry the audacity of you to be like why didn't you respond to my email you it's like and I think like and I don't you shouldn't annoy reporters but like if they don't respond here email they didn't tell you no and and it just means like email them again the next week was something like new and different and better right it's like like you have to build this relationship with a reporter by like going to them on a regular basis not annoying them good cases a little bit different is he wasn't trying to promote his project he was trying to like get me to warn the community that's in which is like a little bit of a different thing I guess turning the wheels a little bit and focusing on something slightly different but connected given that you have a much more broader mandate right it's similar to myself do you think that and you know connected to sort of how much media coverage there actually is at this space given how small it is let me at the end of the day we're only talking what is the latest four hundred billion market cap of the whole the whole thing I mean are there too many stories being written on it are we not focusing on you know scams that could be taking place at the big Wall Street banks because we're too busy learning about Bitcoin I think that coverage sometimes is there's overlap a little too much so like the gentleman over there said he's talking about specific coins that may or may not be a scam I think that there's sort of a hole in that coverage I think that there's an entrepreneurial journalist could fill that hole to some degree to talk about sort of more for the community and if it's if it's legitimate I know coin does does a lot of good stuff specifically about coins but there could be someone even more granular getting into that kind of stuff for my readers that you know calling out a scam on a coin that's worth a few million dollars is not they're not going to be interested because they're not buying it so it doesn't protect them per se but so it really you know from my audience it's just a little bit different as to what gets the level where it's gonna catch their attention so I think there are big holes in the coverage but I do think that sometimes we all cover the same things to some degree discuss it rises to a level of interest it has a name that people are interested in so there's I think you know it's a tricky space right now I think that but I think there are entrepreneurial journalists obviously Laura's filling an enormous niche and there are other people though who could come in in other parts of that niche I mean this is an incredibly exciting entrepreneurial area where there are people who need to call out the BS and they're people who need to promote some of the more promising projects but just whatever the news of the day yeah and it's not necessarily gonna be you know my publication which will still cover this area a lot you know obviously there are several unicorns now that's it's it's a really exciting and for Denari but we're not gonna cover it on the ground you wrote granular level but somebody should I think so I think what's your take yeah can I like it's a business right we are employing people are selling people there are so many nonprofit journalism organizations that if if you really want more coverage or something pay nonprofits be an active part of their community there are organizations that are actively seeking out readers to participate in the development of their strategy and make it worth their time show them that you are willing to engage that you're willing to pay for high quality content that focuses on this issue because businesses will sell what people will buy right so if you want a certain kind of coverage be an active participant in the community and you know you mentioned there are so many great things with people do just by calling things out on social media and being contributing to the space Matt way you don't have to be in PR you don't have to be a journalist or go write it yourself I mean like half of what we do is on the content side it's like again I can only get you in front of so many reporters like in the span of our relationship but like you know whether it's medium or hacker noon or just like a blog on your website like start writing on your own and there's like so many different ways that you can promote that stuff whether it's through social media paid and earn social channels I like you have the ability to create your own really good content if you see something going on in the space and I really appreciate it when people do that I do appreciate it when people go and they create content that they've researched something that they've showed something and sometimes I can use that that's the gate further it gives me clues of where I can look so it's a good thing to do I don't think that's a bad thing at all today woman no another thing I want to added by investigative stuff we've got Nathaniel popper at the New York Times I think is doing really good work in that regard so he's one of the few that those anti at Reuters and our orders is killing it good stuff yep yeah those are those are two people to follow a great great exception of journalists what has been your favorite story that you've written and your favorite story that you pitch that have done right probably my favorite story was the phone and I Jack in one just because that was the most that had the most impact and that unfortunately is still going on where people if you don't know what I'm talking about they get their phone numbers stolen via mm-hmm like a customer service agent basically at their cell phone provider giving the number to the hacker and then the hacker goes to like their email or their Twitter or their Facebook or whatever and clicks forgot password' and then has the code sent to the phone number which is now in the hackers possession or which you know all that calls and texts are going to their phone and then they changed the password and locked them out of their email Twitter Facebook etc it's happening I mean it just happened last week - Ryan sulcus who was on my XRP episode so that was a big story and I think it hopefully helped a lot of people to protect their crypto to know that that was going on and that they needed to do that for their phone numbers awesome favorite pips that that's a hack my stories I mean and I like live in the weeds of PR like I'm I like to actually do the work which is kind of separates me from us PR people and so like a1 and like you know whether it's Frank or Li you know it's like news of the day like email one of my clients give me a good quote about this send it to you guys the story like you know gets like you know updated and emotes in there like like that daily thrill like I mean that's like a PR person I'm just like I'm working hard and getting [ __ ] done you know I think like on the on the part that bigger so I just like I think like working with Nellie Bowles on a couple stories that are about sand so I'm sure she will find the truth and in the story as well so yeah favorite picture favorite story or favorite sort of likes story that you pitched him you know one of your clients got it you know it was actually I mean it wasn't even a stir it wasn't even a story that we pitched but it was nice to hear a project that I care a great deal about which is a which is a client called or orchid protocol which was I know mentioned on your on your podcast Laura I know it's a company that you've been in front of a few times and certainly haven't told about but it's a company it's a company that I care about that I'm following I'm paying a lot of ten but a lot of attention to what they're doing and you know it was it was nice to hear Laura actually mentioned the reasons why she passed over at the time and was still looking into it so for me it was it helped me understand a little bit a about the project B you know right now you know they're there they're certainly very quiet deliberately but it's a project that I care about so by the way I am interviewing them at that Oslo Freedom Forum in a couple weeks and that episode on my podcast say he'd stay tuned for that very cool before I even do mine can I call it one of yours I really liked Laura you did an article about people who were lying in their pitch decks claiming they had advisors and investors that they did not have and that was just a really high super shady thing going on all the time and ICO sleaze like deviously meant I'm an advisor yes it's terrible so everyone in this table knows that that happens right and we know what happens every day because we see it but we don't write about it because we could assume everyone else did and you did it in such an excellent way of just describing to the public what we see and exposing something that should not have been happening and I just think you were on point reminds me of that meme you ever see the mean with the like guy who has his hair different in each picture exactly what story you read okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna tie it and it's actually two different series I was really excited about the series I did about crypto currency in Iran because I think we talked about about censorship resistance and we talked about it like a concept we forget they're real people on the planet that need that kind of technology and are using this technology today so I was really excited to hear about people in Iran who are actually able to do business across borders with people who otherwise could not have done business with them and that it's actually helping them feed their families and another one would be the series I've done about sex workers sex workers is another community that is actually using crypto for the censorship resistance that we built it for and they've been doing it I learned about cryptocurrency a lot before it became a big thing from them it wasn't me coming with any genius idea it like people needed that people need to have the ability to store their assets when they can't be discriminated against because the fact the matter is is that people genuinely are discriminated against and I'm really excited when I can highlight the way that this technology can be used for good and not only can but is today now has been I love all of my stories equally I like my children I don't have children I think I think you know the best stories for me are the you know I think it ties in to what Trey was saying it are the scoops that you know really take the hustle and the grind to get them out the door most recently last week I published that point base was moving to support colocation and do a lot of other things to learn high frequency traders and this week they pitched it to everybody and everybody was a week late to the news but I got a last week those are the best stories I think my first cover story on Bitcoin where I kind of mapped for the we have you know lots of hundreds of thousands of investors who read the site and to read the magazine and who are not familiar with the space so I mapped it and showed the connections between traditional finance and in crypto finance and kind of put together diagrams that I got a lot of good feedback on people said oh I never understood how you know hedge funds actually work in the spacer so that that was kind of a is before we got on we were talking about how you know PR folks get a lot of flack for some of the things they might do wrong but when we think about reporters right there's a huge information gap from you know maybe a lot of TV folks might not necessarily writing folks but how do you sort of navigate that TV from the movie it's like this is the trickiest like space because and I'll talk quickly because I thought about this for a while on the TV side a producer's job is like news of the day let's say like CBC it's like markets news of the day and they're just not afforded the opportunity to go any deeper you know than that so if you're gonna be on TV it's probably gonna be like top-line news whatever is going on and they kind of moving over the print side there are and it's hard could you like you want to reach out to a reporter and and a lot of times like I don't know if you eat this reporter even understands block J then so it's like do I have to explain it to them first and then am i insulting them at that and it's that unusual from I mean I know you covered some tech companies too that aren't in this space I think it's just um again the space is new I think the number of reporters that are starting to cover this is going to keep growing and so there's there's people like on this panel that I can email me pretty straightforward get to the news and then there are reporters where I'm like having to explain blockchain to them you know before I even actually pitch the client so it's so it makes it hard there is like more uh noir undereducated reporters out there than educated reporters when it comes to this space and I think like the under educator reporter as I almost just like it's almost not even worth for me like pitching them because if they haven't written about blockchain now like what makes me think that they're gonna write about it in the next you know thirty days mm-hmm wasn't your experience a little bit I mean I think you know just piggybacking on what Trey said you know many times if we have broadcast networks that are obviously focused on news of the day then our clients were regularly speaking to them about being expert commentary right so it's we're sitting down and trying to get them to a place where they could very quickly you know comment about what they can comment on really appropriately and fit them in in an appropriate place and then maybe sort of spin it around in terms of their project right it sort of has to be this like here's your entry point right you can really you can really come in there and quote um hope you Jackie but you can come in you can talk about XY and Z and and round it back to you yeah somehow round it back to the implications of your project it's the first can the so the better that they are the more they can come back right the first thing your producer is gonna ask is like have they been on TV before so I was like anyone out here if you all want to be on like TV I would go and like go buy like a camera and just start doing videos of like of your like self like you know just talking about things like your ability to like send clips you know to a producer that shows like that you can you can handle your [ __ ] on TV like that's at least gonna get like a pinky toe in the door of new getting and getting on to national TV if you have no clips if you've never been on TV before you'll never be on TV mm-hmm there are there any questions in the audience is anybody sitting out something yeah go ahead what's your name were you from [Music] yeah so what's your question I guess the I guess it kind of plays into what you're saying and you need to have an ability to you know make a presence in to you know walk it and be a voice for the firm and that's not always gonna be the guys that are actually building out stuff right and let me just summarize that also for the podcast robed up the comment was basically that for a project to get media attention they often feel like they need to get fortune 500 executives to kind of speak to the project but then the real people that are building it are the developers for the team and so your concern is that the real people that are behind it what they're not getting the media coverage is that it do you have a question that you know so it's a that was actually an it's a bearish comment and I'm not gonna I'm gonna say something and then I think y'all could probably like middle half of it is like a year ago I was like what I was asking all these like crypto guys like what makes for a good ICO and then we like went through this whole list and then I was thinking about okay but what's the media interested in and there wasn't too much overlap between how do you spot a good ICO and then how do you get media coverage you know of that so I think there is like you do have to understand like yeah a good super technical project may not get the media coverage because it doesn't necessarily have the things that a reporter is always looking for what are those things I don't know if I agree with that I disagree as well I mean that way if there are good technical merits to the project then the reporters should be able to figure that out I mean they're like it definitely probably depends on the type of reporter but when I'm like looking at whether or not I'm gonna cover a project I'm Jeff looking at whether or not they have a fortune 500 you know exactly don't speaking well about them that's definitely not what's going to make me be like oh I should definitely cover this if anything that's like a red flag that maybe they don't have something good right you know what I what I do is like I've definitely talked to developers who've looked at the code who can point out to me like hey you know why I noticed these red flags and the github like you know these are other things that I am concerned about like oh you know I'm not sure about the way they're selling this or about the marketing like like there are a lot of other ways to assess projects that are kind of more substitutive and that's basically what I look into whether or not you know I'm going to cover something and how I'm going to cover it when we do it damnedest frankly to make sure that everyone who is behind a project that's in a room before worm equipped a quick thing you know the fortune 500 exact certainly on the technical side to line up both messaging and talking points so that at least they're they're a not off message and be not wrong right so I think to some extent to some extent we do the best job that we can as the agency of record to make sure that we're tying everything together as best as we can between the technical team and the executive team to make sure that the the thought leader the top the top the person who's basically talking on behalf of the company can speak accurately to the technicalities that I believe lots of the reporters do you want to hear certainly that certainly certainly Laura Shen and there's a whole great deal of other reporters that are taking deep dives into the company's technical did you know diligently so to speak cleanliness I also want to point out who are you wanting to talk to right so as a younger reporter I don't make the calls I have a boss and my boss wants to sells to a certain audience and I've written for about watching technology for several different editors at several different publications and I can tell you that the different ones what make us great story to one editor won't make a great story to the other editor so you need to think about who do you want to talk to and then for me this is just my personal bias I really care less about how famous the person is and care more about if they're actually solving a problem in doing something if you're not getting coverage go do the work get out there and make a change and then I'll go and report on that because it won't even need to come from you I'll hear it from people mmm that's interesting do you ever find that like a lot of time PR folks will try to clog your inbox what you need to talk to this expert you need to talk to this expert and you kind of think well if I really need to talk to him it wouldn't be you who's it making the introduction literally every day of my life isn't worth Li what do you think about that because that's how I see they go well you know if I really needed touches on to you know one of my close colleagues or connections in the crypto space about Frank you need to talk to this guy exactly I mean that's you know I don't remember when was the last time I was like oh yeah talk to this person that got pitch to me from a PR person like like I maybe never you know it's always like sources saying they're like you have to talk to so-and-so and especially when there's so much noise I mean I might be getting pitched good people I might be but like I'm not gonna figure it out when I get like so many PR pitches every day like it's like not gonna be possible but I get a signal like oh all these people that I think are smarter saying I should talk to so-and-so then that's exactly strong signal you have a question every day what's your right you mean time of day no no no timing is in how far should be out there should be a week before there probably isn't one right time yeah probably depends on a number of different factors gosh this is a good question I mean it may just depend on a reporter and what type of work they do because like now for my podcast you know I'm not gonna put like something that's just launching on the show right like I might do it on the shorter show maybe if there's like some compelling reason but you know I've a lot of I get a lot of pitches for announcements right now but you know I don't have any place where I'm writing that kind of story so I just I mean it's good that people are sending me that I want to keep abreast of what's going on but I'm not gonna immediately be like oh like you're launching this week I'm gonna stick it on my hour-long podcast like that doesn't make sense you know so it probably just depends on what the reporter does and you know what type about what they have but I think one thing that I would say is like when when a project is early-stage I think one good signal that I can get is like who the investors are if the investors are people where I know know they know what they're doing and they've got a ton of projects and they have a really high bar like like that at that point can say something to me about it you know what kind of promise this has so if you have good investors but it's early like it still might be worth letting people know about what's going on and generating buzz one other thing I will say about that though was that there is some there were some moments in the past one now I probably made the wrong call on this but I was being cautious about what I was mentioning earlier about how everyday people put their money into these thing with me might lend their money so there was a period where I didn't want to write about coins before the I see how so for instance like I knew about taste I was like you know nine or ten months before the ico and I thought about writing about them none but then I just thought nervous and you know just kind of was maybe too cautious and then wired eventually wrote about them but but you know that's maybe something else I mean now in this day like when there's so many I see that like I don't even know reporters have a dance user whether whether their stances to write about things before after the ICO but but that was something that I did consider at that time any thoughts I think for pitches for me at least if you're if someone says they're gonna revolutionize the shipping industry like I don't gonna need to talk to two people in the shipping industry who you have specifically helped I mean for me I don't it's just not gonna rise the level if I get that pitch every day seventy to seventy times a day like we're gonna revolutionize X well I want to talk to the guy on the ship right now like and if not I'm not there's no chance all right about it so there's just so much of that you need to show me the real world problem but I need to talk to they get person who is behind the real world problem who you're actually helping they need to Spain explain the exact mechanics of what problem they're having now and how this specifically helps them otherwise it's a non-starter because the stakes are so high because there's so much of it right I probably have three emails in my inbox from movie coin three different companies three different companies trying to revolutionize producing and it's like what's going on here you know and and it's not just you know the folks at the place is sending me an email they have representation and you know it's not their fault they don't know that there's all these projects in the exact same thing it's like you know how do you how then do you now you get that yeah hey can I just say something okay I also think if you're very early on and you don't have the kind of traction that we would hear about it otherwise naturally something that we've talked about before but it also is relevant to this is being a good source and building your relationship and being a resource I'm gonna be really spontaneous and I'm sorry for I'm gonna pick on you but it's in a good way so yeah exactly so I wrote about swarm and I was extremely critical of them and they were continued to be a great resource for me even when they didn't have than going on they were trying to promote and that to me says a lot so if something else comes up and you know maybe it's early on I understand like the relationship we have in which I can trust them to be resource to me and they know that I'm gonna be hard and that's okay they're not gonna ask me to write co-write the all stuff with me and I think that it goes a long way when you have something that's really early-stage is just letting actually being a resource to the reporter and not bombarding us when you don't have news but being available to us when we might have something that you have an expertise on that is maybe not related directly to your ICO or a launch and so that gets into to like you better not put all your eggs into like your launch basket right like no one here is sitting around waiting for you so you need to make sure that you have like a PR plan in place like we have a partnership announcement in two weeks we have a new advisor we're gonna announce we're gonna create our own survey like you need to be constantly going to reporters with interesting newsworthy stuff and you'll like again like it's not like some Rockets gonna go to the airs to be fireworks everywhere when you launch your company but I will say if you if you have a roadmap and a plan together a month over month over month you'll look back in six months and be like and we got two or three stories a month like that's 15 stories like it's doable but you have to like it takes it you have to do the work yeah and one other thing I would add is that probably for you know some some kind of like smaller piece of news like when you guys are more early-stage that like maybe that's something coin does recover because they're in the industry right but then it's only when maybe you're bigger I know more attraction than like a more mainstream outlook would could cover you and I'd say offer an exclusive to like just go to one reporter offer the exclusive and get your like flag in the ground story to like start the whole thing right or start or going back to providing expert commentary right which is okay no one's you're ico or your company launch but you happen to be an expert in this space and be willing to provide regular outstanding expert commentary right start to build your own respective ran and then you can back into the respective stories of your company and I think that gets into like having a good PR firm too because like your PR firm needs to understand this space as well like if they are not able to like help you with that forward vision if they're not able to like spot trends that are relevant to you like you you have to have people to let you know what they're doing one last question yes in the middle yes I'm right the question so he's basically asking like when we start getting into the the blockchain crypto space do we need a specific PR firm just for that correct yeah it's it's tough like we get a lot of referrals from other PR firms who have said you know what we don't know this space we know where our strengths lie and you know we're gonna hand it off you know Thomas and then we have other PR firms you know who are like hey you know I think I can do that work I can I can figure that out so it's it's tough I mean PR firms like I mean we like me we work for different we for chocolate we're two different here firms we've worked on similar projects together right and we've managed to juggle it the only thing let's say is weird we're a PR firm that's been around for 20 years so we understand you know the industry the tech industry enterprise consumer you know etc etc financial FinTech and so we can bridge the chasm right because we happen to have spark chain which is hyper focused on blockchain crypto digital era technology digital identity but we bring in teams within right the agency that don't have to compete with other agency right so that we can help fine-tune the messaging across the board right so you can have to be you've got to see our I think you should you know in a good business decision as hire someone who has experience and what you're trying to get them to do yeah but please make sure that your PR firms know what the responsibilities are I'll have a lot of companies where 3 PR firms will contact me for the same company true and it just makes me not want to talk with that company because every single thing I do I'll have to talk with other people working with enough make sure that you work with someone whose work with the other care firm right - something helps because they know how to chord mean make sure they're not stepping on each other's toes well on the interest of time I will wrap this up thanks so much for thinking that this was largest image [Music]
