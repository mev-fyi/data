Bloomberg intelligence welcome Elliot hey Laura how you doing good glad to have you here yeah thanks for having me I uh I listened to your podcast fairly frequently so it's nice to be on the other side great on Tuesday a panel of judges in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington heard oral arguments in grayscale's lawsuit against the SEC over its rejection of grayscale's Bitcoin ETF application give us the background of how this day in court came to be sure so you know there's a lot of really interesting legal cases uh in crypto these days and one of them involves uh this case um grayscale's petition challenging the sec's rejection of its uh spot Bitcoin ETF you know this goes back a few years I think the crypto Community has been clamoring for some sort of Bitcoin ETFs for a few years now the SEC rejected those applications for a long time and then finally in late 2021 and then again in 2022 they started approving applications for uh um Bitcoin Futures ETFs but to date they have not approved an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF and that discrepancy um was the impetus for this lawsuit uh or this challenge by grayscale and so on Tuesday during the hearing what were some of the arguments that you heard from both sides sure so you know grayscale's main argument is that um there's an inconsistency in um the standard that the SEC is applying because they approved uh uh Bitcoin Futures ETF but they have rejected spot Bitcoin ETFs and the argument is that you know because the underlying assets essentially are the same and derived from Bitcoin prices they should be treating these two products the same but they're not and as a result they're treating similar products differently and that to use the the legal phrase is arbitrary and capricious and violates federal law and then what about the sec's argument what were they saying sure well the sec's argument is you know that they they actually have been applying the same standard but the products are different that the that the Futures Bitcoin Futures Market is regulated by the cftc and so that they have some comfort that um there that they can detect fraud and manipulation um in the underlying market and be satisfied that that uh that the ETF won't be affected um but in contrast the spot Bitcoin Market is not regulated and so they don't have that same level of surveillance agreements with exchanges to make sure that there's no fraud or manipulation in the underlying market so one other thing that I wanted to raise here was just an interesting tidbit about grayscale's Council his name is Dawn farrelli who is he what's his background oh so Don's really is you know highly esteemed lawyer uh he was the solicitor general in the Obama Administration and was probably most famous for arguing the uh the Obamacare case in the Supreme Court which wound up going uh you know Indian the Obama administration's favor you know he he's a terrific lawyer he's got a very understated manner I would say in court but very respected very credible and I thought it did a really fine job yesterday on Tuesday when the case was argued so when that happened what kind of questions were you hearing from the judges so the the judges were really um digging in to um one particular issue and this this goes to um previous orders where the SEC approved these Bitcoin Futures ETFs and in those cases they said that if there was fraud or manipulation in the underlying spot Market it would show up in the Futures market and um as a result uh you know the SEC was able to approve those orders and they were wondering why that isn't the case now because in the grayscales application and in the sec's rejection order the SEC said actually if there is fraud and manipulation in the spot Bitcoin Market it's not going to show up in the Futures market and just because you have a surveillance agreement with the CME where Bitcoin Futures are traded you're not necessarily going to see that there's fraud or manipulation in the spot market and it's that discrepancy that the Gen is really focused on and they you know they they wanted the SEC to give them a satisfactory answer the SEC tried I'm not sure they convinced the judges though what was the sec's argument well the sec's argument is that even though there's this 99.9 correlation between the prices and the spot market and in the Futures Market uh they're not convinced that fraud in the spot Market would show up the same way in the Futures Market they never really clarified what that meant but they you know they said that grayscale needed to provide more empirical evidence of how fraud in the spot Market might manifest in the Futures Market um and and the judges pushed back on that quite a bit and said you know why why do they have to show that why is it not enough that the prices are correlated so extensively and in addition to that what type of you know empirical evidence do they need to show and the SEC um you know didn't really give a satisfactory answer for that in my opinion and so going into the hearing before you heard the arguments what were your thoughts about how you thought the case would go yeah so going in you know I I thought it was a close case I gave the SEC a slight Edge I thought grayscale had a 40 chance of winning prior to the argument you know and that in my mind I reflected that it was a close case I gave the edge to the SEC I thought courts generally deferred to agencies on issues like this because the agencies are the experts and courts are you know not quite as versed in insecurities laws and and um and things like that but coming out of the argument um you know I think uh grayscale is favored now and I give them a 70 chance to win a ruling from the court that vacates the sec's order rejecting their application primarily based on that one inconsistency that the judges were really honing in on is that why you changed your mind yeah that's that's a lot of it I mean it was sort of the tenor of the questions and the extent to which I I thought in this case didn't think the SEC convinced the judges that there was a satisfactory explanation for that inconsistency yeah and it definitely looks like the markets agreed with you because um afterward the gbtc price Rose and for quite a long time now it's been trading at below um the nav which reflected kind of the fact that people um you know felt like it wasn't actually as valuable an instrument to have as the underlying so that um now reflects more confidence that eventually holders of gbtc could be made whole and if they're buying at a discount now then that means that they'll sort of get free money if this becomes an ETF so in a moment we're going to talk about uh what the different outcomes could be but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible ever wanted to use D5 without being tracked railgun is the leading D5 privacy Solution on ethereum it's available on BSC

app at railway.xyz to find out more back to my conversation with Elliot so if the court rules and grayscale's favor um that doesn't necessarily mean that suddenly gptc would become a Bitcoin ETF so why don't you just outline like all the different possibilities of what could happen yeah and they actually talked about this at the argument um on March 7th it's not like the court is just going to issue a ruling saying bam uh you know bought Bitcoin ETFs is approved ready to go they'll most likely send it back to the SEC um they'll let you in order sending it back to the SEC for further review and language of in that ruling is going to be really critical because they can go a few ways they can send it back to the SEC and say you know you didn't give us a satisfactory reason for tuning these two products differently go back to the drawing board give us a better answer um and you know review the application again with that in mind right that that's one possibility another possibility is that they actually constrain the SEC a lot more and sending it back and say look you know based on you know the arguments made the facts that we've seen you know we don't see any way for the SEC to um reject this application again and so we're sending it back to you but essentially with the direction to approve the application the next go around but obviously there's still a chance that they rule for the SEC right I mean you know I think grayscale 70 likely to win this round but that obviously leaves an opening for the court to give to rule for the SEC right but but so let's explore this like if Grace scale were to win a little bit further um so potentially it could be either that um the the Bitcoin ETF is denied on another uh basis could anything happen to the Bitcoin Futures ETFs as a result of this you know whatever happens yeah that also came up in the argument and you know a couple judges asked about that you know if they do if they do um if they do vacate the order the sec's order and they say the SEC got it wrong theoretically there is the possibility that the SEC says okay well you know if if spot Bitcoin ETFs are not going to be able to um you know if we can't reject those then in order to be consistent um I mean in order to be consistent we'll also have to reject Futures uh Bitcoin Futures ETS which we've already approved I I find it hard to believe that the SEC is gonna go back on its previous approvals of Bitcoin Futures ETFs I think that ship has already sailed but it is a theoretical possibility it came up an arguments both side you know the SEC was unwilling to say exactly what it was going to do but the judges asked about it um and Don's have really mentioned it as a possibility as well and so earlier when I said that you know the price of gbtc Rose because potentially people are like oh like if I own this and I'm sort of getting these shares cheaper but it looked like you reacted and maybe didn't agree with me so yeah did you want to respond to that no no I I don't read too much into into my facial experience um but you know um but but we did see you know that um the discount did you know drop right there was the this kind of went from like 40 some or something like that when the argument started to you know low 30s by the time the argument ended so you know I think that does reflect the market thinking that you know grayscale had a good day in court um you know there's you know probably five to six billion dollars it's daycare in terms of um value for gbtc investors uh you know reflecting the that that discount between the the value of the trust which is um you know about eight and a half billion dollars as of March 7th versus the value of the underlying um Bitcoin which was roughly 14 billion dollars in the trust so um what so if this ends up resulting in gbtc being turned into a spot Bitcoin ETF what do you think that could mean for other you know firms that have been applying to create their own spot Bitcoin ETFs like meaning would the ruling be limited just to this one situation or would there be kind of a a wider implication no I I think there's a thing there's definitely a wider implication um because of eventually uh grayscale's application gets approved and then it opens up the you know the floodgates for other firms to offer similar products and so earlier um you know you started to go into if the court were to rule against grayscale for the SEC and obviously we talked about why you know right now your confidence is more in the other direction but if the court does rule for the SEC what do you think the reason will be that that's a great question you know I think the the reason would be that um that these are different products um and that you know the SEC if that happens convinced the court that just because the price is correlated doesn't necessarily mean that the way fraud or manipulation manifests in the spot Market is the same as it is in the Futures market and that as a result um the FCC was um you know in the right in between the two products differently and other argument that the SEC made is that in Bitcoin Futures ETF which is one of which was approved last year in in the two Korean order that there was a one-to-one relationship between the underlying assets which were Bitcoin Futures and the products on the CME that would be you know that are subject to a surveillance agreement right and we don't have that here in the spot Bitcoin ETS because the underlying asset is you know it's about point and the surveillance agreement again is with the CME and Bitcoin Futures and so there is a there is a slight discrepancy there and you know the the SEC pointed to that difference many times but again I don't think the judges were convinced I think that's one thing that the judges likely asked the SEC to go back to the drawing board and explain better why why that matters why that one to one relationship matters for purposes of approving the this um or rejecting the spot Bitcoin ETF you know the backdrop to this lawsuit is that there's been a kind of a turf war between the SEC and the cftc over crypto now for a few years and I wondered if you thought the ruling in this case would have any impact on on that fight sort of between the agencies yeah no it would definitely see that I mean you know I think sometimes people describe it as a Turf War I think it might be overstated because I think the agencies actually do work together most of the time chairman Gensler certainly has tried to stake out a lot of territory in terms of overseeing the crypto Market I don't think this case actually has will have much effect on you know whether the SEC versus the cfdc is jurisdiction you know the SEC has jurisdiction over um ex you know ETFs and exchange traded products right there are other cases where I think it will really matter for whether the SEC or the cftc has jurisdiction things like the SEC versus Ripple case you know other cases where the SEC is saying that digital assets that are being listed on platforms are unregistered Securities right and if the SEC loses those and they're not treated as Securities and the tftc would have jurisdiction over them so when do you expect a ruling in this particular case so I I you know based on other cases coming out of the DC circuit you know I think it ruins likely within three to six months probably closer you know to the six months time frame um so you know I'd expect something at the earliest weight to queue um but probably more likely in you know mid to late three q and so just a moment ago you said that there are other cases that you feel are also very impactful in crypto what are some of those that you're keeping an eye on yeah there's a there's a lot yeah I mean the SEC Ripple case is obviously one that's on a lot of people's minds and you know we uh we're waiting for a critical ruling on summary judgment motions in that case which which will essentially determine whether the judge rules on her own as to whether xrp is a security or not or not or whether to send it to trial but there's you know there's there's the um SEC versus wahi case which is the um case involving a coinbase employee accused of insider trading um again the SEC has alleged that you know and almost 10 digital I think there's like nine digital assets at stake in that at issue in that case and the SEC has said their Securities that'll be an interesting case to follow you know we the um the case against Tara terraform involving stable coins is going to be interesting for purposes of how the SEC approaches stable coins in terms of alleging whether they are securities or not we have the nft case uh the thoughts case that came out not too long ago which has to do with whether nfts or Securities you know the judge said there said that based on the allegations the case could proceed but we still have to wait for you know a marriage decision later in that case there's a few others but you know the point is there's there's a lot of really interesting cases and a lot of them are cases of first impressed in because this is obviously a novel area and of those cases which ones right now do you think are going to go in a direction either that the crypto Community wants or like really doesn't want well I I think the Ripple cases I think you know one of the more interesting ones um because you're dealing with a digital asset that you know has you know has utility right um which weighs in favor of of those assets being Commodities um on the other hand um you know the SEC has alleged that they were marketed as investments in many ways that purchasers who who bought the tokens from um Ripple you know two to them as Investments and are hoping that the the you know the price of the assets rise right so it's a really interesting case for for the whole crypto sector um and you know I think we may get a ruling on the summary judgment motions you know in 1H

troubled crypto bank and would continue to monitor reports in a video for Unchained Caitlyn long founder and CEO of custodial Bank says that this failure isn't a reflection on crypto this is actually a canary in the coal mine for Bank regulators and I do hope they see it as that it that uh this has nothing to do with crypto it has to do with how fast the payments can settle which means Bank runs

regulator was later overruled by the bankruptcy judge who found the objection to be quote vague and lacking concrete evidence the deal's approval marks a significant win for binance U.S and Voyager creditors who could potentially recover 73 percent of the value of their deposits at the time of voyager's bankruptcy filing the ruling could set in motion the process of transferring customer

buterin sell 700 000 in coins when the creator of ethereum makes Market moves people pay attention Jenny Hogan from Unchained has the update so vitalik buterin recently sold about 700 000 worth of coins which are these joke coins that are often a huge waste of money not to be confused with regular cryptocurrency which are non-jobe coins that are often a huge waste of money but like a hot girl in a bar vitalik actually got these coins for free turns out that sometimes people will send free coins to a celebrity in the hopes that their followers will copy them and then buy the coin it's not a bad strategy I mean people do copy vitalik that's why unicorn t-shirt sales have gone through the roof in recent years Anna can have positive repercussions one time Shiba Inu sent about half their total coins to vitalik and he donated them to a covid relief fund which I have to imagine is the sole reason why the pandemic is wrapping up after a mere three years is it rude to sell something that
