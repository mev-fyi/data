if you allow creators to kind of revoke a license because someone you know used hate speech then you've really opened the door to you know censorship and and people creators being able to rug their holders and and it's it's hard to refute that because it you know ultimately that is um that there is a risk of that uh in the event that the creators retain that right but at the same time right you can imagine that creators and other nft holders in a community wouldn't want people to be able to use their you know nfts in you know some propaganda that that really kind of reflects badly and so there are you know there's very differing views on on what is the right approach and again we didn't take an opinion on on kind of what the correct approach was and so we have versions of our each of our licenses that have kind of the hate speech revocation
