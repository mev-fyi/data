I mean thank God for Hedges or it would get arrested for public indecency a lot of crypto guys are calling Bitcoins rally a Vindication of the crypto ecosystem I would make a joke about it being Revenge of the Nerds except that's just a straightforward description of what it is others say that it's related to bitcoin's having event that's happening in 2024 but you don't need a big event for that you want the crypto Market cut in half again just ask SBF if he has a free second right now
