founder and CEO of poly chain capital a new hedge fund launched last fall that invests in blockchain based digital assets Olaf was also the first employee at coinbase the most popular us-based cryptocurrency exchange where he started out doing customer service and eventually became head of risk welcome Olaf Laura thanks for having me let's start by having you describe what poly chain does sure so poly chain manages a hedge fund that invests exclusively in digital assets so we invest exclusively in protocols not companies and we do this by investing in things that are made scarce through the blockchain and when you say protocols not companies can you define what what those terms mean and what the differences are for listeners yeah absolutely so in in 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of Bitcoin solved an unsolved computer science problem called the Byzantine generals problem by solving that for the first time ever Satoshi had created digital scarcity or scarcity in a digital environment what this means is that for the first time ever with the creation of Bitcoin I can send you something over the Internet and you can be confident than I no longer have that thing this was an unprecedented breakthrough in computer science because before you could always copy/paste anything over it over the Internet once he solved that and created Bitcoin the protocol many many people have been iterating on Bitcoin ever since then and copy pasting the code base because it's all open source changing variables inventing new block chains all sorts of things now for the first time we're seeing platforms that actually make it easy to launch new digital assets so creating a blockchain from the ground up is very hard you need to deal with underlying consensus mechanisms mining algorithms you know complicated attacks both distributed denial-of-service attacks and 51% attacks however if you can solve all those problems and sort of abstract away the blockchain itself you can create a platform that makes it really easy for developers to launch their own scarce digital assets so we can talk more about this but that is what aetherium is doing in the ecosystem so when you referenced all the different kinds of attacks and different technical difficulties what you're saying is that that's kind of work that if you were to do it from the ground up takes a lot of effort but that now platforms exist that sort of take care of that for you is that what you're saying and and then people can launch these tokens these assets yes exactly right and in addition you know the security of a blockchain is basically one-to-one with the market capitalization of that blockchain so if you are starting a brand new blockchain and its market capitalization is very low you basically have a very insecure Network so bootstrapping on top of that an existing secure network that has solved all the underlying consensus mechanisms and just focusing on the creation of the digital asset is a big breakthrough because it opens the door for a number of developers okay and I also want to ask you about the language that you're using a lot of people have talked about Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency but you are using phrases like digital assets or blockchain based assets so you know why do you choose the terms that you use and why not use something like cryptocurrency yeah so I feel pretty strongly about this I think a lot of people got it in their mind that Bitcoin or cryptocurrency as a technology was basically limited to money or currency now while that metaphor is perhaps useful to understand this it's ultimately not the full picture so when you look at protocols like aetherium they actually are capable of so much more than just value creation and transfer so with aetherium you can have arbitrarily complex pieces of software encoded in the blockchain that don't look anything like currencies that you would think of like the dollar or the renminbi or anything like that so to me there is really a breakthrough here in what a blockchain is capable of executing and it's not just payments and and storage anymore and when you say that aetherium makes things beyond just payments possible what are some examples of those things and then how does that relate to the choice of digital assets as as your term yeah so if theorem has what's called a turing-complete scripting language so I'll back up and explain that so Bitcoin has a very narrow scripting language by design and this was to prevent attacks against it and a scripting language is essentially a programming language you use to interact with the protocol so Bitcoin scripting language is very limited and effectively what it can do is is store Bitcoin in an address and send it to another address theorem however with its turing-complete scripting language means that it's capable the the programming language you used to interact with the theorem is capable of arbitrarily complex software and it can it can hypothetically run any piece of software in the etherium scripting language so this means you can build much more complicated financial contracts and people in the etherium ecosystem refer to these as smart contracts and they're basically pieces of software that execute in the etherium blockchain a good example of this would be just a day or two ago I was playing blackjack against a smart contract so and you know every time I take a kit or want to shuffle the deck I have to initiate a transaction and interact with the state of that contract and update that contract that contract held either and I could win real money from that contract or lose real money from that contract by betting against it it was effectively playing the house in a game of blackjack so when I think about that me taking a hit in that game now that mechanically looks very much like a Bitcoin transaction I'm paying a fee that goes to the miners in order for the miners to update the state of the ledger but it it really doesn't look like a payment exactly right I'm really interacting with a piece of software and updating the current state of that software so to me you know taking a hit or shuffling the deck in a game of blackjack against the smart contract doesn't you know the metaphor of money or currency doesn't do that justice okay so let's you know we're we're getting really deep now into these into kind of the details on all this but I actually want to back up to talk a little bit more about the hedge fund and then and then we'll dive a little bit more into the digital assets aspect so tell me about the hedge fund aspect who are your investors and how much money have you raised yeah so we currently have about fifteen million dollars under management we've been live for a little bit under six months we have backing from andreessen horowitz Union Square Ventures Pantera capital and a handful of other great investors so I I launched this fund in hopes of building the first fund that's really a diversified portfolio of exclusively blockchain based assets I think so far we've seen a really good response from the investment community of people who want a broad-based exposure to blockchain technology without having to invest in a single digital asset like people have historically done by just buying Bitcoin so what I find so fascinating about your story in particular is that in a way much of your life I guess really as as an adult has contracted the evolution of cryptocurrency or digital assets so can you tell us your story and let's just start with how you first heard about Bitcoin okay yeah we can we can go all the way back so it was June 2011 and I was back from a summer vacation and my friend told me you need to read about this saying Silk Road and you were in college or high school or yeah I was I was this was the summer after my junior year in college okay I was going into my senior year and my friend told me you need to read this article about Silk Road so Silk Road was an online drug market place and so I read about it and it was kind of a spicy sensationalist article about this and I realized though that there was really just one thing that they pretty casually mentioned they said oh and by the way in order to remit payment in this online drug market place everyone uses this thing called Bitcoin and I felt like that was the crux of the whole thing that was it to me there was something here that was making this possible and it was this technology so I quickly started reading about Bitcoin and went very deep down the rabbit hole that summer so that summer of 2011 I spent a huge amount of time on forums and in chat rooms learning about Bitcoin learning about what it was capable of buying Bitcoin I put you know I was an indebted college student but I put most of my meager life savings into Bitcoin at that time and then going into my senior year of college I was trying to decide what to write my undergraduate thesis on there was kind of the culmination of all of my studies and I decided to write it on cryptocurrency so this was in the fall of 2011 and at that time there weren't a lot of you know formal academic studies or inquiries into cryptocurrency at all so I sort of had to convince my professors that this was a good idea and I think there was some skepticism there but I managed to sort of convince them that I should write it on this and and sort of grabbed a lot of thinking from other fields in order to make sense of a research thesis on something that effectively had no formal research the the other thing that was kind of funny about that is during that whole time from the discovery of my discovery of Bitcoin to writing my thesis and kind of starting the early drafts the Bitcoin price dropped from about $17 to $2 and I mean that it's a really massive drop I mean that's a huge huge percentage of value just disappearing and a lot of articles were coming out at that time and there was one particularly in Wired that said you know the rise and fall of Bitcoin was the title and it was about how bitcoin was this fun little computer science experiment that failed and my professor showed that to me and said you know now that bitcoin is dead what are you going to write your thesis on like word for word and I you know again had to fall back into all these arguments about why it was theoretically interesting and even if bitcoin was the first crypto currency it wouldn't be the last and all sorts of things but I kind of held on and kept going with it and eventually kind of Bitcoin saw more adoption and more people were using it everything so yeah it turned out that my stubbornness was good and why do you think you were so fascinated by it it you know when I first read about Bitcoin I just pretty you know right away I I knew this is the most important technology that you've ever read about and it's happening right now like it felt like whoa this this white paper came out you know just two years ago and I felt like I was reading the white paper for the internet you know it just felt like this massive technological breakthrough and it was so neat like no one knew about this yeah and so to me there was just this massive potential to see this technology kind of transform the world and to get in on something like this very very very early before you know even my computer science professors had heard of this thing so to me you know that this this prospect of programmatic finance or or or rather like running the financial systems of the world through software versus through centralized clearing houses and banks and all sorts of things like that has massive implications and it always felt like the natural path that these these things will take just like the Internet has sort of disintermediated endless industries you know media distribution and e-commerce and all sorts of things like that it felt right that financed and associated industries would also be automated through software so walk us through then how you went from writing your senior thesis on Bitcoin or and I know there were some other topics in there too being hired at coinbase yeah so once I graduated this was May of 2012 the bitcoin industry so to speak was basically non-existent there was maybe a couple of services out there these were bootstrapped businesses that by you know my examination did not look that legit I think that I was right in the end these companies turned out to be male Cox bitinstant you know companies that have shut down for one reason or another since then but I was looking at the space really closely so clean base launched and I was actually the 30th user on clean base so I was you know looking at these services right away when they were coming out and coinbase had a really a really amazing feature that sounds silly now which was that it allowed you to buy Bitcoin on the Internet so you'd think that a peer-to-peer electronic cash system it would be easy to get that on the internet but there's this massive problem with buying Bitcoin on the internet which is that if you pay with like a credit card or PayPal or something like that and someone gives you Bitcoin you can then go charge back your payments and they can't get back their Bitcoin so bitcoin is like cash once I give it to you you have it and I can't get it back whereas credit cards and PayPal and ACH transfers all sorts of things like that are all reversible so fraud when buying Bitcoin is a massive massive problem for the person selling that Bitcoin so coinbase offered but purchases of Bitcoin through a bank transfer this sounds again this this sounds so simple like I can't believe no one had done that yet it is a very hard problem to solve have you been buying your Bitcoin before that cash cash so what did that transaction look like so you know I I was using a service that was run by someone who later worked at coin based so it's kinda it was kind of funny that way but it was a service where I would go to the account and say I wanted to make a cash deposit of let's say three hundred dollars it would tell me to deposit three hundred dollars and seventeen cents or some other weird amount of change to a very specific account and routing number in cash at my bank so I would go to the bank and I would have cash and and seventeen cents and say I would like to deposit the money here into this account and they'd say okay great and then I would go home and on the back end they're using that weird amount of change to math a cash deposit against their internal database of which account it you know deposited that cash to their account directly yeah really well really this is this was built with duct tape so you know and then you by the time I get home though the Bitcoin would be in my account because the cash transfer is instant and irreversible and then I would transfer that Bitcoin off to my own hardware so it was a really it was relatively seamless you know but it in retrospect you know this was a very primitive mechanism you know to to purchase Bitcoin I love it it reminds me of those transactions that you sometimes have to do now to use other financial services where they want to connect to your bank account and then the way that they confirm that they got the right account is they put random amounts of sense into your account you know like seven cent deposit and a 50 cent deposit and then they ask you to report back on what the amount was um but anyway so finish your story about you know how you ended up a coin base okay so after that you know I I was traveling a little bit and kind of thinking a lot about Bitcoin and this is throughout kind of the latter half of 2012 and then I saw coinbase just growing and growing growing I was a very active user of coinbase purchasing Bitcoin through the bank account mechanism and I decided you know what this looks like the the company you know the one that really has the vision to bring this to the masses and isn't like actually has a good service and isn't built with duct tape so I you know I was staying at a friend's couch in Oakland this friend actually now works at coinbase this happens but I was staying at a friend's couch in Oakland and I just cold emailed jobs at coinbase and I attached my thesis on cryptocurrency and said you know I'm willing to do anything I just I just want to join a growing company in the space and Fred replied back and Fred the co-founder of coinbase replied back in maybe 30 minutes and instantly wanted to get on skype and I realized that this was going to happen really quickly like that you know we were gonna either do this or not very very quickly yeah and just for listeners who aren't familiar that's Fred aresome who actually also recently left coinbase and says that he's not sure what he's gonna do but may do something in that ethereal space so talk a little bit about what jobs you had while you weren't coinbase oh man so this is this is a laundry list so when I started I was doing front line customer support every single time someone emailed support at coinbase I was the one who was replying so I did that by myself until we had 250,000 users this was a marathon and I was also automating a lot so I I would you know when you had keywords in your subject line I had a tool which would look at those keywords and if it knew like probabilistically what kind of ticket that was based on those keywords it would wait one hour and then you would get an automated reply from someone named Roger could you do this once once once that reply went out if that person then replied again you would always get a manual response so like my assumption was that if roger was wrong about whether the canned response that it sent out and and the user ree replied and said that didn't help my problem then you'd always get a manual answer but i think something like at least half of the tickets we're getting an automated can reply delayed for one hour which actually solved most of the problems because a lot of routine tickets have very similar language and a very similar you know simple canned solution so I was doing a lot of acts like that that really aren't leading to a great customer experience frankly but you need to scale at that stage and we had grown when I joined we were at about 50,000 users and we grow 250,000 over the course of maybe four months so we had gone up in the number of users by 500% in four months so it was a really hyper scaling moment at that point I then hired a distributed team of people to do customer support and this was a very interesting thing so we were really struggling to find someone who could help me with customer support at coinbase because a lot of the problems were really technical and there is a lot of money on the line so finding bugs quickly was my job you know we didn't have it necessarily a huge QA team or something to make sure everything was working properly the main way we would hear about something breaking was a customer support ticket and catching bugs quickly at that time you know could make a huge financial difference and these bugs are really serious it's not like a UI bug you know there were problems with funds flows between a bank account or Bitcoin address or things like that so there were these big problems with funds flows and everything something actually well can you explain what that when you say funfun slows you mean that you know you weren't receiving funds that you were having to deliver a Bitcoin is that an example yeah all sorts of things like that so matching a Bitcoin payment to a bank payment making sure that everyone's deliveries are timely making sure that our anti-fraud algorithm wasn't catching the wrong people and was catching the right people there were just all sorts of complicated things going on so it you know basically the the the needs for a support person were actually really really intense this was not like your casual person who was working at a phone center they really needed to understand Bitcoin the payment mechanism that we were using all that kind of stuff Ashley also lets situate this in time when you started and you said that coinbase had about 50,000 users and then within a few months was at 250,000 when did were you hired there that was March 2013 I believe oh okay so keep going so you were looking for you know support yep so I was looking for support this was later that summer and we couldn't find anyone so what I did and this was really a last-ditch effort this was not like the go to plan from the beginning I I made what we called internally the Bitcoin SAT and this was like a quiz which with a bunch of complicated Bitcoin questions and I posted it on all the major Bitcoin forums so this is like Reddit and Bitcoin talk and things like that and I said if you get a perfect score on this test the Bitcoin SAT you will get an interview and so we you know it was really desperate and we had an absolutely resounding response from the community and something like 250 people took this Bitcoin SAT and a lot of people did really well on and this was I was very surprised it was a very complicated test and so I started doing you know four or five interviews every single day and it's just the caliber of people I was talking to was amazingly high so I still remember one of the first interviews I did was with Josh who's now the director of customer support at claim base you know this is three three plus years later he was one of my first interviews and he had a master's degree in computer science and was an absolute expert at Bitcoin and just a really really competent guy and I said okay if you have a master's in computer science why do you want to do a customer support job and he said you know I live in new caledonia which is like this island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean sort of a thousand miles off the coast of New Zealand and it's just an absolutely weird place to be located and but it was it was great because now there's a perfect fit we can have this remote workforce all paid exclusively in Bitcoin and all working on customer support for coinbase so fast forward a few months and I had a 43 person distributed team working for me all doing customer support anti-fraud investigations some of our early compliance investigations you know merchants onboarding all sorts of stuff and so this was really the team that was making sure that the companies operating everyday and at this point we had you know of over a million users and it was really a massive team that was almost exclusively hired through that Bitcoin SAT posted on the forums that's really interesting and is that guy josh is he still based in New Caledonia no he relocated to San Francisco to take the job as director of customer support oh wow and when you said that everyone was paid in Bitcoin why why was that because we had people working from you know 12 different countries or something like that so we were dealing with a lot of different currencies it just was easiest basically like we were actually using Bitcoin because it was useful huh okay so if this is a really fun conversation but I just want to pause things right here to bring in an important word from our sponsor on-ramp the best companies in the world obsess about branding killer

organization strategically poised for the future you can learn more and see examples of their work at think on-ramp com I'm speaking with Olaf Carlson we founder and CEO of polishing capital a new hedge fund that invests in blockchain assets so you were talking about you know how you have this huge team for customer support but I know that eventually you went on to other jobs what were some of those other ones yeah so you know that was only the first year at coin base so out of three and a half years so it was it was quite a journey so then I was the head of risk so I really focused in on tea fraud and user account security issues so this is people buying Bitcoin with stolen identities so someone gains access to your online banking someone gains access to your credit card and they purchase Bitcoin with that so in those cases coinbase is actually on the hook for the loss so it's a massive complicated problem that's all machine learning base combined with manual examinations in addition you know people are trying to hack users coin based accounts all the time so just like you might get your email account hacked you can get your coin base account hacked but you know you lose your Bitcoin potentially in your account now we we at that time it didn't have as great of account security mechanisms as then over the course of the next year and a half we built some really really great things and now I think that coin base accounts are very very secure I actually think they're much more secure than most online banking accounts so that was really a big push over the next year and a half and really my final job at clean base at that point I try to built these two pillars of the company kind of the operations side and then the anti-fraud side and Brian Fred gave me kind of a free ticket to work on whatever I wanted and so it was at that time that I got very deep into the etherium ecosystem and this was kind of the fall of 2015 and early 2016 and the development around aetherium was just pretty mind-boggling to me and it was during that time that we were seeing the absolute first kind of experimental token launches where people were actually building digital assets on top of aetherium and launching them by selling them to people which basically raises money much in the way that you might raise money in a series a round except that you're funding a peer-to-peer open-source protocol instead of a private company which is a totally unprecedented effect so I started seeing that and really in a way giving me that free ticket to work on whatever I wanted got me so into what was happening in the ecosystem that I I knew I needed to leave and actually start poly chain start start my own company which kind of invests in the future of that space so the thing about this trend that you you know decided to pursue is that there was a sort of similar trend previously where we saw the proliferation of alt coins which were generally somewhat trivial tweaks on Bitcoin so what's so different about this new trend that you're seeing in these digital assets yeah so there's really two things one is that now it's much easier to create digital assets like I said before if you're Emacs as a platform for developers to launch their own digital assets the other thing is that people are actually raising money to fund the protocol through the through the creation of these tokens or digital assets so you're seeing economic effects that you'd usually see in a private venture round for a private company being kind of open so anyone can participate in the funding round and its funding an open source peer-to-peer project that the oftentimes the funders really just want to see exist in the world the main like meta effect that this is happening to me you know for me is monetized peer to peer networks so historically appear to peer protocols have never had a monetary layer attached and so these are things like the torrent protocol or the Tor protocol and that's that's file sharing and kind of an online packet routing and these these are two different protocols that never you know added payments and for that reason were run sort of altruistic aliy like the people who are contributing to the network are also the people consuming from it and in general no one's doing it for money now now that we're adding digital assets into the mix and monetizing peer to peer effects you get for the first time ever asymmetrical peer-to-peer networks and what I mean by that is where one side of the peer-to-peer network is extracting and the other side is contributing so this this it has never really been monetized so like you can have a peer-to-peer marketplace let me let me give you a pragmatic example there's a project that I'm excited about this is digital asset built on aetherium called golem and golem is a peer-to-peer marketplace for computation what this means is that instead of me shutting my computer at night I can rent out the CPU and GPU cycles to developers and this developer might be on another continent and they're training a machine learning algorithm or rendering animation or something like that so this marketplace is between the people with cycles to offer and sell and then people who are buying those cycles so that's what I mean by it's an asymmetrical peer-to-peer network but the effect that this has is sort of like an Airbnb effect on Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azur where these are the centralized hubs that developers traditionally have to go rent out in order to get these cycles and run run complex computations and now instead of having to rely on these centralized hubs you can go out to a grid network of volunteers all just receiving smaller amounts of money so I think that something like Gollum by adding a monetary layer to this peer-to-peer network is creating something new and potentially massively disruptive let's explain a little bit more in depth how this works because for something like Gollum I know that they have created their own GNT they call it Gollum Network token but you know as you talked about a lot of these are built on aetherium which has its own currency which is ether so why is it that these networks are creating their own tokens as opposed to just using ether for payments or another cryptocurrency yeah so it's mostly not for hard technological reasons but rather what I would call kind of game theoretic reasons like you want to align incentives so it allows holders of GMT or Gollum tokens to be exposed and very narrowly to the growth of the golem Network so these tokens are also tied to governance right so when you're trying to decide the direction of the protocol to take these tokens can actually be used for voting on that network additionally you know as an investor you can invest very specifically on that network not on the larger aetherium network and as the founders of the protocol you have sort of equity incentives right so the founders of Gollum if they built that with ether and it becomes very successful the value of ether might rise 10 or 15 percent but if they if they create these Gollum Network tokens and the network is successful the value of that Gollum tokens will rise maybe a hundred or a thousand decks right it will become much much more valuable from where it started so to me it aligns incentives better and it supplies a better governance mechanism so it's sort of a crude metaphor is that just because I have US dollars right doesn't mean I should be able to vote at a Google shareholder meeting right just because you know that the stock is denominated in dollars doesn't mean I sort of have those rights and so there there are some similarities between being an equity owner in a private company you want to issue your own stock so you have kind of narrow Network effects around your project okay so I actually want to go back to just explicate for people who may be you know because I know that you're steeped in this every day and you sort of very quickly talked about something that you know I think maybe the listeners really need to understand which is that by creating this software that is creating these new tokens these developers can now raise millions of dollars sort of out of thin air almost you know obviously they have to put forth what the value proposition is and you know to make all the effort to create the network and to you know create the utility and the network and a reason to want to use the network but you know as you mentioned essentially they don't really need to raise money from VCS anymore and you know they can just create these tokens and do a big crowd sale and then suddenly have you know a few mil a few million dollars but the thing is that because of just how appealing that sounds to as I said sort of create money out of thin air you're also seeing a lot of maybe less legitimate you know new tokens being offered potentially scams so for you as somebody who's running this hedge fund that is investing in a number of these digital assets how do you decide which ones are legitimate and which ones are worthy of investing in yeah so this is the beauty of this space is that it's totally permissionless innovation so anyone in the world can create a token and and say hey I'm building this new project I think that's great it also means there's a lot of noise and and just finding the signal in that noise is my job so we we look at a lot of things so we read white papers religiously and make sure that the way the protocol is specified actually makes sense we will look at the github repository to kind of check out the codebase and make sure that makes sense as well as the github Forks and stars and kind of the developer ecosystem around that to see how that's emerging we also will always talk to the founding teams particularly the technical architects on those teams to make sure that the way they're thinking about their protocol makes sense and that they're the right people to you know work on this for many years so you you don't have a computer science background or at least you're not a programmer so you know how do you do that kind of like technical review and then also can you explain when you said you follow the github Forks and stars what that means yeah so I I have a team of people that help me with the technical review I feel very good about reading even the most hardcore white papers I think when it gets to the bike code on say you know is this new scripting language actually legitimate that's where I would reach out for help and I have a team of advisers and investors that can kind of help me there and then the github Forks and star is what that basically means it's in this open source environment that is other developers interacting with this open source code base so a fork means okay I copied it and I'm gonna tweak some things so it's like a developer kind of messing around with the protocol to see if they can tweak it in a good way or maybe they're building an application on top of it that uses that protocol so yeah it's it's basically a we're measuring always the developer ecosystem around these and what does the developer ecosystem mean to you like when you see that developers seem to be tinkering with something what does that signify so you know most of what we're investing in right now are underlying protocols or what I might call middleware and I think Gollum is maybe a good example of that so I don't really see Gollum being used by quote regular people in in the way that an end-user application is meant to be you know you sign up and interact with this app right it's it's really tools for developers so they can build and user applications that are really meant to be like for the masses and so in that case really the users are developers like to me a theory 'm is a tool for developers so looking at the developer ecosystem is is basically us measuring the success of this project like are there a lot of developers hooking into this and trying to build things on top of it because of where you stand an industry I imagine you see a lot of these digital investment additional asset investment opportunities but then you probably pass on a very high percentage of them what are the main reasons you tend to pass oh man there are so many reasons we might pass I think right now one of the big issues is that a lot of people want to create a digital token in order to raise money but that token doesn't make sense for the project they're building so in general I think a good rule of thumb and this this is something that Fred the the co-founder of coinbase really said first was that if you have our building network effects then a token can make sense but if you're not building network effects a token probably doesn't make sense and III think that in general this has has remained true for the projects I see so people are creating tokens for things and in digital assets for things that that don't really have Network effects and aren't trying to build Network effects in which case you actually as a buyer of the token the project could succeed and the value of that token might not increase at all so you know poly chain we're investors right and the when we're buying these digital assets we of course are trying to create returns for our investors so we need to invest in things where we believe that the growth of that network will be one-to-one with the price increase of this token or digital asset we can't invest in a digital asset that you know is maybe only very loosely tied to the success of the network so I think that's probably the number one error we're seeing right now and aside from Gollum what are some other digital assets that you're excited by right now so Gollum is very much on this kind of aetherium digital asset it's an application-specific token is what I call it so once again Gollum is not meant to be used as general-purpose money or currency but really for this computational marketplace another example of not a digital asset honor theorem but rather a whole new blockchain is kaizo s-- so Tasos is like aetherium in that it has this Turing complete scripting language that's capable of running arbitrarily complex software Tasos is scripting language has sort of different semantic qualities in it and the main difference is that when you write smart contracts or these pieces of software with Tasos you can formally verify those contracts and formal verification is a process whereby you essentially mathematically prove that the contract does what it's intended to do so it makes it easier to write a bug-free piece of software and when you're writing financial contracts ensuring that there are no bugs is very important so to prevent things like what happened last summer with the Dow which raised 150 million dollars but then sort of collapsed when someone or a team of people managed to pilfer like about 50 million from it is that yes okay exactly right in addition Tasos is a proof of stake blockchain this means that it's one coin equals one of equals one vote on kind of consensus so instead of having miners the token holders are actually doing the consensus and finally it has protocol level voting on decision-making so governance has historically been a very complex problem in these ecosystems in in Bitcoin it has manifested as a multi-year debate about how to best scale the protocol of which there are big disagreements and no clear governance like there's no clear mechanism whereby to decide what to do and it has basically resulted in an analysis paralysis where the disagreements mean that neither side wins in aetherium after that hack there was this decision to fork the protocol and actually sort of undo what that attacker did through a fork and again a very vocal minority of people opposed this and there was really no good mechanism to determine you know how to move forward in Tasos you can actually have one coin equals one vote and have essentially vote on how to move forward and the protocol will automatically upgrade or fork based on how those votes are tallied so for the first time ever I think you have built-in governance at the protocol level not based on sort of these vague relationships between developers miners users exchanges but rather you know codified governance so we think that's a really interesting experiment I think it's it's something to definitely watch over over the next year or so one stays us is launched do you worry about legal or regulatory issues hurting your investments yes a little so I think the regulatory risk here is there right I think there's unclear regulation around a lot of these types of things just like I think there's still somewhat unclear regulation around certain things in Bitcoin now that said I do think that open source and peer-to-peer is it has historically been extremely resilient so for example you know file sharing and file sharing protocols that are used like the torrent protocol have been extremely resilient to attempts at any individual geographic region attempting to squash that activity and this truly is a global phenomena and there are no clear legal jurisdictions in which most of this is taking place it's really all happening on the internet and the digital assets that you know poly chain is holding these really aren't and domiciled in any geographic location they really truly kind of are exists on the Internet so to me you know we're seeing what is a truly global and internet-based phenomena more than we're seeing a phenomena based on any specific geographic region and for that reason you know legal frameworks are based on geographies in the physical world not based on relationships over the Internet so I think that the regulatory space here is very complex for that reason if any end vidual country makes laws around this it's very unclear you know what that applies to if this projects on the internet and nothing's based in United States and no developers are located in the United States or things like that you're holding fifteen million dollars worth of Bitcoin ether and other obscure crypto currencies how do you keep your private keys which hold all this money which you know keep the money secure how do you keep all those secure yeah so we use industry standard offline or cold storage is is the other term for that so in a cold storage architecture what you do is you actually create get an offline computer that has never touched the internet and never will touch the internet and you actually generate keys on that computer these are cryptographic keys that actually store the e cryptocurrency then you can create backups of those keys so these backups can be on flash drives on physical pieces of paper again none of this ever touching the internet you can secure those backups in in very secure locations like Bank safe-deposit boxes or things like that and then at that point you can actually send cryptocurrency to that computer so this is the interesting thing about this with cryptocurrency that sort of counterintuitive is you can send cryptocurrency effectively from an online exchange to a piece of paper and really what's on that piece of paper is access to that cryptocurrency in the ledger which is stored on the Internet so it's very easy actually to move from an online environment through a 100% air-gapped or offline environment what this means is that any sort of attack vector targeting this cryptocurrency needs to occur 100% offline or 100% off the internet and and this is this is by far the most important step you can take when securing cryptocurrency is to move to 100% offline storage okay let's talk about how you got these big VC firms andreessen horowitz and Union Square Ventures to invest in poly chain first of all how does a venture fund invest in a hedge fund and why were they interested in investing yeah so it you targeted you said the right thing which is that it's very unusual for a venture fund like Andreessen or Union Square Ventures to invest in a hedge fund like as as an LP in another fund but this is a very unique asset class so if you if you look at the numbers here just to back up for a second Bitcoin companies raised about one point four billion dollars in venture financing if your iam companies by comparison have raised an absolutely you know rounds to zero kind of amount of money but if Tyrion digital assets built on the platform have raised something like three hundred million dollars you know in order of magnitude more than private companies building on a theorem a phrase so there's definitely a lot of activity happening here but out of that three hundred million dollars basically none of that money was venture really most of that money was sort of you know quote regular people from around the world that want a stake in these projects and to support this certain open source ecosystem that they are have been investing in so to me you know gaining access to these digital asset and protocol based ecosystem means that you either have to go do it yourself or you can invest in something like poly chain so explaining to your investors when you're a sort of traditional venture firm that you are going to purchase cryptographic tokens I think is very hard but investing in another fund while that's still hard actually makes a lot more sense and so these ferns Andreessen and Union Square had high conviction and this was actually the best Avenue for them to gain exposure they also know that monitoring the space and reading these white papers talking to the developers and sort of understanding the whole ecosystem is is a full-time job at more so by putting that on me they don't need to have you know a whole team of people just looking exclusively at this ecosystem and it's also a very specialized skill set that can kind of look at these various investment opportunities and discern which ones are really the most valuable well we're running out of time which is so sad because there's so much more I could've asked you about but sort of quickly because I can reference this in the show notes I wrote a story about you I forgot if it was a two year I think it might have been was it a year ago or two years ago about how you were spending most of and spending all your money in cryptocurrency and I can link to that in the show notes but can you just tell us briefly if you're still doing that yeah so actually creating poly chain has complicated the living on Bitcoin experiment that I was doing for so long because I put 100% of my cryptocurrency holdings into the poly chain fund so this means I kind of you know I don't have cryptocurrency sitting around in personal wallets you know and I I have maybe a hundred bucks that I can send to friends or something but if I want to purchase like a plane ticket or hotel or something like that I really do need to do that in dollars now because I put all of my meaningful cryptocurrency holdings into the fund so we'd actually starting poly chain really broke my living on Bitcoin experiment well that's very ironic but I'm but definitely a good reason so where can people learn more about your work and get in touch with you if you go to their website poly chain capital you can actually read about a one-sentence blurb about what we do which is much less informative than I hope this podcast has been and then it might my contact information is there as well great well thank you for coming on the show yeah thank you very much for having me Laura thanks for joining us today if you're interested in learning more about Olaf's work with cryptocurrencies check out the show notes which are available on my Forbes page forbes.com slash sites slash Laura shin thanks so much for tuning in to Unchained which comes out every other Tuesday please share the podcast with friends and on social media and remember to review rate and subscribe to it and iTunes or your preferred platform thanks again for listening [Music] [Music]
