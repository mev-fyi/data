thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline national banks can hold stable coin reserves big news regarding fiat back stable coins such as usdc and tether on monday the office of the controller of the currency said that federal chartered banks can hold the reserves for such coins although stablecoin issuers have been using u.s banks for years the regulatory environment surrounding such use has been murky the occ guidance has now made it clear that federally regulated banks should feel comfortable providing cis disabled coin issuers as long as they are backed on a 101 basis with fiat currencies publishing concurrently the securities and exchange commission released a statement from its finhub unit which focuses on digital assets noting that certain stablecoins might not be securities under federal law but each case would be decided on quote a facts and circumstances determination presumably fiat back stable coins are not securities but from previous cases such as base coin slash basis algorithmic ones could be next headline is the uniswap token a security in the latest twist to the uniswap sushi swap saga una swap went live with its token uni last week immediately crypto lawyers began saying they believe uni looks like an unregistered security first it was airdropped and airdrops quote may not spare you from securities regulation according to a 2017 coin center blog post which niraj agrawal its communications officer felt compelled to tweet out the night of the uniswap airdrop second as the price has shot up people may be interested in obtaining uni with the expectation of a profit rather than to utilize the network and the value of uni could be influenced by the efforts of an identifiable party uniswap and that would trigger the final prong of the so-called howie test which determines whether or not an investment contract is a security greg lisa a partner at huggin levels hogan levels he works on a case involving ether delta a crypto exchange that built itself is decentralized but which the sec determined was not said to the block quote this really looks like a blimp crash it can be seen from a mile away the biggest question is when not whether the sec and other regulators or law enforcement are going to say slash do something about this on a related note two bipartisan bills introduced to congress this week could clarify how the sec and the commodities futures trading commission handle tokens since tokyo can sometimes start out as securities but evolve into commodities once their networks are sufficiently decentralized one bill called the securities clarity act would explicitly define sec jurisdiction to token pre-sales as coin center puts it quote a non-security is being sold the future decentralized token but it comes with a contractual promise from the issuer which is the promise to build the token network as specified so that tokens will actually do something of value in the future the second bill proposes a way for the cftc to rig it us-based crypto exchanges and would give crypto exchanges the option to register as a digital commodity exchange or dce and any pre-sale tokens meaning those that started out as securities could only be traded on the cftc registered exchanges but only after the network is live a token is sold to the public there and at that point it would lose its security status next headline high gas fees have forced eunologin to shut down unilog and co-founder alex vandesant announced that the dap onboarding solution is closing up shop due to high gas fees on ethereum with the cost of onboarding a new user soaring to over 130 on some days although the provider considered a pivot to a layer 2 d5 focused wallet it would have required an almost total restart of the project unilogan has decided instead to return its remaining cash to investors adding that even if gas prices were to improve and it's uncovalescent it still can't imagine a way forward because ethereum's high gas fees do not appear to be a temporary problem in related news a progress report on eip 1559 ethereum improvement proposal 1559 which promises a significant change to ethereum's fee market was posted on wednesday first proposed by ethereum creator vitalik buterin in 2019 the transaction pricing mechanism for eip-1559 would offer a quote fixed per block network fee that is burned and dynamically expands and contracts block sizes to deal with transient congestion the main concern is that since eip1559 could stretch blocks up to three times their current size any denial of service attack could now be three times as effective next up analytics roundup dune analytics secures two million dollars in funding dragonfly capital led a seed funding round in ethereum centric analytics platform dune analytics which enables people to create their own charts and dashboards and share them with others for those of you who haven't yet tried duna analytics i highly recommend this resource which a lot of my own sources use to explain things to me next up in the roundup block native announces mempool explorer calling it a missing link in the ecosystem block native unveiled mempool explorer on wednesday which enables people to for instance detect when more than ten thousand dollars of liquidity moves into or out of a specific protocol or to find out when someone's smart contract is party to a pending transaction and more if you recall the story by dan robinson of paradigm about the ten thousand dollars that he tried to rescue from a smart contract but could not because a bot spotted his rescue attempt in the mempool and stole the money first that helps in explaining how this tool could be useful next defy roundup maker dow will not compensate victims of march's flash crash after initially deciding in early april to refund washed out investors from march's black thursday crash on tuesday larger mkr holders dominated a vote and decided against making whole those same investors who lost a cumulative 8.33 million dollars only 38 unique votes votes were cast the equivalent of 8.7 percent of all mkr token holders participants were incentivized to vote against any compensation because additional printing of mkr would dilute the value of their holdings tbtc is now live the tbtc network which launched earlier this year but quickly pulled the plug has relaunched quote with unprecedented security measures in place allowing users to deposit and redeem bitcoin in d5 without intermediaries users can now exchange btc for tbtc which is an erc20 token for use on d5 platforms at a one-to-one ratio quote each tbtc is fully backed and matched by at least one bitcoin held in reserve yam looks forward after relaunch after a wild three-day launch and then crash in august last friday defy token yam relaunched by monday it had its first rebase with 571 thousand dollars in yusd added to its treasury next headline a new alternative to buy back and burn in a blog post joel monegro of placeholder capital examines the common buyback and burn model and points out that though this model works for currencies it has pitfalls particularly for governance tokens he writes quote when it comes to capital assets like governance tokens issuance is key to capitalization and burning can get in the way of growing fundamental value he defines currency as an asset whose value comes from exchange such as to consumer goods or to services however an asset used for governance or equity participation is capital he cites mkr and zrx as examples of networks that generate incoming eth but then redistribute value via their governance tokens he says if you draw an analogy to buybacks in equities world stock buybacks typically do not result in shares being destroyed they tend to be held by the company as treasury shares and just reduced the number of outstanding shares on the flip side issuance is how a crypto network such as a dow or a protocol can obtain the resources it needs to scale he says quote this is why tools like mining proof of stake and liquidity rewards can work so well there's far more upside to smart issuance than there is in clutching to scarcity he then proposes a balancer smart pool balancer is one of those automated market makers and he proposes a smart poll that would be 10 eth and 90 of a capital token that could function as what he calls quote an automatic buyback machine token issuance pool and liquidity provider since it would automatically rebounce rebalance by selling excess eth or the capital token to retain a specific ratio and that would function as a buyback his post gets even more in the weeds than this um hopefully i haven't lost you all but it's definitely worth checking out four creative ways to provide liquidity in a token next headline how to value the wi-fi token the wi-fi token which governs yearn or y-earn was launched with the disclaimer that the token itself quote has zero value however investors disagreed with that initial assessment and fyi limited to only 30 000 tokens has reached a price as high as 44 000 since its launch but how should such a wide-ranging crypto network be valued the newly formed mechanism capital did a deep dive into potential valuation methods first dismissing the usefulness of total value locked which is a common metrics metric as well as price to earnings ratio the article then makes a case for two future oriented valuation models forward price to earning and discounted cash flow it presents base conservative and aggressive forecasts for the price of wi-fi with the bare case being for a token that's worth fifteen thousand eight hundred dollars and the aggressive case for a much higher price token three hundred and fifteen thousand five hundred dollars fun bits jack dorsey to speak friday at the oslo freedom forum i realized this is somewhat last minute but if you are listening the morning that this episode drops you can see twitter
