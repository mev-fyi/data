back explained to cnbc 63 months for ethereum developer virtual griffith 39 year old former ethereum developer virgil griffith was sentenced to five and a quarter years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to violate the international emergency economic powers act last september griffith was originally arrested in 2019 after giving a presentation on cryptocurrency in pyongyang the capital of north korea despite being denied permission by the department of state to do so prosecutors allege that griffith gave north korea information that he knew could be used to evade and avoid u.s sanctions and fund its nuclear weapons program specifically the department of justice says that griffith and his co-conspirators also answered specific questions about blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies for the dprk audience including individuals whom griffith understood worked for the north korean government in addition to a 63-month sentence griffith was also fined 100 thousand dollars speaking of north korea the u.s treasury department is alleging that lazarus a north korean hacking group is tied to the 600 million hack of the ronan bridge from earlier this month the treasury department has added a wallet holding 148 000 eth to its sanctions list celsius shuts down yield for most u.s citizens u.s regulators continue to force crypto companies to halt offerings of retail-based crypto yield this week's mark was celsius a crypto rewards platform that much like blockfy offers an earned platform where users can deposit crypto tokens and accumulate yield at a rate between 0.65 and 18.63 percent per year according to a celsius blog post this week non-accredited u.s customers will no longer have access to its yield product starting april 15th due to regulatory uncertainty as we have previously acknowledged celsius has been working closely with regulators around the world it is our intention to be as transparent with our community as possible celsius wrote more specifically we have been in ongoing discussions with united states regulators regarding our earned product as a result there will be changes to the way our earned product will work for users based in the united states this means that celsius customers who make less than two hundred thousand dollars a year or do not have a net worth of one million dollars will be barred from earning interest on the platform celsius customers who had deposited tokens before friday april 15th will be grandfathered into celsius's earn program and can continue to obtain yield on their investments the news is not surprising to anyone who has kept up with the crypto yield space notably celsius has been under scrutiny from u.s regulators since 2021 and has faced obstacles in new jersey texas and alabama furthermore celsius's major competitor blockfi paid a 100 million dollar fine to the sec and state regulators for offering a lending product which the sec believes is the securities product to us citizens without registering additionally the sec threatened to sue coinbase after the exchange announced its intent to launch a crypto interest-bearing product for us citizens coinbase listings spark skepticism and an insider trading allegation in an effort to increase transparency and token listings coinbase published a blog post revealing 50 tokens for which the exchange is considering offering support the decision seems to have backfired first of all the list of tokens being considered was met with skepticism on twitter at pastry eth was one of the more vocal voices and cited certain red flags with some of the tokens on coinbase's list for example bottle b-o-t-t-o has a market cap of four million dollars crom k-r-o-m is at roughly 10 million dollars and mona is less than 4 million while ric is about 2 million dollars with zero volume out of all the assets mentioned in the blog post by coinbase i have heard of maybe 10 of them pastry eth wrote additionally nearly half of them are under 20 million market cap and some as low as even 5 million dollars pastry eth then wondered is coinbase just stupid or is there something else going on secondly in a move that has sparked insider information debates an ethereum wallet purchased more than four hundred thousand dollars worth of tokens from the list three minutes before the list was made public however while the tokens briefly spiked in the hours after the announcement it does not appear that the trader was able to turn a profit as the wallet address holds less than four hundred thousand dollars despite hitting five hundred and fifty thousand dollars plus at one point in related news robin hood announced four new tokens on its platform customers now have access to comp matic soul and ship circle raises 400
