of delphi digital and victor boone protocol specialist at coinbase cloud formerly known as bison trails welcome yacht and victor hey so good to be here thanks for having me token designs are getting more diverse and more creative but before we dive into the meat of the episode let's just make sure everybody even really understands what we're talking about why don't each of you say what you think the definition of tokenomics is and why it's important and victor why don't we start with you sure so the way that i think about tokenomics is the ability to use incentive design to set the behaviors that you want and consistently accomplish them normally this includes the use of a token but it doesn't always have to there's a lot of social pressures and other responsibilities and ethics and other cultural norms that also play into it and yan what about you yeah not to restate too much of what victor mentioned but yeah the idea is a token is kind of a mechanism to organize a a set of individuals where you know if you assume that they all act in their own best interests or in a way that's most logical for them how do you kind of organize that and combine that in a positive some way to create value or kind of accomplish what you want to accomplish and so when people are designing these incentive mechanisms and tokens what types of factors are they considering whether it's things like fairness or liquidity or security or the developer ecosystem or i'm sure there's plenty of other considerations but what do you find that people are thinking about and tend to value for some of the different choices like maybe you could give some examples of how that either affects the community or affects the value of the token i yeah i think one of the most important things is for protocol teams or communities to first figure out like what it is that they're trying to accomplish and what their token specifically will be used for so in a lot of work token models for example such as live peer or keep a new cypher or the graph the token is used to provide a service it's serving as a taxi medallion and so there's an element of security there but there's also an element of i am following the rules of protocol and providing a service to specific specifications and i want to be able to do that in a consistent way but also punish folks that are breaking the rules of their protocol or not providing that that service in a consistent way and so that's gonna be one of the first things that you think about is like how does the toe can actually accomplish the goals of providing this useful uh work to an ecosystem of participants and then all the other things get uh factored in afterwards such as governance how do we like what are we actually making decisions on and who are the right people to make that decision then how do you incentivize right people to actually participate in the protocol in a way that scales beyond the protocol team but it encompasses everybody else that should be part of it i'll pause here because i think jan has done so much incredible work with with uh protocol and token design that i'd love for him to chime in no no and and again yeah really largely agree with everything you're kind of describing um it's yeah it's really figuring out so what is really trying to what are you trying to realistically accomplish and how do you accomplish this and then you kind of you basically start at the the primitive of you know what is the goal how do you get there and and so you start incentivizing you know certain elements of behavior around getting achieving this goal and then afterwards it becomes kind of this very iterative process of of understanding all right you know you can accomplish a goal this way but with crypto everyone is is encrypted there's a lot of very savvy actors and so there's always going to be kind of exploits and so the whole idea is okay yes it's very it's fairly easy to get someone to do something but it's fairly it's the difficult part is how to prevent all the other kind of potential uh negative actors or kind of value extractive actors where just because you reward somebody for doing something and and you get them to do something that doesn't necessarily mean that this is a sustainable model or one that that's kind of foolproof so it's it's yeah it's figuring out what you want them to do and then kind of figuring out how to prevent everyone else from extracting value in a way that that doesn't necessarily you know go in line with what you're doing and at the same time you know there's a lot of importance with the so the community and the stickiness component is so with crypto unlike in other places forks are are very prevalent and so if your protocol and we we see it mostly in d5 and that's part of the issue is there's a lot of kind of mercenary capital and mercenary behavior that can exist and so you know you take a step back and think all right not only do i need to figure out how to incentivize them to do something and prevent someone else from doing it but how do i create some kind of stickiness longevity community how do i create actual incentives for them to stick around other than kind of you know pure tribalism which it happens to work in in certain communities but it's often a byproduct of of you know being very early where individuals have made kind of life-changing money and and a protocol and so now they're kind of they're they're tribalistically with it but realistically you have to assume most are going to be mercenary-esque to some extent obviously there's a spectrum there but it's realizing all right on top of that how do i kind of prevent individuals from you know accomplishing what i want them to accomplish but then not kind of redoing that cycle elsewhere because it's so easy to kind of fork what's been designed and so i think that that's been a fun learning process and just observational process with defy in particular especially you know over the past uh two years or so yeah in a way it actually reminds me of um kind of like a really basic thing that maybe parents sometimes deal with where they're like oh should i try to incentivize my children to do you know whatever like chores or get good grades or you know eat healthy or whatever buy either paying them or you know rewarding them with like sweets or you know whatever it might be but then it's like well what's better is that you want them to intrinsically want to do those things rather than you know trying to game the system in order to get the rewards so it'd be like what you're describing just reminds me of that but so both of you have helped design or redesign various tokens and i thought it might be fun for each of you to just pick one example that you would like to describe of a team that you helped you know maybe it was like they had a particular problem they were trying to solve and like just walk us through why you know you all made the choices that that you made and either one of you could go first maybe i don't know if eon you want to because i know delphi uh is sort of known for this so yeah yeah it's like a popular one's actually but i think um just because that one's been you know really overly discussed now um it would be more interesting to kind of talk about uh so ash report is a project that we're uh incubating heavily through delphi labs and and so it's a decentralized exchange that's on the lunar ecosystem and um so you know we've worked a lot of various d5 protocols and and both in terms of like consulting capacity and just um or done plenty of research on them and it's interesting you see a decent amount of iterations so there's kind of multiple innovation layers with dexes whether it's just the actual you know amms the automated marquee maker type um like a uniswap where you know it started with this simple xyk model and over time those have evolved but there hasn't necessarily been as much evolution on the token design front and so you know we saw the first instances of of the value of a token when the sushi vampire attack happened right where unit swap was a dominant decentralized exchange and then sushi basically you know it was a fork of unit swap and then they were able to incentivize a token on top and the whole idea is you know come to our exchange and and use it and we'll give you tokens and reward for providing liquidity and the ideas if you provide the liquidity there you kind of start the virtuous cycle of liquidity gets volume which generates fees which creates more liquidity and so you know that exists but sushi's had its own issues where the the disconnect there was uh and this is where the introduction of kind of like very mercenary s capital happened where there was a disconnect between the users of the platform and the the token itself so uh as a token holder you you benefit from the fees on the platform where um basically by by staking sushi you you take uh a six of the fees that are generated on the platform the the issue there was you kind of have this dichotomy where the users of the platform you have the traders and or the liquidity providers there's no real reason for them to hold the token and then you have the people that own the token and they they're just pure speculators that can benefit from upside there and the the loose agreement to some extent was basically you know as sushi price appreciated the value in terms of the rewards that they can use to incentivize behavior that would be value creative to the platform increases right if i if i can give away one sushi if it's worth you know one dollar versus ten dollars there's it goes along a longer way with being at ten dollars so there was like this kind of that was the dynamic but once you know it's very reflective on the way up but it's also can be very reflexive on the way down whereas price goes down the way your your ability to incentivize behavior you know diminishes and and so um then you know volume is less or rather liquidy kind of disappear and so on and so forth and so the the gap there is you have this disconnect between the users that are participating on the network or using the platform and those that are holding the token and so with astroport we're kind of trying to tackle that and you know we've we're taking some tips so curve has um an interesting model where you can use the token and lock it up to to basically vote on rewards towards your pool and and so you also and you're kind of seeing this with like token mac as well where owning the token can you can stake the token and direct rewards to a pool and so we're kind of combining a lot of elements there where basically the design here is um you have you know similar components where with sushi you take sushi you stake it into a pool you get x sushi which is a claim on that pool and the idea is over time the fees from the platform are used to buy back sushi deposit it into the pool and your ex sushi over time is worth more sushi so you know you deposit one sushi you have one ex sushi and then over time you can withdraw that like you can kind of redeem that x sushi for more than one and so that's how like the value accrual exists whereas so we kind of take it a step further and basically allow you to take that x sushi and deposit it into which is x astro deposit it into a voting contract and you know the amount you your vote is is a function of how much you stake and how long you stake it for and the idea there is okay what are you actually voting on so with the the fee structure it's you there's usually like a 30 bips like fee capture and what we're basically doing is rather than users pay 30 basis points typically 25 would go to the liquidity providers and 5 goes to the protocol so we're kind of lowering that a bit and doing 20 basis points to liquidity providers so 5 base and then 10 goes to the protocol 5 goes to that similar x sushi x astro equivalent and then kind of combining the curve thought process basically you can then stake your ex astro and you get this locked voting share so the um the benefit there is as a community if you have if you're providing you know if you're if you're if you're a fan of a certain token and you have liquidity on on uh astro the benefit now is the community hold holders want to be token holders because they can vote basically to direct a certain level of rewards to their individual pools so basically if if you're a liquidity provider on astro it's in your best interest to also be an astro token holder because you can direct a certain amount of vote towards your pool and then like kind of taking that a step further you know if you have let's say 15 pools and there's obviously a lot more but let's say you have 15 pools that want to participate in in order of like of voting rank if you're number nine versus number 10 your you know incremental value of voting from 10 to nine and so the idea is you know your share of rewards is a function of your share of the vote if you know if you're in ninth place or tenth place there's no real incentive to to participate or like there's no like additional incentive to participate it's just like a very micro level vote and so we've introduced kind of like a a a list that gradually expands and so if you don't make the cut you are effectively you're you're missing out on the rewards but if you're in this like top eight list so basically you're always going to have a lot of competition at the high end because there's going to be a lot of kind of you know that the very popular pools are always going to be they're going to have larger communities but it's the the smaller communities that are often forgotten but here you're kind of creating a lot of um incentive for them to participate because you know coming in eighth means you're actually going to get so eighth in in a scenario where all 15 participate you're getting a lot less eight in a scenario where only top eight participate you're getting a lot more and also going from eight to nine is a massive drop-off because you don't actually participate in any of the kind of the rewards and then there's a lot of kind of additional um attack vectors that exist with with kind of like convex and and kind of uh like hijacking of governance and so i i don't want to kind of uh hog up the entire conversation but that's one area where you know what we like to do is basically you know observe what works read about it figure out why it doesn't work and then try and kind of iterate and combine different facets and and and potentially introduce some of our own and that's kind of like the thought process behind a lot of um the token design that we work on it sounds super interesting and wait when is this going to launch um we can talk about it here as well but but the launch mechanism is one we're really excited about as well because it kind of addresses some of the issues with distribution and yeah i can take a pause before going into that but so that's going to launch the first part it's it's a three-stage process but it'll start on december 6th uh okay yeah we'll we'll circle back to that about the launch but one other thing that actually i meant to say a while back was earlier when you just described uniswap as xyk for people who maybe are new or don't understand that's just like the equation that is used to you know kind of maintain the price uh in each liquidity pool so you know the price of each token should always equal this constant k or when you multiply them the two of them all right um so it's super interesting and yeah uh i think there's like plenty we can unpack from there but victor why don't you pick one token design that you want to walk us through i had the pleasure of actually working on the first decentralized protocol merge between new cypher and keep networks um at bison trails we are essentially just a blockchain infrastructure provider and we support both those protocols and they both provide cryptographic services for folks that are that are interacting with them and the fascinating thing there is that they started off with with different use cases and that new service started off with proxy encryption and keep network started off with random beacon which is such a random around number generator and some other services as well and what we saw is that they were increasingly going to go and compete against one another in specific use cases and so because i was very close to both of the teams and we were able to start you know having conversations on what could potential merger look like and i ended up being one of the leads of the proposals that actually uh went through governance and was voted on and accepted for how to merge the two protocols and the two communities into a single community and a single protocol and one of the interesting things there is that it's one there's no playbook or roadmap it it is incredibly incredibly hard to do a merger of equals because of all of the you know different places that each protocol is in different tone distributions and different incentive designs that they have and different you know considerations around uh you know inflation and whatnot and so one of the things that uh was a big a big priority for me is actually well two bits the first bit was around how do you design for what the network will look like in its ultimate state and that was crucial because we talked about earlier about work token models is that they're providing services and the nice thing about cryptographic services is that you can provide them in a modular fashion now you say okay here's the building block and what this does is proxy encryption here and this does some zero knowledge stuff or here this does some homomorphic encryption and so on and so what you can do is you can actually opt into these services and you can uh provide some or all of them depending on what your preferences are as a node operator and so one of the important things of the incentive model is you want to be able to direct incentives to uh encourage node operators to provide certain services that you think it's important for the network to do and so it's a really specific example uh soon the new network is going to be called thresholds it's actually launching i believe sometime next month uh which is gonna be really exciting and on it is going to launch something called tbtc uh which is the version two of it and you obviously want this tbc which is decentralized bitcoin you want people to adopt it you want people to support it and you know provide that service and so that's going to be probably one of the things that the community is going to vote to incentivize and so you have a bunch of these notes like hey guys we need a lot of nodes to make this successful we need to be super decentralized we need for there to be a lot of support for it and therefore we're going to direct more of the rewards towards that use case rather than other ones for example that are less of a priority for the for the ecosystem so that's like the first thing around how do you make sure that the actual work itself gets done and is incentivized the second part and this is quite challenging is that when you have these two two token amounts and two communities and two whatever how do you actually get them to use a single token like what is a fair way to do it right is it based off of the value of each token is based on you know the quantities and whatnot um and if you say okay the new cyber team will get sixty percent because their market cap is larger than the keep side and they only get forty percent they're not going to be happy right the keep token holders are going to hold a grudge that's what uh we were very fortunate that the you know the market caps were fairly close together the stages of the life cycle were fairly close together and therefore we could have done it and we did do it as a merger of equals where each token holder base got exactly half of the token distribution um and then you can you know map that using target factors essentially to convert uh go from one to the other but for uh the future when there's going to be token mergers uh i think a lot of them are gonna look like uh acquisitions more than mergers and that there's going to be greater disparities between the teams and it's gonna be less a merger of equals and more of a one team subsuming the other one of the nice things about threshold is that now it sets it up so that um new teams can actually join the network and that ethereum is only protocol out there that has like multiple clients that are you know in active development and threshold is going to be one of the only workforce models it's also going to have multiple client teams and the ability to add more client teams as other folks want to come and you know add modular cryptographic services and then petition the community to say hey like you should adopt this and you should fund it and you should direct uh itself rewards to go towards the service that we're providing so that node operator is adopted and provided to the community so it was really cool to work on it and i'm excited to see more uh mergers in the near future amongst other protocols yeah yeah um i think that will become a bigger thing and obviously we did see in terms of uh one involving you know two protocols that were maybe less equal was obviously the polygon and her hermes or i don't know how to pronounce it um deal but uh actually let's now talk about a big change in tokenomics that happened for ethereum which obviously is one of the biggest it's the second biggest protocol which i'm sure everybody knows so in april you know they adopted eip1559 which started burning the base fee and obviously we've seen that this is now led to eth being deflationary at times sometimes like for you know kind of a decent amount of time which is fascinating just you know and that's that's being driven by things like nfts and and stuff like that um but i was curious for your opinion on uh kind of those changes and how well you think that design has played out and will continue to play out for ethereum especially as it transitions to the final merge for ethereum 2.0 yeah so i actually um i took a look at this yesterday so i have some really really fresh metrics on it um so thus far the iap1559 has reduced the net ethereum issuance by about two-thirds which is a really a really significant cut and while ethereum still is inflationary from that perspective um if ethereum were to switch over to the merge today um it would actually be fairly significantly deflationary and i think that it has actually a couple of really really interesting impacts some of them that are shorter term and some of them that are longer term in the shorter term eip159 is is like catnip to institutional investors because ethereum makes a lot of sense to them and that they say okay this is a thing that you can build on and it has use cases and applications and yada yada yada and also you know before people would say well how is eth going to capture any of this upside it has no mechanism and you know folks that have been around in industry for a long time realize that if something is useful it's going to be valuable right and that's what happened with ethereum but as new folks and especially institutions enter the space and now they can say okay well we can actually model the cash flows and the impact of this of these activities and what this does to uh the supply of it and how that could potentially impact price um that becomes like a really attractive uh narrative for them to latch on to and this is combined at the same time with the merge occurring with the ability to stake ethereum and so now you have eth that is this you know revenue generating quote-unquote asset that you're able to provide security with earn rewards on and you're able to see how the supply of it will change over time and you can like model all that against your your income as a validator and so i think from that perspective in the short term that is why i think a lot of uh enterprises institutions and and you know funds are extremely excited about ethereum where we've seen such inflows into the ecosystem from that perspective in the long term though i'm a little bit uh maybe a little a little bit concerned in that i think the the nice thing about ethereum is that you want people to spend it you want people to use it i don't think it's meant to be something that you just sit on and wait for it to appreciate and when you have something that's deflationary one of the core characteristics of it is that you're expecting for it to go up in value but if you're expecting something to go up in value you have less desire to spend it and while that may be great for currencies like bitcoin um i don't think that's the right uh framework for something that is meant to be used and is meant to be to pay for gas and is meant to fuel this this economy which is its from that perspective i think i'm i'm super bullish on yeah be 159 in terms of its impact on ethereum but i think long term one of the things we're going to come to is to figure out like where that you know inflationary versus deflationary kind of like direction has to end up in order for us to accomplish our goals of making something that's really useful for people john do you want to add anything yeah yeah no i think those are all really good points crypto's probably one if not the most like reflexive thing i've really ever come across um and and i think so if you look at you know the net issuance or the kind of net inflation relative to um you know the change it's not that seismic right if you think about it on like you know in terms of the the amount that's being burned relative to the size of the entire kind of um the entire protocol but but the narrative is is very very strong and and like victor mentioned you know it's very it's very um digestible for you know people who are used to seeing buybacks and it's like oh i can i can you know think of it akin to this and so it becomes you know very digestible and familiar and and so that's very massive and then the other thing is you know if you go to this like kind of net deflationary narrative then it goes from all right this just becomes something that i can kind of use as as a random currency that i'm not really looking to sit on to all right i'm happy using this as a form of collateral to borrow against or or kind of holding this as some form of sore value and so i think what ends up happening is that in in the similar way that that bitcoins finite supply is what really is part of what strengthens its store value narrative i think this deflationary kind of component also strengthens the the store value narrative for ethereum and so i get the apprehension for you know i think that's a super fair point where you know eventually it could come come back to bite you a bit where you know part of it is meant to be spent but i think realistically you know ethereum pre being deflationary still could have been easily considered a store value because you know the incremental difference in that issuance or burn isn't that massive it's only really seen over the course of many many years but this net deflationary kind of component that's where the reflexivity comes in it's like okay this is the net deflationary we think there's going to be more adoption so we think this will only be increasingly more net deflationary so i'm very comfortable using this to store value oh man others are using this as a store value so i will as well and so it's like this small shift that just kind of loops and loops and and it like reverberates through the communities holders and investor mindset and so i i do think that like you know obviously the concern of people not wanting to spend something like you know the idea that's why i don't think bitcoin will ever be this you know global like currency it's just that's not what it is or at least you know for from my opinion but the interesting thing with youth is that like i think the the net spend on gas for most people is negligible so you know if you're spending it and and so it's like what else are you really spending it on if you're no one's really going out and buying cars with eth you're buying other things in in the crypto community with eth whether that be nfts or or i mean ft's being a big thing and an empty is obviously like a massive sub sector whether it's in games or just art but most of those things end up being priced in eath as well and so to that respect most people are i think are you comfortable spending it because you're still kind of exposed to it but like yeah the the gas component is obviously an interesting one in terms of spend but you know in bull markets people are clearly comfortable spending just obnoxious amounts on it as evidenced by the the burns that we see during these nft mints and things along those lines huh okay yeah i mean it's gonna be a really fascinating thing to see play out i mean i think your point that against the total supply the burn is small may be what will offset that desire to hodl rather than spend but i you know i i think we won't really know until it happens yeah i i guess the one thing that i like about eip1559 is it does you know just tie together so much more closely usage and demand with the price which just seems like intuitively how it should be right you know if something is being widely used it should be valuable and then therefore that should cause the price to go up but you're right that then it kind of has these other knock-on effects so uh it'll yeah we'll we'll just have to see how that plays out even to that it kind of like shifts the value from value flowing to miners to you know value flowing a bit more to the protocol as a whole whereas before it was pocketed by by them and now it kind of just reduces the supply which is is more kind of the socializing the benefit yeah yeah it yeah it widens that i i love that actually that totally makes sense um okay so in a moment we're going to talk about all kinds of other issues and problems

link in the description back to my conversation with jan and victor so we did see a couple of issues recently with a couple of popular airdrops uh one was ens um the ethereum name service airdrop and you know people which i mean i think this happens all the time but again people were gaming the system so do you want to kind of describe what happened there what the problem was and then how you guys think maybe it could have been resolved differently or or better yeah so one of the challenges there was that somebody had either leaked or figured out or somehow optimized their bot to spin up a whole bunch of new ethereum addresses put some meat into them register enos names and you know make sure that you they set all the parameters correctly and either through inside knowledge or some sort of locker determination uh they managed to secure themselves what would have been a very sizable air drop amount of ens tokens because they met all the eligibility criteria in order to maximize that and you know it's one of those things where the community uh spotted it early and they gave feedback to the team that these addresses were engaged in this behavior the team reviewed the behavior of those accounts and also other accounts as part of the list of accounts that were going to be receiving the airdrop and banned i actually remember the exact number maybe about 1500 uh addresses from the list uh so they block listed them and so those addresses did not receive any any token airdrops and you know some folks have different opinions about it but i think that what it kind of boils down to is and you know i think a lot of things actually tie in directly back to whether or not you think code is long and whether or not you're supposed to apply it you know equally to absolutely everybody regardless of whether or not they're a good actor or a bad actor and i fundamentally disagree with that i you know in circumstances like this nobody's entitled to an airdrop nobody's entitled entitled to receive you know not only free money but also a say in how the network is going to govern itself and spend its funds and otherwise incentivize adoption and so on and so i think it's actually it's not only optional i think it's a responsibility of every protocol team considering doing an airdrop to be thoughtful about who they're dropping the tokens to and to intentionally comb through the list of you know the list of accounts and see are these real users are these people that are going to be contributing or are these people that are militias or that are vultures or that are value-extracted because when we think about it you don't start a company or a family or a school based off of whoever's around right like you don't do it through this random chance of like whoever shows up right it's like all right guess we're doing this together you're intentional about it why because if you're bringing in people that are bad actors not only does it like unfairly benefit them but it also hurts the good actors and they see that people that are bad actors are are getting money and they're getting benefits and you know they're doing that in a way that is making people that are good actors that and do try to like play by the rules like feel really negatively about it so i i'm you know a hundred percent in support of what the ens team did and i look forward to other teams doing that and also much more to make sure that you know their air dropping tokens in a way that's very targeted and very intentional and truly accomplishes the goals that they set out to do yeah and actually before yon reason i mean like something kind of similar happened with paraswap and i just wondered in general because what ens did to resolve it was a retroactive solution but i wondered also if you guys had ideas on how airdrops could be designed ahead of time to not fall victim to these bots that are trying to farm the air drop because with paraswap their estimate was that some people were deploying literally tens of thousands of months which is that's that's a lot so i don't know if you have thoughts on that yeah i mean i i have a quick thought and then i'd love to pass it over to yon i i think one of the things and this may be like important to comment on is that just like we were talking about with tony design earlier with airdrop design you have to have a specific goal in mind of what you're trying to do and there's a couple of like high level goals that people should try to accomplish or probably are trying to accomplish and one of them is going to be you know give folks skin in the game or like the people that you actually want to to continue to stay part of the ecosystem that have been providing value and being active the other bit is you want to obviously incentivize early users and people that have helped you get to where you are and the third thing is that you want to think about how do you treat this as a customer acquisition cost um not only to acquire your existing customers but also continue acquiring customers long into the future so you're not turning people off i say okay like only a small subsection of people will get it and other people won't and so i think that with with folks like paraswap they did i think a generally good job generally a good job on their airdrop in that they were super targeted they knew exactly who they wanted to get in there and they got those people in but the mistake that they made was that it wouldn't have cost them a lot to get all the other users that aren't bots and just give them a little bit of skin in the game and give them a quick thank you you don't have to make those people very rich but you should acknowledge that they help you get to where you are in in a way that doesn't then make them salty uh about not not having received anything at all and so i think that was one of the mistakes that they made and so when you think about like what ultimately drives a good uh airdrop design i think more and more what it's going to come to is identity and that identity can be done in like a super reputation-based way and in your activities and whatever but honestly i think identities can be done the identity way of saying okay how do we tie back like real world identifiers to whether it's ens or one of these other things because what you want ultimately is you want a proof of uniqueness a proof of identity or proof of humanness and then when you have that in some variation you're able to be much more intentional about okay you know this is a person that's super active and they do all this governance and all this activity and therefore we want them to be participating in governance activity on our protocol as well and like boom you can do that um or this person is a whale but they're like a long-term whale versus a short-term will and so you started being able to be like really granular by getting the right people uh in the door so i think i think we're getting there there's decentralized efforts obviously but i think centralized ones will always also get us like part of the way there so we'll just see which one of those like takes off first and actually gets adopted by enough users to make it worthwhile to use it to target john um yeah yeah i couldn't agree more with basically everything uh victor said yeah the issue is obviously the the the parasitic um participants there it's a double whammy right where they're not only are they extracting value but they're making the value that you gave to everyone else also worse and just kind of you know they're taking kind of hitting you on both ends where they shouldn't be getting it and now those that got it are worse off than if the the people that shouldn't be getting it even got it in the first place and and so yeah it's certainly a problem and yeah so i i very much agree that um this identity kind of situation is certainly going to be one that's going to be uh more on the forefront where like we're very bullish on on the idea of on-chain identity and and so um in that you can you know provably verify what an individual's participation has been over the past x amount of time and you can pretty you know easily not easily but quickly kind of get a rough quantifiable idea of how much value they can really provide to your protocol as well and so you can be a lot more kind of targeted and particular with your airdrops and so yeah like one of the things we're actually working on is a is this kind of nfc primitive where you'll be able to effectively kind of customize your nfts based on um rewards you've gotten and those rewards are a function of your participation in in various protocols and so you you'll have these kind of like you can basically combine uh you know a shell with different whether it's um you know different details so it can be like a you know imagine like a pfp that you that that iterates and evolves over time based on what you've accomplished and so it's a way you know there's that there's a public side where you can obviously show off like oh man this guy was a massive whale here and he was one of the first lps here and and so that's you know super valuable both in terms of just elevating the kind of status of your of your uh pfp that wasn't just you know a function of you spending a bunch or getting lucky with a mint it's actually work you've done and at the same time it's potentially a way to also identify valuable participants and ecosystems and then you can you can do this across chains right like if this exists you can you can monitor these these valuable participants across chains and and now with bridging and kind of how easy it is to to move across them you can bring liquidity bring users bring these power users or you know really get targeted with these air drops because yeah otherwise it can be a massive waste in terms of uh customer acquisition costs and then you know a poor air drop just really sets you on on poor footing to to begin with where you know it just shouldn't be a disadvantage you really need to deal with there's a lot of obviously other things that you need to target and so part of part of a good air drop is also having good token design going forward where all right yes you rewarded a certain user but then is there a reason for them to actually hold it beyond just being a fan and thinking number go up or you know is there a way for them to use it to actually interact the protocol and whether that's through a government through governance through monetary benefits you know it really depends on kind of what what the protocol does but yeah it all really starts with equality air drop and then quality kind of integrations afterwards yeah and actually just to go back to this identity issue because i also as i was even just writing the questions for this i was like oh gosh i feel like until we have blockchain based identities then this is going to be a problem but i came across a blog post that anil what's his last name i nailed uh leila lula lula okay right um adelphi he wrote about how one resolution would be to link reputation to yield and is that what you're talking about just like seeing oh certain actresses participated in these various protocols in different ways is that how he's defining reputation to some extent i think you can have more objective metrics where you know as black and white did you participate and to what extent and you can you know quantify that without any real subjectivity the reputation component is a really interesting one because it's when you're thinking about like token design it's all right how do i really keep someone incentivized through participation or like how do i create some level of stickiness and in the early days it was always financial and and that's tough because it's that's often zero-sum in the sense that if i'm giving you extra financial benefits it usually comes at the expense of of someone else or the protocol or something like that whereas with reputation that can be its own community-based kind of element in the sense that reputation can be granted by others to others within the community and so you have this like natural filter of the people who know the most are actually able to distribute the most reputation but obviously there's ways to gamify that and so you constantly have to kind of think through these loops and and really ensure that there aren't really these attack factors because you know as good as design can be if if there's a way to exploit it and it breaks it really diminishes all the value that's been built up previously and so but yeah we're very bullish on the idea of kind of reputation with endows within ecosystems to allow those who are actually you know knowledgeable really con um contributing a lot to to kind of rise to the top and and it and then it becomes you know healthier for all participants where you know i think with dow's especially if they get really large you're gonna have this free rider problem and and that can be very parasitic but to to be able to really uh incentivize and reward the people that are actually delivering the most value ends up being you know very useful for everyone involved yeah and and if i if i can determine just one other thing there is that you know one thing going back to your point earlier about kids uh having extrinsic and intrinsic motivation i think one of the conclusions that we're gonna have to come to as an industry is right now we're trying like very hard to make things as extrinsic as possible and that everything's happening on chain and it's on chain reputation on chain contributions and you look at your activity but i think the reality is that especially as like these dows and organizations need to scale you're gonna have a lot of soft reputation you're gonna have a lot of intrinsic motivations you're gonna have like a lot of the stuff that happens off-chain because you're ultimately dealing with humans coordinating with other humans and so it seems like right now one of the things that we're doing is we're saying okay how far can we push it in the direction of everything on chain everything extrinsic and then from there you kind of walk it back and you say okay you can't have everything be on chain and extrinsic which parts we need to have the off chain and intrinsic and a little bit softer okay yeah i think uh probably in in a way there's i mean already we're seeing there's gonna be like a big mix of of designs um but that also now takes me because we've been talking about these air drops where like the protocol has already launched but they're kind of like retroactively rewarding users and i wanted to ask about like launching coins as i'm sure you're well aware there's this tension between the fair launch coins and the vc coins and that goes back to this you know question that has been you know for forever in in crypto even like before i started covering this six years ago which is the issue of like you know pre-mine or no pre-mine and um and of course now that also raises questions from like vesting and lockups and i'm wondering if you guys have an opinion on on all that like if you think it's always better to just try to do the fair launch thing or um you know what whether you think a prime ever could make sense and if so how that should be designed uh so you think about doing i guess like fair launch versus you know vc investors as someone who is a vc investor like naturally i guess there would be some inherent bias but you know realistically we're always trying to think of what's the best um approach here and i think the the biggest issue is that thinking that it has to be binary you know having vcs that are actually builders and and helping uh contribute to what you're designing can be very useful versus i think what we see what we sometimes see is just you know in the same way you have mercenary capital in in these launch strategies you also have mercenary kind of vcs that are just investing in a bunch of places and don't really have the capacity to to add value besides just you know the capital they provide and so i i do think to some extent having the right investors is is more valuable than not but i you know i i get the idea from those that aren't investing from their perspective that you know it isn't fair in in terms of what's being delivered so ideally the idea is that bringing these investors on board actually ends up being more value creative than than not and so you know you're owning a smaller slice of a larger pie is kind of the idea and so you always want it to be fair and it's like what what is the definition of fare you know to some i think it started with a bit with wi-fi and the idea is fair as it has to start with zero and everyone kind of minds but you know at the same time is it fair that the people that found out about it in the first 24 or 48 hours are gonna just out like farm you by a larger extent and like then does it really become fair and so i think we've seen the definition of fair kind of gradually evolve and i think fair ends up being you know a very public pre-announced um distribution plan where you explain each component why it everyone has the ability to participate and their participation actually adds value to what you're trying to build or what mechanism you're trying to design and so i think you know fair has has shifted where previously was just zero investors first people in are starting to get it to all right it's fair in the sense that you're not gonna have uh people who can code in solidity snipe or like you know you're not gonna have people who can code snipe out um the initial drop and and fair is is now what's the most equitable way to distribute where certain people aren't disadvantaged because they're not as technically savvy or they didn't hear about it in a small chat first and so yeah i think the definition of fair has really evolved and you know i ideally that's kind of where we sit in terms of that that kind of conversation yeah so it's it's interesting if i can actually maybe push back on the question a little bit and that i actually think that's the wrong question to ask in that like we've seen super decentralized token launchers that are from zero like and urine is a good example or grand for example in the in the layer one space and we've seen super centralized circuit launches right uh where a ton of the supply is held by insiders and i think one of the things that we're coming to the conclusion of is that like they obviously impact how successful a protocol is going to be but it is not necessarily resulting in a more or less successful protocol just from that and what we found was this kind of random right how successful the protocol would be whether or not it launched you know fairly or unfairly you know quote-unquote i think the better question and this is something that nobody's been able to answer so far is how do you continue distributing a token over its lifetime in a way that is fair and that i think is a hard part like right now the closest thing that we have is like okay you're gonna do liquidity mining right and then if you're a liquidity provider you will continue getting you know getting some tokens and that's kind of like the v1 of it but you know the other question is how do you continue to incentivize you know people that participate in governance and people that add value and people that are thoughtful and there are companies that are uh you know adopting it or building partnerships for tooling for it or whatever and so those are the questions that we really need to answer and right now it's done in a little bit of a crude way and now you have a one-off governance proposal too let's give this person a grant or let's fund this marketing effort or whatever but these are oftentimes like one not utilized enough and two they're kind of crude and really what you want is you want to find a way to continue deploying a charter you continue to deploy inflation and continue to incentivize people to do value additive things that distribute the token more and more widely over time to the right people doing the right things that's the part that nobody's really been able to answer and it's also in a lot of ways independent of whether or not the you know the token was like fairly launched or unfairly launched and i think you know one thing we've seen is that you can have like a pretty small pretty small token launch but then you have you know quote unquote a theoretically unlimited amount of time that these things will be live for right they can go on forever and so based off what you started and then what you do it really starts to starts to compound and that's the area that we need to be focused on yeah well so talk about that like what do you think is the optimal way to you know structure a liquidity mining program because as you guys have talked about throughout the episode you don't want to attract this mercenary capital that is just going to leave you once once the rewards you know taper off or whatever it is so you know what are your thoughts it's really about rewarding the users that are it's a combination of rewarding users that are are you know going to be interacting with your protocol and then also having a a way for them to do so right so um and not not to pick on on sushi here but just just like we were already on the topic but so like they're they're they had an awesome you know initial kind of um distribution uh situation and you know this very successful vampire attack the idea was um for the rewards that you got um one-third you'd get up front and then two-thirds would vest over time and so that that worked in in in two ways where you know initially it was very reflexive on the way up very reflexive on the way down where you know i'm providing liquidity i'm getting this yield and i can only sell one third of it so i'm you know i'm seeing a large number come in and i can only really liquidate a smaller portion of it and then so what happens is you know a lot a lot of liquidity because now number continues to go up and so you know it gets very reflexive but then the the kind of the the subsequent headwind is that after this mercenary capital has realistically left you know they've farmed it and there's potentially another farm and that's kind of the issue with d5 in general where if there if it can be very mercenary where okay i'll fork it and now how do i compete on a natural level when somebody else can just fork and then create new a new wave of incentives and so that like that kind of happened and then you started to see the unlocks come in and the unlocks were now given to people who are probably no longer providing liquidity so now you know they're not really adding much value but they're contributing to a decent amount of kind of selling and so yeah it ends up being very way up but very you know negative on the way down so the idea is you have to kind of understand you know you want to introduce enough supply into the market where it's enough to reward people not enough where you're basically overpaying because you know like victor mentioned it all of this is effectively customer acquisition costs and so if you're overpaying it can be uh it can considerably you know weigh down the protocol as a whole where if you're over rewarding certain activities that that aren't necessarily as valuable as the rewards you're giving it it's you know negative and so that's kind of one thing to keep in mind and then the other is understanding all right these are users who you know it once they receive the token they in that situation they can either sell it or stake it and you know with the expectation of number going up but there aren't really additional benefits outside of that but when you kind of start to introduce ways for them to continuously benefit from the ownership of the token it's when it's basically you want your customers to also be your token holders rather than uh distinguishing the two and so when you distinguish the two you have to kind of provide separate incentives to some extent but if you can overlap them i think the incentives themselves become much more effective because it's not purely just cash it's actually a valuable asset that they're getting that they can uh leverage to to you know receive further benefits and so it's really just all kind of boils down to this this game of incentive alignment so i don't know if this is a a little bit of a hot take um i'll you guys be the judge of that but i think we should assume that liquidity providers are always going to be mercenary capital like when we think about who has the most liquidity in the world it's always going to be investors and institutions and money managers like and like large institutional players and what do those people care about they care about yield right and from that perspective i think it makes sense to like think of them as always just optimizing for yield and you know there will be component of oh i think this network will grow and i think you know all this stuff but treat them all as mercenaries and so then what does that mean well what it means is that what we currently think of liquidity mining programs in terms of let's give money to liquidity providers i think it should be flipped on its head and that really what you want to optimize for is usage because if you have a lot of usage right the fees are being generated by the by the protocol will be high which will be the incentive for liquidity providers to come and say hey right now it's paying out 20 i'm willing to accept a rate of as low as 10 percent and so i'm going to put a ton of liquidity into here until you know the rate hits what i'm what i'm willing to accept and so from that perspective i think that nobody's really figured out how to do that yet because one way what crude way that we've seen is you say okay i'm going to incentivize the borrowing or i'm gonna incentivize the trading but you can just game that right that's so that's the whole point and especially as fees drop on things like layer twos or roll ups or whatnot uh it's going to be easier and easier to game it so the question is how do you incentivize the the kind of like ungainable uh actual adoption and usage of this protocol and nobody knows yet and nobody knows how to do that in a decentralized and trustless way you know one of the shortcuts to it is you say okay you know maybe we form a partnership with dharma or with arjun and we're like hey route all your stuff in here and we'll give you you know some you know a kickback or or it'll be subscription or it'll be something um that's obviously the centralized way so it's not a perfect way in a perfect world we'd like to find a decentralized way to do it and i think that's going to be like whichever protocol figures out how to do that how to incentivize the actual like usage and partnerships and collaborations um is going to do really well and then the liquidity will will follow that so we're running out of time and i literally have ditched so many questions because um like we can just go so deep on on any one of these topics but um i i did want to ask about nfts and maybe what i'll do is actually just quickly sneak in this last question that kind of is a take off what you just said but like i wonder if more of this will be about kind of like identity and community as time goes on as we're kind of seeing in the nft world and the reason that i say that was i'm pretty sure that i heard this on an episode of uh frank cipro's the scoop podcast um where he was interviewing um so i i don't remember who it was but um i think it was like somebody from gem capital and they were talking about how like uh you know which in the traditional financial world is like all about keeping things close to your vest but then they were saying that now if for their crypto activities they are trying to get involved in governance and in the community and like being more transparent you know the way that he was describing it it just sort of seemed like it was almost like becoming they were like creating this identity for themselves in this space right and you know when you're watching things like what's happening with the nft world with board api club where you know they gave the board a uh owners you know the rights to make derivative works and things like that and then now we're seeing like all these new projects coming out of out of that so i i'm wondering if like that is how you kind of make it more organic but i'm curious for your thoughts and any other thoughts you want to say about designing nfts because um you know to incentivize kind of like the value there yeah well you know i think that what it boils down to and so at bison trails i'm part of maybe like 40 or 50 different protocol communities at this point and so we've seen all the different iterations of going from a tesla to intensify tesla to mainnet and how all these different ecosystems come up and the thing that keeps sticking out in the protocol space whether i'm looking at layer one or layer two or interop or dpi or nft is that community is a killer feature it's it's like it's it's that simple people try to complicate it but it's it's not complicated community is a color feature and so when we think about design and when we think about community you know management the driving force behind it should be how do you create a community of leaders that act as owners that have the agency and ability to go and do like what they want to do in order to add value and there's a degree of trust there right because if you're if you're empowering people so much you're saying hey we're trusting you to do the right thing with this power that you have and a lot of brands are very afraid of that um but what we're seeing in the you know board yacht club community is that these are folks that are extremely excited to be part of this cohesive community and they want to do things that not only make the brand better but they also have a lot of fun doing together and so from that perspective i think it's you know they've done like a truly incredible job i'm not and i'm aboard a nfc owner myself as well just i guess uh to give that disclosure but i also think having said that that that is the v1 in that we haven't seen him go poorly yet you know at some point somebody's gonna you know take their ability to do this and do something pretty nefarious with it right or they're gonna do something that's uh you know very nasty for work or or whatever it is and so it'll be up to the community to figure out like where are those guardrails and what are we willing to tolerate both at the like extrinsic level of like what you're allowed to do or not allowed to do based on you know the agreements you have but also the intrinsic level of are you a good community member what are we you know welcoming as part of community and what are we not and so i think the nft space is probably going to be pushing the d5 space forward quite a bit in terms of that culture and in terms of community in terms of intrinsic stuff and i think ultimately what we what we're going to see is that a lot of the d5 folks have nfts a lot of the nfc folks have d5 and so i think these designs are going to like really build upon each other to make what is going to be um really powerful communities that can withstand shocks and withstand black swans and withstand a lot of stuff and then really thrive uh with powerful community members john yeah i largely agree that that those those two are massively overlapping now in terms of just like an ownership basis but that the functionality still hasn't really seen as much of an overlap as it certainly will in in the coming months and years and so yeah that's kind of part of the thought process behind uh the the kind of the nfc standard that we're helping uh design but also i think one thing you're actually starting to see is the value of of of a governance token within these nft communities where you know part of sometimes you're starting to see it as uh like basically you know nft communities are air dropping a token sometimes for weaker failing ones it's just like a cash grab thing which you know uh it's inevitable like it's just a kind of function to space but in the healthy and thriving ones it's just another kind of way to to coordinate and organize the community where you know you could also leverage reputation on top of that as well which which would be more merit-based than uh an airdrop which is just purely based on you know how many you own or some kind of derivative of that and so um i think what we'll start to see is is basically some kind of meta layer of governance that that's orchestrated around a token or or reputation that is used to really organize these because you know i really agree that the community is the hardest thing to build you know it can't be manufactured it can't be really incentivized purely it has to be organic there has to be some reason why people want to spend their time there it's not something like i'm here in you know i'm not idly farming this i'm actually contributing my own time and going out of my way and so i you know community is definitely the hardest thing to really build and so it's going to be natural that in as these communities grow and in order to really maintain some level of organization there needs to be something that they can use between them whether it's token or reputation to organize it all yeah and maybe and sorry for chiming in again but just the last point there is that you know board api club did announce they're gonna do uh a token and they you know probably will be air dropped or i don't know if a party will be sold doesn't matter but i think one of the interesting things there is that you have a culture that's constantly doing things that's organizing parties and and you know and getting celebrities to do stuff or getting partnerships or sponsors whatever right and the interesting thing is that once you have a token is it going to be a finite amount of it or will there be some inflationary opponent and if there is an inflationary component how do you as a community figure out what you want to incentivize not only the types of activities but also the specific individuals and there's there's a lot there to unpack is that you don't want it to be a popularity contest but also like people that are going to be doing good work are going to be well known and so how do you uh do that in a way that people feel is fair and that people are bought into the process and now you're starting to get into this really like interesting poli-sci democracy like the uh like characteristics where you really have to unpack it and almost like in some ways we learn all the lessons that we've learned over designing like the us democracy for example but then figure out like where does the crypto component sit there and how is how is the game going to be you know ninety percent of the same but like the ten percent is that it's different how is it going to be different how are we going to leverage that successfully yeah yeah one other thing that i was thinking about while you guys were discussing this also was like the friends with benefits token which i just like i was asked to comment on this uh oh well i won't say who it was for in case they don't want me to reveal but um but it was like you know what what do you think the future of money is or whatever and i was like oh i think it's going to get a lot weirder and it's going to be a lot more tied to your identity and interests um because you know if i look at things like yeah the board api club or friends with benefits like it just feels like oh yeah it's like you just have this kind of um like group that you hang out with and then you all have this identity as represented by this token and in a way it does end up sort of being like a popularity contest um i think but anyway oh my god you guys i had so many questions we did not even get to there's just like so much we could discuss on this so we we should totally redo this at some point later next year uh because the rest of my calendar for 2021 is filled out um but this was so fun uh where can people learn more about each of you and your work and and uh you know if you have any recommendations on resources for tokenomics let us know uh well for me you can just go to the bison trials website on our blog we publish a lot of stuff there or just follow me on twitter just my first name last name v-a-k-t-o-r-v-u-n-i-n victor bunyan and my piece of advice is for folks that are interested in this space make sure you get the basics um and so the internet of mo the internet of money volumes one through three by andreas antonopoulos is an incredible resource that really lays down the foundation upon which so many of the things that jan and i talked about are laid so highly recommend uh giving that a read yeah you can find out more about delphi at our website delphi digital.io you know subscribe we sent out a lot of free content um as well and so feel free to join there and then you can follow me on twitter also first name last name uh is my handle perfect well thank you both so much for coming on unchained yeah thanks so much for having us thank you thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about yawn viktor and tokenomics check out the show notes for this episode unchained it's produced by me laura shin with help from
