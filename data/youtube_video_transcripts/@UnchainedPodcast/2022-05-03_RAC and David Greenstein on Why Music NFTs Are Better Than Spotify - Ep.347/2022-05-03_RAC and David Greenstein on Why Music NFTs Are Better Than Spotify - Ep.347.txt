and jose better known as the crypto friendly artist rac and david greenstein co-founder of sound.xyz a web3 music platform welcome david and andre i guess yeah well thanks thanks for having me i really really appreciate it and thank you as well i feel like this has been a long time in the coming from your initial email when we first give you a lot of credit for reaching out back in uh december oh yeah oh my god i feel like i feel like my book launch has just kind of offended everything in my life um and i'm kind of uh grateful is not the word because obviously i've enjoyed the book tour but you know it's nice to be able to get back to work all right so the problems with the the business model in the music industry have been kind of i guess you could say iffy slow motion disaster might be another way to describe it it's been playing out over the last few decades since the internet has become dominant but before we get into kind of like everything regarding music nfts let's just make sure listeners understand the traditional business model of the music industry can you describe that and also what you think is wrong with it and why don't we start with andre so people can learn to differentiate your voices like my experience with the music industry has been uh in the form of an artist so you know i you know a lot of people sort of have different perspectives on it but like you know my my experience is working with various labels and i've worked with pretty much every label out there big and small i've done music for film and tv i've done i've done a little bit of everything and so i've had sort of i've gotten to experience almost every problem area of the music industry so i i do have a lot to say here but it's it's also important to mention that you know as much as we're we're trying to fix things like a lot of what we're trying to do is sort of start over so uh and we can get into that during this talk but you know let's start with sort of the recording side of music you know the you know the spotifys and and the uh you know the apple musics and amazon musics and all that so you know typically as as an artist you know you you work in the studio you you record a you know piece of music and you know from that point you know and it's it's relatively inexpensive i mean it's really not you know the cost of producing music has gone down pretty dramatically in the past you know 20 30 years to the point where a kid with a laptop can essentially make a professional quality you know chart topping songs so you know i guess my point is that that's it's really inexpensive and actually quite accessible to a lot of people you know we we start there and you know okay you finished the song now okay now we're thinking about distribution like where do we go from here there's sort of a variety of different methods of releasing music and and what people generally know is you know you sign to a label and and they handle that side of it and they release it for you they handle promotion they handle you know all those sort of various aspects of of releasing music in that process is sort of where i see one of the major issues in the music industry which is essentially the financial side of it you know so labels typically serve two purposes one is the the financing of music and the sort of uh you know creative support you know i'm talking about like album art you know maybe they're helping you know find the right artist to do the to the album cover or or they're finding the right uh you know record store to put it in like things like that but the the financial side of it i i really see it as sort of one of the core issues which is that it's it's almost like a loan shark model where you know they'll offer you you know let's say for the sake of this example you know a hundred thousand dollars and they call it an advance so this advance is essentially a loan that's paid back at a rate and that rate traditionally for especially on a major label is about 12 so okay you're an artist you you get 100 grams you know you're like sweet okay like half of that goes to legal right off the bat so then from there you have a little bit of money left for promotion you know maybe by the end of it you have maybe a couple thousand dollars to yourself you know for living expenses and whatnot so uh you know that that's you're a little bit limited there but the issue that i think a lot of people don't realize is when when you take an advance like that you're actually paying it back at a a 12 rate so that a hundred thousand you know you you the they call it recoupment so it's like when you when you pay that back you're paying it back at a 12 rate which effectively makes it sort of more like a million dollar a loan because the essentially the album or the song or whatever needs to make a million dollars to recoup that 100 000. so it my point is just there there's a lot of sort of shady kind of misconstrued you know tactics that people use to take advantage of young artists that think that they're supposed to do it this way and that's created i think like a really difficult environment for for an artist to to actually make a living really supports the primarily the the people that run these labels and and everybody else in the music industry essentially the artist is the last one to get paid across the board go on and on about like all the different problems of the music industry but i think that that's like sort of a key one that i think is actually directly related to crypto is is sort of the the financial side of it is like how like because it's always going to cost money to promote stuff it's always going to cost money to make music and release it so how are we financing that are we going to finance it through like really really toxic loans or are we gonna find a new model so maybe i'll just kind of keep it at that one example because like that to me is such a strong easy to fix uh you know also relevant to this conversation about music nfts is like the of sort of the fundraising side of music which is incredibly anti-artist i guess yeah i have to say i relate because although i it does sound worse than publishing a book there are aspects of it that are very similar so a lot of it what you a lot of what you said resonated with some recent experience i've had um so david what do you want to add on that yeah so a common theme that i'm sure is going to come up in this interview is just too few options it's not about one versus the other is better it's about giving artists more options to explore and experiment with their music and so on what andre just talked about which is obviously very valid and all too common is that if an artist wants to raise money for an upcoming project or an album or a music video there are very few sources today in music for where to get that creative capital and it often time comes uh obviously from the label if there's very few sources then the other party has the leverage because there's ultimately not that many places that you can turn turn to and part of what's going on here is the more sources for creative capital the more places that artists can honestly choose from the same is also true on the monetization side no matter whether you're self uploaded or you pick a label to distribute your music the next step is where do you put out that music and today the majority of recorded music revenues come from streaming which wasn't even a thing 10 plus years ago but is now obviously the dominant default and has done a lot of good to kind of like the music industry is at an all-time high right now and labels are making more than ever because of obviously the growth of streaming however the streaming didn't solve every problem and what streaming has done is it's basically become a very top-heavy model it's essentially radio with a very pretty ui on top and there are a couple reasons for that let's just say hypothetically that i'm a huge rac fan and laura you know you don't really like rac unfortunately um there's no place on on andre's spotify page that lets me give him money for his music if we took every one of his listeners and there's millions and we ask them how much do you want to pay for andre's music it seems very unlikely to me that they all decided that they want to pay roughly .003 cents per stream some fans may want to pay a lot more some fans may may want to pay a lot less but the answer is we should find out what that answer is because as a listener no listener has given input into the price of an artist's music and then the irony of the story is no artist has given input into the price of their music so andre has never determined that the price of his music on any music dsp today should be .003 cents per stream this leads to the conclusion that it seems unlikely that the entire music world has decided to value every song by every artist the exact same way which is kind of the underlying thesis behind this whole movement of maybe music is undervalued i think one of my favorite quotes actually for tweets and there's a lot of them from from andre that i always use in almost anything i say is he put out a tweet a couple right a couple maybe weeks ago a month ago around um walmart and walmart is a 300 billion dollar company and the music industry if you add up the entire music industry on recorded music is around 30 billion so the question is is the impact of the music in the world one tenth of walmart is true then um then you know i think we're all gonna be very wrong about uh obviously what's going on here but if the answer is that that's ridiculous well then music is potentially one of the most undervalued media assets in the world because it's been suppressed the value of music for no real reason it's not that point zero zero three cents per stream is not some sophisticated calculation it's really just a number um and the question is can we experiment and and kind of explore with what that number obviously looks like and the ultimate goal to wrap it up is to give artists more options and more ability to make a full-time living off their music because ultimately music is what drives an artist's economy whether it's touring or merch all of these things are unlocked because somebody has an emotional connection with the music and so it feels a bit crazy that music isn't as valued as it should be yeah jesse walden has said that music is criminally undervalued compared to the impact it's had on society or something like that i remember the term criminally undervalued which makes sense to me just you know i it to my mind music well i mean i actually once had a philosophical debate about this with somebody and and now i'm going to argue against myself but i do think that music is um one of the art forms that kind of like just gets at our emotions in in a more direct way even than some other art forms so you know obviously that that has a high value on it so obviously both of you are like very active with your own projects but i before we get into the details on that and i do want to dive into the details on those things i actually just want to give people an overview around music nfts generally because at the moment i think a lot of people actually typically associate the word nft with visual art nfts or profile pics but you know the term music nft actually can refer to any number of things there's like a huge variety and there's a lot of creativity right now and how people are experimenting so what are some of the ways that you're seeing that people are associating nfts with forms of music well i i can jump in here i mean i i feel like there's there's been a variety of different methods that have been tried and that's actually kind of one of my favorite things about it right now is the is completely it's completely undefined so it allows actually creators and artists to sort of treat it almost as its own creative medium you know and explore that and and you know a lot of it is sort of economic in nature and and that's fine but it's like i i i like that we haven't sort of landed on that perfect formula yet and that we're still sort of iterating like it's exciting you know it's not sort of the same old thing like even just like maybe two years ago you know before i mean perhaps before nfts and before a lot of this stuff really started to take off i mean the the the only method of releasing music was essentially kind of like what david was saying he's like you upload it to spotify and hope for the best you know and and hope you get on some featured playlists and you know maybe you'll get some plays and you know maybe four or five years down the line you'll actually get some money from it so it's also like a lot more of a direct connection which i i really appreciate you know it's uh it's it's me interacting with my fans in a very real way like artist to fan and and you sort of get that feedback but anyway going back to the different styles of nfts you know i i experimented very early on with visual art because that's sort of where i was you know super rare was kind of the main platform nifty gateway was starting to pop off and i i just started working with a visual artist that was a friend of mine that he had done my album art and as and now he's like one of the biggest uh highest grossing uh crypto artists out there so you know it's kind of cool to see that transformation of of like you know we were just trying to do something creative create digital art you know we weren't necessarily thinking about it as this category of music nfts but and if it was that oh sorry this is uh uh andres reisinger oh okay he's incredible uh so we we we did a couple like visual collaborations but in the back of my mind i always hoped that we could go to like sort of uh what i would think of like a pure music nft you know maybe it has an album art attached to it just like an album would or an lp or whatever but like having the focus be the music was something that was very appealing to me even back before it was really a thing so i was kind of like hoping that it would kind of happen naturally and and i think that's that's in great part due to uh david and the sounds team of sort of i i think they sort of crafted that category in their own way and and sort of differentiated from other platforms that were doing maybe a different style of music nfts so just to list a few typically there's been sort of the one of one music nft so you know a single co a single edition essentially and you know the other one is obviously the the sound xyz model which is you know anywhere from like 25 to 100 editions uh sometimes a bit more if you're a bigger artist but the idea is to some level of accessibility while still maintaining a level of scarcity because i think that's that's important you know you want it to be desirable those are kind of the two prominent ones uh there there are other experiment experiments with uh you know what we call stems so like little um you know for every song has sort of different layers of musical elements you know guitar bass drums whatever and you sort of you can separate those two into maybe let's call them sub nfts that are associated to the original at the top but can be kind of played around with and you can do different things the the other example that i'll all throw out is i did this project with this a platform called async where i essentially created a song that had didn't really have like a final form so you know when you listen to something on spotify there's a final song and that's it you know it doesn't change but this was like you're selling elements of the nft or stems of of the of the song and every nft has sort of a couple options so what that does is essentially the owner of that sub nft can change the drum arrangement or change the piano here or whatever and it creates this sort of ever-changing piece of music that again it's just an example of using this technology to do something creative that is really not necessarily possible before so i mean i don't know if i'm missing any david but those are kind of the main categories that i'm thinking of yeah i think the only one attack on is probably like i've seen a few generative drops and first artist on sound oshie just recently did one with a company called beat foundry where took four different songs and all the stems that andre was talking about and they made 888 unique copies of that song so again there's the beauty of this and this goes back to my original theme is it's not one format versus the other it's about giving artists the tools and the options to experiment with what makes sense i do think that there are principles that remain true throughout every single one something that was really important to us at sound we were getting started was one obviously making sure that this was you know accessible to uh obviously like want to be careful there was saying we did a price point around point one each to start um which in crypto world is is not too bad but obviously the music world is still 300 dollars but again within striking distance it's not super cheap but it's not so far away from being like in kind of a mass market accessibility and then two like we felt it was really important for more than one person to be able to collect because from an artist's perspective they want their music to be heard by as many people as possible most most artists don't want their music heard by only one person or two people or three people and so while we're super early there it was really about getting multiple people around the song because you unlock different dynamics when you have like a community around that music and i always use the concert as like the holy grail of music experiences i think no matter what happens in web 3 music i think the in-person concert experience will remain the holy grail of music why is a concert so incredible it's because you're amongst a community of people if you went to a concert and it was just andre playing for laura maybe that would be a good time for for youtube but i don't think it would be the most like a memorable experience and so part of it is just about building that in an online format and i always use some examples like let's use the grateful dead which is not your typical uh web 3 example if you go on spotify and you look at the grateful dead streams you would think that nobody cares about them but they're playing 80 000 stadiums or whatever literally any arena in the world they can play and sell out in two minutes but that's not captured anywhere in their online presence and part of that is because the community of the grateful dead is not able to congregate in that way in some type of online manner and support that artist through their music and a lot of what's going on here is how do you give artists the tools to build their communities their cults their like super following around it and today one of that's captured through the concert but the music experience is very isolated when i listen to andre's music it's really me by myself um and i think that's what's kind of being unlocked here so with sound we obviously um have a lower price point obviously still scarce but more accessible and sets the pic that's like the stage for kind of what's to come with building these kind of communities through their through their music yeah that's one thing i loved about uh when i was learning about sound i thought it was super cool that you had the social element um but one actually other type of nft that i just wanted to mention was and maybe you just view it as being in a different category but like royal allows people to participate in the royalties which you know i think is another kind of interesting model and obviously like quite different from some of these others but actually let's now dive more into sound.xyz because you know obviously as we discussed you know you launched it to uh address some of these issues that we are seeing in the music industry so why don't you describe you know how sound tries to address those and how it works for musicians and um also for fans yeah so sound is a suite of web3 tools that help artists experiment and monetize with their music in new ways so the first tool that we we built was basically the ability to upload your song since it seemed like that was what a lot of artists wanted wanted to do and so you upload your song it feels very much like soundcloud back in the day where you and upload the wav file you upload you know a name we created a section for artists to write a description about the song because we thought the story behind the music was really really important to kind of building that emotional connection between a listener and a song and ultimately an artist and we ultimately allowed for artists to like add any attachments or rewards and the final thing that we did was we created this fun game called the golden egg where one of the nfts associated with a sound drop is valuable for no other reason than the artwork is different and the golden egg isn't something that money can buy it gets randomly determined only once the song sells out and artists have been attaching value to this golden egg if they want to with you know whatever perks or rewards whether it's you know access to unreleased music concert tickets it could be anything we've seen some pretty creative creative use cases which i can get to in a second but it's just a fun fun way so an artist uploads their song takes about you know 10 minutes and one of the things that we did that was different is we created the first music nft platform that allowed artists to deploy their own smart contract so something that was really important to us was artists owning the relationship with their listeners people don't want an autograph essentially from sound.xyz people want an autograph from andre because andre is the artist andre is the brand the artist is the platform sound is just a reflection of all the artists on on on sound sound itself is nothing without obviously the artist on the site so that was another thing that was really important and the way you can see that very clearly is every artist has their own open seas storefront because each each artist has their own uh collection so you upload a song it creates a listening countdown associated with that song so now the listener can see everything about that song the description the rewards how many nfts they can't play the song yet and they can see the countdown ticking down until they till the countdown you know gets to zero once it hits zero it plays back across all devices at the same time so we're all listening um to the song together which is a kind of a spin of the concert right when you're at a concert you all listen to the song together and as i said i've been very inspired by concerts and once the song ends you can press our famous ape button which is our buy button and if you press the a button you can uh go and collect that song so the couple things to highlight are anybody can listen for free we're not charging people to listen to music that's obviously against kind of the ethos of what we stand for in terms of making the art accessible to as many people as possible everybody should get to enjoy andre's music those who want to collect is totally optional if you choose to collect and you're able to get one of the nfts because they often as people found out sell out within seconds then one of the first ways that you can show off that you own this nft because today most nfts sit in your wallet and that's not a very social experience is that you can leave a comment on the song and kind of etch your name in the history of that song's journey which was inspired by obviously like soundcloud because they had a feature where uh where you could leave a comment and i've always been obsessed personally with who discovered andre who discovered the ios who discovered some of these major internet stars and even if they're not superstars more just like artists that have gone on to have tremendous careers artists have never had the ability to differentiate between their first fans and their one millionth fans right they all get washed in and this created if there was a clear simple way to be able to show who are the 25 50 100 people that are supporting that artist then it'll be very easy for the artist to have that ability to say hey i want to interact with the people that have first supported me and of course just like everything else was sound that there was a bit of a wrinkle in it which is if you sell your nft you lose your comment on the wall and the new person can come in and leave a comment so it creates a bit of a like i guess buying pressure because some people really want the social status but then these nfts have obviously gone up in value as well um and that's kind of the uh end-to-end process i just wanted to add something that you that you said that i i think it's sort of a common misconception with i think maybe nfcs in general is that and it's particularly interesting for music so is that the song is free like you can listen to it for free anybody can listen to it i think a lot of people assume and i get it it's sort of a click-bait headline it's like artists sell song for 300 or whatever you know it's it's it sounds i know what it sounds like but the the truth behind it is actually you're only selling you know the the ownership of that of that edition you're not selling you know you you're not get toke you're not gating content you're not you know putting a paywall on it or anything like that so it's something i i like to make a distinction because i think a lot of people gloss over that it's like i think it's actually a really powerful idea of essentially let's stop like gating content and just say hey any literally anybody can have it and the theory and i believe in this is that you know the wider something travels on the internet the more valuable that original source for that nft becomes and you can still monetize it in however way you want and and all of that but it's that that original you know like there shouldn't be a hindrance like you know we're you know we're like 30 years into the internet you know really so that feel i've always argued that that is sort of an old model that that doesn't apply to the internet like information wants to be free and and we this was sort of a way to to you know it's a different model it's just a different way to sort of value digital objects so i just wanted to add that because i think it's like really important for people to understand it's like we're not trying to charge 300 for a song it's free right all right yeah although i don't know if i would agree that information wants to be free that that little line annoys me for various reasons but anyway i did want to ask you though because obviously you you know you are an artist on sound so and i've seen you tweet about this can you just walk us through a comparison of the economics for an artist like yourself on spotify versus on sound yeah absolutely so it's it's so such a stark difference that people don't believe it so okay like for example on spotify you know we we count we counted in millions because that's the only way to sort of rationally think about it so like i i know back of my head it's like yeah i don't count it in 0.00 or whatever three cents i count it in in a million place so if i know that if a song gets a million plays that's roughly around anywhere from 3 500 to 4 grand uh so and that's like pre-distribution pre-label pre-everything that's just sort of raw money from spotify so okay that's a million people that need to listen to a song you know or a million place you know somebody can listen to it all day long and you know it adds up but still a million people that adds about four thousand dollars and if you think about it in the sound model i mean if we're doing you know point one eth i mean it's it's really just a handful of people that can sort of achieve the same amount of uh of money and it's kind of incredible honestly because like i tweeted this out and and people really don't just don't believe it they don't know how is that possible like i'm you know it's like uh this is this isn't right this is this is a scam or whatever and it's like no it's actually just the unlocking of value of music you know it's it's uh it's sort of going back to what we're saying earlier it's like i really believe that recorded music specifically recorded music is completely undervalued and this is sort of letting a market decide the value of it and i find it hard to argue with markets you know what i mean it kind of is what it is so you know the example that i gave with with my sound release is that you know we i think we sold a hundred editions uh and that's about uh ten eighth total so you know about thirty one thousand dollars i think uh yeah i have the tweet yeah you said you uh made 1.858 or about slightly under six thousand dollars in royalties in one week and you said it was generated by 36 people and then you said that would have taken 1.4 million plays to generate that on spotify and then you said that when you included the primary sale which was 10 eth or about 31 thousand dollars that that was the equivalent of 7.75 million plays and so basically you concluded 136 people generated more than 9.1 million people yeah and that's what i mean it's like these numbers i know it seems crazy right like but but look at the data i mean it's what's happening and and that to me what that signals is like is that music is far more about form far more valuable than 0.003 cents per play i mean it just doesn't i just don't accept that anymore you know uh like i think it's worth a lot more and there's a lot of sort of behind-the-scenes stuff about how that rate came to be and we we can get into that if you want but you know i i think just there's some kind of simplicity and beauty in the fact that a market decided the value of this and it's like finally we we have you know uh somebody valuing music in a different way you know and and i think there's some underlying um like principles that are not even covered there just the pure numbers which are things that uh i don't think will ever go out of fashion are being you know fast transparent and accurate with payouts and i think those things are oftentimes not the case today in the music industry so i think it's not only just the sheer quantity of the money it's also that it was paid out instantly and on the spot so that he literally has it um which i think is different because i don't know if i think with ethos maybe you put that on i don't know if you put that on spotify or you didn't but if you did right not yet but whatever money does come in it still takes three to six months right for getting it out so under the premium to be paid and i think just to do it from an aggregate perspective on sound on sound we've been around for four and a half months we've done around 125 songs on sound like 100 different artists we just crossed the 100 artist milestone which we haven't announced yet we've done 2.7 million dollars paid out to those artists which again is around 650 million spotify streams but the real impressive part is not necessarily the dollar amount it's the quantity of people who generated that 2.7 million dollars and we just announced recently that we have over 2 000 unique collectors so 2000 unique collectors generated and again it's not apples to oranges in terms of streams aren't equal to people but you get the idea that 2000 people generated the equivalent of 650 million um and that is such a large magnitude of difference that even if it came down and we met somewhere in the middle it shows something is off and i think that's kind of the the macro point on this one yeah so in a moment we're going to talk more about how sound works but first a quick word

smart contract which i could imagine would be expensive in a lot of work so why did you choose to structure that way great question so i i think for us like provenance of other contracts is something that is going to become the default if not already so in artists like a lot of the space is about empowering creators empowering artists and for us it was really important that artists own the relationship with their fans again coming from obviously the music industry side of things and um trying kind of trying to undo things that obviously haven't been able to be done before i think there were certain themes that we thought were never gonna go out of fashion so one was fast transparent and accurate payouts i didn't see who would complain about that and the second thing and by the way i just wanted to add on that which is that like it just goes to show you how far behind the internet era our current financial system is because just intuitively that makes sense that at the time of transactions sort of like you know when you go into a store and you're gonna buy something that the money would just be exchanged at that moment so it just seems like such a no-brainer and so it's just kind of funny that yeah actually now the majority of these statements take three to six months or whatever which is just like bonkers in this day and age but anyway keep going and uh the other thing was that no artist has ever held the relationship individually with their fans like they always tell you you have fans in new york you have fans in portland but you've never been able to just message those fans directly or take those fans and leave and go from one platform to the to to the other so that to us felt like another core critical component i think we were inspired by a couple other platforms that did this but i think the first to really like own in on it was a company called manifold obviously did their own creator smart contracts as well and we fully agree with everything that they've been kind of promoting and sharing which is that artists should have provenance over their own contracts and you've seen a multitude of different marketplaces do this we're kind of the first on the on the music nft side but it was 100 worth the extra engineering effort to basically make this happen because it basically sets us up for artists to obviously own and can build those relationships and there are you know sound is kind of the first uh example of something built on the sound protocol but in the future artists can host and we can even build tools to help artists host like listening parties on their own website so that it doesn't have to take out take place on sounds of xyz i just wanted to add to this because this is like so important to me like this is like such a big deal because uh so i've been doing this for a long time i've been doing this professionally since 2007. i that's the myspace era that i moved to soundcloud and then i moved to spotify and then you know so on and so on my point is that i i've had to build and rebuild audiences every single time and hope that people sort of like you know move with me and i've never really owned that actual relationship it's always been you know let me give you an example of of uh you know facebook's a great example so like i built you know 100 000 followers on facebook that took a lot of time and effort you know a lot of i gave away a lot of free content to sort of get people to join it and all this stuff and then at a certain point they sort of turned to switch and they're like hey actually so you know that audience that you built we're gonna charge you so that you can reach them so we're going to monetize you now as well so it was sort of like it became like what are we building this for like am i i'm not building this for myself and and granted like you know there's there is a benefit to it of having access to that many people and there's there's a lot of good sides to it in communication all that sort of owning that relationship is like so crucial and and we can get into this if you want but you know that's sort of the core thesis of behind my own token and my own platform and my own website is like is really sort of being the platform not building the platform for somebody else sort of like using tools like sound xyz and using various other web3 tools to sort of build that platform myself and granted that's a little bit bespoke and you know a little tech heavy for for maybe the average artist but if i can sort of prove the use case i think there's like a real pathway for other artists to do this so that's like something the the provenance thing is also super important you know making sure that the the art is coming from your you know ens address and like all that stuff like that is uh it's super important and i just wanted to stress that yeah so i i do have a bunch of questions for you about rac and rac os and and other things but before we get into that why don't we just do two more questions on sound so david you talked about how having additions makes music more inclusive or at least i saw that on the sound website can you talk about why you're describing it that way like what about it is more inclusive yeah so i think the the main point was just around forming a community amongst amongst around the song and i think you know artists obviously want to get paid and have their music valued appropriately but they also want to have their music heard by as many people as possible and so the goal is like if you can bring down the price and obviously have people directly support it then you can build models where artists can make a full-time living off their music with 25 50 100 1 000. it doesn't matter and i don't think we found out what that chord number needs to be but as long as it's around there you're with every artist can aspire to get that amount of people around their music what andre covered earlier was he thinks in millions and the problem is that there are millions there's only billions of people in the world how how is every artist going to get tens of millions of listeners in in streams there just simply isn't enough people to be able to get those amount of streams so you ended up in this really top-heavy world and so we're we're kind of and this is why i think it's important that obviously we've had some big artists on sound but the core of who we're trying to solve for and who our main like ultimate kind of artist is is like the independent up and coming unsigned artists because those are the ones that actually like like really need what we're doing right because there's so much music uh something that andre said earlier that is so true is like the cost of making music is none but the cost of make of getting heard and getting your music heard has never been higher um and so it's really really important that you build sustainable ways it doesn't seem sustainable for every artist to get tens of millions of streams if you want to be a mainstream artist that's incredible and so with sound we're kind of threading a middle ground here which is hey this works for a bigger artist if you we've obviously done snoop dogg and a few other artists with more established kind of audiences but if you want to only build with 25 50 100 doesn't matter what the number is this can very real work for you and as andre said he only did 100 people on his uh first sound drop and a second sound drop but a hundred people can cause real noise if they are connected to the music and obviously want to support so that's really why we we thought it opened up the just the dynamics from a from from more than one perspective and the final thing i want to just comment is a lot of the times in other prior web 2 models it was always the artist doing work like if we think about kind of the fan club model it's the artist making exclusive content it's the artist and the artist spends a lot of time already doing the work of making the music and so by forming multiple people around the song and multiple listeners and multiple fans there's an opportunity for the listeners and the community to engage with each other without even the artist being there just as fans of andre's music and i think that's also a more healthy ecosystem where the artist is free to go work on music and obviously he still is an active participant in the community but doesn't need to be there 24 7 running like a fan club or newsletter because ultimately why they became an artist in the first place is really make music and create and that's kind of what this is unlocking as well yeah yeah and but i wanted to note like in wherever it was that i saw this on your website it said something like that you decided to do it that way because music shouldn't just be for the the very few rich like i think it was like saying like this is a better idea than one of ones which i thought was interesting and like you know just goes to what you're saying because i agree with you that the concert is the best way to experience music and that's like you know kind of yeah just like the height of a music experience so i love that yeah you have this community aspect and one thing i did notice though is that you don't take a commission from the artists who use your platform so how will sound make money yeah so that's a very famous question we get asked all the time i i think that was more of a statement than anything else so i mean sound has plans to obviously monetize in the future but i think in the beginning uh we were really just so laser focused on and still are on just helping artists shape and revalue music because while people are talking about music nfts on twitter now when we started it really wasn't much of a conversation and so before we monetize anything we first need to make sure that that like this is a like you know an asset that people honestly want to collect and so monetization wasn't our focus our focus was really on directly supporting artists and i think there's no better way to make a statement than paying artists 100 of obviously what comes in on both the primary and the secondary market and given i think people forget that we've only been around four and a half months we just haven't turned on modernization so that's the simple uh kind of excuse for why we currently um and honestly unlike other kind of you know web 2 things in the past we wanted to figure out our business model in conjunction with the artist every single artist that's released on sound we have a personal relationship with we actually have a group chat with all the artists on sound and so it's really i don't think the the the this sometimes gets like i think spread falsely is like i don't think there's going to be a problem when we do monetize and if when we do we'll do it in a very tasteful kind of manner in terms of figuring out like what that looks like because i i think like large 50 transaction fees are not the norman kind of web 3. and i think it's really just going to be about figuring out that business model in conjunction with the artists uh who are basically like co-stewards of the platform as well i think i it's obvious that if we never make money we probably won't be in existence so i think it's in everybody's best interest to kind of work that out together but i think in the interim no it's much more of a powerful statement to pay every 100 and kind of a bet on the feature that hey we're not in this for like the short term like because obviously we could be charging on these drops right now we think this hasn't even really gotten started and but you know we'll be prepared for when that when that uh when that true growth really happens and it's so that sort of almost sounds like a dow model i don't know if that's what you're hinting at uh so i'd say that the thing that i i'd more likely say is i think one thing that's been true in kind of the the prior world is that no artist or the music community and there's more than just artists we always talk about artists because they're kind of the focal points but there's producers there's songwriters there's mixers there's the music listener there's music curators that's kind of who i think about and the entire music economy has ever really had a stake in a music uh related service or or platform so i'll use you know our favorite spotify as the example when spotify went public all three major labels had major stakes worth hundreds of millions in spotify when they went public no artist as far as i know or if there are there are probably sub five had a stake in spotify and most artists don't even have a stake in the label that they're ultimately assigned to now why is spotify worth whatever it was when it ipo'd my guess is that it you know builds up a large subscription base based on something called music and who ultimately makes that music it's not labels it's ultimately the artist the songwriters and the producers and so i think there's a world and that's kind of honestly what drew me to the space where what if you can build this music economy where artists songwriters listeners producers mixers can all kind of have joints say and kind of where a music product is headed and i think that is the ultimate kind of experience and um experiment that hasn't been run um in prior iterations of the music industry oh my gosh we're like at 45 minutes and i'm just like there's so much we could cover but ric where andre we need to get into your trajectory into crypto obviously you told us a little bit about your struggles with all these different platforms eventually you not only found crypto but you have already lived like nine lives in crypto you know you like yeah why don't you just talk about how you got there but then i'd be interested in hearing you know your initial work with like the tape token and then later launching the rec token so yeah why don't you just give us that whole history yeah so uh just for some really broad context i've always had sort of an interest in computer science it's been part of my life i think it goes hand in hand with music production because you know very computer heavy you know it's just there against my your background yeah yeah yeah so it's a highly technical thing i computers go hand in hand with my lifestyle so you know i i so i grew up around you know various different uh technologies i grew up was surrounded by open source software i've always loved to you know i've always had a windows linux mac i've had it all just because i just love computers and at the time i became pretty upset like napster basically was my sort of musical awakening like that's when i discovered the world of music and i was i was young i lived in portugal a small place like and like the thing that i like to say is i discovered the beatles on napster which you know is kind of crazy but that's that was my that's that's how i found out about them and and you know i saw how they got shut down immediately and you know in hindsight i think like their model was you know messed up because because there was sort of a central point of failure even though most people thought that they would sort of work with the music industry but you know then we move on to bittorrent and bittorrent was like the first time it really became fully decentralized and so you know my point is like i'm starting to see how technology can sort of challenge the status quo you know um bittorrent although it is sort of a piracy primarily a piracy or a protocol used for piracy you know the technology was sort of neutral in that way and that that was important to me so you know that's later on when i discovered like bitcoin and all that it all kind of made sense to me uh and granted i didn't come from a financial background or anything like that i i really recognize the power of of a decentralized technology so when i discovered bitcoin i was like cool this is really interesting i don't know anything about finance but you know let me let me look into this and that's when i discovered ethereum i was like okay we're here this is cool this is really cool and and that's like when when it sort of clicked for me where it's you know a general purpose blockchain so sort of those decentralized properties but you know a programmable blockchain so you can essentially you know create anything within reason you know my first thought when i discovered ethereum was like oh we could sort of rebuild the rails or the piping or the plumbing of the music industry using this technology in a in a way that's actually completely neutral and uh essentially replace the music industry with code that's something i like to say because that's kind of what it is it's not completely destroying the human element but it but it's taking the sort of part that needs to be decentralized and making that decentralized so that became an obsession of mine and i really haven't looked back and so all everything that i've done since like 2017 has essentially been sort of a form of experimentation with this where it's like i'm not gonna single-handedly you know reinvent the entire music industry but i can at least experiment with my own career and i i don't have much to lose you know like people don't really care you know i'm still going to do things than the typical way but you know having this again this other option of of being able to play with technology and do something that's interesting that became you know an obsession of mine so in 2017 i i guess i released the first album on ethereum so we used a smart contract to if you deposited you know roughly ten dollars of ether in this contract you got this uh you got the download and you got a an erc20 token so again this is sort of predating the erc 721 standard but it's it's uh it was it was a form of collectible you know and one that's actually still currently traded where people have sort of wrapped it into a 721 and now they traded on an open c so it's kind of i'm sorry which was token with that so this was uh my album was called ego and this is uh it's called the ego token so again this is like 140 people like tiny tiny tiny little experiment but you know it sort of proved the the use case and granted we were so early and but it was it was cool to kind of play around with that i'm going to try to get through this quickly but like in in 2020 i had another album called boy and i figured okay what uniswap was already starting to kind of be a little bit more popular and i was like what if we created an erc20 token that represented this this uh limited edition cassette tape basically so it's it's essentially creating a market for a scarce good so instead of just making you know a thousand tapes i just said i'm gonna make it a hundred and i'm gonna let a market decide its value so who went from i think we the original listing was like 20 or something like that it went to it eventually peaked at like 13 000 or something like that which again is the irony isn't lost on me of like you know using a kind of cutting edge technology to sell a cassette tape which is also like an obsolete technology but also challenging the notion again challenging the notion that music is is valuable and and you know granted that was sort of an extreme example you had you know a lot of d5 people kind of running the price up and down whatever but it was it was kind of a fun thing to do and say hey no music is actually way more valuable than what you guys are pricing it as so that that really kind of got me into it and you know that sort of set the set the groundwork for the rac token and also just uh i i need to give it a little bit of context which is that you know covid was you know happening suddenly the thing that we love about music live performance is not an option okay so what do i do i i start streaming on twitch and now suddenly there's like this group of people that i'm i'm like kind of interacting with my super fans for the first time in my career you know like 10 years in so it's like i'm getting to know them i'm like talking to them and then that sort of funneled into a discord server you know okay now now you know there's there's a not a very not a large amount of people you know but they're all on my discord server and the thing the most beautiful thing about it really for me was it wasn't just about me anymore it was like maybe i was the catalyst that got them there but they have a lot more in common and it's sort of naturally turned into more of community of sorts but i got sort of i have ptsd from all these other platforms you know pulling the rug and uh so i was like okay well how do i sort of circumvent this while i can you know so that was the idea was like okay let me create a token let me create a token that i'm basically going to airdrop to anybody that have an email that i have sort of a financial transaction trail of any sort so anybody that bought like an mp3 or a piece of merch or anything dating back to 2009 which is i think the earliest data we had got a token airdrop so they got it for free you know just for they they didn't do that with an expectation of a token so i felt like that was like like a real way to start you know well that community existed it's just a way to sort of like connect them you know and it was sort of a way for me to backtrack and like sort of try to get it everybody back into this in in a platform that that we controlled you know so that token i i think it was one of the first not maybe not the first but like it was one of the earlier kind of social tokens you know at first it was perhaps like a rewards token it was kind of a lot of different things but that you know eventually we we started to develop some software around it and and that sort of culminated in in the most recent release which is the or called the rac os or the r it's rac.fm if anybody wants to check it out but it's basically it looks like an os and you know you can connect your metamask and it'll check you you'll first of all can unlock songs based on your token holding and and we we sort of just wanted to lay a framework so we can continue to add more features so that was kind of like it was a long path but we finally got to this point where it's like i am the platform and you know i'm trying to create like you know i'm trying to own that platform and instead of giving it to facebook or instagram or twitter or whatever and and those those platforms will always exist and i'm always going to continue to use them but at least i can now funnel people to like a platform that i control and we can make it you know streamlined we can make it like for that community like niche specific and you know that's that's sort of where i see all of this going and that's sort of why i'm excited about it because it's it's like you know finally you know it took like this long but like now finally i feel like we finally landed on a model that kind of is starting to make sense and i i'm just like excited you know yeah i love how you said now i am the platform which makes so much sense if like people are fans of you and your work then it would make sense that the way that they're going to congregate is around you and your work so i i love that one other thing that i saw in an article written about you was you were talking about something called the amen break and how that sparked some of your thoughts on music nfts so i want you to tell us about that but we'll we'll play a clip of it here uh so people can hear what it is [Music] so so go ahead tell us about this amen break and uh how it sparked some of your thoughts around music nfts yeah so uh the almond break is amongst like music producers it's maybe anecdotally it's probably the most widely used sample of all time uh so what it what it is is i i don't quote me on the exact song because i kind of forget what what it is but it's it's from a song i think from the 60s where it's just a drum break so like a little interlude like a six second interlude in the middle of a song it's a b side on a little seven inch somebody found that it was like this is a thick drum loop i'm gonna use that and it eventually sort of spawns it's such a good drum loop that it essentially spawned entire genres of music like you know there's entire scenes and entire worlds and subcultures that are based around this this uh sample and you know this is obviously wishful thinking but like you know if we had nfts in the 60s or whatever and and if that sample was some form of an nft you know even though it was sort of widely used for free you know because nobody ever paid any royalties on this you know i i think i think of it as sort of an important cultural artifact and that it's like i think it's priceless you know and the most disappointing thing about the current music industry is that like the original artists never saw a single dime from from that usage so even though they have sort of you know like i i was i played drums on the almond break i'm on like you know 700 songs or 800 songs or whatever but that still doesn't you know they never got to you know they never got their due so it is i mean it's not a perfect comparison but it's just another example of like how the music industry has sort of failed us in the current system i i think of it as like like okay maybe this isn't for right now maybe you know we're i don't know we're gonna find another almond break today but you know if if we're setting up the system correctly i think and that's sort of what i was getting at you know with that yeah because basically it seems like maybe that then could become a stem nft i don't know if i'm using the terminology correctly and when people use it then they could like pay some royalty or or even if like it was just sold as kind of a cultural artifact then the value of it like you know whatever people are trading it for would sort of reflect how valuable it is even if people use it for free still so it's it actually asks a really interesting question and and a lot of people will debate me one way or another and i i i love it but basically like what actually gives what gives this value you know is it the monetization of it or is it it's sort of cultural significance or or maybe that's a threshold that you cross after a certain point i i don't know like you truly don't know and that's that's actually sort of a question that's happening a lot with nfcs now it's like you know aside from maybe royal and and a couple other examples like there's not really that you know connection to the monetization of it so again like we're making these nfts free so like where is it going to monetize you know none of those royalty streams are streaming to the nft holders at least in the cr in its current form so why does it have value it and that's like i don't know that i really have an answer for that i i have a couple theories but like you know that's something that we're kind of grappling with right now you know yeah so i do you want to ask some broader questions about music nfts but before we do that just one last question for race for andre which is you have this creative agency called six why don't you tell us what that is and how it came about yeah so uh six was it's essentially well okay for in the broader context of like i started doing visual nfts and you know we this was like late 2020 uh we were releasing we had a couple like minor successes and broke a couple records and whatnot and i think the music industry started to take notice and it was really when uh justin blau actually the ceo of royal he did an an nft release that i think grossed around 12 million dollars or something like that it was a very pronounced moment and this happened on a sunday so me and my friends had sort of been toying with this idea because we were getting you know hit up from every angle say hey what's this nft thing like what are you what are you doing how do you how you making money off of this like what what is it you know because everybody in the music industry's hungry because they don't they don't make any money so like people are like really trying to like freaking out trying to trying to figure out how to do this and and we're meeting a couple friends uh people that have been doing this for a long time we were like okay well what if we started uh an agency maybe like maybe that's a something that we could help other artists and that was sort of our focus was like let's let's help the independent artists let's help the people that really stand to benefit the most let's let's help them before the labels come in and try to like mess it all up basically so so we started actually that that sunday we kind of got together in a group chat and we're like hey i think we need to start this like like tomorrow i think we need to announce this tomorrow and because like in in my mind like that 12 million dollar mark was every single person in the music industry was gonna hear about that first thing in the morning like every intern is probably like like scrambling preparing you know some it's like some presentation on what nfts are and we're like okay let's get ahead of this let's just literally put out an email and a squarespace website and and and you know the next within within the next like four months i feel like i was on calls for you know 16 hours a day talking to various different people so it was this like amazing little pocket of time that we we kind of got the timing right and you know we created this agency we have we eventually were involved in the wu-tang album and some other crazy stuff and it's it's been like and when you say that just talk a little bit about the the which because obviously there now there's multiple mooting clan albums and unfortunately there's a little bit of this that i i can't speak about some details because of the ndas but essentially we we were involved in brokering the deal in between the doj and or dao so we sort of facilitated that and uh okay yeah yeah so we we that was uh yeah that was the one originally owned by martin shkreli yes yes so that was that was a crazy crazy couple months yes okay okay oh that sounds fascinating i would love to dig into that sometime we'll do it off air so here's what i want to ask this was a super interesting tweet that i saw cooper turley tweeted breakout 13 musicians will not be ranked by plays or monthly listeners they will be ranked by floor price trading volume unique holders and treasury balance and this was controversial and andre i saw you tweeted about it so why don't you guys both just react to this so you know what's your take on what he said so i i think uh cooper is obviously a big collector um on sound and kind of been pushing the music nft space forward for a while but i think the um i land somewhere in the middle here i think that's a bit on the extreme end of the spectrum i don't i don't necessarily think that that's how we're going to be like describing artists because as i said like there's only two sides of this there's the obviously the modernization side but there's also like just getting that music heard on the flip side i think uh cooper has a point and a lot of people in the space have shared this which is you can't define a song's impact by by just the play count alone because for certain people that song might have changed their life right and that's not that that promotes this mass culture kind of like society where like you have your song is only successful if it goes mainstream hundreds of millions of streams etc so i think that's really like it's more of like the future of the music industry is around building tight-knit communities around your music and i think that will be the most important aspect and then i think yes you will still have mainstream what's called hits in the music industry that reach hundreds of millions of people but the ultimate bar over what we're obviously doing is to form tight-knit uh communities kind of like many you know grateful deads and uh examples and whatnot because the best music communities have always been like cults and i think andre's actually a great example of this where andre has people around his music that really care about him and his music and there's a lot of strength in uh in numbers here which is like andre can put out whatever it's an rac token it's a it's a release on sound and his community will travel and follow with them and i think that is that's why i think andre was such a large moment for us on sound when he first released is and why we've honestly like i don't think sound would exist without andre is kind of pushing the boundaries forward even before sound even launched but that's why like andre is a much more relatable example to many many more artists than if we take some of the some of the like a drake as an example where it's so large and so beyond kind of like any type of relation i do think a lot of artists can be in their own way their own rac or create their own platform and have their own kind of relationship and i think that's kind of the model in the blueprint here so i i think again it's like everything else it's about harmony and balance it's not about any one versus the the other and that's honestly reflected in everything in the web 3 space where it's not we never tell an artist hey you can't try out something else or hey you can't release on spotify it's really about kind of experimenting exploring with the different options out there yeah i'll i'll just chime in on that tweet i mean it definitely you know ruffled some feathers let's say in in some people but like i i think that what he he's sort of in intending to explain isn't really that uh dystopian uh even though sometimes it was kind of perceived that way i i think like you know what what it is is a little bit sort of myopic and uh this happens a lot in crypto where they only see crypto and they don't see the wider sort of uh ecosystem and like david was saying i kind of play in both worlds like yes obviously i focus a lot of time and attention on crypto but i mean you know i still release music widely and and tour and do all the things that are non-crypto related you know so they're they are kind of two different audiences and but like i think where where maybe this is this is going is that you know this is kind of like how i'm thinking about it a little bit is like a sort of a gamified form of fundraising on some level you know where you're sort of perhaps raising funds to to be able to release it more widely or or whatever your objective is or if you just want to sit on it and collect the money i don't know but i think there will be a class of fans and investors or however you want to think about them they do care about the floor price you know they're they make sense you know they bought something they probably care about its value you know but i i think it's maybe a little bit naive to think that the wider community would actually care about that so i i mean like i know he means well it's just you know i i think i i responded to that tweet and sort of shared my thoughts but yeah it's yeah no i i agree with you that maybe certain people will view it that way but i don't think most people will um just because i do think even when you have nfts which make it easier to earn money from these cultural objects
