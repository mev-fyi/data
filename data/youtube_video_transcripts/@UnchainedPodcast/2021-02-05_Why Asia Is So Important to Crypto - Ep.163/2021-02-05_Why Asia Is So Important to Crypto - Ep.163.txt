research analyst at missouri welcome mira hi laura thanks so much for uh having me here you recently wrote a report on asia's crypto landscape can you give us a broad overview of why and how asia is such an important geography in crypto yeah absolutely actually my background is traditional finance and i spent maybe about 15 years you know focus on equities in terms of all the companies or sorry all the countries in asia pacific so i was always very well acquainted with like the cultures and also the different politics and macroeconomic structures of the different countries you know sometimes what i take for granted in terms of understanding the market i find that a lot of my colleagues or a lot of my friends in the u.s or europe might not necessarily know what's happening in asia and so you know i think a couple of interesting pointers is that for example like you know by december last year 42 of the market cap of the top 20 tokens that actually had a headquarters basically was from asia i think chain analysis also said that 43 of global transactions are from asia and then also a lot of china a lot of asian companies basically dominate the future space so 98 of um you know futures is based in asia you know i think people don't understand that tether is based in asia polka dot has a lot of supporters in asia and so a lot of tokens might have uh yeah a lot of tokens might see a lot of funding from asian uh investors and asian companies although i think the media mostly picks up uh you know us and europe and so i think this this i guess report tries to cover some of the stuff that we might miss in asia yeah something that struck me in your report was you said that asia accounts for 98 of eth futures volumes and 94 of btc futures volumes why why does asia so completely dominate the trading volume and futures yeah um i i guess that probably is like part human capital and part like the genesis so if you think about it so like for example bitmex you know ftx these are big companies that are in hong kong and i think you have a huge concentration of financial services in hong kong probably second to new york city and you also have i guess a lot of regulation shaping how companies are you know until november last year uh regulation was optional in hong kong so now the sfc has made a proposal where you know that would no longer be optional but as a result you see a ton of companies have you know extremely exciting uh products for example like bitmex created the first auto deleveraging product you know ftx is very innovative and very quick um also to introduce new products and i think i think that's just a background of where hong kong is in terms of being a financial hub yeah we saw how quickly ftx moved to capitalize on the gamestop um momentum that was happening and um so you know obviously i just called out the difference in the futures volumes and would you uh cite any other different trading behaviors that seem to be different between east and west um i think in terms of trading behaviors like you know i think in in the us and europe you see a lot of the decentralized movements especially defy coming from there you really saw a lot of developers in china uh are are on the back foot in terms of d5 applications and i think that's really because like cultural there are cultural differences so for example i think in asia people are a lot more comfortable with centralization um you know if you look at japan uh it's okay it's okay to like politicians it's it's great you know bankers are seen as great this is not the same narrative as the west you know i think you see for example a lot of support of ripple in japan in philippines because people have no problems with sensorization yeah there's a little bit of nuances in terms of different styles and different cultures of course uh these are just generalist uh generalizations of of the culture but yeah i think you can see where you know a lot of for example you know another thing is that privacy tokens are generally not allowed in asia by regulators so um you know whereas zcash might be super popular with my colleagues in the u.s um you know among my friends in asia we don't really see that we don't really see a lot of talk about privacy tokens you know on this side of the world all right yeah and one other thing that i noticed was um it seems like in the in asia as well certain things just around the general culture in tech and investing are different like you cited um how wi-fi penetration there is extremely high and even just technology penetration like um you know i have relatives who live in korea and uh my parents get annoyed when they come to the us and then they're like everything's so backwards here and you know whatever but yeah it was just really interesting reading some of these cultural differences and also the propensity toward gambling in asian cultures so you know even though we've been talking about asia just in these generalities obviously it is a very diverse place and reading your report i was really struck by the differences in regulation across the region so do you want to just kind of give us an update about about that yeah absolutely so i think generally regulation is cautious um so you know the first to regulate was um so if you look at like who tried to ban bitcoin so in 2013 thailand banned bitcoin trying to ban bitcoin 2014 vietnam 2017 korea 2018 so now regulations softened but has been a little bit wait i'm sorry i have banned bitcoin in 2018. so yeah so basically in january 2018 the ministry of justice uh banned bitcoin trading and so and then they investigated six banks that basically were service providers to crypto exchanges uh there was such a big backlash on this that they had to retract their um their ban and so they said they softened it and they said okay in january 2022 there'll be a 20 profit tax on crypto trading so i think uh you know especially um this is probably really important for people to you know realize that the people do have a voice like in india when they try to ban basically banking for crypto enterprises as well like the supreme court eventually overturned the reserve bank of india's statement basically because of the lobbying of crypto enterprises and the people there so people aren't powerless to just accept what what regulators are saying they are responding and regulators are also understanding that they have to you know keep up with the times so and you know i think an example of that is japan so japan was the first to regulate in 2017. you know japan has been hacked the most in the world so you had mount gox you had coin check they've been hacked almost a million bitcoin in the past few years which is a tremendous amount and despite that you see a lot of regulations still coming out and you know japanese support is pretty strong even amongst banks who tend to be sitting on the sidelines and investors and major investors in these crypto exchanges i would say like the biggest difference for all these regulations is probably hong kong because every country has always created a new framework for crypto um hong kong has done something different where they took the existing financial framework and they actually injected crypto crypto companies that are licensed they have to follow all the regulations of financial uh of you know other financial companies uh plus they have the added layer of being a crypto company and having to do you know extra regulations for perhaps being a safe uh you know showing that they're safe showing that you know their leverage requirements are are met so it's actually doubly hard to be i guess licensed in hong kong but at the same time that means that stos are wide open for a digital asset exchanges in hong kong oh oh interesting security token offerings yeah your token offerings okay and i also was curious china seems to have a pretty complex relationship to bitcoin um can you just break down what is discouraged there what at least if not outright encouraged at least flourishes anyway and just explain what the chinese regulatory approaches to bitcoin yeah absolutely so china um in 2014 they closed down exchanges uh banking services and then they said they banned finance companies from engaging in bitcoin and other crypto in 2017 they banned bitcoin trading and icos so right now bitcoin trading is banned but you can see like kobe and okx are obviously some of the largest the way that they structure it is that it's kind of like an ebay where it's a matching service but they're not supposed to take custody um so really like you know seller and buyer are supposed to you know match with each other and you have reviews as well like oh this person is really honest and trustworthy and therefore you might get better execution if you have you know better reviews and five stars rating sort of like a local bitcoin style yeah exactly and so they use an escrow as well and and so people don't necessarily have to meet in person yeah exactly so you know there's there's lots of different channels um in india this is what they did as well so for example they said you know we will transact between you two and then i'll do the payment offline you know maybe through wechat or through bank transfer and then i'll i'll click confirm on to the on to the exchange and then they'll let the they'll let the transaction through of course you know me not being part of a exchange you know maybe i can speak freely that this is obviously not really what happens that you know obviously these exchanges take custody which is not really you know letter of the law but uh you know these guys have basically been doing that so which is okay i mean okay yeah well that's how things are done in the world in many places yeah exactly all right so in a moment we're gonna explore more of what's happening in crypto and the rest of asia but first a quick word

my conversation with mira cristanto so as you noted earlier japan has been through some of the biggest ups well sort of ups but definitely downs in the crypto space uh with some of the largest hacks in crypto and you know also it was the first a country to regulate um so right now what would you say is kind of the state of things and how are companies being affected and the markets being affected there yeah so the state of things right now is that japan is actually like a world like two house where you've got crypto native companies uh like bitfire for example and you've got um securities broker companies that are trying to enter the crypto space so these security brokerage companies are big companies you've heard of sbi softbank investment although softbank had divested you know many years ago gmo is also a big fx trader dmm rakuten rakuten is kind of like the amazon of japan so if you can imagine say amazon going into a crypto exchange you know what is different is that these guys aren't really getting market share it's really like the crypto native companies that are still gaining market share so um i think adoption is still relatively slow especially if you think about it japan has the largest and most active retail fx trading in the world so i think there's a lot of potential but right now like penetration isn't there yet in terms of regulations um you know i think after the hacking uh in 2018 coin checks hacking of like half a billion dollars regulations and licensing has been quite uh slowed down but basically with a new license right now uh they are making a little bit more difficult for uh japanese companies to to become licensed but that said there's a ton of lobbying going on by you know major companies like daiwa asset management to maybe you know create a bitcoin etf um i don't want to single out daiwa because i don't think it's um it's official but um you know there is there are a lot of major asset management companies that want to enter crypto and if they do then the banks will definitely follow because you know they have to support you know some of these big companies and what about south korea um this country has the highest per capita involvement in crypto you said that one third of the workers have invested in crypto which that's pretty amazing um so what you know what else is happening in um the place of the kimchi premium yeah so i think different in korea is that people of all ages so people's grandmothers grandfathers are invested in crypto that you don't really see elsewhere so people are quite ford i think that's because samsung is a big part of you know korean i guess development in terms of the tech sector you know you don't really see any other country that has more police investigations and raids than korea they are basically quite cautious because they want to develop regulators want to develop this market um you know slowly and and basically curate it to be a more mature and i guess uh controlled market but what happens is that they haven't officially licensed companies yet they have created a framework but what they do right now is kind of softly i guess creating a license by seeing like which companies have proper kyc which proper companies have proper aml and they were they will be the ones to be able to get like official banking partners the companies that don't have this it's kind of an indication that they haven't really you know perhaps gotten to that level for you know proper banking relationships and so i guess softly we might see that the ones with official banking partners might be the first ones to be licensed and is the kimchi premium still a thing there yeah kimchi premium is a thing because uh for example any any companies any countries that have uh you know capital controls like um china korea india vietnam malaysia they will all have a premium or they all trade in a lag so in vietnam um if you see a sell down in the u.s for or the rest of the world for bitcoin prices vietnam tends to kind of not move for a few days and then they'll catch up later there's always a lag but all due to capital restrictions yeah okay so yeah let's talk a little bit more about um southeast asia what are you seeing there in terms of southeast asia i think that regulations are starting to come through so for example um you know the first one that is most sophisticated is obviously singapore so singapore has they haven't outright licensed a company a company yet but they've grandfathered 107 companies uh under their payment services act by the monetary authority of singapore so these companies don't need a license because they've been grandfathered you know what happens then is that they will slowly be contacted for licensing so singapore you actually see a ton of companies flock to singapore to set up you know either offices or regional offices uh to start companies there because you know if they can get the banking relationships then then it would make their lives easier as well secondly second most sophisticated is probably thailand so thailand they've licensed about 13 companies but the problem with thailand and i think they're they're unofficially relooking to this is that they've separated kind of like the crypto versus the digital tokens so that's kind of like layer ones versus say for example erc20 tokens so you need licenses that are different for those and then you need a different alliances of your exchange if you're a broker or of your dealer that makes it a little bit hard sometimes because if you want to execute like where are you going to get the assets from so i think they might re-look at to this philippines has been extremely forward in terms of licensing and in terms of adoption of crypto i think because they have like a developer mindset so last year in july the government actually created a portion like 10 million dollars of their government bonds on ethereum i mean it's still early days and even if it's on ethereum they'll actually like just swap it with fiat but i think it shows that you know people are that basically the government is looking at different ways to get basically all the filipinos around the world involved um and this is another way for like the sto market to help with uh fundraising all right let's yeah well did you want to talk about any other i know indonesia is a big country there but i don't know how active it is indonesia is a big country in terms of indonesia is a big country in terms of population but it's not that active gold is actually the first um usually the first investment that people go to not equities i think people have not really discovered bitcoin but they are slowly i think there's about like two million clients in indonesia okay yeah i'm interested in indonesia because i used to live there i love it there oh really um where did you live in jakarta no in pontong which is like three hours southeast yeah yeah beautiful and the weather's much better than in jakarta and let's do a quick tour through india i know there's been kind of a lot that's been see-sawing back and forth i feel like there yeah absolutely so in india um so in 2018 they tried to ban uh bitcoin trading in 2018 also the rbi ban banking for crypto enterprises so obviously large last year i don't know if you recall but around march the supreme court overturned what the central bank said and within two months crypto trading went up 5x right now there's still a ban to ban trading and to ban mining i think this is like an ongoing process uh so you know it's still on table but um but there's no real news on it i think that there's not a lot of funds um in in india even if it's a very sophisticated investor base yeah i think that's due to regulatory um i guess regulatory confusion as well you know i think what is interesting is that uh just like you know indonesia in 1946 in 1978 in uh in november 2016 they did this demonetization so basically overnight they said you know all 10 bills are basically void so this is to increase transparency the effects of that was that bitcoin trading doubled basically overnight because people started to understand that you know they wanted they wanted to be responsible for their own money and you couldn't just like void their own cash overnight so yeah i think i think it's still a work in progress but i think the the focus there is more on regulatory clarity and then just to circle back to china you mentioned mining and how india might be banning that and i wondered in china kind of what is the state of mining yeah i think i think when people talk when i hear like americans talk about bitcoin mining in china you know bitcoin like it's 65 uh mining in china compared to the whole world i mean people think that china is like one entity what's really happening is that they're all super competitive all these mining pools like they are cutthroat against each other because they want the best rates they want the best pricing they want you know the earliest machinery they want the best locations so these guys they don't work in tandem you know you can't you can't say this is all one china they're really completely separate entities that will do anything to kill each other off so you know how competitive chinese businesses are so you know this is no different in china as well there's no i think you know there's this saying in china where the mountains are high and the emperor is far away you know especially in mining in china i mean these are in rural provinces typically where energy costs is cheap so if you have a mining hub it's really hard for the government to crack down on it because you know you are a private entity after all okay interesting yeah i i've heard that saying before it must have been from somebody in kind of like i guess chinese crypto twitter like maybe one or i don't know i i've definitely heard that saying before anyway all right well this has been super interesting thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed yeah laura i have a question for you if you don't mind oh uh-huh sure so i've actually learned you know a ton from your podcast but i saw on your twitter profile that you're no coiner why is that oh just um for journalistic ethics reasons like some publications i might want to write for wouldn't wan wouldn't like let me write for them if i owned the stuff that i cover so i'm not like philosophically i'm a no coiner i'm you know a no coiner because i i would rather write about bitcoin than own it i guess although i really would like to own it but you know if that's going to prevent me from writing from certain publications then then i won't own it so that's good well thanks for your contribution anyway for the dispersion of information oh yeah yeah no i love i love doing what i do super super super fun i've just been having so much more fun professionally than i could ever have imagined so anyway all right
