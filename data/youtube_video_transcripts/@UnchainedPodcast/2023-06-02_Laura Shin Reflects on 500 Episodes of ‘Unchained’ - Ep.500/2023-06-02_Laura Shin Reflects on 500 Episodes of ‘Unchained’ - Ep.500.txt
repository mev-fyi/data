of Unchained hey Laura how you doing I'm good how are you I am doing very well thanks for having me so technically speaking this is indeed the 500th episode but there are dozens more in the archive talk to me more broadly speaking about reaching this big milestone well um yeah as you mentioned it's technically probably the I don't know 650th or 660th somewhere in that ballpark because there were a bunch of episodes about 160 some that were released on another feed called unconfirmed and I uh kind of discontinued that show and just folded it into Unchained but I'm sort of amazed that this podcast that I started on the side actually seven years ago it'll be seven years exactly in about two weeks yeah has become as big as it is I did not plan on that that wasn't the intention I'm very glad that that all transpired but yeah it's amazing to me that it's kind of sprouted into a little company and has a bunch of people working on it and that there yeah there are a lot of people who listen to it regularly and hilariously everybody whenever they come up to me and tell me that they listen to the show they're always like I listen when I'm at the gym or I listen while I'm doing you know the dishes or I listen while I'm driving everybody has their own little you know anecdote about where it is that they connect with me and the show and it's always fun to hear about that from people and then the other thing that I want to say which has also been super meaningful is that so many people have told me that listening to the show has changed their life they will say things like I work in crypto and now because of you I've heard that so many times and that's not at all what I intended to do I'm so glad that it had that effect but you know for me it was just I was so interested in crypto um kind of couldn't stop learning about it and couldn't stop thinking about it and loved podcasts and so really wanted to do one on crypto and I'm so glad that just doing something out of love you know out of uh the pure joy for me has led to so many benefits for other people yeah and so those are some of the thoughts um I feel like there was one other thing I was going to add oh yeah just I talked about this when I wrote a Twitter Thread about um 10 years of working around myself and I talked about how I I really believe generally that the best way to pursue you know what it is that you're gonna do in this life is just to follow your own joy and to not you know think about what it is that other people think you you should do or whatever but just find in your heart what gives you Joy and yeah I'm really glad that that's what I did here and then the last thing that I will say it too is that I used to cover other areas as a journalist and I find it amazing that I've been covering crypto for eight years and I am not getting bored at all I feel like I'm still getting started I am captivated every day by what happens in the space by the technology by the implications for society there's so many reasons why I love covering this as a journalist and so yeah it feels very momentous to reach this Milestone even though like I said the number's a bit not not exactly the exact number on this episode in your podcast player so anyway yeah thanks for asking yeah no problem I want to go back to the time the time question here because right this is eight eight or seven years you've been doing this for a long time I've only been at it since 2018 it also feels like an eternity obviously crypto time is sort of akin to dog years uh you know as you're in this reflective State as you reach this Milestone I just want to get your thoughts on your views as to whether things have changed or are the same from when you first started covering crypto things definitely have changed quite a bit at least on this surface I would say and um in the respect that for instance when I started blockchain not Bitcoin was what everybody was kind of talking about and so my first big feature story informs on blockchain ended up being about how Wall Street was going to use blockchain technology to make its products and services more efficient and I just find that hilarious it was so wrong um but that is what so many people were saying at the time and I obviously have seen over the years that yeah I mean some people do that but it's not at all you know by and large what the majority of people in crypto are doing and then you know there are things that are still the same uh in the sense that there is this spectrum of activity in the space where you've got this sort of like idealistic and high-minded people who are really in it for you know changing the world and like bringing about all these benefits through decentralization and like tackling certain problems that can be tackled when you decentralize things and then there's the other end of the spectrum where there's the people that are really into speculation and are in it to make a quick buck and you know there's all these like scams and rug pulls and so um in that sense the space hasn't changed I still see both ends in the Spectrum pretty frequently um and yeah I mean we're dealing with money and we're dealing with a new technology where things aren't codified I I would imagine as the technology matures that the balance will shift more toward serious activity and less toward the scammy speculative Parts just because for instance like things will become more regulated there will be more standardized way of doing things and they're not going to be ways of doing things that enable all those um kind of unsavory bits to happen so um yeah I do actually think that the fact that it hasn't changed that much is probably due to the fact that yeah the technology is still really young and it has a long way to go before it's mature time is a flat circle Etc definitely a little bit of that at play as well all right so this is our behind the scenes look at your 500 plus episodes we've selected 14 Clips we're going to go over them and I just wanted to ask before we dove in like what's your selection criteria for this very small slice of the uh overall archive well we didn't want to make the episode too long so I really actually try to think of episodes off the top of my head that sort of stuck out for some reason or another um because yeah like I said we didn't want to have too many so I literally did not look at all you know whatever 600 episodes or something I just try to think off the top of my head and then somebody else actually picked the exact moments and I did edit them like I just you know sometimes I was like oh actually the reason I selected this episode was for this particular section not that but otherwise I just let them pick whatever they thought was interesting from that particular interview so yeah so I don't know everything exactly that's in here um but yeah I really was just trying to find moments that I thought would be fun to talk about all right real time is real interesting so this will be good times all right we're going to start we're gonna go into the Wayback machine back to 2018 and talk about the rise of binance let's see this clip one thing that I also want to ask you about though just to go back to the regulatory question I've seen other interviews where you've said things like quote we're okay to do things very creatively to avoid unnecessary regulation or another quote we don't want to be in one place right now because of regulatory uncertainty and obviously you have this history of moving finances offices and servers it partly I think because you don't want countries to be able to easily determine if they have jurisdiction over binance and you know those times when you moved out of China you also moved out of Japan I think you also had regulatory issues in Hong Kong like those three moves I think were due to regulatory issues so some people that I spoke with said that to them it seems like you are flouting the law do you ever worry that you are putting yourself on this path to be to clash with regulators and that you could end up in jail again I think you are making somebody's else some random people's opinion to be the holy to be like a legal to be a legal enforced I don't know uh ruling or something a lot of people because I could think about anything I could think of I could think I don't know Donald Trump's violating the law but what I think doesn't really matter um so I I actually think the reverse I fully respect the laws of every country every jurisdiction and the but most people are most people have this mindset that you got to stay in one place and work with one government but uh why is that like why can't you go to a place to work with a government that you choose instead of always being stuck in one place and work with a government that may or may not support what you want to do so in a new brand new industry uh where I'm I'm very certain so they're they're they're fundamental laws right laws are different by country and the fundamental stuff you can't do uh like uh hurting people stealing scamming uh stuff like that so and there are other things like okay how do you classify a cryptocurrency how do you uh is it a security is it not and this this kind of things different countries do it differently so what's wrong with going to a country and choosing to living a country where those things are more viewed favorably for you why do you have to be stuck in a country that that are not good for for this kind of stuff why like this is this is like saying look why don't you why don't you stay like if you if you don't like hot places why don't you stuck me why don't you stuck yourself in Florida I need the sun all the time and you just don't like it right why don't you go to a different city right so I don't think there's any I don't think there's anything wrong or illegal or anything or even unethical about it I mean that's just it is optimistic but why don't you choose the good opportunities for you we're living we're living a world where we where we where we seek and um and and and phrase uh Freedom right so this why don't you use the freedom that you have all right so CZ back in September 2018 speaking about his opportunistic approach to moving Finance around the world what was your take on that one why'd you pick that one uh to start off our review well I remember that when I did this interview that it got pretty heated between him and me in a really kind of like intellectually fun way it definitely felt like intellectual sparring and I don't remember if I articulated this during the episode but one thought that I was having was that I had heard that the US government will take jurisdiction over any company that they feel is um interfacing with U.S customers uh I guess this is probably in financial services I don't know about other Arenas but I remember just feeling like you know if you're not really properly blocking people then you're effectively going to be under U.S jurisdiction and there were other parts of the interview where I think he kind of pushed back on that notion you know obviously we did this interview about five years ago I would say that at this point it's pretty clear that the direction I was going was probably correct you know some of the stuff that he was seeing here unfortunately he's not the regulator he's not setting those laws and he's not um determining how they'll be applied and so we have seen that Finance has been the target of multiple different Regulators around the world in particular the us as well so you know who knows how all of that will shake out there's a lot of articles that have come out kind of you know insinuating different things might happen so I think this story is not finished here but last thing I'll say is it's interesting to me how these same issues are still at play today and how so much of the conversation really hasn't moved forward from what we were talking about but I do think today he would probably give quite a different answer to the question that I posed yeah I was going to say exactly that like some aspects of this are prescient right like on a road to clash with Regulators While others feel like you know there are still many unresolved questions as to how to how do we regulate these assets and under which agencies purview do they fall so it is funny that there's a mix of sort of things that we have a bit of closure on and things that remain entirely open I will ask let's say binance is around in five years five years down the road what do you see from CZ wow I wonder if it will be you know unfortunately um kind of something that looks more like the bitmex of today post um you know all the executive changes and the uh actions by the doj and cftc so you know there's been hints that something like that might come down on binance and if anything binance was way it has been way bigger than bitmex was so potentially we might see a CZ that gets sidelined at some point um you know I I'm not I this is not something that like I'm saying that I want to happen necessarily I'm just kind of reading the Tea Leaves of of everything that we've seen so far in the space you know I I actually think that CZ is kind of like a crypto True Believer and you know whatever there's just a lot of things about him that I actually would put him more in the bucket of crypto native than for instance someone like Sam binkman freed so um you know I'm not saying this is my opinion that he's you know this or that type of person or this or that type of whatever but it's more that I'm just saying given the way regulations going I would not be surprised if those things happen to czn finance all right always interesting to watch sorry to put you on the spot there with the magic ball all right let's change gears let's go to vitalik back in 2019. this was unchained's first live podcast recording let's see a clip you know do you agree with what Fred Wilson is saying here which is uh is ethereum losing its lead and we do that a lot for our companies um ethereum needs that right we know that vitalik is not a CEO metallic is an evangelist he's a brilliant computer scientist but like ethereum should be more like a company right like they like you look at what EOS is doing and you look what ethereum is doing and it's like you know if ethereum was doing what EOS was doing and they'd be crushing it but they're not and they don't have enough money um uh they don't have enough developers they don't you know they're not their go to market strategy is non-existent like they're not behaving like a company and if if the of all of us who own ethereum go to metallic and say you know look this thing you've got going in Switzerland it's not working fire these  who who don't know what the hell they're doing and put somebody great in there who could help you build this thing into a monster like that's what we would do I don't know how to do that like how do you can't like there's no mechanism to do that that's that's painful I guess first of all like if Bitcoin was run like a business would it have succeeded and I feel like we're kind of intuitively know the answer and so it like it's definitely a structure that works for some things but like blockchains and cryptocurrency and all those uh all of those things that come with that package are just fundamentally kind of so much more and kind of so different from a kind of traditional company or or a software product so I'm really not at all sure that like that kind of of model is anywhere close to the right model um so in terms of like what our model is right like we've definitely had these discussions inside of the foundation and there's definitely been people from time to time that just said yeah we need to go in with guns blazing and fire those bastards and then you know get the 40 people in and like stick them in the middle of some nimbies you'll be in Silicon Valley and get them to pay ten thousand dollars a month to rent get them to work for 16 hours every day rah-rah raw six months and like we got ethereum 3.0 man and wow wow what a what a blast in the past yeah that EOS reference from Fred Wilson maybe not aging so well I think metallic may have gotten the last laugh on that one all right what are your thoughts on this clip yeah I have so many thoughts so first of all you're right that um it the clip from Fred Fred Wilson didn't necessarily age well and that vitalik really did have it right that um when you have a decentralized project it needs to be run differently you know ethereum has succeeded beyond all measure there's so many times when it really could have failed you know if you look at things like even just something as simple as the crypto kitties Saga when the blockchain got really clogged for the first time um or that wasn't the first time sorry because we had by then we've been in Ico season so you know status and um Brave and uh bancor and all those icos had really tested ethereum but despite the fact that ethereum keeps kind of busting at the seams every so often with all this activity it's proven that it's got a lot of staying power but when I said that I have so many feelings about that clip like another part of me just thinks back to what I learned from reporting my book where you know I discovered a lot of kind of discontent and dysfunction at the top levels of the ethereum foundation and just uh generally how um that was all run um you know people talked about this Shadow government there were a lot of people that were involved in things without a specific title and so there were a lot of complaints that these people had a lot of influence but nobody knew how it was that they had the power to do the things they do because they didn't have like specific titles or duties or anything like that it was just these shadowy figures who sort of wielded this power so you know I do think that um yes ethereum has succeeded probably because it followed that decentralized model and yet like I said I know so much of the backstory about how people felt that there still was so much dysfunction um and so I think there's kind of a Middle Road like hopefully projects in the future will be able to be decentralized while also having certain Clarity and not kind of creating this um sort of mystery and um yeah Intrigue and like these power struggles uh you know for when it comes to controlling the protocol yeah interesting to think about like the Securities Law implications of some of the comments made by Fred Wilson there as well but we'll leave that for another day all right changing gears let's Zoom ahead a few years let's go to April of 2022. this goes ahead to the anchor and UST Extravaganza with Kevin Zhao offering some perhaps insightful and prescient wisdom about that algorithmic stablecoin project let's see the clip an algorithm that makes stable coins have historically had trouble so in this case how and why did usdn depeg yes it was for a number of reasons but the main reason is that people found that on chain there was a really large address that was doing what we call recycling right or leveraging and the way that that works is that and and many people think that this is the waves team themselves that was doing this and the way that works is you know you first you start with usdn you put it into avires and vires is basically like the Ave of waves so it's a borrow lending platform you can deposit uh you know usdn over there get some yield you can borrow other types of assets like usdc tether there is itself waves a lot of different assets so the way that this Loop works is that usdn is first put into Vera's as deposit and then from that they're able to borrow hard assets like usdc and usdt they use that then to buy waves and then use the waves to convert it to usdn through the mechanism that we talked about right before and then redeposit that usdm back into virus completing the cycle and continuously do this until basically all the deposits for usdc or usdt um are depleted because then the cycle can't continue anymore so basically there was a lot of this recycling going on and that's what's been causing this huge pump in the price of waves and then afterwards at some point you know there are a lot of people on Twitter for example like Xerox hams for example A lot of people are pointing this out uh which is that you know this whole thing is unsustainable because at some point the whole thing has to come come back down once uh this cycle stops because of the running out of uh of the deposits of ustc and usdt okay so it's April 2022 about a month before the famous collapse of the Terra ecosystem Kevin Zhao kind of staked his reputation at the time on some of those predictions and we all know how that story played out so let me get your thoughts on this clipboard yeah did well before anyone else and I did have I think it was actually more than one person who reached out to me after Tara collapse and told me that listening to this episode with Kevin where he it's not just in this clip but multi kind of throughout the episode he's talking about how he thinks Tara could collapse how it would work why it is that it's likely to collapse I think he even like gave predictions on sort of um what would happen to the market cap and you know I had people say things like after listening to that episode I pulled my money out of Tara and that saved me you know a big chunk of money it like it saved me from losing a big chunk of money so I think what's good is that afterward I did a few different interviews where I asked people why is it that so many people have these thoughts about Tara but did not speak up you know because as you recall before Terra Luna collapse like dokwon was super arrogant like more arrogant pretty much than anybody we've ever seen in crypto you know his Persona on Twitter was like Mr King of crypto and I'm going to use my ego to bruise anybody who tries to just come at me I mean it was very it's kind of entertaining to watch a little bit cringy um and yeah like I think because of his Persona because of the different backers he had whatever the reasons were a lot of people had these thoughts about Tara and just didn't speak up and so you know kudos to Kevin show for saying what he really thought and calling it and yeah hopefully that's a model for next time around when people think that there's something that might collapse and um you know cause a lot of pain and hurt in the industry yeah that really was the big collapse that set off you know subsequent dominoes that were we're still kind of seeing the ramifications of those unfold to this day so yeah credit for calling that one I mean his fund even got caught up in some of those dominoes later on down the road which is sort of a funny twist of fate as we see often in the crypto World anyway all right let's go to the next one and now we'll shift gears to Martin shkreli offering some unsolicited advice to SPF should he end up behind bars but Sam isn't exactly gonna be somebody that fits into prison you know my advice for him includes shaving his head my advice for him includes uh deepening his voice he speaks in a sort of and again I I would normally not judge somebody this way unless the context of prison which is a very testosterone-filled masculine place it's very difficult um there are plenty of prisoners who are trans who get by just lying in prison I defended one trans prisoner and vouch for them in many ways and helped not protect them so to speak but but sort of vouch for them as somebody that should be accepted Sam is going to have a lot of issues because he's a bit of an unfeminate Guy and um his his sort of demeanor um some people say autistic sort of sense uh or sensibility is not something that goes over well in prison people sort of expect you to be direct they expect you to be very assertive if you're not it's seen as weak you know you have to be quick on the on on the uptake with sort of um responses you know if you know people get the sense that they can pick on you they will pick on you and you you know it's going to be very hard for him to sort of adjust to that sort of Lifestyle he also doesn't know anything about the streets and sort of criminal culture which my advice to him is to pick those things up as quickly as he can he should be listening to as much rap music as possible he should be trying to learn everything there is to know about gangs about the tough neighborhoods in every major city this sounds funny but this could save your life you know I I my suggestion to him is that he rebrands himself quite a bit in fact he probably should no longer say that he's from Stanford or something like that he can say that he's from Oakland all right so that's some straight talk from a guy who spent some time locked up uh that one like a little little wild pretty spicy clip there I don't know what you were thinking at the time when you recorded that one yeah I mean first of all I was a little uncomfortable with how he was kind of picking apart Sam's personality and his mannerisms you know I think what he was saying was yes many of us have been trained to not judge people in those ways um but he's entering a place where he will be judged in those ways it did make me a little bit uncomfortable but I think he was giving really practical advice and I think he was yeah in a way um trying to oh it's like almost like a brotherly thing or something um you know like I'm I'm gonna try to make this as easy for you as possible but one thing that was so fascinating to me about this episode was that after we published it I got so much pushback oh my God so many people were mad that I had him on the show I mean it was like people who've been on the show and like love my show had written me really Stern messages about how they have lost all respect for me and I mean it was like a little bit shocking I you know always when I'm covering things I always look for the best source to cover something to to you know be either the guest or like in an article the source for you know whatever I'm writing about and I really felt that actually this was kind of a genius move I had seen him on YouTube analyzing the case and he clearly was like this prominent White Collar uh Criminal Who had gone through the southern district of New York court system many times he knew all the judges I mean he had strong opinions on who the different judges were that SPF might face and how that would affect the sentencing I mean it was like a really detailed analysis that I just knew I wasn't going to get that from a lawyer you know and so I actually felt like this is the right person to hear from now and so it was just very fascinating that people thought that I was endorsing Martin shkreli that I you know and I'm not I'm just trying to see like who is the best person who can shed light on this new story that we're all fascinated with and intensely interested in and give us insight into what it might look like for stamping been freed if he does go to prison so in that respect I personally felt like this was an amazing show and I actually um was really surprised by how personable and gregarious and insightful Martin was um I have a feeling that probably because you know I read a bunch of his whatever tweets and posts and other things that he said before prison I have a feeling prison changed him uh you know in different ways and maybe made him a better person that's just my guess like I said kind of looking at the before and after um so yeah I thought it was a hugely insightful episode yeah an interesting second act for Martin for sure I bet come you know October of this year 2023 when the SBF trial happens he'll probably be back in the Limelight we'll see yes all right changing gears let's go back to the realm of politics and regulation August 3rd 2021 we got two cftc Commissioners on the show let's see what they had to say and at the moment with the way that many of these D5 projects are set up who do you think is a natural entity for you to regulate for the cftc in general to regulate well that's a great that's a great question um and so one one one has to look at a number of factors and and to see whether there is actual uh the sufficient edition of control or intermediation of fine who's financing it who's making the decisions um is is somebody benefiting by it by by Financial uh financially is there really an organization behind this uh how how decentralized or centralized is it and it can be very factual specific and it's an evolving area so we're we're looking carefully at a number of these things it's it's different different facilities and different protocols seem to have different degrees of centralization or decentralization and I think it's a it's a some of these present a very interesting questions for us okay that was Dan Berkowitz then of the cfdc leader of the SEC now out of the public sector who's actually on the show again I think about a week ago and there didn't seem to be a much more additional Clarity to his thoughts on how to regulate defy in a compliant manner so that one is funny to see uh in the wake of some recent comments from the same guy yeah I mean the more that we kind of grapple with this question the more that I just realized yeah what we're talking about here is something fundamentally new this this is probably as much of an opinion that you'll get from me anywhere on the show I tend not to really reveal opinions but you know if you look at something like a security and if you look at kind of traditional Commodities this definitely feels like kind of a different beast and I don't mean to say that literally anything that comes in a blockchain wrapper needs to be classified one way or another but for the assets that people tend to think of as you know crypto assets the things that kind of reflect the ideals that the crypto World um is trying to bring about I do feel like yeah probably having some set of regulations that tackles those in particular would be good because the way things are shaking out right now it just feels like people are mainly just disagreeing a lot and we need kind of either Congress to come up with something pretty definitive or yeah maybe actual rulemaking from the SEC which is what coinbase has been begging for yeah it's hard to get the square peg in the round hole in this instance when you're dealing with the way D5 works and the way the existing sort of regulatory structures work and we see this conversation time and time and time again and seem to go nowhere productive all right let's leave that one be let's go back to do Quan back to the Tara episode this one was a big deal October 18 2022 I think this was a big get for the show talking to dokwon himself let's see what he said fat man's here and posted some stories of people who had lost a lot of money in Tara there was one man who said he had a malignant tumor and he'd received fifty thousand dollars from insurance for therapy but then he lost 90 percent of it in Anchor someone else lost a quarter of a million dollars a lot of these people had young children Taiwan news reported that a man in Taiwan who had two million dollars in Terra um had that value plunged to about a thousand dollars and committed suicide here's your opportunity to say something to the people who lost what many cases was their life savings um here's your opportunity to say something to a family who lost members to Suicide what do you want to say to them oh so whatever issues existed with Kara's design its weakness to respond to you know sort of the cruelty of the markets it's my responsibility and my responsibility alone so for the community that engaged with the para ecosystem used its steps you know sent tokens and coins into its many protocols the the downfall of the companies I chose to build on Pera uh for the people that you know chose to work on the ecosystem and for you know the hundreds of thousands if not millions of people that used you know Terror currency uh you know the Terra ecosystem which was all built on the stability of UST I own up to that responsibility fully and it's it's not easy I I think the hardest thing about the current situation is having to contend with you know so much astronomical loss it's it's it's it's quite hard to put into words but the the scale of the sort of the financial and emotional and economic damage that that happened here uh is is not easy to live with heavy stuff and a bit of introspection from dokwan co-founder of terraform Labs talking about the collapse of the terror ecosystem and some of the human cost of that tell me what that interview was like that was a big one I remember that one was the Talk of the Town for quite a while what stood out to you uh about that particular interview I remember that I felt like I was really threading a needle there because there were the people who fell on the one hand that he was just a failed entrepreneur they were the people who felt that he had committed a fraud and so I did um in a very compressed period of time like some amount of kind of investigative work so I could try to catch is not the right word but you know just unearth facts about some of the areas that people thought were frauds I think the closest I came was when I asked him about some claims he had made about chai which we later did see made their way into or not like literally the parts of the episode but that incident made its way into the SEC complaint the one thing that I neglected to include or just like I said I didn't have all the time to make it the number one best interview that I could but I didn't have the bit about jump in there which was um also in the SEC complaint but I just remembered that I tried really really really hard to stick to facts to get neutral to not prejudge and to not even judge during the interview but just to let him have his say and to represent both sides represent the people who thought he was fail entrepreneur and the people who thought that he had committed a fraud and let people hear what he had to say and then judge for themselves so yeah it was It was kind of tough and I also wanted to um yeah call him out basically on his arrogant behavior um you know not not by you know like I said judging him but just to ask him about some of the comments he'd made and stuff like that so in that regard you know we did see him humbled and that was a moment where um he kind of expressed some regret and I'm glad that you know I was able to get him to do that for people who felt that they needed that yeah definitely a big moment I think for the space at large to hear some of that Contrition that you know we mentioned it earlier right the bombast and sort of the hubris that you saw out of him was in stark contrast to what came through in that interview all right we're going to switch it up to a bit more lighter Fair let's go to punk 6529 back in March of 2022 talking about the significance of board ape yacht clubs and crypto punks last Friday Yuka Labs the creator of the board API Club announced that it had acquired the crypto punks and mebits collections from their creator larva labs why don't you describe what else it was that they announced with that acquisition and how you think this will change things for crypto punks and mebits owners great and I'm happy to do that and I think before we discuss that specifically I think it's probably useful to take a step back to what the punks represented in the space what maybe yoga Labs represented in the space because I think beyond the technical aspects of the transaction I think there were quite a few let's call them narrative aspects or psychological aspects that are embedded in the various reactions that people had to this so if that's okay maybe we do some context setting so the punks are not the first nfts but let's say they're the first nfts that reached popular knowledge popular social construction they have been in the last year at all points in time the most valuable collection by most metrics of the market capitalization of all the punks cumulatively and they had this let's say counter-cultural narrative right there's a lot of OG Punk holders and particularly the early Punk holders are people who saw value in nfts and saw value specifically in the punks early or at least saw narrative saw art saw that this was something worth claiming initially they were free or collecting this led to both a certain Community feel among the punk holders and a certain aesthetic and they are in fact punks then they're low-res punks but they're they are punks so they have a counter-cultural vibe in what they're representing visually and this abstract aesthetic this 24 by 24 pixelated aesthetic has dramatically influenced the space as has the structure of the collection right whether on purpose or by accident the crypto punks have set the base model for what a pfp profile picture collection looks like that it's around 10 000 pieces that there are dominant hierarchy traits so in the case of Punk's humans zombies Apes aliens and that there is a generative aspect in how those their various traits are randomly given to in if each individual Punk and many of the traits in punks you see reflected in many other pfp collections right so whether it's a direct homage or it turns out that those are traits that people find appealing for example hoodies turned out to be a quite appealing trait in punks even though um they're not a particularly rare trait and so many collections proceeded to then have hoodies as a trait because they've seen the market reaction on which traits people like to use to represent themselves in a profile picture identity so the punks were let's say nine months ago the completely unchallenged leaders of the profile picture category right and some of the largest nft sales that had ever happened were Elite punks the alien punks that were between 10 and 20 million dollars and the view being that there's only nine of them and so those nine might become almost unimaginably valuable over time because of the historical provenance of the collection right that's let's say where we were in May in May is also when the board Apes launched and the board Apes I think it's fair to say there were three things that distinguish them from a lot of what was happening during that period that was a period where a lot of collections were trying to mince at relatively high prices or to create escalating prices during the mint so bonding curves where the price of each success of Mentor group movements goes up and it ended up it has turned out as the field has concluded this is a bad idea it actually it's bad for the collection to have people on day one having some people having paid one price and some other people having paid 20 times the price actually leads to unhealthy Dynamics in the collection all right so that was Punk 6529 on the cultural impact and Legacy of the crypto punks collection and how they shaped PFE projects going forward all right what's your what's your thoughts on this one this one was a bit historical in nature kind of a cultural analysis what were you thinking at the time well well listening to him I really felt like it was listening to an art historian talk about the development of nfts and it was kind of this like big analysis and I remember that it was technically supposed to be a Friday episode which is actually the shorter episodes that we have on the show but this was his first time ever appearing on a podcast so it was like a big get for me and then he just you know did you know what he does when he does a Twitter thread where it's extremely long but it's like you know gives all the context and everything and so he ended up talking for an hour and I just let him I just you know kind of sat back and just let him do his thing and just try to come up with good questions that would elicit his ideas so I kind of threw out my script I might have like followed a little bit of it but he really you know I barely had to prompt him and he just had so much Insight so um yeah it was great to have him on the show and yeah like I said I it felt significant and almost like historical to hear his perspectives Laura no opinions just recent analysis are you bullish on nft sticking around do you think that they are going to be a fad that was of its time in 2021 2022 and that Mania will never come back no no I definitely think they're going to be a thing I don't know if they're always going to look the way that they do now but for sure um in a way actually um so obviously they're quite popular and they're drawing in all these newcomers and they're drawing in all these people who don't even know um anything about crypto and you know Reddit has had uh success with them not calling them nfts um you know those Collectibles or whatever they call them the avatars uh were quite popular mostly maybe because people didn't think they were nfts but I think that you know since so we have this use case that's stringing bringing in all these normies but on top of that the kind of ways in which nft um nfts can uh intersect or collide with regular is like just a much smaller area than in the rest of crypto so for that reason I actually feel like it's going to be easier for them to take off fair enough fair enough all right let's go back in time again to 2018 just a lovely headline on this one to be honest Melton dimirs and Jill Carlson on the coin waterfall let's hear a clip from that one I'm speaking with Melton demirs and Jill Carlson so let's talk about this irony of the crypto space sort of recreating the old one melson you tweeted new money just like the old Mini but with different Rich guys in charge yeah awesome Neato I'm curious to hear your take on what we're seeing play out so far which is pretty much as you put it Laura you know I seriously was obsessed with your Twitter feed I was as I was putting this together all right that was a fun one nice little historical gem from the I guess the tail end of the Ico era but certainly something that uh has been persistent in the space ever since melt I'm always good for a fun quote what are your thoughts on this one yeah so first of all um the reason I selected this episode for my staff to take a look at is I just remember laughing so much during this episode because Melton was being herself and I think that having Jill there had like kind of even loosened her up more because she'd been on my show before but like only by herself and this time was like when I really got what they really thought about everything and it was like pretty hilarious so yeah she kept talking about the coin waterfall as she called it and you know I find this particular tweet that I called out really interesting because it definitely is something that I've noticed a lot and I'm sure anybody who does anything in crypto knows you know it's like 90 men and um it's interesting to me in the sense that just in our world you know I feel like everybody uses money everybody uses technology and so you know just on kind of like a certain basic level it doesn't make sense that um it would be so lopsided but then um on a totally different level you know it's like you see the disparities like in the tech world in the finance world and so when you combine them then we you get this like hyper version of that um so that's why I actually think that you know uh lopsidedness is even more extreme in crypto but you know the kind of sad fact of the matter is that when I asked her this question back in 2018 things were not that different from how they are now and you know I do think of course nfts have brought in more women but I still think that the lopsidedness is just a smidgen less extreme than it was and I don't see it even getting close to like kind of the disparity you might see in Tech or Finance which I think is maybe more 70 30 rather than like 90 10. um and I don't know what's going to change that but probably it's just the maturation of the space it's just unfortunate that the people involved in building it and making it more mature are not going to be women um or at least you know so far they haven't been hopefully that will change um but yeah it's something that I've asked multiple people about I feel like nobody ever has a good answer I don't have a good answer I don't know if you have any thoughts on that but yeah it's sort of a perennial question yeah I mean my thoughts are that the space could certainly use it the space is sort of aggressively masculine and I think there's a huge skill set uh associated with those that are more feminine that could be highly useful to how crypto advances and kind of reaches again that ultimate goal of mainstream or at least more widespread adoption because it's still yeah I feel like these ideals around decentralization and stuff I feel like those in particular are ones that first of all either drama or women or could use uh more women to kind of help develop them and anyway so yeah I know that there are certain groups that are working on that um I also know that there was um I'm just blanking on the name of it but there was a kind of like Dow type product but it was like mini Financial clubs elitzer I think is his name and Ian Lee um Syndicate Now by chance yes Syndicate Dao yeah and they created these like little investment clubs that's what it was and when they launched the launch group that they had was half women LED or women only Dows and they didn't even like intentionally do that so that's saying something and so they were like oh we just kind of realized that actually our mission was aligned with what a lot of women were doing in the space so who knows maybe as that kind of stuff developed more develops more we'll see more women get involved yeah interesting point on like Dows and collectivism I think that's definitely well noted all right let's change gears let's go to the idea of ultrasound money we talked to Justin Drake way back in 2021 about eth on its way to becoming ultrasound let's take a peek this idea that if could be turning into what people in the ethereum ecosystem are calling ultrasound money so what were the characteristics of eth as money before the upgrade and what would you say they are now and why would you call that ultrasound money right I mean one of the things that's kind of uh useful is to understand what what is money right so money for me is a money candidate with monetary premium okay so what is the money candidate and what is monetary premium a money candidate is an asset which has various characteristics which means that it could potentially be used at money it's durable it's divisible it's fundable it's transmissible so if you look for example at a cow a cow that will never be money right because it's not easily divisible you know the head is not equivalent to the tail and you know it's not durable and it's not transmissible easily on the other hand if you take an asset like you know salt for example that was using money at money or gold or Bitcoin they have all these basic properties but it's not sufficient to be a money candidate you know you can look at all the coins on coin market cap most of them are not money all right that was Justin Drake from the ethereum foundation Lord you remember when like Ethan's money was sort of like I don't know a tagline or something that was debated I feel like I don't know I kind of remember that era and obviously it evolved into ultrasound money and then the shift approved stake and sort of deflationary pressures that I don't know gave Heath Maxi's life force what's your thoughts on this uh this whole evolution of the ethas money narrative I mean it's so interesting because this question of you know is this crypto asset money it just keeps coming up and I mean clearly they have value their financial assets um so then it's like you know do they fit those three prongs that people usually use to describe money which is unitative account store Value Store value but then also transact it's like for transactions means of payment or something like that yeah yeah something like that and um you know I definitely would say like maybe some tiny percentage of the world uses them as all three uh like I remember back in the day um Olaf Carlson we told me that there was periods of his life where he only transacted and like Bitcoin and eth or whatever and so maybe for him but um I don't think you know we've got like you I would be highly highly uh shocked frankly if like even one percent of the world actually transacted an Ethan this way um so I you know which is not to say I don't think it will happen someday like I literally have no idea um but just in terms of like if we're looking at those three prongs does it fit those no it doesn't you know doesn't mean I never will no not necessarily um but I almost find the question a little bit silly because I'm just like you guys at this point like literally everything you know even I remember from my book when I would interview people about you know um different events in crypto they'd often be like oh the price of Bitcoin at the time was da da or the price of eth at the time was blah blah blah and they always would denominate it in dollars even if they're European even if they're Asian whatever they would always denominate in dollars so you guys to my mind like dollars are definitely money not sure about Bitcoin and ether it's the universal unit of account for sure I mean it's kind of funny though like the whole nft craze being pretty much widely denominated in eth right eth was much more widely spent than Bitcoin was uh and Bitcoin obviously is peer-to-peer electronic cash is originally conceived so it is interesting I think at least in the crypto sphere which is again a very small sliver of humanity eth became the more spendable asset relative to bitcoin as as money in that instance but maybe that's a controversial take I don't know yeah no but it's totally it's totally true except of course in the last few months in the last few months now the um ordinal transcriptions have been denominated in Bitcoin so um yeah so maybe it's through nfts that we'll start to see these assets be used as units of account sats are back baby all right we're gonna change gears let's stay in the world of nfts for a minute we are going to hear about Mitchell chant who's one of the first nft pioneers let's hear what he told you in late December of 2021. okay so I feel like this is the perfect segue to discussing your first nft art because you know there are a lot of themes around the actual artwork and then the either experience of that artwork or the commodity value of it that you played with in that first artwork and it's so incredibly fascinating um so yeah why don't you describe how you came to create that first nft art and what it was sure so I'm I'm coming like I'm coming fresh to crypto from 2017. I have a very like it's 2017. I have you know some awareness of it I know a little bit about Bitcoin but I'm sort of just discovering ethereum for the first time and so I'm sympathetic to a lot of the you know criticisms or shall we say skepticism about crypto um you know there's nothing there it's insubstantial it's not Tethered to anything it is free-floating uh it doesn't represent uh uh um a certain quantity of gold um in in in in a vault somewhere but I'm a conceptual artist so that doesn't bother me in fact I understand that in fact it's untetheredness and it's free-floatingness is what could give it power right and of course I'm an artist so I'm also most interested in yeah what does this mean for art um not that at this point does it seem like ever you know there's going to be a significant amount of art that is created on blockchain or transacted on blockchain that's a Preposterous I Dia in 2017 but I mean yeah what if what if this will be a fun little thought exercise charismatic speaker that was a fun one uh what was the highlight for you from this conversation oh my God so many Mitchell is an amazing Storyteller and he is so just creative and insightful with uh the way he looks at crypto probably because he is an artist so um he just kind of will yeah I mean you could hear it in that clip he just has like really interesting ways of looking at things the reason why I want to include this clip though is I have to tell you in all the years I've done the podcast this is the only episode where numerous people felt the need to tweet at me how much they loved Mitchell and how delightful he was as a person and um it really shines through the episode like if you go back and listen the whole thing because he tells this whole story about actually what he considers the very first art nfts and they're from an artwork from I think it was like the late 1950s if I remember correctly in France I'll just like do a really brief description of the artwork but it's eve Klein and uh there's a you know he's famous so there was a big Gallery uh exhibit at a gallery and they were like you know lines around the block and stuff and people go in and the artworks are uh just like blank it's all blank and he's selling something like 23 of these and what you get for your it's called like immaterial zones of pictorial sensibility or something like that and you get a certificate saying that you own this artwork even though it's like not visible and then um the other thing that was funny is that he said in order for you to experience the apotheosis of this artwork you needed to go with him to the river Sun okay by the way also you could only pay for your artwork in gold gold coins and so if you wanted to experience that apotheosis of this artwork you had to go with him to the river sun and he would throw half the gold that you gave him into the river if you threw your certificate into the river and so um people were paying loads of money for this and um basically uh Mitchell created an nft version of that and the smart contract for it literally has a function where if you burn your nft your certificate and send it to the burn address it automatically takes half the eat that you paid for it uh that that he earned for selling you the nft and burns that as well so um anyway it's just really funny he made like an nft version of that first analog nft and um yeah the whole story was highly amusing there's like way more in the episode you guys should all listen to it was super fun yeah good stuff we got a couple more all these are obviously in the show notes so check that out online if you want to dig into these episodes in full all right from the magic of art on the blockchain to some what was it Advanced game theoretical Shenanigans let's go here from mango markets attacker Avi Eisenberg on the ethics of D5 exploits you then made a proposal to return 67 million dollars to investors as long as they agreed to a condition which we'll talk about later but just overall like when because it's you know this isn't the first time that a hacker has returned some of the money so why do you think that people who are in this type of situation offer to return some amount of it back um I mean I can't speak for anyone else in this case as I stated publicly I wanted to ensure that other users won't hurt and so I helped uh negotiate the settlement and make sure that everyone all the users of the platform would be able to withdraw even though the platform was technically insolvent all right that's self-described applied game theorist Avi Eisenberg who ended up in U.S custody late last year and I think was still in detention earlier this year what's the latest on obvi's story and also talking to him what were your impressions yeah so I am not sure of the exact latest on this story but I do think he is yeah you know as you said still in detention I mean I just kind of couldn't believe that he even wanted to come on my show and then um one and we we didn't I guess you know whoever went through and selected these clips didn't uh select one clip where I asked him about you know whether or not what he had done there was Market manipulation which is what a bunch of people had thought and he said Market manipulation he's like you know how do you determine what the correct price is at any given moment um you know and he was kind of disputing the notion that the price had been manipulated he was saying that he just made it the correct price um so you know I thought it was pretty Brazen like pretty much everything the Tweet telling everybody coming on the show using these different rationalizations to describe his actions which you know they're not con like common interpretations of how you would interpret those actions and definitely not ones that the US government agreed with so um you know maybe there's like a sense of like self-righteousness in him like he thinks he's smarter than everybody or you know I that's kind of the only way that I can explain all of those different things um and you know sadly what he instead demonstrated is that maybe wasn't the smartest move actually to do all those things so yeah those are some of my thoughts on that yeah fair enough definitely an odd case all right last one let's finish maybe on a more uplifting note let's go to one of krypto's OG's zappos's wences casares on how Bitcoin makes a more fair world this was all the way back in 2018 let's see how it has aged so out of all the businesses you could have done with Bitcoin why did you choose to build Zappa with you know the vaults the wallet the debit card I once I understood Bitcoin I became very very optimistic that if Bitcoin succeeds it may be the biggest Leap Forward we've ever seen in the democratization of money and it will make for a much much more equal and fair World in my opinion but the fact that it succeeds is not a given it could still fail so I decided that I want to spend the rest of my career helping Bitcoin succeed I don't see this as a job where I am running a company to make the company grow and make money that's not what motivates me what motivates me is when I am old and hopefully my grandkids come and ask me hey Grandpa what did you do with your career I want to be able to say you know what I was part of a large group of people who helped Bitcoin succeed and for me the best way to help it succeed I see sapo as a platform to help Bitcoin succeed alright years later what do you think how's Bitcoin doing is it succeeding are we yet to get there give us some historical perspective based on the entirety of your coverage as to some of those big ideas that wentz's voice there well is Bitcoin succeeding um it probably depends on what your bar is for Success it certainly has a very passionate following around the world you know how big it is is basically really not that big when it comes to the grand scheme of things um however there are certain people who have really demonstrated what the use case is for Bitcoin and I've had some of them on my show in this episode actually one says tells some stories about his life growing up in Argentina that make clear that you know if he'd had Bitcoin available at the time then it would have helped his family um you know kind of weather some of the storms there it depending on where you are in the world it kind of either primes you to see the potential in Bitcoin and other cryptos or not so for instance I feel like every time I talk to American audiences they either talk about Bitcoin just as an investment you know and they even sometimes will ask me if it's like a stock or the or they won't ask they'll assume it's a stock or you know they'll kind of talk about it as a passive investment um or they'll just say why is this necessary um they don't get the reason for it and then if you talk you know to like argentines or people um yeah just like in Afghanistan or whatever they understand it and you know at least the ones I've had in my show will tell me that they've used it and here's the dire circumstances in which it came in handy and was their only option so I think for all those reasons um that's probably why we've seen adoption kind of take off in small Pockets but not really in the mainstream especially in the US but in the US what we do see of course is that there's a fair amount of speculation and there has been some interest uh from institutional investors so as time goes on and especially if we get a Bitcoin ETF sometime soon which looks kind of like more than likely or odds than we probably would have thought a year ago for all those reasons like there could be a moment where there's a catalyst that actually causes it to take off a lot more quickly well interesting thoughts all around thanks Laura

they have turned to the Bahamian government for a specialty waiver in December bankman freed was extradited from the Bahamas but his legal team now contends that any new charges violate the extradition treaty between the two countries the U.S justice department however argues that the treaty does not limit the charges that can be brought post-extradition while they maintain the validity of the charges they have recognized the Bahamian government's authority to Halt certain aspects of the case as the justice department notes the Bahamas response will be quote dis-positive in deciding how to proceed with the additional charges the three counts involve allegations of conspiracy to commit bank fraud operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act a hearing on the motion to dismiss the charges is set set for June 15th in response to fraud charges spf's defense team is set to argue that he acted based on advice from Law Firm

amid pushed for independent Examiner the battle to appoint an independent examiner for FTX has escalated to the US third Circuit Court of Appeals thanks to a ruling by District Judge Colm Connolly the request championed by the U.S trustee Andrew Vera representing the Department of Justice had been rejected by a bankruptcy judge citing significant costs estimated to be near or exceeding 100 million dollars four U.S senators including Elizabeth Warren and Cynthia lemis voiced support for the independent examination they argued that the law firm representing FTX had a conflict of interest given its past association with the exchange the Senators stated quote The Firm is simply not in a position to uncover the information needed to ensure confidence in any investigation or findings binance

restructuring and settlement agreement crypto mining breathed the Society of relief President Joe Biden's proposal of a 30 excise tax on crypto mining companies in his 2023 budget proposition was recently Swept Away in a debt ceiling deal the excise tax aimed at energy consumption for crypto mining had been planned to be phased in over three years with a 10 increase each year however in an effort to circumvent a U.S government debt default this controversial tax has been dropped as revealed by Ohio representative Warren Davidson according to Davidson the draft bill will block the proposed tax on crypto miners electricity usage this draft legislation which is currently awaiting Congressional approval would suspend the debt ceiling for two years allowing the US government to continue borrowing money and meeting its Financial commitments something that was seen as positive by many crypto Traders meanwhile Bitcoin miners witnessed a surge and transaction fee Revenue this may reaching a two-year High primarily due to the rise in Bitcoin nfts as the mining difficulty surpassed the 50 trillion line according to data from btc.com additionally stablecoin provider tether is

protocol is slated to return to the hands of the original governance token holders the motive behind this apparent surrender of control is unclear there is speculation that the attackers could either have lost interest after swapping 483 000 torn tokens for ethereum or eth or they could be attempting to increase torn's price before selling off the remaining tokens time for fun bits everybody's been saying that the US government is trying to kill crypto listen to Jenny from Unchained who has some thoughts on whether it's actually a secret recently I've seen what feels like hundreds of tweets and articles about the US government's secret war on crypto which definitely makes me question the definition of the word secret and it's Democrats fault apparently Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has warned that the Biden Administration has it out for crypto and he is going to get the troops to go fight it just as soon as he has conquered Mickey Mouse at least that's what people say he says I I couldn't hear I only heard static Elon Musk also thinks that crypto could crash if Democrats keep power and I trust him because he is the world expert on platforms that crash they're not the only ones who think that crypto will die if Biden is re-elected which I think is kind of optimistic you really think crypto is going to make it to 2025. I also think that people with this concern are maybe giving the government too much credit you really think they know how to kill crypto just the other day Dianne Feinstein asked if Bitcoin was a very small coin also not to State the obvious but if crypto is capable of getting killed by the government then it totally failed at its purpose Unchained is produced by Laura Shin with help from Kevin Fuchs Matt pilchard me Zach Seward wateranovic Sam sriram Genie Hogan Jeff Benson Leandro Camino Pam majumdar Shashank and Margaret Korea thanks so much for listening foreign
