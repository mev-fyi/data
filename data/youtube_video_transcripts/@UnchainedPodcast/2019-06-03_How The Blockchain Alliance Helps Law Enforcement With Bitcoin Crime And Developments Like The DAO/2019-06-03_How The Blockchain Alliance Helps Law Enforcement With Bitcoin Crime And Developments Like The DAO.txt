welcome to forbs podcasts hi everyone welcome to Unchained a forbs podcast produced by fractal recording I'm your host Lauren a Forbes contributor covering blockchain digital currencies and FinTech thanks for tuning in for today's episode I'm speaking with Jason Weinstein in Alan Cohn who are partner and of council respectively at the law firm Steptoe and Johnson as well as director and counsel at the blockchain Alliance welcome Jason and Alan thanks Laura thanks for having us yes thanks Laura Jason let's start with you and tell us about your background and how you came to be involved in blockchain well I I was at the Department of Justice for 15 years and was a federal prosecutor and during the last third of my time there I had the opportunity to supervise both the Computer Crimes section and the organized crime section which focused primarily on international organized criminal groups and one of the things that those groups both have in common is that the criminals they're after are very good at moving money and as it became easier and easier to move money digitally the criminals they were after got better and better at using technology to do that and so in that context I became interested in digital currencies and when I switched sides and I became a defense lawyer and joined Steptoe I continued to be interested in it and one of the things that I was really fascinated by as Bitcoin became more in the in the popular consciousness is that Bitcoin is the complete opposite of the currencies that the criminals we were after were using the when digital currencies first became used by criminals they were currencies that were designed and maintained by and for criminals they were actual digital currencies that were tailored to the needs of criminals and when Bitcoin became more popular what I realized fairly quickly is the Bitcoin was the opposite of that Bitcoin was a digital currency that was designed for legitimate uses that was being misappropriated by criminals and so one of my my interest since I've been on this side has been educating law enforcement about the differences between Bitcoin and digital currencies that they used to go after and getting him to understand that just because criminals misuse the technology doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the technology itself and tell me more about those previous digital currencies that criminals used to use were they ones how do they function well you know the two most popular were called eagled and Liberty Reserve and the e-gold case was investigated and prosecuted while I was still there in the Liberty Reserve case we started while I was there and concluded after I'd left the department and in a nutshell they were they were tailoring to a clientele that was that was really just criminals it was you know there was no kind of kyc or know your customer involved in fact because they knew their customers were criminals the you know there was no attempt to establish legitimacy of the transactions in fact the assumption was all the transactions were illegitimate and just every feature of the software and every feature of the way it worked was was designed to meet the needs of criminals and allow them to move their proceeds more quickly and before law enforcement could intercept them huh interesting and before we turned to Alan for his background can you just explain how Bitcoin is different from those previous versions well you know Bitcoin like any new technology you know that is misper misappropriated by criminals Bitcoin was not created with criminals in mind Bitcoin was created with you've come changing the world in mind that the people who created person or people who created Bitcoin since it's still kind of a mystery I think were motivated by the financial crisis in 2008 and by a desire to empower people to not be entirely dependent on on banks and and I think that one of the ironies of the way Bitcoin is developed is that I think a lot of the people who were drawn to it early were drawn to it because it provided the the prospect of of this or in disintermediating banks and other large institutions when in fact banks and other large institutions have recognized the power both in Bitcoin and even more the blockchain which is the technology that underlies it so Bitcoin just like the internet was a technology of created to improve people's lives and and it will and just like the internet did dramatically improve people's lives as will the blockchain it's just that sometimes people who don't know a lot about it what they know they know because they've read in the paper about Silk Road or other kind of the criminal cases where criminals have gravitated to it also it's a fundamental truth that criminals are the earliest adopters of every new technology and they are drawn to technology that works for the same reason the rest of us are because it works because it's convenient because it's efficient and allows you to do things more quickly and and and so part of what companies in the Bitcoin blockchain space need to do and are doing through the blockchain alliance is educating law enforcement and law makers about the fact that the technology itself is it's incredibly valuable and will be incredibly impactful on society and on business and on government and that it shouldn't get painted with the same brush as the number of criminals who are misusing it for their own purposes okay yeah that's it's so interesting to hear this evolution alright so Alan um tell us about your background and how you got into blockchain so I was at the Department of Homeland Security I was there for about nine years and I served as an assistant secretary there for the last part of the time that I was there among other responsibilities I helped to coordinate cybercrime policy for the department so like Jason my first introduction to this space was through the use of virtual currencies for cybercrime but as I learned more about the technology both Bitcoin itself and also the underlying blotching and technology I became more and more interested and also convinced that this was a potentially transformative technology and so when I left government about 16 months ago it was an area that I wanted to stay involved with after my time in government I was lucky enough to come to Steptoe and Johnson and become colleagues with with Jason where we've been able to continue work in that area as Jason has described particularly with the blockchain a lot so helping to to kind of continue to help our government colleagues understand and better use the technology okay so let's dive a little bit more into the blockchain Alliance what does the organization do so the blockchain Alliance Laura is a coalition of about 20 now more than 25 companies and organizations on the industry side and the consits of today is exactly 25 law enforcement agencies both in the United States and overseas and the blockchain alliance was created to establish a forum for dialogue between the public and private sector about digital technologies and about the blockchain and also to provide a mechanism for industry to work proactively to educate enforcement agencies both in the US and abroad about this technology back in the 1990's when the internet was was first gaining commercial use as I said before like any new technology it had actually begun being exploited by criminals especially child child pornographers and other criminals or even earlier and in the mid-90s law enforcement reached out to industry and asked industry for help in understanding how this new technology works that they could improve their ability to go after the criminals who had already figured out how to use it and the Alliance is roughly modeled after that same effort that occurred in the 90s the critical difference here is that the Alliance was created by industry that industry reached out to law enforcement to offer help not the other way around and we were fortunate to team up with Coyne Center and with the chamber digital commerce who are the two leading advocacy groups in Washington for digital currencies in the blockchain and together with those two organizations we created the Alliance to provide this function and so what we what our goals are to protect public safety of course because we're improving the ability of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute crime that involves digital currencies and we're promoting the growth of the industry at the same time because at the end of the day if we can make the people who enforce the laws anxious about the technology and more comfortable with it we will also make the people who write the laws less anxious and more comfortable with it and so who are your members and what role do they play in the organization so we have as Jason said over two dozen industry members and then we engage with over two dozen government partners and so our industry members really span the range of Bitcoin and blockchain companies we have Bitcoin infrastructure companies like bitfury exchanges like BitFenix bitstamp coinbase coin X it bit crackin noble markets wallets bit go and zap oh and blockchain we have payment processors and financial services infrastructure like bitnet or bitpay circle and ripple other participants in the ecosystem like bit peso which is a cross-border service provider in Africa it wage block net key and then the suite of analytics companies that provide analytic services to law enforcement and to financial institutions like block seer and chain alysus cipher trace elliptic and scry as well as the MIT Media Lab and then on the government side we have a range of different partners the US federal government law enforcement level we have the Department of Justice and several different United States Attorneys offices we have the FBI in the US Marshal Service the Secret Service US Immigration and Customs enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations the US Customs and Border Protection and the criminal investigation groups from both the IRS on the Food and Drug Administration from the regulator community we have been Sen the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the Securities and Exchange Commission at the state level we have the California Attorney General's Office the Texas Attorney General's Office the New York County District Attorney's Office it's the DA's office from Manhattan we also engage actively with Europol and Interpol and indirectly with the Australian Federal Police and the Commonwealth Secretariat well that's quite broad and and so what what do all the different members do you know the key thing that we try to do with our members and our partners is to encourage them to engage with each other and so we begin with and our foundational activities are simply monthly calls that allow these participants to engage with one another ideally we want to be responsive to the needs of both industry and government and so in addition to the cause what we try to do there is to draw out issues of current concern or a future concern and then we put on informational webinars on different subjects and again these are on subjects that our government partners might identify as areas of concern or that our industry members might identify as as issues that we want to present on and so that includes everything from basic blockchain 101 webinars to more in-depth information about blockchain analytics were mixers and tumblers and other anonymizing techniques or wallets and exchanges the different players in the in the in the Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem and these are presentations done by industry for law enforcement and regulators to help increase the education and knowledge level and to surmount challenges that that come up from time to time and can you dive into the mixers and tumblers a little bit more for people who don't know what they are sure so mixers and tumblers and other types of tools are mechanisms by which people try to more fully anonymize their transactions using Bitcoin and so this would be mechanisms by which you can take Bitcoin that you hold in a wallet of your own and run it through different services sometimes in the in the clear web sometimes in the dark web that seek to obfuscate where the coins come from and seek to obfuscate where the coins are going and is that's something that law enforcement has been able to handle you know it is it is one of the categories of ongoing concern that we that we hear from our law enforcement partners as concerns about whether it's the pseudonymity or the perception of anonymity that comes along with Bitcoin transactions generally or the emergence of newer techniques that are meant to help on the one hand ensure privacy associated with these types of transactions but that also can obfuscate origin and an eventual destination of Bitcoin involved in transactions and Jason did you want to add something I was going to say that the the educational programs that Alan mentioned that we've done have been the curriculum for those has actually been designed by law enforcement what we have done on behalf of industry is gone to law enforcement and ask them what are the things you are most concerned about what are the topics you most want to be educated about and we've designed these webinars to meet those needs we've now you know we've done four of them so far in the eight months or so that we've been active and we've reached over four or five hundred law enforcement officers I think is just just about five hundred actually law enforcement officers and regulators from over 15 countries around the world and as Alan alluded to the concern that all of them have even as they get more educated and they learn more about the technology continues to be this question of of anonymity or really the better way to say it is attribution because one of the misperceptions about Bitcoin is that it's anonymous it's not anonymous but it does take some understanding and some skill and some technology to be able to do the investigative work necessary to connect a Bitcoin address or a wallet identifier with a human being and how did the Alliance get started well the Alliance got started in part because as I studied Bitcoin and as I said it was was focused on the how different Bitcoin was then criminal currents truly criminal guarantees one of the things that occurred to me was that this reputational issue that big point had the fact that you know the random person on the street or the random person in my house if you ask him about Bitcoin the first thing they're gonna say if they know anything about it all is Silk Road that that revenue issue was not just an annoyance to industry but it could actually be a real impediment to industry that they could interfere with adoption by the public it could interfere with the development of applications for the technology it can interfere with investment and it certainly could interfere with the legal regulatory environment and so I had the opportunity to go to the I know you and Alan went to the second Necker Island summit this year I had the opportunity to go to the one the previous year and during conversations with a cross-section of investors and entrepreneurs and and representatives of various Bitcoin and blockchain companies one of the things I pitched them on was that they should do a modern version of what I described before as having happened in the 90s with the internet that that it was in all of their interest collectively even if there were competitors it was in all of their interest as an industry to reach out proactively to law enforcement and do the kind of engagement and education and relationship building that Alan and I are describing and the response was enthusiastic overwhelmingly enthusiastic and so when I got back from the island we Alan and I together with coin Center and the chamber of digital commerce undertook the process of putting that idea into action and we're thrilled by the fact that not only were the companies enthusiastic about participating but long for the law enforcement agencies we reached out to were as well and we started we started relatively small we had about 20 members or participants between government and industry and now as out said we've got over 50 in just a very short period of time and I think that speaks to the you know the the determination of the industry to make this happen and the power of the idea and I think the shared goal of both law enforcement and industry of having this be a technology that can thrive and and to create an atmosphere where innovation can take place without compromising public safety and what has the attitude of regulators been toward digital currencies in blockchain and how has that evolved over time well it's funny I think that that the attitude of regulators towards digital currencies and blockchain initially was ha but we've we've seen that evolved dramatically over time I think it's interesting you've had a several regulatory agencies really study the technology with an end towards determining how it fits into their existing regulatory regimes and so some of the earlier earlier actions were by FinCEN determining who and the ecosystem is and is not a money services business you had the IRS coming forward and determining that that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies would be treated as property under their regulatory regime as opposed to currency more recently other Commodity Futures Trading Commission come forward with decisions as to how they're or its regulatory regime would apply to not only to virtual currency but to companies participating in the ecosystem so that's been one category of activities you've also had different states step forward the most well-known I think is is New York State with its bit license so you have states like New York on one hand that have actively sought to learn about the technology and then in different ways sought to apply regulatory regimes to the technology of other states who have simply said that this technology is not covered by our current regulatory regime you have a third category of regulates regulators who are in a sense leaving aside the questions of the technology itself and looking more closely at how is this technology being used in ways that are harmful to the public or harmful to investors in ways that other technologies are so you've seen the Securities and Exchange Commission identify Ponzi schemes that are using Bitcoin or other types of virtual currencies it's not to say they are making a clear distinction between a statement on the technology itself but rather when people use the technology for for malicious ends then you have a number of other regulators who have adopted a wait-and-see attitude and who are actively looking at technology or in many cases just saying he can to learn more about the technology so that they can understand either how it best fits within their regulatory regimes or how their regimes will have to evolve to account for the new technology what our regulators concerns now we've seen a range of activity that might catch their attention there's criminal activity around paying with Bitcoin around Ramson ransoms being demanded in Bitcoin and then there's also instances where it's not clear whether a law was broken such as the DAO hack where decentralized autonomous organization was created that was essentially a venture fund that was written in computer code and then somebody hacked the or exploited a loophole in that computer code to steal money from it so where where are the regulators focused now well I think from a law enforcement point of view the primary concern is I mean ransomware is obviously a very big concern right now although ransomware I would point out is not a Bitcoin problem ransomware is a cybercrime problem the hackers who were using ransomware - you know inflict harm on their victims happen to be using digital currencies and in this case Bitcoin as the method of payment but ransomware was a problem won't before anybody knew what bitcoin was and and the solution to ransomware is also not about Bitcoin the solution or - ransomware is the same taking the same steps that protects people from other types of hacking activity which is to practice good cyber hygiene and to take all the steps that providers and the government encourage people to take in protecting their personal or the corporate systems to keep them safe from from malware I think that the the pervasive concern of enforcement agencies and it's been true since Bitcoin first gained public consciousness and it will be true even with the work that we're doing the Alliance is this question of attribution that they're I think through the work that the Alliance is doing and our companies are doing to provide education I think the law enforcement agencies are getting a better and better sense that bitcoin is not that you know as I often say reports of bitcoins anonymity are greatly exaggerated and that in fact you can pierce that anonymity one of the things that I try to view and what I talk to law enforcement audiences is get them to put this problem in historical context the reality is from pagers to burner cell phones the email to online chat to mobile devices law enforcement consistently has had to evolve as new technology that's designed for legitimate purposes is used to facilitate crime and in any type of electronic crime and really if this applies to every type of crime facilitated using the Internet the problem law enforcement faces above all is attribution and what cops and prosecutors call putting fingers at the keyboard you have to take a series of letters and numbers and characters whether it's an Internet chat name or an IP address or a MAC address or even an email address and tie back to a particular human being and when on the internet that person uses tor or proxy servers or other anonymizing techniques or in the Bitcoin blockchain space when they use mixers and tumblers that makes that work harder for law enforcement but it doesn't the problem is not insurmountable and and law enforcement works tirelessly to overcome those challenges in in traditional internet crime and they are getting better and better at doing it when it comes to Bitcoin and blockchain based crime the solution often lies in taking data from multiple sources and trying to combine that data to figure out who the particular bad actor is and so Bitcoin to the extent it presents an attribution or anonymity problem it's really just the newest twist on a problem law enforcement has been solving in the internet space for two decades now what part of what we try to through industry teach law enforcement is that there are particular advantages that the blockchain and Bitcoin have for law enforcement that the internet and other technologies do not that the ledger the blockchain ledger that records all of the Bitcoin transactions is a permanent ledger it's not going anywhere so you're not dependent on the data retention practices of a provider because the data is always going to be there it's also traceable so once you learn how to read it and how to use it it's kind of like the matrix when you just see a bunch of numbers and when you learn what you're looking at you can see the shapes and the colors when we when they learn how to use the shape how to read the shapes and colors that data is traceable and so once you identify who your bad actor is you can trace back all of that person's transactions through all of their accounts through the beginning of time and that data is also publicly accessible so in an era where law enforcement is facing increasing challenges to their legal authority to get data that's stored overseas they don't have that problem here because the data is publicly available through anyone with an internet connection and so there are there are technological advantages and there are legal advantages to law enforcement from this technology and part of our challenges is to teach them that so that they are less anxious about it you know I think that with respect to the dau and Alan can speak to this as well because he's done a lot of thinking and studying of this topic I think one of the concerns that regulators have in particular is that the innovation gets out ahead of ahead of anybody else and that before you could at the blink of an eye that you know that there's a new innovation that creates some sort of consumer protection risk or other kind of risk to the public that no one's thought about or that regulators haven't had a chance to take a breath and think about before it's already broadly adopted and I think that the pace of innovation in this space is such that and will continue to be such that that that's going to be just an ongoing problem so the Dow is a very recent phenomenon and it's really at the cutting edge of this technology you know aetherium was only launched about a year ago and it has this really powerful smart contract capability and the Dow really showed just how powerful that could be and yet you know obviously there was a loophole and the code that was exploited there was you know more than about 50 million dollars that was stolen you know through through that loophole where our regulators focused now when when they look at things like this and how might they handle these kinds of situations I think that Dow the Dow itself as well as the Dow hack the speed at which the Dow emerged from the etherium ecosystem and then the speed at which the what we'll call the hack occurred I think presents both a challenge to the regulatory agencies but also a demonstration of the speed at which that regulators and others are going to work in order to try to keep up with developments in this ecosystem because of course the Dow's creation itself raises all sorts of questions about is this a corporation is this a general or a limited partnership is to crowdfunding exercise is it a venture capital exercise or venture capital firm as you as you mentioned and the dow tokens which people could buy with ether you know did that represent a security was that a commodity a derivative what was it did it does its characterization change depending on whether you're exercising voting rights or not whether it's sold through the primary offering or through secondary offerings through exchanges and so each of those questions is a novel legal issue in and of itself for different regulatory agencies to try to untangle the additional question of when someone goes in and exploits an element of the code in order to remove money that wasn't theirs you know this raises the question of whether as I think the the doubt creators represented the code is the law or is this a question that that necessarily falls under either the criminal or civil laws of a range of different jurisdictions and I think that regulators are still trying to parse through those questions and piece together what's the most appropriate response but again it's not an issue in isolation these types of issues and these types of challenges are going to continue to present themselves and they're going to present a challenge both in understanding what is the law today and how might it apply to those types of situations but so what should government policy be squirts these types of innovations tomorrow and down the road and and how should government policy or policymaking regulation and even the law itself need to change or adjust to account for this kind of technology and so can you help them build these solutions or answer these questions and if so how are you doing that well I think this is one of those things that you know a range of participants in the ecosystem need to look at for our part with respect to the Alliance we are starting with some educational programming webinars on other types of both digital currencies and blockchains to introduce law enforcement or regulators to Theorem and to the particular type of ecosystem that's set up there a public blockchain but as you mentioned optimized towards smart contracts to again is the first thing that that we try to do within the Alliance is just to raise the levels of awareness and help to spread knowledge and education within law enforcement and regulatory agencies there are extremely smart people within each of these agencies working on these questions but they are complicated questions and there's always a need to to bring the general knowledge level up and so that's one of the key things that we try to do within the Alliance is to help our government partners kind of raise that awareness across their organizations about these issues and what next steps do you have planned for the Alliance in general well you know a lot of it will depend on the needs of the law enforcement agencies and the regulator's that we have on board and that we bring on board as I said before we very much want the programming that we do and the education we provide to be responsive to what their needs are based on what they're seeing in the cases they're investigating and the challenges they're having in those investigations but first and foremost our goal is to continue to grow as I said before we've grown from about 20 to over 50 participants in a very short period of time we have a number of pending requests from national prosecutor and police agencies in a number of countries in Europe who are looking to join and we certainly welcome their participation and look forward to having them join because this is really a global phenomenon and it's one with global implications and to the extent that we can educate law enforcement and regulators all over the world about it at the same time that certainly not only serves the public's needs but very much serves the needs of Industry so we're going to continue to do that one of the things that we have found as one of the most gratifying things about what the work we've been doing is that in addition to building relationships between regulators and enforcement agencies in industry we're building trust that through the work that our companies are doing and our organizations are doing with law enforcement we think it is much less likely that the companies participating the Alliance will get painted with the same brush as the criminals that may be misusing the technology and I think one of the things that for the enforcement agencies and the regulatory agencies that are participating in the Alliance one of the things I think has been a real eye-opener for them is just how seriously the companies in this space take compliance and take security and safety and consumer protection and that these are companies that are run by grownups who have a sense of social responsibility and they're not just good corporations they're good corporate citizens as well so we want to continue to spread that message let's also talk about your work with blockchain at Steptoe today your firm has an announcement about how the your practice is changing what are your plans well Laura over the past two and a half years at Allan and I and our College depth of advise just about every type of participant in the blockchain ecosystem investors entrepreneurs early-stage companies exchanges trading firms transaction processors even retailers who are studying acceptance of digital currencies and of course through the Alliance we are proud of the fact that we've been part of the foundation of the industry and we've been helping through the Alliance lead the effort to spread the word about the almost limitless potential applications for blockchain technology and now that message is taking hold I don't think you can pick up a publication or log on to the Wall Street Journal or Forbes and and see not see articles about the blockchain and so as we move into the next phase of the public's understanding of the application for the blockchain Steptoe is actually reorganizing itself to better prepare our clients president future in a variety of industries for the application the blocks into their businesses and operations the way I like to think of it is that we have been counseled to blockchain companies and now we are going to be counseled to companies impacted by the blockchain so we have put together a sprawling full-fledged multidisciplinary blockchain team that encompasses expertise from a wide variety of practice areas in industries that we know are now being impacted by the blockchain that certainly will in the years to come so we have representation from our energy transportation insurance financial services international regular regulation and compliance you know intellectual property corporate international trade government contracts government affairs tax cyber and government enforcement practices among others and we've got because this is global we've got people not just in the United States but from our London and Brussels and Beijing offices as well and so we think that having this multidisciplinary team will be of tremendous value to our clients in all those industries I mentioned and others as they study how the blockchain will impact their business and how the blockchain can be adapted by them to achieve their business and economic goals and why did you decide to build a blockchain practice well it's it has become clear to us as I said you know we are focused for the last two-and-a-half years or so has been on being part of the foundation of the blockchain industry so a lot of the entities and individuals we've advised have been startups and and as I said entrepreneurs and investors and companies that are developing applications for the blockchain as you know that that work has taken hold and it's become clear to us that the blockchain is going to be the second Internet it's going to be the internet of value and will have the same transformative effect on a wide variety of industries that the Internet did and so in order to best position our clients to be prepared for the coming second Internet and to be able to get out in front of the technology and understand at a very early stage how it will impact their business and how best to adapt it the best way to do that would be to bring all that expertise together so we're really gratified that the leadership of Steptoe saw that shared that vision and and supported us in putting this team together so we've got it just a tremendous range of expertise in a wide variety of industries that we think were well positioned to help our clients as I said our current clients in our future clients as they think more and more about how the blockchain will impact their business and and you know it's it's a combination at this stage of both legal and strategic advice you know some of the advice is legal understanding how laws and regulations apply to to their business and and how the blockchain would change that some of the work is trying to do policy work to try to improve the legal and regulatory environment some of it is simply strategic and educational making sure that companies in a variety of industries understand the different ways in which this technology could impact them and helping them as they begin to think about how to respond to that and overall how do you see the whole ecosystem developing and what role do you think lawyers need to play in that development so I think it's interesting you know we see a number of different tracks along with which kind of the ecosystem is going to continue to evolve obviously we as we've been discussing along for a lot of today we do see a continued evolution of the kind of the public Bitcoin blockchain ecosystem with a network of companies transacting currency transactions but also an emerging number of different applications along those lines some of the key issues that we see in that area are helping that ecosystem of companies establish relationships with traditional banking organizations and continuing to develop out along along those lines and of course not to bury a lead but as as part of that ecosystem and as part of our creation of this practice we will begin accepting legal fees in Bitcoin for companies that wish to pay in that way it's an important part of the firm and of demonstrating its commitment to the to the ecosystem but that's obviously not the only place where we see this the this ecosystem evolving as Jason said you know as more and more companies look at the adoption of blockchain technology this whole range of legal policy and strategic issues that emerge and I think over the last few months there's really been an explosion of interest not just in public or Bitcoin blockchain applications but also in private or permission block chains whether that's in looking to compliment or replace back-end systems for financial services or other types of applications so whether a company is looking at the Bitcoin blockchain whether they're looking at at a another type of public blockchain like aetherium or at private or permissioned block chains there are a range of questions that companies need to ask themselves about how to adopt or adapt to this type of technology again what the legal regimes apply to that type of application today what questions are still unanswered what steps need to be taken how to think about transitioning to to a different type of technology or intersecting with different types of companies and in all of these instances it's again not only a question of understanding current law but also about the need to shape policy to shape new guidance and interpretations of existing law existing regulations to go through and even initiate new rule makings or other regulatory process is to help adapt regulatory regimes to this type of new technology and in some instance is actually going ahead and making efforts to work with with government work with lawmakers to change laws to make the the overall legal regime fit into a world in which this technology becomes more ubiquitous and what do you think of some I guess ideas I've heard in the air that lawyers will have a really important role to play around smart contracts and that they may need to even understand code to some extent in order to help prevent situations like the Dow hack I mean in a sense lawyers have to evolve along with the technology lawyers absolutely need to understand the technology but there are many technologists who understand the technology what lawyers what the rule that lawyers have traditionally played in the place in which lawyers can offer I think the most value in the ecosystem is not just again understanding the law but understanding how the technology and how the different applications of technologies fit together under not only the legal regime that the policy policy regime as well so whether we're looking at smart contracts as they apply to digital rights management and intellectual property or as they apply to insurance contracts or leases there's a lot of work to be done in understanding the technology itself understanding how the technology is being applied in a particular situation understanding how the current law would apply to that and how it's meant to apply to those types of situations and then being able to walk through what areas are unknown how would would interpretations need to change how would policy need to adjust or how may it be that a company or a group of companies or where an entire industry needs to go to go and initiate the processes that would be necessary in order to evolve legal interpretation evolve regulatory regimes of all flaws to adapt to the new technology you know Laura my first day of contracts class in law school my first semester of law school that the book might as well have been written in code for all that I understand but I think that that you know it's right at the end of the day a lawyer doesn't necessarily need to become a coder but a lawyer needs to become conversant and have a basic ability to converse in the technology and really have an understanding of how the code plays out in the real world so I think you'll have lawyers in really any area in which contracts are relevant which is pretty much any area have to become a little more literate in what the impact of various types of code are and I think you know just as you have litigation and disputes over contract language you may see litigation of disputes over what code means well this has been a fascinating discussion Jason where can our listeners find more of your work or contact you in the future well the anyone
