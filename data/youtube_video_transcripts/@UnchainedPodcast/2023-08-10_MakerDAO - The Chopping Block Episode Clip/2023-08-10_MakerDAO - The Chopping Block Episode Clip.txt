are going to learn from this there was another interesting experiment in defy that just took place this week which was with maker Dow so maker Dao their stable coin is called die there's this yield that dye pays out called the die savings rate the idea is that if you lock up your die into this vehicle call it which is the die savings rate you can earn a yield just by just passively sitting on your die there's a few other kind of cute things like chai which basically allows you to tokenize a die that's sitting in the die savings rate but basically the dice savings rate for the last however long has not been very popular because the amount of yield that the die savings rate was paying was very low I believe it was like what one percent or sub one percent for a while and they recently started jacking up that rate so that rate the treasuries obviously now are north of five percent the die savings rate was up to was it like two to three percent it's like 3.3 and then recently they started jacking it out the web to eight percent um about like a week ago or a few days ago and that's kind of what uh caused this entire sort of uh situation now I guess with the DSR Yeah so basically there's this uh there's this thing called the enhanced die savings rate the edsr and edsr is this experiment to what happens if we jack up the interest rate on die to eight percent uh now that is a that's that's a that's a rate that's sort of at the margin as more people start depositing and very quickly you had I think over half a billion dollars of diamond did uh so they could capture the yield in the in the edsr um that yield has come down significantly now it's uh I think closer to five percent um as opposed to eight but the my understanding of this experiment was it was it was a way to kind of see if we offer more yield to borrowers what is the elasticity of demand such that you know how much more Capital are we going to get into the protocol and more diamond and potentially more liquidity created for our sample coin uh just by offering you know a relatively small amount of yield that we don't have to pay for a super long period of time uh and so I think this is in a way die uh maker dot kind of experimenting and trying to model out what happens if we start offering one element of the end game plan for maker now which is this in a big master plan that involves potentially yield farming uh if we start offering additional yield or juicing the die yield uh what's going to happen to the dye Supply and how can we model that out and it seems like maker is sort of poking and trying to see what happens if we do this and if we do if we do this we want to make sure that we're being intelligent about how much we're spending on on the yield and attracting more deposits and trying to make a play at becoming this super stable Point let's say any thoughts on what Maker's doing here well I think if they really want to go for it they should just you know take anchors 18 interest rate and start there because eight percent I mean yeah that's not going to get you the 40 billion dollars of stable coins well the difference is that anchor guaranteed 18 regardless of utilization which is completely insane a maker was only offering this for the marginal dollar and as more people came in the yield went down of course it's slightly facetious yes but but just to be clear for the audience because I think a lot of people would hear that be like oh [ __ ] yeah it is it is very true that one thing I've realized being encrypted for the last five years is there are still lots of people I talk to who don't know the difference between usdc dye and UST and they're all just like oh they're all stable Clans all bad all good there's no like there's no Nuance to like splitting the splitting them into good basket bad basket um so yeah it is it is kind of funny I think the idea of doing these elasticity experiments is interesting although I think this one was kind of obvious that it was going to be dominated by large players because the the key metric is the spread between borrowing against your die versus sort of minting new dye so the idea is like hey look if I can borrow die and pay three percent but then I can earn and then I can use that to create new die and earn eight percent there's this five percent spread and I can recursively do that a bunch of times I think the end games goals are were not necessarily to like reward the largest holders but of course just structurally such incentives generally tend to to be harder to capture for the smaller users so it's interesting to see they're already like kind of changing and you know we'll see what the the outcome of this experiment is yeah it feels kind of like a wash like um basically the amount of dye in circulation went up by almost exactly the amount of incremental dye that was added to the DSR so it was definitely like two inside of these whales who come in see this carry trade where you can borrow a diet three four percent uh you know deposit it and then or eight percent and like you can just leave it it's I think the idea is not wrong right it's sort of like um you know a bank offering like an inductory rate that obviously it goes way after a period of time but it's not really having the intended outcome of like actually introducing um you know meaningful incremental demand for for dye um and and sort of people actually being able to treat this like a you know a savings account in some way yeah it does appear like the financialization of dye is mostly going to appeal to Smart Traders we're going to arbit away pretty quick that said it it did I don't know if this was the intended effect but it did get a lot of eyeballs with the headlines of oh my God dye is offering eight percent I don't know if that's good or bad because I think for most people it's pretty obvious that that's a negative interest rate margin for die I mean for some people they might be like oh man maybe I should start paying more attention to the maker dialogue system I think for some people it's like oh God I guess we've been learning lessons from 2021 so I I'm a little bit mixed about like whether even just like the headline of you know whether or not it's a short-lived experiment the headline of die is offering eight percent now on uh in the DSR is actually good or bad net for defy yeah I I agree I think a lot of people have PTSD to like uh Tara and an anchor and every time you say stable coin or any yield related to a stable coin uh the the kind of uh flashback to that um I think like like the DSR is also I think kind of strange like like die you know the end goal is right you want this to be an actual currency that is accepted that people use that they save in that they you know engage in Commerce in um and that's really only possible if it's liquid people actually use it and it's it's out in the world and there's there's demand for it yeah with the DSR yeah they have chai which is sort of this like um wrapper on top of the DSR that creates a tokenized version of your deposit but the die in the DSR like isn't out there in the world right like if all the die we're in the DSR it wouldn't really be a very good stable coin because it would just be locked in this contract and not really tradable and if you sort of split it between chai and die then they're not really you know liquid either and so I I understand sort of the incentive but I think from a from a product perspective it's just not super usable it doesn't have the right ergonomics for what I think uh maker is trying to trying to do with it it seems like the DSR is it's kind of like the um the risk-free rate or something in defy where if the DSR increases it kind of forces interest rates everywhere to follow in lockstep so it is I mean it's not literally risk-free for obvious reasons I mean it's tied to a particular D5 protocol um but it seems to have that effect in some way on the yields in across D5 and it's interesting because I haven't thought about this very much I'm curious Robert if you how you think about this but here to Tom's point if you raise if you raise the rates of the VSR right they're basically kind of incentivizes people to create die but then kind of lock it up so essentially just like lock up ether or lock up you know whatever they're minting die with uscc whatever um and just have it sit there and do nothing whereas if you just instead lowered the interest rate on vaults you kind of have the same effect but you increase the the circulating die instead of increasing the amount of collateral that's just sitting there doing nothing so why would you want to increase the DSR and not just lower the interest rate on vaults well I think you could like I think at the end of the day what they're creating is a system in which you know interest passes from those who are borrowing to those who own the asset and it really should be the same roughly to increase the interest rate that you're paying or lower the interest rate that you're charging to get to the same equilibrium supply and demand Dynamics uh roughly but I think in this case like because the savings room is so low it just makes more sense to start on that side one tiny thing to note in that regard is uh interest rates are strictly positive numbers and so they're sort of uh going down has slightly higher you could think of as higher weight than going up if you have equip probable ups and downs partially this comes from the fact that sort of like the geometric mean is less than the arithmetic mean but maybe that's too much of the In The Weeds on this but the idea is like when I'm looking at things that are ratios and I can only go to zero like zero is a point of infinity and Infinity's like I'm always a finite distance from zero but I'm always an infinite distance from the maximum possible rate so I'm sort of like biased uh and so that sort of means that your lever going down which is sort of the The Collection rate is like less effective than the increase rate in some way it's like less elastic uh which is why you might see the experiment behave better by doing you know increase the interest rate paid by 10 versus decrease the borrower caused by 10 it's it's unfortunately this like tiny there is some tiny bias to those two but the technical detail yeah is this um Monet Supply who's uh involved in maker governance which talks about this sometimes of like you know there's sort of this mental model of how we think maker works out we think D5 works of Market is very efficient capital is very fluid uh people move to um you know normalize rates across different venues in practice like people it's actually not that um elastic when you when you actually adjust interest rates like a lot of people still stick around they don't even realize that the rates are moving like there's there's a lot of lag and it's not quite as responsive as you would imagine it would be in like a truly sort of efficient optimal market so um maybe some some evidence to turin's point but we just need more AIS involved in this process who are making all these decisions for us instead of human beings well I hear I hear the AI hype has taken a summer vacation a little bit is that right at least that's what the the the API and Views numbers
