new data economy start building your next idea on the oasis network today's guest is neha narula director of the digital currency initiative at the mit media lab welcome neja hey laura good to see you this week on wednesday the crypto council for innovation in conjunction with arc invest square and paradigm held the b word virtual conference at which you were a moderator what was your main takeaway from the event uh i think my main takeaway was that the bitcoin ecosystem is alive and thriving there are a lot of people and companies and technologists who are very excited about it and are focused on it so i think um overall it was a really successful event and i really enjoyed it so the main conference panel was one that featured kathy wood of arkhanvest elon musk of tesla and jack dorsey of square and also twitter and when asked about the bitcoin block size which is a debate that's sort of like over and yet not over elon musk said the reality is the average person is not going to run a bitcoin node and then referring to the year in which the bitcoin software code was written he said in 2008 there was still a non-trivial number of people on modems and he said he felt the block size could be increased without affecting the decentralization of the network because technology has improved so much since 2008 i think this is antithetical to what some of the bitcoin community believes what's your take on these comments yeah that's a great question laura i remember hearing that and he i think one of the things he said as well was i like to run things in reverse so let's think about decreasing the block size what what would that be like and um actually there are some people who want to do that so it was really funny that he sort of posed it as a as a ludicrous idea you know i think fundamentally you know you have to think from first principles the fact of the matter is that you know copying all of this data to everyone's computer and verifying it on everyone's computer you just can't do that with too much data so i think the really important thing to note here is that you have to look at trend lines and sort of you know how things work in the limit and the fact of the matter is that we can't just keep increasing the block size as we go it's entirely possible and you know that it that it could be increased today i think i don't think that you know there are very many people who disagree with that technically i think it's more about the um the governance model and sort of who gets to decide that and under what circumstances it's decided and what is the upgrade path for something like to like that to happen you know if i think back to 2015 2016 2017 when we were having this conversation the first time around that was really um the debate i think that a lot of people didn't understand that it wasn't about the exact number it was about the method by which that upgrade happens so you know i think it could be raised a little bit but the fact of the matter is putting everything on the blockchain is a bad idea and we're gonna have to figure out sooner or later how to do things off chain or it's just not going to scale i mean we saw ethereum go through go through this right so um you know i remember back when the the plan was sharding right and now um now it's all about roll-ups and i think you know what you realize is you just can't put and verify everything that's on the chain so when you come at it from that perspective you know whether the limit a good block size is one megabytes or four or eight it's it's just a number and you have to realize that our hope is that the demand is going to outstrip whatever number we pick so we better start preparing for that right now yeah i i found how he posed um what would you know what would it be like to make the block size smaller i found that interesting because yes since some people do want it and he clearly thought that was a ridiculous idea i thought that was kind of a funny moment so elon in the beginning kind of like danced a little bit around environmental issues i felt when it came to bitcoin and basically if i kind of was reading his comments it seems like you know he supports bitcoin and then as an afterthought in the beginning he sort of was like oh i have to mention these environmental coffeehouse due to tesla's position but then when he was asked directly about it he basically said he would want to do more due diligence on bitcoin to confirm that the amount of renewable energy usage is at or above 50 before tesla would adopt bitcoin transactions again as we all know tesla has bought what at the time of purchase was 1.5 billion dollars worth of bitcoin and it still is holding the bitcoin on its balance sheet so what do you make of his comments is it do you think that this is a serious concern of his or is it more like a pr play or something else yeah that's a that's a really good question um you know i can't i can't sort of presume to know what he's thinking but i do think we suffer from a serious lack of data and that's starting to change the past few months people have actually started measuring uh really well you know how much green energy is used to produce bitcoin which is which is really important i think that we have to do more measurement in this area and we have to really surface the data and understand what kind of energy is being used and what the climate impact of that is and then people can make their own decisions there are a lot of washing machines in the world and i'm sure that they use a lot of energy in aggregate but we don't tell people well because washing machines use so much energy we you just can't use them we weigh the balance of how much value we think that thing brings to society and then decide whether it's worth the energy cost and the really interesting thing about bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies is that that trade-off is made really obvious the amount of hash rate that will go into bitcoin is exactly the reward that comes out of mining bitcoin and so what that means is that the higher the bitcoin price the hot the more hash rate that's going to go into it that doesn't necessarily mean more climate impact i want to be very careful about that but it is kind of a way of showing that the energy use is proportional to how much people value it now you might ask do people really understand the climate impact and um you know do would they would they be as interested in bitcoin if they really understood it and i think that's what's unfolding right now which is a good thing because it's forcing everyone to think about well what is the climate impact and are we really okay with it or not i think another really important piece of information that's missing from this debate and where people like me can can contribute is around exactly what the security guarantees are that we're getting from proof-of-work this is you know you've probably participated in proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake debates uh so many times and i think that we still don't really have the right language and models to characterize the security guarantees of proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake they're clearly different but we don't really have the language to completely explain exactly how they're different and quantify you know the security trade-off if there is one so that's another place where i think um we can we hope to find more data and and to sort of have a more productive informed debate yeah and about the data for the renewable energy aspect i feel like it's going to take a while because there's this major shift happening in the network and where the miners are located and so we're kind of not going to really know where a lot of the hash rates coming from anyway for like six to nine months and then after that it's going to take a while to figure out what what is the renewable energy mix now and so yeah maybe like in two years we might know yeah i feel like this conversation is making the incentives go in the right direction so that's positive and hopefully in you know two years it shakes out and it turns out it's really high yes hopefully so elon also talked about how he holds dogecoin and he was talking about how it was a reverend and it has great memes and how he loves dogs and how he loves how dogecoin doesn't take it itself too seriously and then he gave a twist on occam's razor saying that the most ironic outcome or the most entertaining outcome are the most likely ones and he thought it would be great if the crypto that started as a joke and was meant to make fun of crypto became the biggest one so these were kind of unusual remarks for someone at a bitcoin conference do you think that dogecoin could become a serious cryptocurrency laura i'm really bad at predicting this stuff um i'm not very i'm not really so up on investing or predicting prices and things like that you know i uh i think i don't know how many nodes there are in the in the dogecoin network i don't know how robust it is but definitely security um and thinking about the attack surface and vulnerabilities and bugs and things like that and my understanding is that there weren't really a lot of people contributing to the dogecoin code base applying patches running nodes monitoring the network things like that so um i'm honestly i'm kind of amazed that it's that it's stood up this long and i wonder if it's just because there isn't anybody sort of bothering trying to attack it so that would be really interesting to see but i think you know in the long term the true value of this technology is that it operates in a really decentralized adversarial environment and that means it needs to be really really secure and well written and um you know if if there's no developers maintaining it then i would not be very i wouldn't have a lot of confidence that that it is uh very secure but i don't know i'm not exactly sure what's going on i don't track dogecoin very carefully the technical development you know one of the panels that i was on at b word was about security and i just think that's so critically important and we we need to have more of a discussion about that as well yeah i think we're going to have to see now that apparently elon is working with them and with all the meme stock mania and wall street vets and everything pushing up dogecoin like i guess there's incentives there well but is it decentralized you know elon can't just hire a bunch of developers and have them build it because um if it does get really big then you know there's a small group of developers who can someone can go to them and say hey this thing's happening on your network i want you to shut it down right that's the question i guess but that might take some time to shake out right right but i also meant like if the price goes up that might incentivize people to start working on it yeah very true very very true who knows all right in a moment we're going to discuss um squares plans for bitcoin but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible designed for the next generation of blockchain the oasis network is the first privacy-enabled blockchain platform for open finance and a responsible data economy combined with its high throughput and secure architecture the oasis network is able to power private scalable d5 revolutionizing

conference recently announced that square would be building a bitcoin hardware wallet and that the company would also be creating a new business to foster decentralized finance on bitcoin um by creating an open developer platform a number of ethereum people made fun of the announcement saying that this already existed in d5 what do you think is jack just trying to build something that already exists uh no i don't think he's trying to build something that already exists because it doesn't exist on bitcoin and they're very different coins with very different properties and communities and supporters so um you know i think you know one of the one of the parts of that hardware announcement was building something for mainstream users and i think that is so important uh and that this area really needs a lot more development and research in in user research and how can we you know everyone talks about how the um the great thing about this technology is you know it could help with financial inclusion that you don't need a bank account you it's open to anyone but you know where's the data showing who's actually using it and where's the data showing how to actually build tools that really make it open to everyone because everyone's not going to run a full node or understand how to store their private keys securely and i think it's part of our job as technologists to help build tools that help them do that because i'm really not excited about a solution where all the bitcoin in the world is held on you know 10 exchanges and it's all custodial that's that's really not the revolution that i signed up for and so that means that we have to solve this challenge of you know educating people but also building tools that work for them and so it was really exciting to see that emphasis in the open hardware uh announcement um and uh you know i hope we're hoping to do more work in this area as well invest in user research especially for underprivileged populations to find out where we can make the biggest difference um with respect to diva on bitcoin i mean i think ethereum has shown that this is a really exciting area and it's much much easier for developers to build applications on ethereum it's pretty challenging to build secure applications on top of bitcoin and huge kudos to all the people who have been able to do that but i think the idea of building you know seeing what works from ethereum and bringing it over to bitcoin is a great idea oh interesting okay yeah we'll see because you know now we've got thor chain making it possible to to transact in between chains without using wrapped coins so who knows although maybe that could be connective tissue all right so bitcoin mining is undergoing a big shift as we alluded to earlier it's been leaving china in a big way and as those miners go offline the bitcoin mining hash rate has also dropped quite a bit you know by more than half actually over the course of a few months although recently there has been a little bit of a rebound so what do you think is the significance of this decrease in the bitcoin hash rate yeah so i i mean i think you know short term um it's it's not that big of an issue the the network can adjust blocks might come out slower for a little while but um that's the beauty of the difficulty adjustment algorithm uh sort of in the long term and more abstractly and theoretically i think it's really interesting to think about i i love to think about how things can break so i love to think about all the ways that things can go wrong um and you know half the hashrate going online is uh is you know is is pretty juicy in terms of thinking about ways things could go wrong now whether that will actually happen or not is a completely different story it seems very unlikely but um certainly it's uh it's it's interesting to think about what that might mean and how that hashrate could be used um if someone wanted to use it in an adversarial way uh that said it it seems like it's pretty difficult to to mount that kind of attack on bitcoin at this point in time so um what we see with the hash rate is that i think drops though they do you know reduce the underlying security of the blockchain um it's also the case that we're not really sure yet how much hash rate is enough so to speak we're still kind of trying to figure that out and understand exactly what kind of security guarantees we get for hashrate um there's been some really interesting work uh by economists and we did some work as well showing that uh maybe it's the case because you can think about sort of the game theory behind it you can think about the threat of counter-attacking that uh it might incentives might be lined up to just kind of go with whatever the the longest chain is even if even if an attacker has 51 of the hash rate so um you know i don't think it's it it really has much effect in the short term but i think the long term questions and uh sort of the theoretical questions are really interesting so bitcoin recently became legal tender in el salvador and that was a little bit controversial because president naive buchelli's has a link to has links to corruption and he also has some authoritarian proclivities how do you think this association with el salvador will affect the perception of bitcoin uh well it certainly generated a lot of press and excitement you know i'm just really curious about the details uh how who's gonna custody the bitcoin will people be able to custody it themselves you know who's gonna run wallets who's gonna run bitcoin full nodes i think you know i i haven't seen a lot of details on on this um and i think you know it's one thing to say that something's legal tender and then it's another thing to actually do the work of uh making sure that people can access it fairly um and safely so uh so i think we'll have to see how that shakes out yeah i did see something like only 45 of salvadorans have access to the internet so that's also an issue yeah that doesn't that doesn't seem like it's gonna be a good environment to take off so um yeah it seems a little bit more like pr so the digital currency initiative worked with the fed of boston on a paper or some kind of work to determine whether a central bank digital currency could be possible here in the us and i realize you probably can't say exactly what it says but just tell us what are your thoughts about a us digital currency yeah so um we're working with the federal reserve bank of boston and we're studying the question of how you might design and build and test a hypothetical digital currency so a couple things first of all it's technology research so we're not engaging in the policy discussion which i think is really important and deserves a lot of attention and research but we're really looking at it from the perspective of you know what how might you build one uh how might you make it perform really well what are some of the trade-offs how do you think about security and fault tolerance and redundancy and in particular we want to surface data for policy makers they're just there's too many people out there who are just kind of running these very unrealistic sort of you know three node dlt setups or something like that and that's just that's not how this is going to work if it ever happens it's not clear to me that it's necessarily a good idea either we're still we're still gathering all of the data on that and we're trying to understand um but i i have to say it's really exciting and i think it's a really exciting question to research i also think um you know unfortunately there's this false narrative out there that it's either cbdc or crypto and people are often quite shocked when they find out that uh we work with the federal reserve bank of boston and we also support several you know really important developers on bitcoin and we spend a lot of time working on bitcoin and thinking about the security of decentralized networks it really does make sense to us though because we're just really excited about the future of money and the future of cash in the future of value transfer and whether that innovation is happening in the cryptocurrency world or you know it can't just happen in the cryptocurrency world it's if fiat currencies are still such a big part of everyone's lives that i think we need to figure out how to bring that innovation to fiat currency as well um and i think that doing so will strengthen the cryptocurrency world can you imagine if uh if you know something like the the dollar actually did get launched as a digital currency that would put wallets in the hands of so many people and uh would teach them so much about the technology so yeah i don't really see these things in competition at all i think that they they um they will co-exist and there's use cases for both yeah yeah i agree it'll be a huge on-ramp essentially um so last question what are the main things you're working on at the digital currency initiative that the audience should look out for in the short term yeah well um the upcoming research with the federal reserve bank of boston on central bank digital currency we're really excited about that the technical research in addition to that we recently announced that we had raised some funding for a dedicated bitcoin security initiative so um this is a an effort where we are dedicating resources to thinking about the longevity of bitcoin so dci has been a home for bitcoin core developers for gosh six years now so we have provided a stable home for for example the lead maintainer of bitcoin and uh i think that's really important you know there's a lot of people out there who are giving grants which is fantastic but whether or not that's a long-term solution for senior developers is another question and uh there are people who like to say that you basically have to get a phd in bitcoin in order to really get to the level where you are trusted to do code review and you can do code review on some of the thornier parts of the system uh and so you know i was as i've been learning more about it this past few years and thinking about it it just seemed to me like there needed to be really be this dedicated effort towards the longevity of the system and the security and it's also just a fascinating question bitcoin's been around for 12 years and so a lot of people say look it hasn't been hacked it's been 12 years and there's certainly some truth to that um it's definitely you know security first but i also don't know if it's really been tested you know what happens if a nation state really comes after bitcoin in a you know in you know drops a couple zero days and you know how will the network recover and like i said i really like to think about how things will break so part of this effort is to figure out how we can secure it against something like that from a technical point of view and uh you know what are the the problems that arise and and what kinds of um you know what do we need to put in place and to be clear there's already a tremendous amount happening across the bitcoin ecosystem in this area and we hope to encourage that and plug into some of that all right well sounds like there's a lot of interesting stuff coming up for you thank you so much for coming out unconfirmed yeah thanks laura it was great to see you again don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break

week's news recap first headline gensler speaks on synthetic assets as the fed discusses stable coins in a conversation with the american bar association securities and exchange commission chair gary gensler hinted that digital assets backed by traditional securities could fall under u.s securities law gensler said quote it doesn't matter whether it's a stock token a stable value token backed by securities or any other virtual product that provides synthetic exposure to underlying securities these platforms whether in the decentralized or centralized finance space are implicated by the securities laws and must work within our securities regime his speech occurred just days after binance announced the suspension of its stock token program which had allowed customers to purchase tokenized versions of tesla coinbase microstrategy microsoft and apple the sec was not the only us regulator looking into digital assets this week notably the president's working group for financial markets a presidential advisory group met on monday at the behest of u.s treasury secretary janet yellen to discuss quote the rapid growth of digital assets according to a readout published after the meeting the pwg expects to issue stablecoin related recommendations in the coming months covering potential benefits risks and how stable coins could fit into the us regulatory framework and speaking of staple coins next headline circle reveals reserves and paxos snaps back on tuesday circle the company behind usdc the second largest stable coin in circulation released its latest reserve attestation revealing how ustc is backed based on data from mid july 61 of usdc is backed by cash or cash equivalents 13 is in the form of yankee cds 12 percent sit in u.s treasuries commercial paperbacks nine percent and five percent of the reserve's allocation is in corporate bonds if those numbers are confusing don't worry even decrypts jeff roberts needed clarification asking on twitter finance people is it a big deal that circles usdc reserves are 14 non-cash equivalents someone told me these aren't liquid enough to withstand a run on the stablecoin but i really don't know paxos gave an answer in a downright frothy blog post on wednesday which started with a shot across the bow at circle dan bernstein general counsel and chief compliance officer at paxos wrote quote i have been reading with a combination of disbelief and exasperation the recent claims by circle that quote ustc has become the world's most trusted and regulated dollar digital currency neither usdc nor tether is a regulated digital asset for the simple reason that neither token has a regulator these tokens are backed by illiquid and risky debt obligations a critical weakness that no prudential regulator would allow to exist as this creates undue risk for their customers bernstein contrasted usdc's 61 cash or cash equivalent reserves and usdt's 49.6 commercial papal reserves to that of pax and busd both of which are managed by paxos in which he described as regulated stable coins tied directly to the value of the us dollar pacs and busd are backed by 96 cash and cash equivalents before signing off he added regulatory oversight is important because it assures stablecoin users that the dollars underlying their stablecoins are secure and will be immediately available when they want them to round out a hectic week on stablecoins tethers general counsel went on cnbc's tech check and announced that an official audit of usdt the largest stablecoin could be months away tether has spoken of producing an audit since 2017. next headline new jersey alabama and texas regulators warned blockfy on monday evening reforms reported the new jersey bureau of securities ordered crypto
