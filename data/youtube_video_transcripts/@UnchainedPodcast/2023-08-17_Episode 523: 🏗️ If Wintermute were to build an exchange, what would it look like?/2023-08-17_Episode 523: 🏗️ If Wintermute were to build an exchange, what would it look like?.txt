if you were to build an exchange that would be much more similar to CMEs and to binance coinbase like I think it would be focused much more on the matching engine and basically like the central clearing part basically stripping away all like kyc ml for retail people stripping away managing leverage stripping away like all the horrible things about driving your own centralized exchange on crypto and just making it much more see me like and basically focusing on one hand and it's like what this BF try to do with FTX like making this Central clearing run a very efficient cross-marginine kind of like engine and on the other hands kind of like Improvement on CME side it would be basically running on the stable coins instead of Fiat so that you can do settlement Cycles faster and if you can do settlement Cycles faster you effectively can extend more leverage to the clearing members as a result
