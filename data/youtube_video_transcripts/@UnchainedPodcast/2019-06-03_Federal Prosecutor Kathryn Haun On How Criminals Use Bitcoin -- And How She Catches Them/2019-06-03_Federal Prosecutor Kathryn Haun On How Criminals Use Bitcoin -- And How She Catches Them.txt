welcome to forbs podcasts hi everyone welcome to Unchained a forbs podcast produced by fractal recording I'm your host Laura Shen a Forbes contributor covering blockchain cryptocurrencies and FinTech thanks for tuning in if you've been listening to the show unlike what you've been hearing please review rate and subscribe to Unchained on iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts it helps get the word out about the show just a heads up that this is the final episode of season 1 but please check back in 2017 for season 2 for today's episode I'm speaking with Kathryn Hahn who is the assistant US attorney and digital currency coordinator for the US Department of Justice in San Francisco and who also teaches Stanford Law School's first class on digital currency and cybercrime Katherine is also the prosecutor who put away the DEA and Secret Service agents investigating the darknet Silk Road marketplace who tried to make off with more than eight hundred thousand dollars in stolen Bitcoin she's here speaking with us in her personal capacity and not official capacity today welcome to the show Kathryn thanks for having me Laura tell me about what you do how you can to be a federal prosecutor and how FinTech cybercrime and privacy became your areas of specialty well now I specialize in the areas that you just mentioned FinTech cybercrime privacy but about over a decade ago when I began as a prosecutor in the Washington DC area that's not what I did I worked Cartel cases and national security matters and then some time ago I moved back here out back here to California and my focus really became organized crime prison gangs and murders so that's kind of when I came back out to California and then some time ago I decided well we're here in Silicon Valley why not focus on emerging technologies that are so at the heart of our culture here and so that's what I did starting about three years ago and that's how I ended up specializing in some of the areas that you just mentioned and so does that mean like you chose cases like those or I did initially I started working on some of the Bitcoin the early Bitcoin cases and of course that led me to some of the darknet cases and more cybercrime cybersecurity matters and how did you even learn about that area or come and be interested in it well I'll never forget in about 2012 I was sitting in my office and someone came to me in my office and said how would you like to prosecute Bitcoin and at that time I really hadn't heard about it this was 2012 now of course we can all laugh now because now that we understand what it is we know that it's not a thing you can't prosecute Bitcoin of course I guess it's kind of like saying how would you like to prosecute cash but back in 2012 when we were just learning about the technology that wasn't clear so that's how I first heard about it and came to learn about it that's hilarious so how did you come to realize that you can't prosecute Bitcoin well I quickly figured that that out like I said it would be like prosecuting cash which just is not a thing it's not possible so as soon as I delved in and started learning what it was that became immediately apparent rather of course what we could prosecute were some of the criminal uses involving Bitcoin just like we do some of the criminal uses involving cash or checks or PayPal or any other kind of scheme and so what were some of those early cases well some of the early cases were ones you would expect kind of involving darknet marketplaces you've also mentioned one about the agents that were involved on one of the task force's dedicated to looking at the Silk Road yeah so tell me more about that like what was going on there and what were they investigating and then how did you come to realize that they were part of the problem well so the case that you're referring to involves two federal agents who have since pled guilty but at the time we didn't know that of course we didn't know it involved two federal agents we just knew that we got a tip about one and it might seem strange but actually it was an investigative journalist kind of someone who is in more your line of work that came to me that persons since become a lawyer and he came to me in my office and said I want to give you a tip I smell a rat and I think you ought to investigate this but of course realize that when someone from the public just comes to you to give you a tip and especially when the tip is you've got a dirty agent on your payroll you know I had to take it with a grain of salt to be quite honest with you I felt that it was I needed to look into it but more look into it to kind of put this what I'll call rumor to rest and so when I started looking into this matter and investigating it I was doing it for the perm the perspective of oh I want to clear this person's name but I quickly learned that that wasn't going to be the result so how did you investigate that well you know at the beginning like I said it's a bit of a sensitive thing to look into a federal agent especially when you don't really have anything more than a tip we need to be really careful about that and so we looked at some publicly available sources and we did what I'll call a very high-level review and that high-level review really quickly showed us that this particular individual was liquidating hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin a month Laura you mentioned eight hundred thousand in the beginning but actually the number was far greater than that because it was eight hundred thousand from the Silk Road but of course the criminal conduct in this case was not limited just to the Silk Road but to many others in the world out there as well so once we saw that the volume was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and the way it was being moved around we knew there was something more nefarious afoot and that's when I did more of a deeper dive so what exactly was he doing he was investigating these and then just transferring the Bitcoin to his own personal account or well in some cases I mean I'm stepping away from the Silk Road aspect this also by the way was the lead undercover agent communicating with Ross Ulbricht almost on a daily basis for years so he was very involved in that Silk Road case at least the Baltimore case not the New York case investigation that was going on at the time but he was literally going around to different exchanges alerting them that they had criminal proceeds on their exchanges and that he'd be seizing them and then those funds would make their way back to his own personal accounts Wow and so have you learned to read the blockchain or like how do you you know dive into all the technical details which I'm sure you're not exact trained in I wasn't trained in it you're right but you know like any kind of thing that were involved in investigating or prosecuting you have to learn to get up to speed on a new area of technology or a new area of law it's no different than when I was in an expert in motorcycle gangs I had to learn about what all of the symbols meant you know and how the those structures were organized so to here I didn't know about the blockchain I needed to learn about how it worked and so I really have to give the credit to the agents that I was working with I was working with some federal agents many of whom are not in the San Francisco area but who are throughout the country at this point and they're really some of the government specialists in this and they helped me discover how one could go use the blockchain to trace transactions transactions of value using things like wallet Explorer for example and so I would not say I'm an expert in the technical aspect of blockchain analysis but I was able to learn how to go on and and trace transactions so when you're unraveling a crime that involves Bitcoin how does that compare to doing the same for a different for a traditional type of crime well let me talk about first how it would be similar to investigating another crime and then I'll talk about how it would be different I mean the similarities are that in most any crime you can follow the money and so that's simply what we did here or what we're doing when we're investigating a crime involving the use of criminal use of Bitcoin we're following the money another things that we would do in common is we would get typically an email search warrant or search warrant for communications facilities cell phones like I mentioned emails so those are some of the similarities but then there are also some differences and some of the differences are things like anonymizing technologies that are being used I mean things like tor or I 2p in the case of the agents that we were talking about one of the things that was different in that case is these were the perfect criminals I mean they knew how to cover their tracks like almost no one else that we've investigated they were able to use their agent status to unwittingly get company to alter evidence unwittingly of course they were able to use burn bags and shred evidence and get rid of kind of covering their tracks but what they really couldn't escape from was that immutable and permanent record of blockchain and so that actually came in very handy to us in unraveling this yeah and so that's something we didn't discuss um you got the tip about the one but then how did you figure out that there were actually two well actually it was from the blockchain and here's how we knew that the first agent the DEA agent had been liquidating hundreds of thousands of bitcoins we trace those bitcoins back to the Silk Road it turns out that that agent had also been extorting Ross Ulbricht his target under us a name moniker he was using was death from above and then separate from that he was also using another moniker french-made to actually sell Ross Ulbricht information into the government's case so we knew about those sources of bitcoins that this agent had had obtained there was then a theft from Silk Road vendor accounts of 21,000 Bitcoin and for those of your listeners who obviously are following Bitcoin in the price that's a lot of money 21,000 Bitcoin and we knew it had disappeared from Silk Road vendor accounts using a Silk Road administrators username credentials and password so of course many people are involved in our investigation believed well it's got to be the DEA agent because he had access to all of those things or it's got to be the Silk Road administrator himself but what we could see from the blockchain is that the patterns of this DEA agent did not match the patterns of the person who had stolen the 21,000 Bitcoin we could just look at the blockchain and see that the modus operandi what we call in law the signature was different and by that you mean just the accounts were different or likely how do you define that not only the accounts but kind of the pattern of where the funds would flow for example the DEA agent used numerous hops numerous different wallets and was really moving things around kind of every three days two different addresses and different wallets on the system and only after you know about a month or more would he liquidate those through his digital currency he was basically trying to kind of like obfuscate okay cry see the other one the other was kind of one fail swoop I'm generalizing of course but one fell swoop into Mount GOx which as you know is the now-defunct digital currency exchange that was based in Japan and so it was kind of all into one place and then all out of that place all out of that place curiously just two days before the feds did a seizure warrant on Mount GOx which also made us think that timing is very odd it was it someone who knew that mount GOx accounts were assumed to be seized by the federal government so we could really see the patterns were different and that did tell us we think we might be dealing with more than one rogue actor Oh interesting so he is not one of those people that lost his funds in the amount gods no he actually got them out before before the feds seized the mount Cox bank accounts and also before the hacks and so what happened was these funds were transferred out of mount GOx and using the blockchain we could see that they were transferred to ultimately a shell company a shell companies bank account here in the US and imagine our surprise when we used other investigative methods to uncover who owned that shell company and it was revealed that it was a Secret Service agent who had also been on that same Baltimore Silk Road task force and do you know those people personally well I I prosecuted them so I do now okay but before you didn't I did not okay no okay no they were agents based on the East Coast right so I hadn't come into contact apparently we had been at some of the government's meetings on these kind of new technologies but I had never met them personally okay and I'm just curious also about this transition that you made to you know learning more about mint I can prosecuting crimes in this area how does it compare to other stuff that you've you know prosecuted before like in terms of maybe your own interest or the what kind of like intellectual you know richness of it hmm well I mean I think I always really had the fire in the belly about violent crime to me just violent criminals were always the ones that kind of got me fired up to go do my job everyday and a job that I was passionate about because I felt like they're hurting other people directly and I never really and I never really honestly Laura thought I would get that same kind of passion for doing what we might call more white color or cybercrime cases or even public corruption because what we're talking about really is a public corruption case but I have to say these cases at the end of the day it's particularly the one that we're talking about I was every bit as motivated to kind of find out whodunit and to make sure that that wrongdoing was brought to justice as I was for many of my other cases involving more violent crime so I I think that's how I would contrast them I mean obviously I guess the other difference is well that's a similarity a difference would be just in the kind of technologies that we're using to catch some of the darknet purveyors for example or you know large-scale vendors say of those selling machine guns on the darknet and those individuals are very smart they know how to cover their tracks they know about tor they know about anonymizing technologies they know about how they can best remain anonymous whereas some of the kind of criminals that I've prosecuted over the years and kind of prison gangs or street crime bank robberies you know they're not trying to cover their tracks so much just just get out of town but they do leave a paper trail a lot more or at least they leave a forensic trail I guess a lot more than some of these criminals involved in using financial technologies and the like yesu speaking of trying to hide your trail there you know has been increasing use of tumblers and mixers that make it difficult to track exactly where bitcoins that are involved in illicit we end up so I'm curious to know how that's affected your work and you know if you're still able to follow the trail well there was a lot of talk about tumblers and mixers maybe a year or two ago and certainly they existed and initially we thought oh no this is really going to end our trail if you will it won't be possible to keep following the funds but the truth of it is Laura those tumblers and mixers were early technologies and they weren't frankly all that great they didn't tumble and mix as well as I think they advertised in some cases so I'll just say that some of the time we were able fortunately to unscramble if you will what the tumbler a mixer had done now that was only in my opinion that was only because it was early days of tumbler and mixer technology and they do think that now times have changed and they've changed quickly and so tumblers and mixers I think going forward are going to be a real problem for us to do that on scrambling but that said I don't think we can just give up because we come into a tumbler mixer we have to at least try and see if there is a way to continue to follow the funds and at some point it might be that the technologies behind tumblers and mixers are so good and so foolproof that the trail will end for us hmm ok well that's maybe not as optimistic of a view as one might hope for from a prosecutor but you know it is true that we've seen you know huge advances in this technology in a short time so I was curious to know if there are any overall trends that you've noticed in the crimes that are committed with cryptocurrency versus those that are not like are they you know different in any particular way well as I alluded to earlier the one thing that does kind of stand out is the use of other technologies like tor or like i2p also kind of these I don't know what I to P is oh the invisible Internet project think of it as another version of Tor The Onion Router it has less kind of what I'll call market cap right now still tor is much more heavily used but I to P is kind of catching up a bit and so when those are used then that just means like you again that the trail goes cold for you I wouldn't say the trail goes cold just for the use of Tor I mean you know tor is not perfect obviously I'm interestingly you know tor was developed as you probably know by the government the United States government but of course it makes it much more difficult I mean the whole purpose of things like tor or I to pee are to mask IP addresses another thing that I think I see trends as you asked for those using crypto currencies to commit crimes would be using kind of non-traditional email providers so email providers based for example in Russia and not using a gmail address or not using an Apple email address I'm also use of kind of messaging apps not whatsapp for example but using instead telegram which I've never even heard of and telegram is getting a lot of notoriety because of some of the kind of terrorist uses of terror of telegram telegram is in theory an application where you can essentially instant message but then the messages are are not kept or stored they're gone oh so it's sort of like snapchat but not for teens exactly why do you think they're using these email providers in Russia and stuff like what why well I think I mean we saw that actually getting back to the case you asked me about the Secret Service agent is a great example of that he and talk about different patterns and how we knew we were talking about two different actors we thought the DEA agent was still using kind of the hotmail email addresses the Secret Service agent to cover up his crimes was using you know Yandex in Russia I think the thinking here is well if the government gets a search warrant and they're not going to be able to serve it without a whole lot of headache on a Russian company on a company that's not here in the US it's much easier to go or at least it used to be much easier to go to Microsoft or Google and say here's a federal search warrant we've justified probable cause for getting this content than it is to to a Russian company oh wow I wouldn't even know how to get a Russian email address but I guess if you I'm not going to advertise that here on your show either so in general how quickly would you say that we're seeing criminals start to use cryptocurrency is the prevalence growing and if so like how quickly and you know would you say that's happening oh I think it's happening very quickly but I want to be clear I don't just think only criminals are using this right I think there are I mean I I actually know federal agents who have Bitcoin not and they're not doing it they're not having it to steal from they actually have it because they find it in interesting technology so I think that the I hope that the overwhelming uses are becoming more and more legitimate but you know like all great technologies I mean it starts out that criminals are often the first or the earliest adopters so I think we're still seeing that they're quickly using cryptocurrency and that's on the rise but at the same time it's also on the rise of kind of the population at large I think it's no different than just everything going digital right I mean you start out using cash you move to kind of checks and the credit card era then you move to the PayPal and the Apple pay era and then you're on to cryptocurrency I mean just like the public at large is moving in this direction so too are the criminals so I think it's rising very quickly well if you were a criminal which what would be your preferred you know a medium transaction well I certainly won't answer that question okay well I'm curious to know do you feel like um cash is still preferred by a lot of criminals oh I think it really depends on the crime I mean if you're talking about the need to move you know relatively little cash I think yes it is and if you're talking about a crime where it can take place like a transaction on the street absolutely because we know that that's not trackable or traceable then you run other risks though of your meeting person-to-person but where you're talking about kind of large-scale criminal activity or fraud it's just not feasible to make the cash payments okay yeah and I guess also if it's like happening cross-border exactly right when you look at some of the crimes that you commonly see and not just with cryptocurrency but you know just across the board what are some of the ways that you think blockchain technology could help you prevent those well I think one of the interesting I think use cases and I don't know that it actually is a use case yet it might just be being tested but is in the area of Public Records for example of all of the kinds of cases and I said this a couple weeks ago but of all of the cases that I've ever done whether you're talking about the Hells Angels or whether you're talking about marriage fraud or whether you're talking about the bank officer I prosecuted for impersonating dead people I mean or whether you're talking about some of the criminals that I've prosecuted and using cryptocurrency they all have one thing in common there's all been always been somewhere along the way a forged counterfeit or stolen public document and they all have that in common even a murder case I I tried same thing it had a forged public document and so I think one of the interesting use cases for blockchain is to kind of help prevent crime or rather help stop fraud let's just call it that help stop fraud in the first place is could public records be issued on a blockchain and I think that's a very interesting thing to explore let's take the case of birth certificates for example did you know Laura that in the United States alone over 6500 different entities issue birth certificates oh my god using over 14,000 different forms and that's just in this country so you can imagine that it's extremely easy to counterfeit or create forged birth certificate I mean people can't even recognize what a forgery is because we're using 14,000 different forms and have 6500 different entities issuing them and you might think well what can you really do with the forged birth certificate well a lot we call these in law enforcement we call these breeder documents and because they quite literally breed new identities let me tell you how you get a forged or a fake or stolen birth certificate in a name and you take that down to the DMV and you get your photo taken with that and now you all of a sudden have also a driver's license you take the driver's license in the birth certificate to the passport office now you've got yourself a passport and all of a sudden with these three kind of identity documents you the sky's the limit on what kind of criminal activity you can do you could file for fraudulent benefits from the government you could commit some kind of terrorist offense you could purchase weapons you could traffic in people you can obviously commit drug smuggling I mean really this guy like I said the sky unfortunately is the limit and so it's a real problem having stolen the ability to kind of steal or counterfeit a birth certificate quite so easily and you know don't take my word for it I mean the Department of Health and Human Services some time ago sounded the alarm when their Inspector General wrote a pretty scathing report on the prevalence of this kind of fraud happening with birth certificates and you can go look that up online to see what I'm talking about if your listeners are interested that's absolutely terrifying to listen to just how easy it is to do that um when you think about implementing that kind of solution that I just I also think of tons of obstacles you know kind of what do you imagine will happen as we're starting to see I mean governments are taking an interest in it but do you have a sense of like where it might first be applied or how it might roll out well first of all let's talk about the problem that it would be trying to solve so one problem is I just alluded to it be trying to solve forgeries or fakes right at the end of the day these centralized databases spit out for us a paper document and you know sitting here going into 2017 it just doesn't really make sense anymore to have that be a paper document particularly where as I said they're so easy to forge so that's one problem the forgery but another problem with some of the centralized databases right now that the municipalities and the governments have for maintaining these public records are they're subject to tamp Frank and I think that's a concern also because for example in 2008 here in San Francisco I don't know if you you were possibly not here at the time but the city of San Francisco's network administrator became disgruntled after getting some poor performance reviews and he changed all of the other engineers passwords and he literally held the entire city of San Francisco's computer systems and databases hostage for five full days no one had access to those documents so anyone needing a city document during that time was out of luck but that's crazy yeah don't mess with the IT guy all right that was the lesson there but he the the point I'm making is that kind of tampering where you have a centralized database as possible so the problems are fraud with paper documents and tampering with centralized databases people are looking to the blockchain is possibly solving those because one it's no longer a decentralized database right you have it spread out over millions of different systems worldwide so the possibilities for tampering I don't want to say they're none as a prosecutor I would never say none but let's say significantly reduced and very difficult to tamper with decentralized systems and then also you don't have the possibility for fraud because you're not printing out a paper record because of the immutability and the permanence one can simply look to the fact of that blockchain to prove that you know was a bait we did a hospital writer record to the blockchain when a particular child was born and I know it's very early days but are there any pilots or kind of any initiatives that you know of that are sort of interesting to you in this realm in the public records realm I'm not actually I haven't looked into it too much none come immediately to mind I know that there are some pilots I I don't know what the MIT digital currency project is I think possibly involved in some of those I've heard about pilots in some of the countries involving not necessarily birth certificates but involving you know land titles I believe in Georgia Honduras I've heard is what I'm Sweden I think and of course we have Estonia as kind of a model of government right but to answer your question about what you know what would be some of the hurdles I think one hurdle is if we're looking at the United States look we've got 50 different states but I already told you that 6500 different entities can issue birth certificates in this country so I think it would be very interesting to have kind of a experiment with you know one state like let's start small let's have a small state start issuing as a pilot project first certificates on a blockchain and see how it works and then let's test it let's have people try and hack that and let's see if they can and so you're not saying oh let's move the entire country let's move everyone to this system all at once I think really start with a small pilot project start in a small jurisdiction and kind of see how it goes yeah yeah I think that's what we're seeing with a lot of these pilots these days so one thing we've been talking about a lot in this episode is the public Bitcoin blockchain but soon there will be some cryptocurrencies that are more private including one that's getting a lot of buzz called Z cash how well something like C cash which is effectively like a more private cryptocurrency how will that affect your work well I think Z cash is supposed to publicly launch next week at the end of October I think it was October 28th and if it works like it's supposed to it would make our work a lot harder now I say yes and that's if it works as it's supposed to because we don't really know yet if it lives up to the hype of being purely and truly anonymous but the thing that we do know is that it's a matter of when not if we have an anonymous kind of form of payment that the technology will catch up that we will someday have that I do believe that and I think that I don't know whether that's Z cash or whether that's some other form that comes out but I think that will make our work a lot harder because as I told you one of the main ways we can trace criminal activity is following the money right criminals want to be paid and if we all of a sudden omit an entire kind of source of evidence that's historically been available to us that's going to make our job a lot more difficult absolutely and so it is this the kind of thing where you know I like I know way back in the day some people talked about it like oh is the government got this shut Bitcoin down but you know then of course I think the government realized that actually the parching is really useful to them but in the case of Z cash which you know might have a different reputation is that something that either could be shut down or that the government might try to or well I just want to clarify I don't think the reason that the government didn't shut down Bitcoin was because the blockchain was useful to the government I think the reason is the government recognized you can't shut down Bitcoin I mean there's simply no way and and that's what we're seeing here is once that with these technologies when the genies out of the bottle you can't put it back in right and so even if the US government and it would require I think a kind of change in our laws and policies that society would you know inform that decision making but even if we could hold I think developers of these technologies accountable and right now generally speaking that's very hard to do it's very hard to say you've made a technology we will now prosecute you for making that technology that's really counter to our existing kind of legal system right now we're seeing this debate by the way not just in anonymizing technologies we're seeing this debate with gun manufacturers I mean there's I think there's some real analogs there you know our laws right now are such that we do not hold gun manufacturers liable for the harm that their product causes and I think at some point we as a society need to say at what point might we want to change those laws I don't know that we do and I'm not advocating that we do want to change them I'm just putting putting that out there as food for thought I hear a lot of times some of the developers creators of these anonymizing technologies say oh we're doing this for privacy we just want everyone to be able to have private transactions which I very much like and endorse on the other hand look it's obviously the case that a large percentage of criminals are also going to be using and gravitating toward those kind of technologies so at what point do you as a developer I mean is there a percentage that you're comfortable with as a developer of where your technologies are being used for more harm than good do you think about those questions I don't know the answer to that I don't know what's in the mind of some of the people that are creating this and I think there are a lot of as I've made clear very good uses and very legitimate uses for some of these technologies but I do worry about the effect that they will have on our ability to help solve crimes I mean you know ironically some of these very technologies come to us when they've been hacked when they've been the victim of a hack you know a tumblr or a mixer and all the funds are stolen well you know who do they turn to to kind of help if they help try and get their money back or put the wrongdoer behind bars and ironically some of these technologies or these developers are becoming sometimes victims twisting and you know it makes it hard for us to solve their crimes because of their technologies or the crimes that have afflicted them I should say so that's crossing so when an organization like that comes to you in that case where you know that they've kind of been making your job difficult like how does that you know affect the calculus of like whether or not you're gonna you know choose that case well I don't think I don't think that really would affect the calculus to be totally honest with you because I don't think that we are thinking that were adversaries with these technologists or developers quite quite the contrary I mean so I don't think it would affect whether or not we would take a case I'm just pointing out the irony that some of the exchanges over the years that have been hacked that have come to the government to seek assistance in solving the hack or getting back the money we're kind of I think originally not thinking they would be coming to the government for help but I don't think it would affect our calculus and whether or not we would take a case and and that's true not just in the space of technology technologies or cryptocurrencies it's true in any case right it's true in the cases of violence or assault or robberies I mean just because let me give you an analogue let's say kind of a bank robber who had prosecuted over the years actually I did have one who came back after he got out of prison and did another bank robbery let's say he was the victim of an assault and he came to me to report that I wouldn't not take that case because he had previously been in a posture that was adversarial to me and I think it might be a far-fetched analogy but I I think you get my point okay are there any other kind of like new frontiers in finding crimes in financial technology that you think are coming up or that are trending well I don't want to give anyone any ideas I think people up there know what they are who are using them already so I don't want to draw or highlight them as far as I know you recently gave a TED talk about some good uses of blockchain technology you know aside from the government records is there anything else that you want to highlight that you're excited about well I don't know how it will play out but I am excited about some of the pilot projects with respect to putting kind of sometimes private data maybe whether it's on to private blockchains or whether it's on public blockchains in an encrypted form in the case of for example something like medical records I mean we talked earlier about public records and birth certificates and people always say well aren't you concerned about privacy and I say well when I'm talking about public records I'm not concerned about privacy because those are public now let's talk about private data and if you want to talk about private data let's talk about for example your medical data you know Laura I don't think most people realize that their medical data is more valuable on the darknet far more valuable than their financial or credit card information and I don't think they realize that hackers are actively targeting the health sector did you know that over a hundred and fifty million breaches of patient records have already happened as a result of things that we've probably all heard of like the anthem breach and of course the anthem data wasn't even encrypted right and why is it that medical records are so much more valuable in the on these marketplaces it's a good question I mean a couple reasons one with medical data you can thieves can take that to create fictitious or fake IDs and bill insurers for fraudulent claims kind of on Moss they can also buy medical equipment and drugs that are consistent with a particular patient profile and avoid detection because the insurance companies or medical providers don't catch this because it's of course consistent with a particular patient's profile that they would be buying that medicine or that they would be buying that medical equipment and then they resell those whether on the black market or elsewhere and so there's a huge marketplace for that and like I said 150 million patient records have already been breached that's staggering and those are just the ones we know about that have been announced and we know that hackers are actively targeting the healthcare industry and part of this is because high-reward right I just said they can make a lot of money with this information but it's also some of the least secure right I mean hospitals and insurance companies and doctors offices and medical industry as a whole is more focused on patient care than cyber security really no compared to something like a bank exactly and also banks have been sometimes having to comply with certain kind of regulations that particularly apply to financial institutions which aren't really as much in effect or in force when you're talking about medical data of course there are things like HIPAA but in terms of securing the actual data this is a real problem where you have kind of some centralized databases that aren't that secure but that yet are so valuable the thieves so if thieves break in to us Chai's database as they did for example with anthem they can make off with everything so getting back to your question of some use cases that might be exciting I mean if it is the case and I don't know if it is but if it is the case that for example what some of the MIT researchers are exploring right now with putting private encrypted medical data onto some form of a block gene that's decentralized so you don't have a central repository for hackers to hit I think that's an exciting use case because I think that we're just starting to see how dangerous it is with having private medical data kind of in these not well guarded repositories that are central yeah and the other thing I was thinking is that you know with your financial data you can change your credit card number or you know but you can't change like your social security number you can't change your prescription you know these are all things that are really just central to you and they're also private right I mean how many people want thieves or being able to know what kind of medical treatment or procedures they've undergone those are incredibly sensitive pieces of information and another thing is we see ransomware providers and we see ransomware providers actively targeting two sectors the first is the healthcare sector and hospitals and the second is municipal governments things like police offices and so but if you go back to targeting hospitals and all of a sudden a ransomware provider can take an entire hospitals systems hostage and demand some kind of cryptocurrency for payment now right now if they've used blockchain and they haven't used tumblers and mixers we might have a fair chance at solving that crime but if these things achieve kind of perfection it perfect complete anonymity like tumblers and mixers and Z cash and a hospital system is taken siege will we ever be able to kind of uncover who is responsible for that I hope that we can up our game and use other investigative methods but at some level it's trying to you know we're prosecutors we can only use the tools that the public and society give us and that our laws give us and at some point we have to be able to solve crimes and prosecute crimes with two hands tied behind our back and say when this piece definitely the better solution would be to put the medical records on a blockchain that's secure and can't be hacked and that's not something that law enforcement is obviously going to mandate that's something that private industry that researchers that regulators I mean we all have to work out those things that's not in my area of specialty but I do think that where you're talking about private data like medical records it is really a problem yeah well this has been such a fascinating discussion where can people learn more about your work and get in touch with you well I would just direct them to the Justice Department's website which is a wws DOJ gov and you can see about not just my work but the work of the many prosecutors around the country in all of the districts are doing and you can visit kind of the cybercrime sections page on that website which is C sips back in C sips is a component of main justice at headquarters well thanks so much for coming on the show thank you so much for having me thanks for joining us today if you're interested in learning more about Katherine
