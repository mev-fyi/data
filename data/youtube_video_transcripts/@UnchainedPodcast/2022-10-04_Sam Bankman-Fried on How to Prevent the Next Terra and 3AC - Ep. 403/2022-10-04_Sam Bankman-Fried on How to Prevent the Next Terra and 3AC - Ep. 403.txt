hey y'all for this week's show I talked to Sam bigman freed founder and CEO of FTX who as I'm sure you're aware spends more time in Washington DC than most crypto entrepreneurs he had some surprising things to say about crypto regulation first he's actually pretty sanguine about the prospect for regulatory Clarity to come soon in the U.S second he also said and this was a big shocker to me that the implosions of three arrows capital and Tara haven't changed the conversation about crypto very much in Washington given that he's so active in talking to regulators and lawmakers plus a huge political donor I asked him a bit about his views on that how much of his giving is driven by his belief in effective altruism and how much of it is driven by his interest in helping the crypto industry grow what I enjoyed about this part of the conversation is the Nuance with which Sam spoke we also cover some of the big line top news in crypto the bear Market the merge stable coins Etc and I asked him about the vision for FTX as a centralized company in a decentralized space just FYI we recorded before news broke that he'd reached out to Elon Musk expressing interest in potentially buying Twitter as part of a joint effort and before FTX had won voyager's assets and before it was reported that FTX was considering purchasing celsius's assets however I've put links to all these developments in the show notes this was a super fun conversation and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did now on to the show hi everyone welcome to Unchained your no hype resource for all things

founder and CEO of FTX welcome Sam thanks for having me right now the crypto markets are in a major slump the total Global crypto markets are only a bit above where they were at the peak of the Ico craze in January 2018 and the day that we're recording Bitcoin is where it was at that time around nineteen thousand dollars and this is also true for ethereum which basically dropped hard after its very successful merge so I was wondering do you think is this the bottom or you know what do you think needs to happen to turn this bear market around yeah totally so you know the first thing is that it's going to be responsive to General macro environments and that's the position we're in and the big reason really is that you know what we're seeing driving Market is changes in interest rates which is leading to the strengthening and weakening of Fiat currencies and so whenever you have the dollar moving right if if the dollar strengthens it's going to strengthen against Exxon it's going to strengthen against Amazon and it's going to strengthen against Bitcoin and when you have a weekend you're going to see the inverse so because you know a lot of macro is being driven by moved in currencies that's going to move the sort of you know crypto prices installers so one sort of boring answer to the question is well you know if if markets go up probably crypto will go up if markets go down it'll go down but let's maybe factor that out for a second and sort of talk about you know relative to whatever happens to stock markets and from that perspective I think we've more or less stabilized you know we're not seeing sort of continuous outflows we're not seeing you know acute pain in the same way that we were for you know the week to month after sort of you know uh Tara Luna and the three arrows incident and and so things are in a little bit of a holding pattern and I I think the the sort of thing that I you know could potentially see on the horizon that would have the biggest impact um would be if we saw uh basically regulatory you know regulatory regimes Clarity and particularly in the United States regulatory regimes come out that sort of allowed the industry to operate um you know with Clarity in the country while protecting consumers that's been sort of the biggest white whale for years and I think we might be close wow wait for what type of legislation like something more sweeping or or just the stable coins aspect or what it's interesting it's a lot of aspects separately but at a similar time and so you know over the last you know let's say six to nine months all of a sudden after a whole lot of dormancy progress is starting being you know to be made on a lot of different fronts here um and so you have staff now Bozeman um which you know if that bill passed it would provide Clarity for uh non-security token spot markets um you have you know pretending pending actions from the SEC that might provide Clarity around spot markets for security tokens you have a stable coin bill which could provide you know a regulatory framework for stable coins um you have pending you know registration including artists with the cftc for crypto Futures and so sort of simultaneously each different piece of this is actually in line to potentially get clarity okay so I'm going to circle back to you in a little bit on policy because I have a number of questions about that but let's keep talking about these recent months because obviously it's been a historically unprecedented time in crypto as you mentioned it started with the Terra Luna collapse I wanted to know what's your takeaway from that debacle is it that's algorithmic stable coins will never work or that maybe it might have if they'd gotten the Bitcoin backstop in place or that the ecosystem wasn't decentralized enough or anchor had two heavy yields or something else entirely or all of it or what right so I mean there's a lot of things going on that all contributed at least a little bit to this that you know had impact on how much exactly there was a crash but you know let's just sort of the way I think about it really is I devised save points is kind of four different categories on the one hand you have fully 100 totally cleanly backed stable coins um you know this is like usdc usdp um you know tokens that are just backed one to one by the US dollar by treasuries in a U.S Bank account and those um you know if you're seeing a crash in those currencies something really bad has happened um because those should not ever have any volatility the second category is is if you look at things which are backed by you know kind of like debt instruments but like maybe not always exactly treasuries right um historically I think tether had been in that category although I think it's transitioning more to the first category when you see that you know I sort of think of that as being you know look in volatile times maybe it drops to 98 cents on the dollar right like maybe there's some worry that you know 10 of its portfolio has just dropped 20 in in value or something like that so you know maybe it's not perfectly tied to the dollar one to one but it's going to kind of wobble around that dollar so you know those first two the first version is sort of the optimal version from many perspectives the second version is a totally fine product now it should be properly disclosed like people should understand that there's a little bit of risk inherent in that um but but it's not like an inherently evil product or anything like that now you get to the third category and these are the sort of like traditional algorithmic stable coins things like maker not what maker is today which is largely backed by usdc um but but maybe everyone was backed entirely by ethereum let's say and you know that is um only somewhat stable um and you know what what I mean by that basically is well maker was supposed to be one to one to the dollar and the thing back in was that you could redeem it out for a dollar worth of ethereum and it's back like you know 1.3 of ethereum or something like that and so you know in a big market crash right if if during went down 50 right then you could see certain extreme cases make her ultimately being worth 60 cents on the dollar although you know in theory um you could be redeeming it along the way now it probably only would happen in extreme circumstances but Extreme times happen that is traditionally what algorithmic stable coins are and you know it's again I don't want to sort of give like a moral judgment on the product idea because it's kind of cool um but it should definitely have really  heavy disclaimers right because we're no longer talking about like a risk of two percent depiking right we're now saying in a really extreme case there might be a 20 D picking of of it and that's not what people are usually expecting when they see a stable coin right so okay so that that's sort of like traditional stable points and then you get to Luna and Luna is actually a bridge further um if you look at what Luna actually is it is well okay so you start out with a bunch of Luna tokens you know USD which are paid in theory went to the dollar and a common misconception is that they're backed by Terror tokens would you be sure as a maker model you're actually not backed by Terror tokens exactly they're backed by the ability to Mint new Terror tokens right if you were to redeem out Luna what happened is the treasures would go mint a bunch of Terror and give it to you and this is even less stable right because the problem with this is that it's not like they're sort of like a going Market well there was a going market price for Terra tokens right but that was with the old supply of Terra right when you redeem it that old Supply is not the new supply all of a sudden you're introducing new Terror and in fact in sort of a death spiral right you're hyperinflating Terror because as Tara Falls you need to make more and more terror tokens every time that you want to be um you know redeeming Luna and people are going to be redeeming more and more Luna and so that that that's the death spiral and and that's what can happen when you're dealing with something like Tara in particular um and and in fact that that is exactly what happened with Tara and Luna on the time of Crash and so that is again it's even less stable than a traditional algorithmic stable coin is and again without necessarily making a moral judgment on whether such a thing ought to have a right to exist um I you know that to say that it's volatile is an understatement that is the kind of thing that might go to zero to actual literal zero not just down 20 or something like that in a crash and and that is in fact what happened and so at the very least such a thing should be sort of backed by a really extreme number of disclaimers shall we say um you know and uh and and you really have to be holding yourself to a high standard to think that like that's the kind of thing that customers should understand um so okay as a backdrop Luna was always at risk of hyperinflation and you know that's what happened um and I uh it's not what people were expecting so you can say well was the yield too high on anchor like yeah it was that was definitely a problem there's not a good part of this story right um it exacerbated things there was already a problem there's always a potential problem there like that did make it worse like you know each one of these things does make it worse yeah so but do you think that type of algorithmic stablecoin could ever work or do you think that pretty much they're always going to end up with this downward spiral effect well it depends on could work I mean it it was kind of a cool thing right it's like a cool concept but it's super risky and I think it's always going to be super risky right you're not going to escape that part of it and so I think just like I just wouldn't even think of it as a stable coin like I don't know whether it's the kind of thing that like like if you wanted it to exist you would have to exist in such a way that was not really being granted as a stable point that it's being branded as an algorithmic weird kind of thing in  you know that was like not not all that stable and like you know it should be thought of as an investment not as a store of wealth that is you know kind of safe I like that weird kind of thingamajigger well we'll add that to the crypto uh dictionaries um so as you mentioned three arrows Capital also you know was a huge story these past few months and a lot of people were shocked of course to find out how much the firm had borrowed and then you know interestingly after the Meltdown there were a number of people that came out of the woodwork and said they'd seen red flags with three AC um but they hadn't spoken up uh one person noted that they had seen 3ac try to sell an equity investment by wildly inflating the valuation to prospective buyers someone else thought wait this is a multi-billion dollar fund why are they taking on a small investor of 20 million dollars it doesn't seem worth the hassle for you know a firm of that size I did also see you told New York Magazine that you now suspect The Firm even tried to pledge the same piece of collateral for multiple terms so what do you think the industry could do going forward so that people either more comfortable picking up about red flags or just to prevent this type of you know insane sort of borrowing happening again yeah it's a really good question and you know one more thing that a lot to this would is if you look at Voyager which ended up you know it's going through bankruptcy right now right it's going through bankruptcy because of unpaid debt from three hours Capital but if you look at when it took that debt on going through our restrict that dead on it was like three weeks before it's collapsed um so this is not like a very long running engagement this is like yet another thing that happened right before the end it probably not as a coincidence these are reminiscent to some extent of some of what you saw in 2008 you know where you basically have non-transparent systems and uh you know you have people who are putting on an amount of Leverage that was not well understood um and uh you know ultimately came back to bite them and so I think what I would say here is like you know that first of all one of the reasons that crypto wasn't hit harder for all of this um that that it didn't get even worse is that like it was uh you know despite all of these problems that were introduced by you know three hours when you looked at some of the core infrastructure in the space it was actually uniquely resilient to this right like on-chain protocols don't have this sort of problem because there's transparency about the borrowing and lending so that's one part of an answer here which is like you know crypto was sort of built in some ways to solve this and in some ways it was the parts of the ecosystem which were released crypto like um which came back to bite people here that's only a partial answer because that that is a piece of it you know having more transparency about around bars and Loans can be a piece of the answer here um having people better understand the risks that they're taking um when they put capital in something you don't like a voyager and I think Voyager is sort of a clean example of this where more or less they did exactly what they said they do like the core thing here is not that they you know were recklessly gambling customer Assets in a way no one anticipated they might even consider doing but that that there was quite a bit more of a risk to that ex you know semi-expected Behavior than I think their customers understood and so I think that like you know having disclosures having transparency they're having more diligence on the places that that are being lent to in this space I think all of those would help none of those are perfect there should be a big distinction made between that and like EQ staking uh which is a really different type of of you know thing that one could be doing to get yield yeah so at this time it looks like block five may be acquired by FTX um this is going to happen at a pittance compared to its previous valuation but now that FTX will be running a crypto lender how do you plan to manage risk so uh you know without explicitly commenting on on on you know whether that that that acquisition would happen you know what I'll say is you know we're working closely with the block by team on figuring out like what is an appropriate way to understand it and measure and manage risk here and I think there are a lot of things that that you can do that help quite a bit and I think that like you know one piece of this is you know understanding the nature of the counterparties another is Distributing the risk between many of them a big piece of this is taking actual collateral um and being careful about what that means right and and so like one thing that was sort of odd that came up in this whole process um around taking collateral is a lot of people thought that they had taken collateral from three arrows some of those had actually taken collateral others of those although they believed that they had um in fact they had um taken the same gbtc as collateral but six other people had taken and it was not really meaningfully their gbtc in any sense and uh and so that that's another piece of this having policies in place and and that's sort of like a sort of bland way of saying it but being ready to actually you know buy Margin Call people in in a hurry if that's what's necessary um I think all of those are pieces to you know managing it in a more sustainable way so as you just mentioned you uh are I mean we kind of veered in this direction about how um you know you think a lot about policy you spend a lot of time in Washington and I wondered um what effect you've seen these crypto collapses have on the opinion that lawmakers and Regulators have of crypto or how it's affected your conversations with them yeah so it's had surprisingly little impact on the conversations and the reason for that because that was not at all inevitable the reason for that is prior to you know this happening the conversations that we're having in DC were already centered around how can we bring regulatory oversight to the space like that was already the focus and you know when that's the focus well what's the right response to seeing you know these happen the right responses getting more regulatory oversight into space and and so I think that to a decent extent um you know as a space we're actually already working on the important things in DC and I think that's something that you know lawmakers are well aware of and you know at the end of the day I think the biggest response that we've get gotten from people is you know roughly speaking like yeah this probably just makes it if anything more urgent that we get some regulatory regime out um for crypto in the United States um and so I think it's added more impetus to the calls for you know regulatory oversight and Clarity you know from federal Regulators in a way that you know there had not been as much of before um which is all just to say that's had surprisingly little impact just given the nature of what the conversations were going in and earlier when you were talking about how the parts of the crypto universe that got wiped out were the ones that look the least crypto-like meaning they're more centralized they look more like the traditional financial institutions that went down during the GFC yep were you um seeing that Regulators understand that distinction as well or not or in lawmakers I would say like some do like I definitely wouldn't say that none of them do but I also think that you know I wouldn't say that this is like commonly understood I think is the kind of thing that like those who are particularly plugged into the crypto ecosystem in the policy space do um and those who are less plugged in don't so you know I would say a fraction but not a trivial fraction so you also have this proposal up with the cftc about changing the way that derivatives are traded are you also talking with Regulators about other hot button policy topics that the crypto Community is focused on such as the tornado cash sanctions slash privacy or how the SEC and cftc divide up regulating crypto or reporting requirements around self-custody Etc you know what else are you talking about with them yeah what we're talking about a bunch of things and you know to some extent this is when you give someone your number you should expect to get called and and we do and we're comfortable with that but yeah we're having a lot of conversations with lawmakers you know a lot of them are constructive and the core of it is basically like we won't be helpful any any way we can here and there are a bunch of places where lawmakers have pretty reasonable questions about how to think about the crypto ecosystem and so you know we've been talking with them through all of those and and and yeah I think it's been like super constructive I think it's been you know helpful that we've been doing it you know I I think that more than anything else it really is the case at like what lawmakers really want here is like straightforward constructive engagement you know that they they want to you know make sure that they're well informed they want to make sure they're having the important conversations that they don't mess this up that they sort of like make Intelligent Decisions um and so you know that's been sort of the core of how we've been thinking about this which is anything good that we have sort of information on you know we're happy to engage on with with lawmakers and amongst those topics that I listed or any others would you say that certain of them are more prioritized by your team than others so I think the biggest you know a lot of this is looking like what are the priorities in general you know in DC and for for the industry and for consumers and you know I think we think the biggest things there are um stablecoin you know regulation is is a big one um Marketplace for basically stablecoin regulation Marketplace regulation and token registration I think I think are sort of like the three big pillars of this and so you know stablecoin regulation is talking with the um law the lawmakers the most and to some extent with The Regulators you know with the markets piece It's a combination of The Regulators who might regulate them and lawmakers looking at passing legislation to encrying that um and with token registration it's been primarily with the regulators so as I mentioned you have this proposal to change the way derivatives are cleared and you would like to do so using ftx's technology and of course this setup would eliminate the role of several existing tradfi intermediaries I was wondering did you um do you have an expectation on when you'll get an update on that so you know we we don't know um you know at the end of the day um this is a um uh you know we'll see when the regulatory Reserve have have updates for us on various parts but you know I can say I think we're optimistic about it I think you know it's been a long long very thorough process you know we've submitted thousands of documents it has been much more intense grilling than I think any other regulator we've seen has put people through and you know the cftc is is certainly one of the hardest you know and most thorough Regulators um in the financial ecosystem they're they're not an easy regulator but they're very knowledgeable one and and and you know we we appreciate sort of what they've been doing so you know optimistically I think that like we've done a lot of what we need to do here and and and sort of you know are in the final structure of of working through any last details with with you know regulators and making sure everyone's on the same page but we'll we'll have to see earlier this year during a discussion at the cftc about this proposal I noticed that you mentioned that some of the other invited ex experts were purporting to protect investors but actually the Traders knew more than they did and what I found interesting is you know on the other hand um so so that sort of kind of has this maybe sort of libertarian feel to it on the other hand you are a huge political donor and the vast majority of your money tends to go to democratic candidates and um as I'm sure you're aware the Democratic party tends to be the party that is more likely to support the need to protect consumers via Financial regulation so I was wondering like what's your overall philosophy on financial regulation is it something that neatly fits into one of these categories or something totally different no there's a lot going on there um I and and there are a lot of interesting you know tangents there um in general very few of of my policies sort of very neatly fit into buckets and this is included I think what I would say the core way that I think about it is the following I think people get distracted talking about more regulation versus less regulation and I think that that's just not the most important access at the end of the day I think the most important access here is is the regulation fit for a purpose is you know does the regulation successfully narrow in on the parts that are most important to have oversight with um and and if it does then the more the merrier right like to the extent that it's addressing really big existing concerns um that that like are you know potentially causing real problems if they go on address then I'm all for having um you know a uh really robust system there um and if it's not if it's focusing on dumb things that don't matter then in some sense the less the better but like more meaningfully like you gotta redirect it to like be better protected and the big thing here is like is it protecting customers is it actually protecting customers right is it focusing on the things where the biggest risk exists and is it doing that in a way which will help mitigate that risk and um that serves the core of how I think about it and and I do really think that a lot of these debates just miss that right like when people are debating you know an agency versus another agency or you know philosophically what the right approach is for dealing crypto I sort of feel like a lot of those conversations and just like come on guys like can we focus on like you know looking at reserves of stable coins like on that part yeah be really thorough you know I want Regulators to be able to dive really deep into the number of dollars and or treasuries in the bank account of a stable coin issuer right like sort of like as much transparency as possible Right like they want to enforce minute to minute transparent currency published in real time by the stablecoin issuers with Hefty fines if like they materially mistake things and don't promptly correct it and very have to you know action if it drops below the number of tokens issued yeah absolutely right like that means something wrong has happened with with the stable coin and like we like you know the more we can do to prevent and to alert around that the better if you look at like having real disclosures around how you know a product that someone is trading works yeah I think like the more transparency you can get there the better like you know totally in favor of that and you know and on the other hand I think when you when when you're saying like what if we introduce three more intermediaries I'm kind of like okay you could regulatory mandate that I agree it would be strict in that it would make it harder to operate in this space but like is that protecting customers like is there a way in which like what's the theory for how that makes the world better than the world before then and sometimes there's an answer right sometimes you have a specific answer like this is why these are necessary players that have to be separated out but like it should be motivated by that theory it's not like old things that are awkward for operators in the industry also protect customers like there are things that are just bad and similar things that are just good that like protect customers and make it easier to operate that is like really at the core what my belief is you've said you want to turn FTX into a sort of financial supermarket and the potential blockfi and Voyager well blockfi acquisition could help you do that however um a financial Supermarket sounds centralized and I was wondering why that was the vision when in crypto the end game is generally decentralization is a good question and to that point at the end of the day FTX is a centralized company like it is and you know we're not trying to pretend to be a decentralized one because we're not um uh we have you know a board of directors we have like job titles we have corporate entities there's no like we're company um and the product we're building is you know it's on AWS it is a centralized product but it's in a decentralized space and the way that I think about that and the way that I think about that interfacing um is basically that well you know you have a sort of a hub and spokes model where you know a lot of things are more efficient if done in a centralized entity I mean one good kind of clean example this is Netflix right if you want to deliver I don't even know how many bytes a day of video content to people um you can't fit that all on a blockchain okay that is what it is and so you know the hft firms are going to want to trade on exchanges that are probably going to require more throughput than blockchains will be easily able to handle okay that is what it is um but uh but while doing that um and acting again in a centralized company in a centralized way we are hooked up by decentralized rails to the rest of the ecosystem right and so if you want to send your assets from FTX to anywhere else you can do it 24 7 instantly by clicking a button and that is you know that's how we are a part of the crypto ecosystem and that is something which I think is really important um any any basically what makes us um you know a a part of a decentralized ecosystem um it's the fact that we integrate with blockchain rails and that we integrate with all the other centralized and decentralized players um in this space that way uh and I think that's sort of like in general the model that like and I feel most compelled by which is some things will be directly on chain directly decentralized other things will be centralized entities done for you know computational reasons you know in a centralized way but that then right out to blockchains that interface with um um and and you know that's how I see us in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the direction FTX is going and uh some of the policy directions also the country could move but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible curious about the world of crypto and the future of the next

chainalysis.com Unchained back to my conversation with Sam as I'm sure you're aware crypto entrepreneurs in the US have been making noise for years that the U.S regulatory environment is inhospitable to them you are one of the top U.S business people in a generation your rise has been meteoric extremely fast and yet your firms have operated out of Hong Kong now the Bahamas and at the same time you're often on Capitol Hill what would it take for you to move back to the U.S yeah it's a good question and you know look we're always going to have to have operations in a lot of countries right like we service Japanese clients and we do that through a regulated Japanese entity and so the the boring answer to your question is well you know we'll always have some U.S operations some non-us operations but let's put that aside to give the real answer right and the way that I see the real answer here is okay but what would it take for us to be able to offer effectively you know something like our full product in the United States something that we felt good about and to be able to do that in a way where um where we were able to operate you know with the us as not just a U.S headquarters but as a global headquarters right um and you know morally speaking like what would it take for us to to effectively have the company basically be us instead of basically be foreign and you know to that point like I think there's sort of one big thing for us and again it's different for different people right like when you're looking stable coin issuers obviously the big thing that they're looking at is stable coin regulation and and and you know um uh and bills for us the biggest thing is the markets piece right like the most important thing for us is we operate a Marketplace that's a core product it's an exchange it's a Clearing House the matching engine um you know it's also a front end and so the biggest thing is you know well for both spot and Futures uh ideally for things that both are and are not Securities um we want to be able to um I you know offer those from our us entity to Americans and if we can do that um I think that unlocks you know frankly most of what's remaining here and so you know that that is just the core of the answer it's like you know clear clear answers to how do we operate the Futures and spot security and not security token Exchange in the United States that's the thing we've been pushing on the hardest and you know that's the thing where you know I won't say every country has given Clarity on that because they haven't a number of countries it's extremely unclear um how one would do that that being said even in countries where it's not clear how one would offer those products there is often an interim answer like there's often a sense of like okay you know like there's going to be a forthcoming regime it's not clear exactly what that regime will be but you know while waiting for that this is what you can do as a company to effectively offer the products um there's not that sense in the United States you know we don't have that sense of like this is how we operate for now um and so that is to some extent the big thing that's that that I guess has been missing here is is you know a sense of like you know either as a permanent matter or even just as a temporary matter pending you know for their license you know licensure opportunities what is the way that one operates these venues but you know we're doing what we can here right like with you know pending application with the cfdc um you know or I guess an amendment to existing application um to offer um you know crypto Futures you know we're working with the SEC on new security tokens where you know working with Congress on getting you know legislation for for uh spot Market oversight and I really do think a lot of progress is being made in all of these fronts wow so it sounds like you're yeah like your road map is um you're you're kind of working on multiple areas of the roadmap all at once yep that's certainly true okay so it seems like if you're successful then you're saying that you you might just move back here it's that you know that's on the it's on the table it's something that like you know we have conversation periodically about what it would mean what it would take and you know every time we have the conversations they seem like a little bit less fanciful and a little bit more like you know like you know the pieces that would have to be in place to make that happen many of them are coming in place I wanted to ask you one more uh kind of political question which is I'm sure you're aware that the loudest crypto critics of crypto and Congress have tended to be Democrats and yet that's the party that you've mostly supported with your political donations why do you think it is that you seem aligned politically with them but then disagree on crypto with them yeah it's a good question the first thing I'll say you know um if I have given to both sides and you know at the end of the day it's policy not politics that I care about and I'm totally happy to support you know whatever side whatever uh people and politicians are supporting good policy you know that that could go either right so that that anyway that's the boring answer to your your question but I do think that's worth noting that like I don't see myself as like having been born with a big D on my chest or or something like that right like it's this is just a a question of um you know wanting to work with lawmakers and that that can cut across the aisle um but the other thing that I would say I is that there are a lot of issues I I agree with you know different people on different issues I think that like you know one of the issues I care about the most is pandemic preparedness um that's actually something which has cut across the aisle to some extent uh but I you know I I think that like you know no one issue is going to give a really clear readout as to you know where my overall politics lies that that's that's another piece of this um and then the last thing that I that I would say there is you know I think that crypto somewhat surprisingly to me a somewhat bipartisan issue it's been an issue where both sides I think have had constructive things to say and and where there's uh I I think both sides are looking for ways to bring the industry onshore and to you know provide customer oversight obviously there are some differences in execution and in in the exact Vision that people have for it um which is what it is um and there are certainly some people who I disagree moderately strongly with on the right way do this um but that's how politics is you know you agree on some things you disagree on others you learn to live with it and um you know I think in this case like they're going to be places where where I you know disagree with a few members of of you're both very certainly with the Democratic party on crypto but I actually agree with with how a number of the the members are seeing it um and um you know hopefully we can have a constructive debate about it I was also curious about those political donations you know obviously it's kind of well known uh that your motivation for the wealth that you've built in your career is to eventually give the vast majority of it away You're an effective altruist and you are very interested in where each dollar will kind of have the greatest impact for the betterment of humanity it's very kind of rational way of looking at this and so I was wondering when you make those political donations and you you mentioned you know you were looking for people who have good positions on policy are you looking um to support politicians with that rational lens or are you looking to support politicians who you think are um supportive of crypto in ways that you think will be good for the industry so the biggest thing is just looking for politicians who are in general doing you know good policy work some of this could be on crypto but most of it is not you know most of um of what I'm looking at is you know more generally like you know how are they viewing the most important issues before us and um and and so I think it's basically answer your question is that it's not a crypto specific thing and you know it is a much more General one and and you know it's one where I you know think that you know how they respond to to pandemics how they look at Future Technologies how they you know try to have sort of rational Economic Policy um you know those are all sort of among the most important things um for me and uh uh and NCI I I think at the end of the day it's you know we there may come a point at which there exists a single issue which is so important that you know no other issues really matter I don't think we are at that point I think we're at a point where it is a much broader swath of things that matter and where you know I try and take a somewhat holistic view of you know how how a policy maker you know approaches uh what policy they ultimately support and ultimately actually really fight for you know I have to say it sort of reminds me of like the kind of uh Michael Bloomberg technocratic view is that am I getting that right yeah I think that's that's pretty fair I think that like um obviously he's had different views at different points in his life too so so you know won't hold off on being too um you know too dogmatic about uh you know exactly where where he has been at various points but but yeah I think it has a lot in common with how he has sort of often viewed these things so in addition to your main crypto businesses um and also uh you know working on this proposal with the cftc you uh in addition have a 7.6 stake in Robin Hood you've also invested in IEX and I was curious to hear how you thought the crypto and Trad five markets will either evolve toward or away from each other and what role FTX will play in all that totally um you know obviously I don't know for sure we'll see what happens um but my guess is that they will evolve towards each other that would definitely be my guess here and I think you know the core reason is that you know when you look at um at where some of the first real their applications of blockchain are you know frankly I think that's some of the most compelling applications in blockchain um are in Market structure um and what I mean by that is if you look at what happened to um you know mobile Brokers on the day that Meme stocks went wild right you know what certainly is obvious is something bad happened right like uh you know somehow that didn't end the way people thought it was going to end um lots of retail got basically liquidated which is actually weird because they didn't have leverage on right like like somehow despite having like unlevered positions their positions were you know in some cases closed and and and at the very least they're not able to add to them they're often just locked out of the app like look what happened there right why did markets break down so much well at the end of the day I think there is basically as it turns out a limit to the amount of money that retail is allowed to make with current market structure and what do I mean by that well eventually you know retail bought a lot of AMC a lot of GameStop eventually they'd made you know 10 billion dollars in a one day period mark to Market it takes two days to settle any equities transaction in the United States so they're sitting there having quote unquote made this money um but uh uh but it's gonna be two days until that money is actually delivered to them and in the meantime they're sitting there uh you know with uh with marked market gains well what happens if you know a day and a half later the other side comes and says haha just kidding I don't have any AMC I know I said they sold you some AMC like interesting you bought that joke I never did that didn't happen right um what happens then uh well it's a mess is part of the answer to that question what happens then is well I either retail didn't actually make the money they thought they'd made there right either it's all kind of an illusion because they're you know the trades just get canceled or if that's not what happened then I guess that somehow I someone else has gotta fund that right someone else has got to pay retail the uh uh 10 billion dollars they think they made so what you have is this world world where every single broker every intermediary separately has to be sitting there with like you know billions of dollars um in uh regulatory capital in case there's a failure to deliver and we're just talking about the stock side here in fact it's even worse um if you look at the cash side where it takes a month realistically speaking uh for cash 2 definitely definitely settle and so okay so you see you're sort of like starting from that position well uh then you know what happens when Market get volatile the answer is like the risk just overwhelms the system um how do you fix that you fix that with clean clear unambiguous settlement that's fast and cheap and that's what blockchain does that's like it's core you know most obvious use case and so um you know one of the first things that I think blockchain May really help quite a bit is settlement um is financial settlement and uh you know excited to see that happen um in uh uh you know in traditional finance and you know I think that like we're gonna start to see bleed over from that if nothing else um you know in the not too distant future and you know outside of that like I think there's a lot else that that can happen here um and you know I think we're just going to see this this sort of intersection increase in increasing increase over time um but uh uh but yeah I think we're gonna see things bleeding together and that's obviously one of the reasons that we've been you know doing what we can to build out our Trad five presence because you know we think we have something to offer there using crypto rails and we think it's also an area that obviously there's a lot of customer demand for it's so funny to hear you talk about this because the way I got into covering all of this was in 2015 that was the era of blockchain not Bitcoin and I think one of it was my very first big article on all this and it was about how Wall Street was going to use this technology and then all these years on it it felt like I was wrong and yet here you are again talking about this as as the future dream um I wanted to ask you about an article that Bloomberg published a few weeks ago a number of people in crypto have expressed concerns about the fact that you both own a major exchange and that you own almost all of Adam Alameda which is one of the largest market makers although the article did point out there is no evidence of any preferential treatment obviously this is something that a number of people in the crypto industry have observed and I was wondering what your response is to them yeah so you know first of all I think it's a totally reasonable thing to bring up and a totally reasonable thing to have some concern over um you know at its core like it is really important that marketplaces act in a responsible manner here and that they act in an agnostic Manner and I I think that like there have to be controls in place there has to be oversight of that you know what it says we do have those controls we do have that oversight that you know and we're regulated in a large number of jurisdictions um this isn't news to Regulators it's not like they sort of read that it's like oh we forgot about that um you know we we have a lot of policies in place for this we've gone over this with a number of regulators um and you know at its core um sort of in line with the statement about there's it's all sort of mostly theoretical there aren't sort of like specific instances like um I you know I I think one of the core things we value the most is that you know our Marketplace is totally agnostic and what I mean by that diagnostic here um is that you know we don't care who sends an order right well sorry the FB kyc'd on the exchange right we we care about that part right um but you know from like a matching engine priority perspective from a latency perspective right like the way we think about it is like our job as an exchange is to facilitate orders hitting the exchange and you know to make sure that that happens in exactly the way that that we say that'll happen which is say you know Bob has an order to send you know great Bob can send the order straight to the venue and if anyone else has an order they'll send it straight to the venue right everyone's going straight to the exchange here um we don't have sort of preferential treatment on that and that's just standard horrible you know we've matched the best buyer against the best seller and that that does make it quite a bit easier that we don't have like you know okay but like you know we try and match it against like a core Market maker if we can and then like you know it's like this group of people we give them like the access like without the extra  like you know as much as as we can just clarify everything and make it just standard access that makes it a lot cleaner to make sure that we don't have sort of you know conflict of interest breaches here um uh and then you know the last thing that I'll say is just that um is that you know I don't actually work on um on Alameda anymore I haven't for years um and uh you know I don't I don't trade for it um and I'm not involved in like David Mansion there either the fury emerge recently went off without a hitch and um yet obviously the price tanked probably for other reasons and um you know that only the merge only slightly reduced the problem with scalability Solana obviously is a blockchain that you've been a big proponent of and it is one that is highly scalable how do you think the merge affects ethereum prospects yeah I mean I think he's an amazing technical feat like it's super exciting that it happened and it happened pretty cleanly all things considered which is also sort of impressive and you know really well done by the ethereum community um um I think it helps them right like like you know as you said it still isn't the fastest blockchain post merge but it's a lot faster right and it was kind of out of Headroom before this right it was at a point where it just like could not support the current level of defy activity now it can and I don't think that it has six orders of magnitude left on top of being able to sell you know to support current defy activity right I think it has like I don't know a quarter of an order of magnitude left or something like that but like it's still a big Improvement and um and so like overall I'm I'm super excited about it also you know I I will say sort of in line with what you're saying that like I think it it's you know this is anticipated I don't think it changes the core narrative which is that like you know their advantage is different and you know disadvantages uh to different blockchains ethereum schtick is not that it's the fastest blockchain it's not that it's the most um efficient blockchain you know it's meant to be a high trust High um sort of trash Parker uh blockchain um and you know now hopefully it can be in that plus a moderate throughput instead of a low throughput a blockchain it also obviously you know gets sort of almost the entire carbon footprint of ethereum uh which is quite valuable because um ethereum was I'm pretty it was it was a pretty significant carbon footprint before this just given the level of demand um you know on the network from D5 so Ethan was likely going to be deflationary and at least the issuance has been drastically reduced and in comparison to bitcoin obviously on those scores it's improved so I was wondering what you thought this did for bitcoin's narrative yeah so you know I mean Bitcoin is is what it is right it's digital gold I I at this point it's not like it's not the blockchain um that you would use for uh high-speed uh low-cost payments although you can still use you know lightning or Layer Two or a wrapper on bitcoin to do it um but it is the most trusted the most institutional um and uh you know uh token that that sort of hasn't changed and he's technically inflationary but he's very slightly inflationary right like I think worth noting is that it is the total amount of inflation ever is capped and it's capped at like 10 right like how many Bitcoins have been mined so far is it like 19 million yes something I'm not sure but something like and there's you know what 21 million that that so you know there's only 10 more inflation over the entire rest of History combined um I mean in this environment that's about annual inflation for for a lot of Fiat currencies so um you know it's basically not inflationary um you know on on a longer time scale um and uh um you know yeah I think it's sort of it's gonna you know continue to play that role and it's a pretty different role than you know the kind of core High trust smart contract blockchain or then the like High throughput um smart contract blockchain does um I think the merge doesn't doesn't change that ton if anything it differentiates Bitcoin a little bit more these ethereum is not proof of work anymore so Bitcoin is sort of the only remaining um you know really really major top Point um that is uh proof of work okay so you don't feel that ethereum's you know more reduced inflation does anything to change bitcoin's places to show Gold I don't think so no okay um so as we mentioned earlier in the show there's you know this kind of uh wild macro environment right now on the day that we're recording the British pound has dropped to a record low there's a lot of talk about recession and I wondered what you thought might happen on a macro level for the next year and what plan you what approach you plan to take with FTX during this period yeah so you know that's where I mean fgx obviously we're incredibly exposed to the crypto industry is what we are I'm fine with that you know um that it would be you know weird not to be given the the business that we're in well we do keep our reserves in cash and uh you know so one of the sort of dumb answers here again I don't want to put too much you know in front of this answer is not really addressing the question um is you know whatever happens happens right like um uh but I think the the real answer to the question is we want to be in a position where we can offer products that people want whatever those are right and so like you know one piece of that is you know obviously we've you know Branch out into equities um you know International we have tokenized equities in the United States we have um you know a broker dealer and and clearing firm and they're offering equities you know through that to Americans um uh you know we would love to have better FX support we're working on that we already have pretty good support in a lot of places but that's obviously something that is going to be in demand you know give what you're talking about um and so you know I think the core thing that I think about above everything else is being positioned to offer the products people are going to want given a highly volatile and uncertain macro environment and it's recently been reported that FTX is raising funds for more deal making so what types of Acquisitions would you like to make yeah so um uh you know I think what I'd say without explicitly uh you know uh uh confirming or denying that is um that you know what are the things that would make the most sense for us as a company well um you know one thing that would make a lot of sense um would be you know when you look at sort of the regulatory space right we've done a number of Acquisitions that have been aimed at companies that have um really impressive regulatory uh I sort of know-how knowledge standing relationships licensure um you know obviously ladrax is a big example of that um now after Exodus derivatives um but there are a number more as well um so that's one piece of this um uh you know a second piece of this um but but frankly that well has historically been a big piece you know I'm not sure it will be as big of a piece going forward just because we've already done a lot of the Acquisitions we wanted to do um you know on that space um you know I I think that acquiring great teams um is always a thing we're excited about gray I think the storybook for all that was a part of the story um and then the last thing and you know maybe the biggest is looking at businesses that have you know really really great user bases um where we can potentially help um you know uh round out the products um or the licensing for them and so that's gonna be something where I have our eye on both in the United States and abroad um you know there are a number of of companies that you know we have been in talks with at some point um or that we have analyzed and you know I I think the big thing from our perspective is thinking about like what would actually be a positive sum uh pairing what would be a place where you know we think that that sort of like you know would be worth more together than a part and that um uh you know it sort of makes sense to join forces and so you know we have been have been you know digging around at a number of those we will always be but you know this is certainly a time that we are uh paying you know particular attention to that so as we've mentioned in the show the guiding principle behind all the work that you do is to just make as much money as possible in order to give as much possible away you know so that'll have the greatest impact in the world however I'm sure you're very well aware that there's a number of critics of crypto who say that they believe it's a net you know negative for various reasons and I was wondering kind of what your thoughts were on that and whether you thought there was any kind of conflict in the way you were making the money and your ultimate goal or not so you know ultimately I would not want to be doing something I thought was like you know strongly destructive with with my day job and I don't think I am um I I think you know look there are good parts of crypto they're bad parts of crypto that's true of everything that they're good and bad parts um you know maybe it's a little bit more true frankly in both directions um because of the you know newness of the field the dynamicness of it you know it means that you get a lot of really exciting new innovation that means you get a lot of they always come hand in hand um but um and you know hopefully we can move more in One Direction you know rather than the other but you know as core I think that like you know crypto and blockchain have the potential to uh you know make settlement a lot cleaner for people both domestically and internationally I think it is you know the potential to help Empower a lot of people economically um you know to give them real Financial access like you know one of our fastest growing jurisdictions um this year has been Ukraine um because you know there's a place where people are really desperate for Global Financial access and you know works day to help provide that and so you know I feel good about a lot of the impact that you know I think we're going to be able to have also think that you know a piece of this is making sure that we are trying to you know to the sense that we can move the the industry in a constructive Direction here um you know which hopefully can simultaneously protect consumers and you know do some good all right well it has been such a pleasure having you Sam thanks so much where would you like to direct people who want to learn more about you or FTX you know I think like I'm I'm most active on Twitter so you can always find me there at SBF underscore FTX uh you know you know fdx.com or fdxus to learn more about us yeah I I think that's the core answer perfect thanks for coming on and chained of course thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Sam and FTX check out the show notes for this
