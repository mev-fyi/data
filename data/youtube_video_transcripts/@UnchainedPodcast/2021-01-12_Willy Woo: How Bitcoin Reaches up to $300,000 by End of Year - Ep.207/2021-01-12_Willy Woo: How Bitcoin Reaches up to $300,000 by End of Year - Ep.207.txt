is willy woo on-chain bitcoin analyst and writer of the bitcoin forecast a market intelligence newsletter welcome willie hi laura great to be back yeah i am so excited to have you i'm sure for the people watching on video they're like why is laura like bursting with joy right now um and so you guys today's show is going to be all about the bitcoin price which has been on an absolute tear and the reason why billion or willy sorry willie and i were laughing a little bit right when we first started is because we just checked the bitcoin price and it's very near 42k and you know a month ago it was at like 18 000 so anyway i just want people to know uh we are recording friday morning eastern time so if things change between now and when this comes out tuesday you all know why all right willie what's your sense of why bitcoin has more than doubled in the last month well um is it quite a ride um i like really we had um i think it's a really a validation of bitcoin by the institutions um you know we've had all manner of hedge fund managers say um that bitcoin is a valid investment at this time we've had the likes of michael sailor with microstrategy acquiring what was it 425 million for his own company and then by another 650 million on a bond raise so uh there's a lot of interest now from um high net worth individuals and i'm hearing through the grapevine that there are so many of these people that have looked at it they are you know ten to hundreds of millions in net worth and now they need allocations so since around um the 22 000 mark um of bitcoin which seems like a long time ago but it was only what was it was only like five or six weeks ago um it's just launched this thing's launched um the interesting thing about it is you know not only is the price going parabolic um and all of the more technical traders are saying it's overheated it's overheated we should sell here you should short it here everything i'm seeing on chain as we sort of decompose who is buying um what quantities um you know what's the nature of these buyers we're seeing that these are um high net worth they're pulling um large um purchases and they're um long term buyers like you know i work a lot with glass node which decomposes a lot of this on-chain data and one of their latest metrics is this measurement of where are the coins moving to are they moving towards um participants that are long-term holders or more liquid participants who tend to hold it trade it you know buy and sell with the swings and what we're seeing now is this unprecedented swing to illiquid these holders that are holding um these bitcoins and they don't tend to um sell so readily and so as these coins are being bought and locked up by these holders and also the fact that it's not just one big institution like microstrategy that is patiently waiting for the market to come to their their limit orders and they buy as the market sells in you've got like all of these um investors that are wanting to buy one million dollar bullets of of investment into bitcoin and they're competing in and as the price is rising they're chasing it and so it's not letting the price settle and sell into the orders so the price is running away it sort of runs and it gets to a point where it's a little bit too too frothy it sort of settles for a few days in and then it launches again so yeah this is the phase we're in um we're at what was it well 41 42 right now um that's that's kind of a resistance zone right now the next major one is 47. um i was just saying to friends that with 95 certainty 40 000 is going to break from everything being seen on chain um you can see this through you know that the sheer number of coins that are being bought um with inflows of of stable coins and um outflows of of bitcoin into their wallet uh so yeah it's a it's a um it's a really uh fun time right now and i think we've been waiting for this for a long long time as is bitcoin is in crypto people you know so yeah yeah to me i was just um talking with some people on twitter that what's remarkable to me and why this feels like such a story is that the price is just going insane but the media attention and hype around bitcoin is i mean not like you know at an all-time low or anything but you know considerably min uh minimal or relatively minimal um and so that to me like signifies there's something really happening here okay so you said so many things we're gonna have to unpack all of that we're we'll spend probably the next half an hour unpacking a lot of that but but one thing that i um wanted to ask you about was i did see that you tweeted that based on your models you believe we'll see what you call the double pump bull market and i don't i don't even know what that means uh okay this is very crypto speak you know as a traditional world they would say a rally um bitcoiners call them pups you know and a retracement would be called a dump so we we like i i like to use the crypto lingo um so you know in 2013 you saw that bitcoin um rose uh very very sharply to um 200 and something and then it retraced 266 i think yeah yeah so well it was 200 and on the daily chart which i do a lot of my studies on it went to 2 30 it might have gone i think it did go much higher like 260 on hourly um and then it retraced down to 66 on the daily close so there was a big rally in the first uh quarter of 2013 and then it retraced 70 something percent um it would have been 90 if you looked at it from hourly peak to trough um and then this thing consolidated i think everyone thought there was you know over that was the beer market but actually that was just a big first rally an overheated zone it paused it rested and typically in these these markets um when the price rises so quickly and it hits a certain point where someone sells and it sets a cascade of people selling thinking oh no this was overheated it was a bubble the thing comes back down and what you're looking for is whether a lower value gets tested and rejected and if it's rejected you'll see that a lot of buyers come in and they buy that asset up very very quickly and it bounces back up and then you get these sort of waves that happen up down up down until this whole thing sort of settles and all the frost leaves and then what you want to really see is um are we going to dip again and if it dips again then we've started a beer cycle but if it starts to climb up again that whole overheated zone and that consolidation of testing that lower range and seeing if it was supported by new buyers if that starts to come up again then that whole thing was just um we're just settling it just got a little bit overheated but we're just settling and um now we've got new buyers coming in again and so in 2013 we did have um two rallies and a double pump bull season um to to the 200s and then on to the 1200s and um you know interestingly in 2017 ethereum did the same thing this is what happens i think is is when um you see a lot of money coming into a smallish asset ethereum really was just launched in 2016 as a floated asset that could be tradable in 2015 okay 2015. you're not better the ico was 2014 it was floated one year later in 2015. and then in 2017 we had the the main bull run and the whole world came into that and ethereum was a very small asset at its time and of course it rallied from what was it was in the 20s to the 1500s or something um i think it started 2016 um at like around ten dollars or seven dollars something like that and then yeah a year later it was at like 1400 on one particular day yeah that's right i've got the chat now it's um we kind of settled you know we settled down and sort of had to shake off the dow hack and then 2017 started at around 10 and then you know we had a major bull run of all of crypto bitcoin started to run and all this capital came in in 2017 and you saw that ethereum also did the double pump bull market right it went straight up and i'm looking on the chart now and it went to 350. it didn't pull back much it dropped to one you know relatively speaking 150 it pulled back to 150 and then it ran on to um you know 1400 and and so you get these you can actually see it just so people know then after that it dipped below 100 i yeah 2018 to 20 to this i think it was the tail end of 2018 that was the the end of the beer but you know the main thing is you see like you've got all of this capital wooden flow into a smallish asset and this thing goes wee and it squeezes it up to the point it can it can't take the capital it runs up so high and then suddenly it has to sort of find itself again and shake out the heatedness and then it goes again and you know and bitcoin did that five times in its first um the first bull run um way back in the um what was it like the 2011 sort of 2010-2011 run-ups um so these assets sort of squeeze up go wee and then they consolidate and then they go up again and and so it's interesting to see how much bitcoin's going to go we and riding it up right now and um you know i'm looking at the unchained capital flows and they're just you know ridiculously high ridiculously high right now um this amount of capital flow compared to what bitcoin is as an asset class as an asset in itself is again similar to like uh maybe ethereum being introduced to the world as an investment um and now we're seeing bitcoin introduced to the world um the institutional world which is then given the blessing to you know there must be someone will have the figures how many family offices there are worldwide but it's not them substantial and if you can think of them all buying one to two million dollars allocation um that's a lot of money coming in and so why do you say that you know that's who it is and that's the amount is it just from conversations with um different you know desks or how are you figuring that out it's it's both it's called it's it's conversation to people in the in the family office in high net worth strata and they are saying all their friends are all finally coming in and saying i need to get an allocation for my portfolio but the main part of this where i get the certainty is i'm seeing that capital flow coming in on chain i can see the um the value of withdrawals on exchanges increasing and and that both could signify institutions but then we can look at um the clusters of wallets that the wallet addresses um you can do some forensics on it and you can notif noticeably see wallets that are or addresses that are controlled by a single participant and what we're seeing is there's a large growth in wales you know i kind of joke that it's whale spawning season there's a lot of high net worth kind of owner it's not corporation scale where you're talking tens of thousands of bitcoins that are being held it's one that the number of whales that hold a thousand bitcoins or more is skyrocketing and so are the the smaller um you know allocations around the 100 250 that that that's a very very you know telltale sign that we've got a lot of participants that are individual um coming in that are um just buying you know and we haven't seen them appear before and so when you talk about like what you're looking at on chain um you're saying it's like purchases or even when you look at you know what's happening on exchanges you say lots of withdrawals you mean that you're seeing activity where money's coming in but then the bitcoins are just being held and they're not changing hands they're not being traded and they're there's just basically no movement after their purchase is at yeah that's yeah that's so that's another lens of it um so you know right now what we can see is there's definite um clustering of bitcoin addresses that are being owned by single people or um you know participants they could be a you know holding company but these there's lots of them and the they're popping up and buying bitcoin and holding large amounts and then we're also seeing the nature of these participants we can look into them and classify them as being buy and holders that they usually coins come in and they don't usually sell versus the more um trader type profile of participant where you see coins come in and they leave and so you can um classify the the liquid guys the trader types is participants that are liquid and the the participants there tend to be holders you classify them as illiquid and then you look for the coin movements between these two types of participants the net flows of it is more of the coins now being dominated or moving towards the trader guys that are going to sell the tops or are you going to you seeing these coins start to move towards the participants that are the holding you know the ones that are like getting an allocation they're probably balancing their portfolio for different risks across many asset classes so we're seeing um coins move to these holders and then to go back to what we were talking about with the you know double pumps and and whatever adam draper at boost vc he describes this as like bitcoin moving in these like breathing cycles where it sort of like inhales i guess new investors and then it kind of settles and then it like takes another breath but each time in between kind of the new happy medium is like at a higher level than than previously and i saw you have like a way of kind of breaking down these bitcoin cycles into stages so what are the stages and what stage do you think we're at right now okay so i we obviously there's the beer cycle which is where the you know there's the long sell-off that typically lasts for bitcoin and crypto as a whole one year and then normally the thing to to end the beer cycle is capitulation you'll see the sudden sharp drop and that's the absolute bottom um peak fear everyone's it says it's over this is gone um so then what you see is a sort of flat band where the the smart investors come in and they put a floor on the price because they're quietly accumulating so whenever someone sells down the investors come in and buy the accumulators buy buy buy and that stops the price dropping and that's you'll see a a solid horizontal band in price after this sharp spike downwards you'll see the price you know grab along the bottom with few waves and then it sort of breaks out of that and it breaks out into a early bull phase um and we we kind of had that the capitulation happened in december 2018 um and then we had a a rather short accumulation um compared to the previous cycle um and then by april fool's day um in 2019 that was when we had this crazy break out of it and it ran up um and so that was the early bullface um so i call it the early bull phase i i consider the bull phase into three parts so the first phase is that that breakout and there's this sort of excitement again um and then that dies down um and we kind of have this um phase where it sort of quietens it goes downwards sideways downward sideways and this this is what we call a re-accumulation phase of the market and in that phase um a different type of investor not the one that accumulates the bottom it's the one that sees that we are now in an uptrend and they come in and buy and it's in that phase that you and at least in the bitcoin world where we have very very good metrics unlike you know stock markets or gold um we've got on-chain analytics to show oh the the inventory that is sitting on um the the spot exchanges um the inventory on them it starts to deplete and and when you see that depletion that's that's it's a good sign that we're in the um the tail end of the first phase of the bull market it's it's you'll see these buyers start to buy those coins and move them off off the of the exchanges into their wallets and we had that reaccumulation which signaled the end of the early stages bull market around um well actually around the time microstrategy bought um around the 22 000 which was only um like in early december it was actually december around the 20 000 mark actually i'm looking at the charts right now that was that was where um we were starting to end the the early bull phase and what i like to see to define the next phase which is the main bull run is after that depletion finishes and then there's this run where we see a relatively smooth upward climb without any choppiness of going downwards and you also see the the capital flows that are going into bitcoin start to go vertical and there's a very strong amount of investor capital coming into bitcoin and this we can measure as well through um through the blockchain so have we entered that phase yet because i mean it looks pretty vertical to me and you did tweet this morning so actually i i also didn't understand the sweet so maybe you can explain this you tweeted about something that you were calling fibonacci traces by the way i'm like super into fractals and that kind of thing so i was like excited about this i was like i have to learn about this um and you wrote when there's no historic resistance levels magic numbers in nature is all we have for support and resistance so also i you know i'm not a trader i don't follow the ta technical analysis stuff but i have gleaned support means like it's not going to fall below a certain level and resistance is like it's going to be hard for it to get past that level but anyway then you wrote bitcoin is in unrestrained price discovery in unsure uncharted territory literally which that sounds kind of interesting so what do you mean by that okay so um you know you think of the markets as essentially a whole bunch of traders that are coming in and they're buying or selling um and essentially through that action there's a price discovery um process so you'll if you look on a on a a price chart of any asset you will often see these these patterns and a trade a trained um trader with a lot of experience will just it'll just pop you go this price is reaching a level where in the past um traders have rejected that price they've sold it you know and it had trouble hitting it hit that that level and it always got sold down or the price conversely if it's going downwards downwards downwards and then it hits a level where in the history of this price you see that it was always bought up so now you've got a um a resistance line in our support line and and the price chart is full of these because we're always range bound exploring the price and we'll always look back to the prior um resistance or support levels to give us a kind of a probability of are we going to slice through the resistance or we're going to reject off it and then have to find some sort of support level and and so um the the price chart ends up being quite a um semi-pattern semi-random walk around these price levels that historically people have supported or rejected and so there's this one thing that happens in the in it's a it's a very very exciting event when an asset breaks its prior all-time high and so now you're in literal uncharted territory because you can go back on the charts and there's no resistances there's no history in no history in this asset that will reject the price you'll go well bitcoin is now 42 000. let's go back the last 12 years of bitcoin when was the last time it hit 42 000 did we find a resistance level that was rejected well no there is no reject resistance so we're in outer space this price just rallies upwards or and not many people want to sell into that because we don't have any history to see oh it was rejected off 50 000 back in this year there's no one has seen that before so no one really wants to sell into this and so there's very little resistance um and so the only things that we can really do to find targets is magic numbers uh so we can do the fibonacci series and that's the golden ratio and the ancient sort of like was it spiral life sort of patterns you see it turns out people have um used these numbers to create levels and you can throw these traces and it just looks like a whole bunch of different spaced horizontal lines from one level to the next and you can put them over the chart and they tend to work even when we're range bound within you know prior explored price they do work so a lot of traders use this but uh now we're in uncharted territories the only thing we can put on a chart is um fibonacci traces and these are just um what these patterns of nature give us and traders will trade to it and they are um they are certainly working um they always work in in these kind of areas and somewhat maybe a self-fulfilling prophecy but uh yeah the next um i think 40 000 was it 40 000 was the last resistance which we just sliced through just a few hours ago and so now um it's i have to look at the chat what was it it's um the way i've laid it yeah 40 400 was the was the last resistance we've started to move off that so 46 800 so say 47 000 is the next level then certainly there's a lot of bullish on-chain um pressure buying pressure to push it there and there's not a lot to push against there's not a lot of sellers we're in outer space so um it's it's it's obviously a very very exciting time um well so one other thing that i wanted to ask about while we're talking about kind of like well i don't know if price target is really the word um but so in the middle of december you tweeted that bitcoin was at the point where the btc top cap model starts curving upward and you said that at that trajectory the ridiculously low target was one hundred thousand dollars so why don't you first explain what the btc top cap model is but then also you know explain how you uh get to that one hundred thousand or if it's changed since you tweeted it oh yeah it's constantly changing um so essentially the dot the top cap model is a model um that uses the theory of mean reversion and in simple language what that means is that it's a theory that um a price of an asset always reverts to the long-term average of the the entire history of the data set so essentially if you're a trader um mean reversion as simple as trading on a moving average you know a 128 moving average tends to be a support level of bitcoin and whenever it hits that it bounces 200 day moving average is sort of the when we cross that that that tells us we're in a bull phase and when it gets too high above the 200-day moving average people might say it's overheated and i think trace mayor is well known to create the maya multiple which measures how far we're above that 200-day moving average is assigned as overvalued undervalued so that's day-to-day mean reversion um playing out and so um i built a model um a while back which uses the same basics of averaging and so if you do an average of the price and you it's a cumulative average of bitcoin's entire price history so it's not like a 200-day moving average it's a forever moving average from the day bitcoin floated on first day of trade to today and that that window averaging continues to average out and you um use that that metric you can use that to find all the tops you can multiply that by 35 it's just the magic number um and it's hit every single historic top in the history of bitcoin don't ask me why i do think maybe it's because bitcoin is a machine it's very mechanical it's set hardening they set supply and the demand is relatively constant through the 12 years and so that creates a top in the current top price today is 94 000 and when you plot this sort of act as it starts to curve and wiggle through time you always see in the bull market starts arcing upwards and you can you can take an estimate of the trajectory it's arcing we don't know how it'll trade through the next um 12 months but uh you can gauge it from historical sort of movements of bitcoin price and make a guess of where the arc's going if we don't arc if we don't arc upwards and we assume the top of the bull market is around december this year which you know it's a fair estimate because all the bull market tops of the last two cycles has been around the december just before um tax season we're we're we're going to go above 100 000 even if it doesn't arc upwards if we arc upwards and we're up to two to three hundred thousand um conservatively i mean given the size of this rally it's gonna it's gonna push it higher so wait 200 to 300k over what time period over the next um by december this year wow yeah wow so so like um plan b's um very well known for his stock to flow ratio yeah he's a twitter anonymous bitcoin researcher or analyst yes yes that's right so he's he's very famous for this um stock to flow um model of predicting price and um he's got many models um i think that the highest one of that is um is it 250 000 and right now the trajectory is on track with the top cat model it'll be an interesting one because the top cap was hit in 2013 in that double pump bull run and the first rally hit the top cap and retraced and then it consolidated and it went up again against the that ceiling um which obviously was a lot higher by by the second um the second pump uh right now if we're going to do a double pump it's 94th 95 000 right now if we have that's that um that ceiling maybe we're halfway there with in terms of price 40 42 000 we're getting pretty close to a halfway point yeah um and it's moving very very fast i mean oh yeah i mean end of january we're going to be a uh bitcoin's going to be a one trillion dollar um it's on track to be exceeding one trillion dollars um by that's i think that's a 55 000 mark we're on track to breaking that we're very quickly um and that's a very interesting mark in the sand because yeah you know all of our major asset buckets whether it's gold whether it's stock whether it's real estate they're all measured in um trillion dollar buckets and bitcoin's always been like a little toy um being sub 1 trillion so um it's a significant event i think yeah all right so in a moment we're going to talk about other significant events in bitcoin um but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend

improvements ensure the best rates on swaps while dramatically cutting response time back to my conversation with willy woo so speaking of significant events um one thing that was so curious to me is throughout this whole discussion we have not mentioned once the pandemic and i just wondered if for you you know you see any effect from that uh in the bitcoin price or if it's actually really not that relevant yeah the pandemic was very relevant to bitcoin's price you know on the outset is everyone who follows the price closely will note a week prior um to the well as this pandemic was starting to roll out across the world um we had price of bitcoin you know it reached um just over ten thousand dollars and it started to pull back over the the successive a couple of weeks and then this whole you know we call it a white swan you know unpredictable we say this is an unpredictable event that wasn't in any of the risk models um that's a black swan but because a pandemic is actually um you know there's a history of roughly every hundred years there's a pandemic there is some data so we call it a white swan but it caught most of the world by but um you know um by surprise and um the price actually caved down to the 4 000 range instantly and that's what we call a flight to safety everyone reassesses their um their risk models so they get out of every single position is absolute panic selling they sell gold they sell stocks they sell all of their leverage trades and everything and they go to the safe haven which is u.s dollars and they park in us dollars and then they redeploy back into assets that make sense for the new um the new world that's ahead you know they change the risk models have changed and you recalculate those and you deploy accordingly and so you'll see this in the 2008 world financial crisis you know gold for example was the perfect safe haven for that time and it did rally for the next three or so years but it also sold off because everyone sells um in that in that flight to safety and and bitcoin did in the covet crash also so um i i like to say bitcoin went from 10 000 to 4 000 to 10 000 over that bump as people reassess their risks and then redeployed but the the the unheard of story and the more interesting one to me is that this was also the point where we saw vast amounts of bitcoin being accumulated and pulled off the inventory sitting on exchanges and you know that was the sign of the re-accumulation that i talked about earlier but this amount of inventory being accumulated off then uh this amount inventory being pulled off the exchanges was two times deeper and two times longer it took ten months to complete than any other you know the prior cycle and what that did was it moved the floor price of bitcoin higher and higher and higher until it squeezed and it the the bitcoin price was trading sideways at that point and people said this thing was a failed safe haven and it's a risk on asset you invest in it as a risky asset it's not a safe haven and actually if you look at the on-chain data it was saying and screaming this is a safe haven and lots of long-term buyers are coming in to scoop it up and hold it as the safe haven but you couldn't see that in price because the price was highly speculative and we had a lot of buffer between that floor price that these investors were supporting and the the random wonder of price resistance and supports that traders speculating on and so there's a lot of movement in that until the price floor comes up and squeezes you out and you see that in the accumulation phase of the bottom of the beer and we saw that happen after covert and that was the start of this bull run this phase of the bull run we saw and so just to make sure that i'm understanding correctly basically what you're saying is there's a lot of people who have bitcoin who don't necessarily have conviction in it and they were selling on these exchanges just trying to make money on the price swings but meanwhile for ten and a half months you had these people with conviction about bitcoin who are buying on the exchanges and moving that money over to their cold wallets or their cold storage and so you could see that there was this kind of like period where people were turning to it as a safe haven but because there was like enough of the um uh the people who were just kind of trying to trade on the swings and who didn't have conviction about it like it took a while to deplete that amount of inventory but when it did that's why the price rose so quickly is that what you're saying yeah more or less um we have you know bitcoin is a very very liquid asset it's traded on um futures exchanges to the billions per day and so it's a great game for speculators to play and very profitable for some and it moves in a random walk when covert happened the you know if as michael saylor said he took a look at the he look at he took a look at the world and so much money is being printed that um essentially everything's being inflated away at 14 per annum anything you want to hold whether it's a car whether it's a um you know harvard education the price is going up by 14 per annum and he was looking for a way to um hedge against you know all of his cash being inflated away and this is the um the dilemma that many investors have is where do you move your assets to in a way that you can outperform that inflation and that's 14 is calculated by microstrategy and so um interestingly the timing of is it was about right if you wind back the clock from when microstrategy accumulate their first deployment into bitcoin and you go back six months which is what michael sailor was known to have said as the time frame in which a publicly traded company needs to go through its entire board approval regulatory approval vcc approval and actually implement that purchase it is six months and that six months is um right at the point of around that covert crash and also where we saw that inventory depletion and so i think it might have been just a number of um very high net worth individuals thinking about the markets in that way um and i'm sure that um ceos of publicly traded companies and their board of directors who are researching this are uh um some of the most well networked people in society so i don't think that it was just um like those guys that bought it um i think that it was that entire network of people that was spreading the word as here's this you know new kind of inflation protection candy that um that you can come and get so well one other thing speaking of people who are well networked i was kind of disturbed because you have this chart that shows what you believe to be an accumulation of bitcoin by wales in the days leading up to the news that the occ the office of the control of the currency will now permit banks to use public blockchains and dollars table coins for settlement you know can you explain why you think that that was the catalyst for that well for starters um it's a it's a huge win for this entire industry because now um the u.s government has the u.s treasury is okay that banks can now use these public ledgers as as infrastructure for banking with the likes of regulated stable coins like usdc by circle that that's regulated there's there's nothing to stop a bank from using that stable coin from transmitting um us dollars around the world cross border or to each other within the country in you know 16 seconds is the block time for ethereum that it runs on if you've got that kind of infrastructure that banks can use um i think that if you consider that bitcoin is or crypto in itself is if you've got usdc it's a hop in a step to get to um to buy ethereum to buy bitcoin to buy any of the leading coins and you've got d5 networks that that take it on ethereum and you can swap it into anything it's literally seconds away from being bitcoin compared to you know you can imagine all of the stories of you know friends or friends of friends who are trying to figure out how to buy this thing and trying to send money to a bank and that's trying to send it to coinbase and working all that out like now it's it's a lot more fluid when um there's a prominence of stable coins that are being run um by banks and supported by banks so that's a huge win and we saw a huge price breakout when that was released and there was a front before the price oh right yeah yeah exactly it was uh it was it was i think it was 23 000 and then this thing launched and it launched um ridiculously um and i was like wow okay um there's no insider trading rules for bitcoin someone's in the know um so anyway that was quite fun to see yeah well a little bit disturbing i mean technically it's not insider trading but it's the same behavior just with a different asset that that rule doesn't apply to yes yes that's true that's true yeah well so speaking of stable coins though um you do have some analysis about looking at state well i can't speak stable point and flows to exchanges so what can you extrapolate about the bitcoin price from what you're seeing there the they're very good indicators for local uh movements um generally you know a lot of stuff we look on chain um they they differ um from the time frames that they can operate from and the lower time frame stuff we just look at capitals go capital flows going into and out of exchanges um you want to see fiat going in and you want to see bitcoin and ethereum and all the other coins move out if bitcoins are moving out and and money is moving in well that's a clear buy signal and obviously we can't see the banking wires and two exchanges but we can see stable coins being minted and being sent to exchanges to buy and so uh that's that turns out to be a very good indicator particularly usdc currently um so it's more so than something like tether you mean that's right tether tether used to be quite good with it but now in this current phase um circle usdc's are um a much better signal and that tells me the buying is by regulated entities and most likely us-based so and actually the buying is coming um but you'll see the the the price rallies more during u.s trading hours than asian trading hours so there's a fair signature to say that we're getting a lot of buying um from that usd signal and we're also seeing that that's that's most likely u.s entities so my guess is it's those us family officers that are buying it right now and so we've been talking about different kinds of on-chain analysis throughout the show but are there any factors that we haven't looked at that you would want to mention well there's one um actually that i know you've talked about coin movements which i actually didn't even know what that was is that are you talking about coin movements that are like number of transactions or is that dollar amount or like how are you defining that um it's a um it's a a kind of a office mix of um i'm looking at the supply of bitcoin and and looking at how active that is and moving um from compared from day to day so there's no actual unit of account no unit there of to speak of and it is it is kind of a proprietary signal that i use i i published a lot publicly um but yeah it seems it's sensing the um how much of the network of bitcoins network that supply is actually moving from day to day compared to you know a month ago and it turns out that these the supply moves and impulses you know you'll see these impulses and the trick is to go when you see these impulses you know there's an activity on chain and usually it's going to shove the price in one price vector whether it's from up to horizontal or horizontal to down or up to down or up to even more up and so i use that as a as a key indicator to um structurally whether the the asset is going to change direction and price vector and there's a lot of extra investigation i have to do whenever i see one of those impulses to go which direction and who's pushing it and and whatnot but um those coins changing hands is kind of the the tempo and the beat of the price action that i see on chain and they happen every between three to six weeks and and right now the the latest tweet i think you saw was um a very large impulse and you know really it's the mother of all impulses for this cycle and normally they're sharp in pulses but this one was like very steep very high and then it didn't drop and it just got bigger and fatter and wider and it's still big and it hasn't let up yet so it's it's a big shove and you know what we're seeing that play out right now is this this tiny little assets being propelled upwards in a sheer vertical wall as that coin impulses is pushing it like it's never had a push before so um yeah um all right well let's also talk about like maybe the most well-known um way to value bitcoin i think the nvt ratio which is network value to transaction ratio can you define that for people who don't know what that is and then say what you're seeing when you look at that metric now okay so um i think most investors are very very familiar with the price earnings ratio for stocks um where you take a look at the price of the stock and you look at its earnings per sharing around a ratio so you kind of get an idea of it's it's valuation next to the underlying earnings activity from this business and of course these decentralized networks don't actually they are not businesses they don't generate income but they that are purely um investor assets um like gold for example so um what we can measure on the blockchain is the amount of investment activity that is happening and the the price in accordance to it and so we do get the equivalent of a price earnings ratio for bitcoin and ethereum and in these networks and like this one this one i came up with in 2016 i think i published around that or 2017 the start of it and it was it was one of our very first on-chain um signals for buy or sell when mvt is is low that would tell you that there's a lot of um so nvt stands for network value which is the market cap the valuation compared to the transaction volume the investment volume going through the blockchain and so when you see mvt being low that's signaling a very um high amount of investment volume moving through the blockchain and when it's comp as compared to the price and so um it's like a buy signal yeah it's an it's a currently there's immense amounts of on-chain invest activity crazy amounts of it and um the price is not that high compared to the activity so the ratio of price is not that high compared to the investors moving coins around and and wait and just for the um value of the transaction transactions on the network is that denominated in dollars you can you can do the ratio of volume you can do the volume um going through the blockchain per day compared to its market cap that's how that's a simple way of calculating it or simple way of thinking about it and that calculation works if you were to um you know streamline the calculation it just turns out to be how much the coins are churning compared to its supply and then but then is that the number of transactions no it's the volume it's you can say the us dollar you could say the u.s dollar value moving through the blockchain versus the market but if you were a technical analyst like me you'd say you can solve that equation to um saying that is actually inverse monetary velocity so how much of the money supply is churning so you can even do it like in the number of btc yeah so i can say there's 18 and a half there's 18.5 million btc and this is how many btcs that was transacted transacted and that's also the same thing oh wow okay so it turns out the highest sorry i just feel like the ratio would be quite different when the price is changing right or am i no i get right because the market never mind yeah because yes yeah exactly you divide by the price and you get the coins and you divide by the volume by price and you get how many coins as well yeah so um both solve to the same thing and so if you think of it in a more abstracted way as is monetary velocity how much of the money supply of bitcoin is churning um that's how much how much is moving between investors that that's actually all it is mvt is inverse monetary velocity and the more velocity you get in this thing um the higher the valuation um the higher the velocity the better um which is which is very healthy for the for the um the network and and it always turns out whenever you see this high velocity which is a low nvt it drives the bull market and we're we've been in that low zone for um a while now since the covert crash so it seems the covert crash the bottom cover crash made us hit the the buy signal on mvt and it's on the in this latest drive upwards with that immense amount of investment coming from you know the family offices and that i mentioned earlier were once again kissing the buy zone um so i guess i'm confused because i would think if it were a low velocity then that would make the number go up right because then it would right because low velocity is like people buying but then moving it to cold storage and not not trading it anymore whereas high velocity would be like like people constantly selling and buying right yeah um i think it's it's kind of counter-intuitive we are talking about the total supply and what actually what you do see um if for example if you were to get all of these holders at a long term and they come in and buy and then they they move it off the market and they become a liquid what you see is low velocity this is true and what happens is there's less volume that needs to to be um traded between investors to move the price because so much of it's locked up um that is true um and so what you what you'll see is these oscillations from um low and high nvt low low and high being the the buy in cell those oscillations still happen but they they start drifting as more get scooped up than locked away you'll start to see mvt start to drift higher and higher and higher but they oscillate and you'll see that in the main chart of nvt that is on my site you'll see that it is oscillating but it is drifting higher and um that's that's actually a consequence of people buying and locking up but it's also a consequence of a lot of coins now moving to exchanges and being held by um like retail who never actually move it off into their personal on-chain wallets and so that looks like um all of this volume and is being locked up um but it's just that it's not visible on the blockchain and you'll see that drifting higher okay well one thing um that was really really interesting to me um and i think this is why i kind of like the whole story of cryptocurrency is so exciting and interesting to me um because i just feel like these assets are like a completely new thing that hasn't been seen before in history and this one tweet of yours i feel like captured that in a certain way you said um well you talked about how um investors and tech vcs have different mindsets um so what would you say um is the mindset well first of all describe the two mindsets but then say what which of those mindsets people should have when it comes to bitcoin and why okay so um you know if you're coming from a traditional world and you're investing in these assets as um you know like you you want to buy an asset where you think it's undervalued and you want to sell it when um it reaches you know the high point of that's you know bull or beer cycle whether it's real estate you know we always want to buy the bottom of the market for the houses where no one wants to actually buy you buy it and then when the market's really really frothy maybe you sell there and that's the mindset of a lot of traditional assets and these are assets at saturation they've had centuries of developing and they oscillate and then you have this other type of asset which is what bitcoin ethereum and these these digital networks represent and they are these assets that are they're new to the world and these are new technologies that are gaining adoption and we in new technology always goes through this adoption curve we call it the adoption s-curve where it goes and it goes and it creates this kind of s as it sort of goes exponentially upwards and as you get closer to the 50 percent it slows down until you eventually get to saturation at near 100 usage and so we'll see that in the tech world with with the internet you'll see it with mobile phones you'll see it with any new technology and so the realm of investment for people who invest in new technology and these are our venture capitalists they know how to invest in new tech and they never sell the tops they buy the tops and this is the view that one should have with bitcoin um it's a newer technology and currently there's only somewhere around the 1.9 percent of the world population that has exposure to this asset and if you believe that the internet is going to go to 100 um which it's pretty close to now and you believe that we're going to have internet native commerce and there will be a internet native currency that is borderless and an internet native store of value then or in the case of ethereum actually applications that can route money and risk across the world these tokens are only at the two percent penetration of the world population and so when you see an asset break an all-time high you've got the choice to sell it because this asset is is really um made you a profit or you can say that asset is um just had another um validation that it is coming in to dominate the world you know if you're given a choice would you buy the asset that is um broken a all-time low and it's a new technology and it's continually making new lows and it's meant to dominate the world it's obviously gone off the adoption s-curve so whenever you see this thing breaking new high it is gaining more traction and it's being validated and you should buy it and you should sell it when it reaches saturation when when bitcoin is used by the majority of the world um then that's probably a good time to sell it but um just keep buying those tops and this strategy actually works in a back trace if you measure that and and run that strategy for bitcoin it is way more profitable than trying to get these oscillations all right well so speaking of tech um you said before you don't really cover ethereum and at last i spoke with you on unconfirmed you did however say at that time that you thought if could uh change in terms of you know whether or not it's kind of like an interesting asset to invest in if ethereum improvement proposal 1559 goes through which is the one where transaction fees will be burned and that could potentially make east deflationary um and since then we've seen ethereum 2.0 launch it does look like eip1559 should happen what is your take on ethereum for the foreseeable future in the in the short term um i'm quite excited with it because just on these um just like all-time highs it's it's about to break one and we've talked about the sort of outer space price discovery so bitcoins doing that right now ethereum is about to unleash it's um it's price discovery into outer space um so it's it's an it's a really exciting time for ethereum as a as a trade where i see it and i think it's you know we'll have to see like i i haven't been so excited with ethereum as the platform i know a lot of i know a lot of developers are and that's not to be discounted because there's a lot of frothiness and and excitement and that that that will drive and has driven application development and we've seen the the really great stuff and that's being developed on d5 i think it's that great experiments right now um so yeah let's let's see what happens um we need to see how well this thing scales how well um these apps can operate with each other on the on the the more scalable platform but it's an exciting space um these are these competitors of course and the question is whether or not um the big question i have for ethereum is ethereum going to be the global development stack in which you will build the risk infrastructure for the planet to route essentially i look at the the world financial market is just essentially computer programs or contracts that route money and risk between participants and ethereum is is the asset to route um primarily risk with the d5 and the question is will app developers only develop on ethereum or will it develop on solana will it develop on um cosmo like these these are all number of ethereum killers out there that that um are competing for this this these the app space and with if you look at the history of computers and and how things are developed you'll notice that um we haven't actually you know focused on one development platform like you look at any app there's all number of development platforms and application environments that we run on and so in each one is fit for a purpose so i i do wonder whether or not it'll be like a menagerie of different networks um that'll eventually fill um the space as we get towards that you know the whole carrying the world's real financial um infrastructure and so that's that's the question to ask um so we've definitely it's the leader right now and it's an exciting time for the asset but if we're to look at it over the next 10 years as world infrastructure gets digitized onto the internet we'll we'll have to see how that plays out yeah well actually you know when you were saying that you wondered if ethereum would be the global development stack i thought you were going to say settlement layer because of this thing with the occ allowing banks to use uh blockchain networks and stable coins and you know we're already seeing a lot of bitcoin coming to ethereum and um yeah yeah exactly it's that is what it's essentially doing is wrapping right we're wrapping us dollars onto ethereum we're wrapping bitcoins on ethereum so it's it's utilized as is the asset that's getting routed by these defined networks which are routing risk and settlement obviously with with um the stable coins but you'll also notice that um you know our first really widespread stable coin which is tether which is routed on ethereum was also routed on bitcoin as the omni layer and it was also routed on litecoin on the alumni layer and now it's also routable on solana's network um and so and i think tron as well so you can see how these the the underlying um stable coin can use any number of networks to route on and you know i could decide if i was the head of the stable coin to say why don't we use this network here because it's faster so it's just whether or not um these networks gain adoption ethereum's great because it's got that network effect of wallet infrastructure and well development infrastructure so it is very much a no-brainer to use that because that ecosystem is very well developed and well documented so it's a platform war i guess and i don't think it's necessarily going to be winner takes all it doesn't have that kind of network effect that you get with protocols protocols like tcpip are unifications of different menageries of communication lines and ethereum's not a um compatibility layer you know it's it's actually very much a environment that you program and and that's that and it's good for some things and there are environments that are better in other applications um so i i think it's really early for this i think we've still got 10 years ahead um at least for that side of things yeah so who knows i agree all right so let's uh shrink this down to um a time frame that's a little bit more manageable what do you think i mean i know you gave a price target for a bitcoin for this year but what else do you think people can expect from bitcoin in 2021. every cycle in bitcoin is really different um these different narratives different underlying drivers i'm just really excited to see how this one actually plays out we've we've been we've been thinking this is um institutionally driven will be insulationally driven um i said that like we thought it would be and right now the thing is i don't actually think it is i think it's it's driven by institutional um narrative in the institutions themselves saying yes we were we think this is good and we're going to deploy but right now i did not think that we would see so many family officers come in and just these high net worth guys coming in and buy so much that well they can probably move faster they can move faster yeah and so i didn't see that would be happening and then i think we've still got many institutions that have not deployed yet i think sovereign wealth will start to come in this year and then um we still got the retail guys to come in too so right now i'm looking at it and i'm going bitcoin is surrounded by all sides and they all think it's sexy and they all want in live retail doesn't realize yet that it's sexy and they want in um institutions are getting ready and right now um high net worth individuals are coming in by the droves and um i'm not sure how it all plays out um i think this double rally thing is is probably the most likely um because that's an immense amount of capital would come into this tiny little asset that's not broken one trillion dollars year so i don't know how it all went to play um i only get really a read of it up to maybe a month or six weeks ahead um and i have models that sort of say this thing's gonna break the model if it goes past here but i'm i'm like you laura i'm just watching this as we go i might have a little bit more foresight with the unchained data but i don't know how this is going to play out this year because there's so many um things that are arriving at the same time yeah all i know is i think it will be a very exciting year for all of us this was a life-changing for many bitcoiners here um so yeah yeah and fun for me um okay well where can people learn more about you and your work so primarily most of my stuff goes out on twitter at woonomic i i like to post most of my analysis there as much as possible if you would like um access to the newsletter go to willywoo.substack.com i put out a newsletter whenever the on-chain structure changes that'll give you a bull or beer call um so and also it helps investors navigate um the the spool cycle so that's available there you can just go to my twitter profile and it's got a link there and uh finally i put up a lot of free chats on charts.wubal.com and um you can you know explore that if you're a chat person and like visuals great well it's been so fun having you thanks for coming on unchained thank you laura it's been really awesome and fun as usual thanks so much for joining us today to learn
