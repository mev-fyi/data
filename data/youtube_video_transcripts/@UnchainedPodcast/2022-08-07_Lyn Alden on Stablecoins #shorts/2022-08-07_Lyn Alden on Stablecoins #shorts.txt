the stable coins was to me the clearest use case years ago bitcoin was the unit of account on offshore exchanges you'd use that as your trading pair and but with the introduction of stable coins uh it displaced bitcoin as the you know kind of the asset you go back to as your unit of account and then also you know we're seeing its usage in in you know for more practical purposes in these countries that are struggling with with currency crisis and you know an argentinian described it very well he's like you know i have local money for the next month and then i have dollar like stable coins for the next say six months 12 months 24 months and then anything that i want for like three to five year savings is you know in bitcoin or real estate things like that
