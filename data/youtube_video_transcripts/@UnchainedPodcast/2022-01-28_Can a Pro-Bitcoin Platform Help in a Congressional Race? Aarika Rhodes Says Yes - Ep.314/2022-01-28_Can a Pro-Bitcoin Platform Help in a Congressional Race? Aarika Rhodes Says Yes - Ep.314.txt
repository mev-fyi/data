mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the january 28 2022 episode of unchained with the crypto.com app you can buy earn and spend crypto in one place download and get 25 with the code laura link in the description today's guest is erica rhodes a democratic candidate for congress running against congressman brad sherman in california's 32nd district welcome erica hi thank you so much for having me you're an elementary school teacher how did you decide to run for congress so i decided to run for congress back in 2020 after coming off the democratic primary and i just felt like nobody was advocating for young people there was so much civic unrest lack of civil discourse and i just felt like it's time for new governance new leadership and the things that i care very very deeply about and i think that would make a difference in our country and my community i was like you know what i'm gonna go ahead and run i talked to my family about it and they were all super supportive and so here we are running against congressman brad sherman and i believe that you previously volunteered for andrew yang in his presidential campaign and he's well known for being an advocate for universal basic income what are the main goals and principles of your platform so our campaign is deeply rooted in you know education reform foster care reform and meaningfully addressing poverty so that's why like we are a very pro bitcoin campaign i think we're at a influx right now where you know we're throwing only money at problems we are we are seeing that we have politicians that only get their money from big banks corporation lobbyists pacs and the everyday person is being ignored and so that's a another root cause or an essential part of our campaign is making sure that people are at the forefront of the conversation and that we're always bringing it back to what everyday people care about so a new way of leadership community service and being active in the community and when you talk about how you're pro bitcoin how did you become interested in bitcoin so kids on my campaign when i first announced like when i first was like running they actually brought it up to me and i wasn't really like certain certain if it would comply with like the fec rules and regulations so i um was like you know i don't know if we can do that and so and i've never i've never ran for office before so i kind of like paused it a little bit and then brad sherman congressman bradstrom and had a hearing and completely went against crypto and bitcoin and the bitcoin community reached out to me we jumped on a call we had this really really long thoughtful conversation then it turned into other conversations and then i decided to go ahead and call the fec figure out how we can do it accounting wise and when i realized that this could be an essential part of our campaign not only were the kids really excited but we were really excited to be able to officially add it to our platform because we know that the big banks keep people impoverished we know that's a different way of finance and we know that one in six people have it and so it's an innovation that's not going away it's going to be as big as the internet and we want to be on the right side of history with that and we also want to bring new innovative ideas to government i think instead of them trying to regulate it and van it they should absolutely be embracing it and leaving it alone so it could be added to his form and when you say that this happened after a hearing in which brad sherman was really negative on bitcoin and crypto which one was it because that's happened multiple times so it happened around i want to say july june or july it was a few months ago like that was the one that i think set people off i want to say was around june or july okay okay and then are you pro crypto too or just pro bitcoin so i have personally put most of my energy in learning more about bitcoin the lightning network and uh really exploring like what that means i read the bitcoin standard so that and talking to people in the bitcoin community because they're the ones that reach out to me and they have offered to really really like educate me on it and so that's just who we've been um corresponding with and then i obviously own bitcoin so i hold bitcoin so that's just where i fall but having me in office is still a net benefit for anyone that holds cryptocurrency because i'm not wanting to like regulate it i i just think for it to be able to flourish and reach its full potential we need to leave it alone that's that's my opinion i don't know how you feel but i just don't think government should be involved in it and as we have mentioned so representative brad sherman he's called for a ban on crypto he's also mocked it for being speculative as you as we all know he is the one who was kind of you know mocking how there could be like a mongoose coin and a cobra coin and etcetera etcetera what is your response to his criticisms of bitcoin and cryptocurrency it's always you have not been to your community you have not spoken to members of your community because i personally have not met anyone that doesn't hold a cryptocurrency or bitcoin or ethereum anything and i have not met anybody that wants it banned or regulated even if people don't even understand crypto or bitcoin or blockchain any of it they don't even care to ban it and so to me i read it is like you're not in the community you have not even you can hold a town hall this is a very important issue to you and you think it it requires constituents being informed you could always hold a town hall on it and see how people feel about it and i think within a town hall you would be pleasantly surprised that nobody wants it banned so to me i read it as being out of touch and irresponsible and earlier i mean you kind of alluded to this but is is it generally that your sense is people buy and hold bitcoin or crypto because of this issue with big banks or like what is the motivation there that you hear from the people you would like to represent i hear people say that they find it to be they want their pro innovation and i think like just like for example the lightning network the fact that transactions can happen like this you don't have to wait for your four days you can be let's say in los angeles and your mom is in um argentina you can just send it immediately and you don't have to worry about the hassle of anything i think that attracts people that that the fast and the efficiency the low interest rates like if you have a bank you know the banking fees i think people keep people impoverished and and they can't get ahead so like if you overdraft and then you get a day for overdrafting by the time you get your next paycheck a fourth of that is gone therefore it's hard to pull yourself up in poverty and los angeles and our district is very expensive to live in so every dollar matters and i think people are you know kind of looking at other all alternatives to the traditional banking system and one of my favorite stories i like to tell is a veteran that actually helps on my campaign you know she was a veteran she came back she fell into poverty she got into bitcoin early pulled her out of poverty and now she has devoted her life to helping um people to community she participates in every drive that we do and candidates that are pro bitcoin and that's just what she has decided to do and she doesn't and she and this is all because she invested in it and so i think that her story is a lot of other people's stories i know a single mom a lot of people of color almost every person i know holds and so i think him trying to ban it is frustrating because it's like an investment that people have young people have it and you try to ban it it's almost like trying like you don't even care about the money that they put into this and i also want to say i think financial literacy should be taught in schools i think that that's really important you know when kids are graduating from high school they don't have a strong sense of personal finance they don't understand you know credit cards debt retirement uh anything like that so i think it's a problem okay so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about your views on that but first

code laura link in the description back to my conversation with erica when you talk about how you feel that personal finance should be taught in schools do you see bitcoin and crypto as being something that would be relevant in that or and if so like how would you kind of use it to teach that yeah i think that it should be a part of it because that's you know a huge part of our current financial system it's something that people care about i think educating people on all things finance is important you know from not just like from just like the traditional banking banking but had a budget you know what does it mean if you take out the student loan at x interest rate you know i think all across the board if it's pertaining to finance i think kids should know about it so earlier we talked about regulation and you you kind of alluded to you know your views there but let's unpack that a little bit more so you said you know you don't feel crypto should be regulated obviously there's a lot of regulators who don't necessarily have that view and the industry has done a lot of things from you know suggesting there just be one regulator as we know sec commissioner hester purse has recommended that there be a safe harbor for people that want to launch tokens other people think the cftc the commodities futures trading commission should be the default regulator for crypto so you know assuming that we can't just like not have it regulated at all like kind of which which route do you think is the best way to go if you're going to put things in place i think that before any member of congress votes they should be very well informed have an understanding of it meet with people that are experts in the industry and and really make sure that they know what they're doing before they they vote on any legislation that heavily regulates it that's my personal opinion i think what we're seeing right now even with that last infrastructure bill they slipped it in and the language was incorrect they didn't have any conversations from experts in the in the in the crypto space and that posed to be a real problem and i think what you'll what we also saw people are paying attention they organize and then they reach out to their elected officials and to fight this and i think that you know that is an indication that people really care about that and if we are there to represent people and they're using their voices to say please don't do this then i think we should take the time to listen more importantly i think being learners i think i i always approach things as trying to learn like i'm always trying to learn and i think that's what frustrates me not with just this topic but any topic there's no desire to listen to anyone and this i know all i know best well the way we've always done it doesn't work it doesn't work and so i think that's why we have to have new people in office that are going to bring a different perspective that our listeners and have different life experiences because it's not working and if it was working we wouldn't still have high poverty we wouldn't have an education system that when kids graduate they would fall right into remediation we wouldn't have a foster care system that we have we wouldn't have a health care system that's not working for people so what they're doing right now isn't working so again to the point is that i think that before they try to regulate things make sure they're well informed the federal reserve just released a report on central bank digital currency and they're going to be soliciting feedback what feedback would you give them on whether the us should issue a central bank digital currency well you know i don't know if i can speak on that because i have not seen that personally but um if they're just looking for feedback i think when they get the feedback really like consider what people are saying for better for worse i think they should really really take it not just do this we're going to get feedback but still do what we want to do like that because sometimes they these people do this so they say we'll get your feedback and input but we've already made a decision of what we're going to do so my advice would be really take the feedback but i haven't seen it i'll have to look that up and so obviously we saw that brad sherman uh when he uh talks about crypto he gets a lot of um uh what sort i guess social media heat and i've noticed that you have capitalized on that and like tweeted you know when he says something that the crypto community finds ridiculous what effect in general have you seen on your campaign from adopting a pro bitcoin platform well two things one i push back because i want to stand with this community and i want them to know that i will do the same in congress i believe that people speak with their deeds and so i really want to build trust that like i'm for real about this i hold myself so i'm not just like doing it for any other reason so that's why i push back normally i don't really talk about brad i don't believe you could teach an old dog new tricks so we're really focused on like our agenda what what we care about and that's very important to me um the second thing is what i love about this particular community is that there's like a call to action there there's intention behind it and it's like a community of learners people that really want to learn things like i better day i was like asking about like home ownership like is there a way that we can advance this to where you know how when you buy a home through the baking system you have to get like a loan and stuff how can we do that through this space like or have we talked about that is there any information um how much how how much of job creation has come out of this space like so and everyone's so quick to give articles and and multiple articles not just one it's typically not biased so i think that's really important to note so secondly it's tremendously helped my campaign because you know i'm an elementary school teacher running and just to be able to accept cryptocurrency bitcoin has allowed us to be competitive against brad sherman because the of the lightning network the lightning network through open node does not take the same amount of percentage that akbu takes and so that allows us to keep the most capital to be able to have a genuine chance at unseating him so it's been really really helpful for me to because i work full-time while i'm doing this and when you accept bitcoin campaign donations does your merchant processor does it immediately convert the bitcoin to dollars or do you keep it in bitcoin it has to convert because that's the fec compliance okay yeah and for people uh who don't know fec i think is federal election commission so yes sorry i i'm sorry i shouldn't yeah no no no it's okay i meant to say that earlier and i i just forgot and obviously you have seen this tremendous impact of being pro bitcoin on your platform on your campaign donations what effect do you think crypto in general will have on the midterms in 2022 i think it's gonna have a profound impact i think people really care about this a lot of people are single issue voters um i think people want new ideas and you know this is just a a space that people really i think that some that people really care about and so you have candidates like myself from wendy matthew from ohio that are leading the charge like as democrats and then um saying that like yo y'all need to wake up like it's time for new things and i so i think if if we win our races being pro bitcoin or crypto whatever you are i think if we win our races i think it's going to have a profound impact not only on um the future of politics but especially the presidential runs i really do and so you mentioned you're a democrat and i i mean it's not 100 but probably more of the prominent anti-crypto voices have tended to be democrats such as elizabeth warren or brad sherman what message would you have for other democrats about bitcoin and or crypto so one thing that i will do if i get the good fortune of serving the 32nd district is i am going to join the blockchain caucus um we initially said that we wanted to start our own but there was already one and i find this to be very interesting that there's 17 democrats and 18 republicans on that particular caucus it's super bipartisan and i think that this space should remain a nonpartisan issue that's my personal opinion i think anyone that wants to have it should be able to have it regardless of their par their party affiliation i think that is one of the most beautiful things about it and i and i really advocate for it to stay that way second i personally plan to sign on the bills that protect innovation in the united states i think that's really important we need to lead anything innovative like we did with the internet thirdly i am going to make it my business to to educate people on it especially because i want to now i haven't decided that i in addition to the educational labor committee i want to sit on financial services because i'm realizing like those two committees are incredibly important to our platform and for the things that i really care about when it comes like foster care environment education reform banking system campaign for all that stuff i need to be on those two committees and so when i will get to be in those hearings and i'll be able to ask very different questions because what's happening is they're asking questions that always try to show it in a negative way and i think that's dangerous i think you also have to show the net benefits and so that is something that i personally plan on doing when elected and brad sherman will be a factor because we'll be unseating him so i just have one more comment on because i think this is important for me you can't say that you're for working people that you care about poverty and be anti because the banking system keeps people impoverished in different ways check cashing companies pawn shops those should not be financial institutions for people so i think that's what we need for them to understand if they don't already understand how the interest rates work with a check cashing in a pawn shop that's that's the other thing too i just want to put you can't be say you're for the people and be against it because this is like and for the people technology and innovation yeah yeah it definitely seems probably more aligned with a lot of the democratic platform than the republican um although weirdly the more vocal pro voices tend to be republican so it's it's a conundrum how this all works i did also want to ask about the fact that a lot of people take issue with the environmental impact of proof of work mining which is used in both bitcoin and ethereum although next year ethereum is shifting away from that and obviously the democrats like yourself tend to be more in favor of environmentally friendly policies so what's your take on the environmental impact of proof-of-work mining and how do you square that with your environmental concerns so i care very deeply about the environment i'm a science teacher so um it's it's it's really important to me um well i and that was some questions that i had on the onset when i was meeting with you know leaders of the space the space and what i appreciate is that there is a huge intention on you know mining the bitcoin in solar using wind power methane renewable gas and i also think that there is that when we talk about energy there's a lot of energy waste on and that we day to day use in general so i think if we're gonna have the energy conversation then we need to have it completely and fully and not just put it on bitcoin mining i think that we need to talk about like if i'm like at home and my my washer is on like like mode whatever i would i forget the what's it called like if it's just like a standby mode that's why i had a brain part standby mode well then we need to talk about that you gotta factor that into or during christmas and all the christmas lights and the energy that that uses so we're going to talk about energy let's really talk about it completely and not just put it on on the mining we talk about the the energy use in the banking system we could talk about the energy you know so so i think that the there they are trying to be more environmentally friendly and i do think that they're cognizant of it and so i i just think we do need to give because in its emphasis still i still like to think it's in its beginning stages the opportunity to make whatever adjustments to be made and allow it to grow because that's that's just the nature of it right now is there anything else you would like the crypto community to know about you i think this is very important to me so in addition to obviously skating with this community i do really care about foster care reform education reform and i think that those are topics that are really important and i hope that you know other people like people can see me as not only like in that i only support this but also for other really great things and i genuinely do want to make a difference in congress you know i wouldn't put my whole life on hold just to be just to be running like i have no dreams of being a senator i'm definitely never going to run for president or anything like that i really just want to serve in congress and make a difference and i appreciate all the support and love that i have gotten received i do not take any of it for granted and this is really important to me too is i really there's a lot of distrust in this space from with like politicians and and elected officials because they say one thing and they do another i cannot wait to to show i'm a person of my word but through my actions like i can't wait to get there and really be like okay she's a real one like she she did what she said she's gonna do so please hold me accountable you have it on i'm on record obviously but know that i'm well intentioned and i'm really truly running for the right reasons i really really care about these things great well where can people learn more about you all right so you can visit my website ericaforcongress.com f-o-r and um you can follow me on social media but it's all on our website perfect all right well thank you so much for coming on unchained thank you so much for having me don't forget next up is the weekly news recap thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap the imf

meta was facebook however as as has been the case with many dm stories the project was never launched a new bill could be disastrous for crypto a provision tucked inside the recently proposed america competes act could prove disastrous for cryptocurrency says coin center's executive director jerry brito essentially the provision gives the treasury secretary currently janet yellen the power to use special measures to police technology helping facilitate money laundering rito says that using special measures the treasury secretary could make it illegal for financial institutions to transact with foreign crypto exchanges miners outside the u.s and or non-custodial wallets if they deem such entities to be a primary money laundering concern notably brito says that the provision would eliminate any public process regarding the implementation of such regulation the proposed language and the america competes act would and we cannot stress this enough remove all formal controls time limits and public notice requirements from the imposition of these draconian measures rope burrito that being said kristen smith executive director of the blockchain association reported on tuesday that her organization has had constructive dialogue and that this is not another infrastructure situation her colleague jake travinsky added that he is optimistic that today's legislative situation will end up fine the white house is set to issue an executive order on crypto the biden administration is planning on releasing a government-wide strategy for digital assets as soon as february according to bloomberg the biden administration will be publishing a strategy through an executive order that will ask federal agencies such as the federal stability oversight council to determine the risks and opportunities associated with cryptocurrencies via a report due in the second half of 2022. the article citing people familiar with the matter says officials have held multiple meetings on the plan the administration is also looking into the possibility of a central bank digital currency ftx u.s raises nearly half a billion dollars ftx us the us-based affiliate of sam bankman freed's

8 billion the sec doesn't like microstrategy's bitcoin accounting process in a letter released last friday the securities and exchange commission rejected microstrategy's bitcoin accounting method found in an earnings report the sec's letter dated december 3rd went as follows and refers to a standard known as generally accepted accounting principles we object to your adjustment for bitcoin impairment charges in your non-gaap measures please revise to remove this adjustment in future filings this came in response to microstrategy reporting non-gaap numbers for its bitcoin holdings in its previous filings as currently constituted companies are required to adjust the value of bitcoin on their balance sheets when the price falls in accounting language this is called impairment however when the price of bitcoin rises the company cannot readjust the price of bitcoin on its balance sheet this quirk in gaap accounting essentially forces companies with bitcoin on their balance sheets to record their bitcoin holdings at the price it paid for or lower while this is only a paper quirk as one could look up the amount of a company's bitcoin holdings and the current value of bitcoin recording bitcoin as an impairment affects the net worth of a company and therefore its value to investors this is most likely why microstrategy reported non-gaap numbers in its earlier filings and wanted to make its bitcoin holdings look better however microstrategy has agreed to stop its non-gaap reporting microstrategy reported holding 124 391 bitcoin or 4.5 billion dollars worth on december 30th 2021. solana's spotty performance irks high profile traders while the crypto markets underwent a heavy dip last weekend solana experienced high levels of network congestion due to excessive

cartoon character dozens of grimace coins popped up on blockchains according to decrypt one such grimace coin on binance smartchain saw its price jump 120 000 in 24 hours ethereum 2.0 is no more the terms eth1 and eth2 are being phased out instead ethereum 1.0 will now be referred to as the execution layer and ethereum 2.0 the consensus layer the ethereum foundation wrote in a blog post one major problem with the eth2 branding is that it creates a broken mental model for new users of ethereum they intuitively think that youth one comes first and eth2 comes after or that eth1 ceases to exist once eth2 exists neither of these is true by removing eth2 terminology we save all future users from navigating this confusing mental model thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about
