is it gonna stop all together probably not but will it be harder yeah in some respects I think that removing this crutch of we're gonna have all these Banks help us out just intermediate them is a good thing because then people focus on like what we're actually here to do which is build a financial system that is parallel not in conjunction with um that system and so the stablecoin ecosystem needs some changes uh there's nothing particularly I find wrong with the fact of like you know a tether a circle a busd it's just that we have these things that people rely on to trade and yet these things must have a banking partner to hold the dollars and so you're saying hey I'm going to issue this token that completely destroys your Global transaction Banking and FX businesses because it moves 24 7 and essentially for free versus your nine to five Monday to Friday thing that you can charge egregious
