head of social impact and diversity programming at consensus welcome Robbie hey the wider discussion on racism in the US has also been part of the conversation in the crypto community in the last couple weeks and you've been pretty vocal about your views before we get into exactly what they are why don't you give us your background in crypto how did you get into the space and what have you been doing yeah absolutely and thank you for having me I'm sorry I got into the space around 2011 and by way of one of my friends Cunard at the University of Michigan and at the point at that point is really just a conversation about Bitcoin and I was actually very critical I was like why we need this you know what what is the difference between you know this you know kind of storoe backstory but a value at the time and gold and but somehow I used the only money that I had at the time around $1600 I think they closed up like $40.00 and just just put in and actually did a lot of trading amongst a lot of them varsity athletes at the University of Michigan and because of my engineering background I started a transition after the 2013 crash and was like okay maybe I should do the more technical things on here and since then you know have been you know supporting the efforts of the development of a lot of blocking practices primarily at Cisco at first with the IRC trust Alliance brokering our relationship with iota and then most recently with consensus and what I deal with emerging in fact in the social sector alright so we'll dive a little bit more into that history in a second but in general why don't we just start with the topic that's been discussed a lot these last few weeks so in general how would you say the crypto community handles issues of diversity and inclusion and racism yes unfortunately poorly and you would think because the average age in the crypto communities is relatively low I mean we have a very very young and vibrant community and you would think with that a lot of the generational angst you know with regards to dealing with diversity inclusion that you may see in traditional tech wasn't inherited you know by a lot of black Jain companies because a lot of more are quite literally led by you know 20-something 30-something good you know just but unfortunately that that hasn't been the case and that you know level of libertarianism and maximalists in terms of decentralization haven't followed into the social sphere that affects you know marginalized communities not not in recruiting not in funding when it comes to startups and not in you know developing influencers across the space when we see the same set of speakers that you know at every conference around the world you quite literally see the same people around the world in general when it comes to the community and that's an area where I think we're a bit hypocritical to espouse how we're going to systematically change you know governance finance all these elements of society but we're not looking at some of the issues in our current system that need be rectified even going to looking at the token taxonomy frameworks behaviors and how overdraft right is a listed token behavior it's like no that's that's a systemic way to tax people who are poor who can't clean or you know they're overdraft advances so it really is kind of structurally embedded unfortunately and and how we operate so you wrote this really grave essay in coined us this week and I'm just going to quote some select portions of it but you can also you know add to whatever I've said to flush out your views but some of the lines that really stuck out at me were things like you said quote the crypto community is conveniently selective about what aspects of society it wants to change you also called out some racist posts that were retweeted by Nick Szabo who some people surmise could be Satoshi Nakamoto and you you were not the first person on Twitter to point these out there was somebody else I don't know if you saw this he screenshotted over the course of a few years a number of posts and and you know I have to say as a journalist who used to follow Nick Szabo I had noticed that as well and I actually stopped following him because the the vibe from those posts was so toxic isle I couldn't take it anymore but I I do ya feel somewhat amazed at my blind spot like why didn't I think to do a story on that it just was like oh this guy is annoying like but anyway the other quote that I liked from your piece was you said quote the truth is most major blotching companies and crypto personalities refused to publicly stand in solidarity against police brutality and racism fearing the retribution of white supremacist trolls more than valuing the lives of their black colleagues friends and employees so now that you've been pretty vocal about your views what has the reaction been from the wider crypto community yeah yeah it certainly got a dose of vitriol I'm used to this right you know this is not you know being being a black you know man this is not my first encounter with racism or the discussion about racism or the reaction to the discussion about racism you know at all and it was interesting right when coined us had posted that arm on Twitter almost immediately right we saw all these different types of arguments that are typically used in this conversation like math has no race or you know are you but I have heard about something or what about black on black crime which I somehow works its way into any discussion I'm not sure how and so I wanted to take a very logical approach to not only calling some of these things out in terms of the level of courage that any particular brand or influencer needs to have to do this but also to look at the statistics right you know black on black crime is it's a myth it's no more prevalent than don't like farmer you know an agent crime or Hispanic on Hispanic crime crime is more closely correlated with poverty and typically it happens between people who know each other and because America has incredibly segregated neighborhoods most likely a crime is going to be between two people of the same ethnicity and and it's the same is true in terms of the motivation right of a lot of these protests I think that's confused and in all this to say that you take these different arguments that have been strategically and politically used by you know what is now called the alt-right but is really just you know white supremacist and and it changes the topic to people no one but not you know black people Asian people anyone no one should be you know killed or murdered from unnecessary police brutality particularly when there are unarmed and we see other developing and developed nations you know see unarmed police forces to stop that but in addition this is not a political issue it's a human rights issue and it's a need to systemic imbalances existed long before we were able to record the death of George Floyd or you know Trayvon Martin right which happened almost ten years ago and until we confront that in any in a meaningful way now just via Twitter but through policy both in our companies but also in terms of legislature we're not gonna have we're gonna keep on having this conversation and and my fear is is that the only turning point will be when there's a mass protest and people actually get killed in the protest much like we see in Egypt and in Lebanon and in Venezuela right and oftentimes you know Americans kind of take the moral high ground when looking at those situations from afar not realizing that our society is slowly devolved into the same type of brutalized protest alright so in a moment we're gonna discuss more about diversifying the crypto space but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible in this crisis many investors aim to keep and grow their digital assets others seek to maximize the yield on their cash next allows you to achieve both of these goals the company offers instant crypto credit lines against all major cryptocurrencies with interest rates starting from only 5.9 percent APR next o also allows you to earn

centralized trading while preserving complete control of your assets 24/7 want the edge head to de ve are s IFI comm and learn more today back to my conversation with Robbie Greenfields I actually want to ask you about this one tweet storm that you wrote and it began cryptocurrency would not exist without black people right there yeah yeah yeah absolutely this was a talk that I did at a protect a while and I was even ignorant so we talked about you know tokenization obviously you know a continuation of the evolving form of how the transfer value right and that's from a lot of different different you know things different peoples different cultures right so it's not to say that you know black people like are the sole reason why cryptocurrency exists but it is to say that the prevalence of fiat currency only came into fruition through the US government and in two particular historical instances made this happen one the funding of Union troops right during the Civil War who desperately needed to defeat the south at the time which was one of the economic centers of the world I don't think people realize how much fuel the cotton and textile industry and the loan industries that came off of that globally really created with the economy that we have today and created the financial centers like New York in fact back then there were more millionaires per capita I believe in Mississippi than there were in New York and this has changed over time in that experiment right that Abraham Lincoln took in leveraging fiat currency which was you know more just broadly understood as we all agree this has value rather than being backed by gold or silver like the pound led into the Nixon years where we'd quite literally came off of the gold standard after establishing it and this is the history right of how money has evolved and how tokenization when we see the tokenization of assets and even you know stable coins in terms of store value money that's the evolution that has followed and that some of the people the first people who were securitized were also black people we look at Monticello and Thomas Jefferson that was funded from a loan collateralized by slaves and also built by slaves so the complexities in terms of how finance has evolved is very deeply intertwined into this systemic racism you know that I caught it on and that people you know unfortunately push off as or minimize as oh well they said the n-word or oh well they didn't let this person into you know this apartment complex right and it's really a lot more than that I would actually love to be called the n-word and have systemic racism gone and I have this superficial racism right exist I can deal with that mentally and emotionally you know but but the constraints that the systemic aspect has quite literally change people's life trajectories in terms of whether they can be an entrepreneur whether they could be hired how much access to credit they get and and you know how that affects their livelihoods yeah I don't know if people know this story but um senator Cory Booker from New Jersey often talks about this in his life trajectory where his parents had been looking for a home in a suburb of New Jersey that had good schools and it was considered a white neighborhood and they kept being told that these houses that they thought sale were not available and this organization I can't remember they must have just worked on like fairness and housing or something got white people to go as decoys after they had gone to these houses and found that the houses were suddenly available and this kept happening and so eventually they picked the house they wanted and when they showed up to sign the papers you know the sellers were surprised because they thought it was getting a white couple buying it and that was how Corey ended up I'd you know in this great school district of course he like went to Stanford was a Rhodes Scholar went to Yale Law School now as a u.s. I mean he's like you know super successful but yet that's like just one story about how systemic racism or in that case the the fight against it or winning the fight against it and when instance did have a positive outcome all right so let's talk about what you did at consensus in regards to social impact you know what problems were you trying to resolve there and how can cryptocurrency or blockchain technology help yeah yeah absolutely so this was we started this in 2017 at my colleagues Vanessa gray and then siegel and and at the time the social sector is about a year behind the commercial sector when it comes to the usage of any emerging technology and so in 2017 that was their blockchain 101 year and coalition-building year but then after in 2018 in subsequent years we started to see really the need and the yearning is to want to leverage this technology in the field and we covered a variety of use cases including developing tamper proof evidence in syria to convict people of war crimes in international criminal court we use the same you know basic approach in terms of the technology with sexual assault forensic kits which domestically are also treated terribly and a lot of those cases don't reach any meaningful agreement or resolution after sometimes decades and then also we focused on cash assistance programs you know and we see this a lot now this has become incredibly prevalent today because of coke at 19 so you know for those who aren't familiar with cash assistance programs this is any for of cash benefit that you get from an NGO or government entity so that includes unemployment that includes food stamps or supplemental nutritional assistance programs like snap or EBT and and it also includes a lot of refugee cash assistance programs that we see in California and in New York and then outside of that a lot of climate change initiatives in terms of how we can create more equity in balance and accountability within a carbon offset markets and that's of course been a huge thing because around the end of 2019 we saw the Amazon forest California and Australia all on fire at the same time and now la is on fire right now and a lot of these underlying systems have had a lot of fraud in it etc so you know that that's been kind of our body of where we've worked with the United Nations World Food Program World Wildlife Fund Red Cross Oxfam international and in our role as emerging impacts given that consensus and started to focus on enterprise finance we've continued that work and really focus on expanding a lot of these pilots to to impact change and you know what would you suggest are some good ways to use this technology to address this specific issue here in the US that we've been discussing and you know I know that you listen to the interview I did with Stephen Mackay last week and one question I asked him I just want to ask it of you as well I know you saw that coin based survey where they did ended up with a report called black Americans in crypto and one of the most interesting parts of it to my mind was that black Americans showed more interest than any other group in cryptocurrency and you know for that reason you would expect to see kind of that they're working in crypto in a higher proportion than they are in the general population but that's not the case so I wondered you know why you thought blacks were under representing underrepresented in crypto what we knew to bring them in the fold but also how we could the three-part question how we could use go to currency to address issues of racism in the US yeah yeah absolutely certainly a load but one that I think starts with economic opportunity and then ends with you know entrepreneurial opportunities as well so in terms of you know education I think it's one understanding what's the difference between being a normal and engineer and a blockchain engineer there are many black engineers you've seen esby society is one that houses many across all the colleges within the US and of course a lot of other organizations as well like black girls code that find people when they were younger and trying to teach them these technical skills but a lot of those programs are lacking emerging technology aspects so that the people can leverage those skills which is 90% fits speak spoken from somebody who has created boxing applications it's 90 percent of the skills you need and just understanding the basics of okay what about smart contracts solidity and how does that play into developing an application so that way you can at least be a great candidate if you're not an entrepreneur to work at a coin base or a consensus or securitize and in many of those organizations constantly say that they have a need for engineers I think this the second thing is exposure so the black community I found is extremely financially conservative because we typically you know on average don't have the means to to freely invest right we don't have a lot of free capital that we can just put toward a project or put towards cryptocurrency and letting people understand some of the basic things that we were all learning when we got into it that you don't have to buy one whole Bitcoin right and spend ten thousand dollars or one whole either you can put ten dollars you know via via coinbase and and just give yourself that comfort that's needed even if you don't make a million dollars off of it right and look in the first you know 12 months or so but it also gets them understand okay you know how do these wallet you know things work and out all these ancillary services that revolve around tokens operate and then the third is entrepreneurial opportunities and this is where I think it's less of a yearning is to understand how blockchain technology can map to problems because I've seen many founders of colors do that very very well both in the United States but also in countries abroad the DEF CON Scholars program that we did with the theory and foundation I think perfect highlight on how well and how smart a lot of these individuals are but the issue is the access to capital is just not there and we have to break this this stereotypically successful founder from just being a white male to being other people I understand that the venture capital community is very much focused on protocols but I think another unattended space that I've seen working in emerging markets is getting everybody else you know you know involved right how do you create mass adoption in low connectivity or low literacy environments because at the end of the day when we talk about mainstream adoption and many volcanoe plication z-- do it's almost as if we're only talking about the west and not talking about billions of people right that could use the same simple services that we've created here in extremely powerful ways and and what does that mean for a company that that that unlocks that potential I'd imagine they'd be valued you know pretty well you know so but that that focus hasn't existed so those kind of three things or what I've seen and why I found it's so important to write that article to say that no you know this hat this is soft we can't be more pack we can't be passive about it I mean 2020 has been a hell of a year and you know I think it's the year for that particular message to come through with many others all right well I'm so glad that you came on the show where can people learn more about you and emerging impact yeah absolutely so everything about me and emerging impact the same place just emerging impact calm if you want to see the work that we've done by consensus you can just google consensus social impact and you'll see all the projects in the case studies associated with them and love to work partner and help anyone that we can so great well thank you so much for coming undone confirmed appreciate it don't forget stay tuned for the weekly news recap stick around for this week in

based analytics has always been kept completely separate from coinbase internal data noting that it is sourced from online publicly available data the response on crypto twitter can basically be summed up with this tweet you can't buy bad press like that seriously consensus is also getting into the analytics game with the launch of code Phi compliance a compliance and analytics feed that focuses on D Phi and aetherium and can track up to 280,000 tokens the crypto Twitter take I thought the main point of D Phi was not to have kyc consensus said this would not reveal personally

network next headline ye IP 155 9 is the biggest change to how users bid for a block space DARAB it had an interesting post this week analyzing a new aetherium improvement proposal Sigmund it would be a significant change for users miners and wallet providers and would be the largest change to how users bid for blocks based on any of the major block chains first it proposes that as much as possible all transactions should pay the same fee rate with users deciding whether to pay the fee or not and not how much to bid second it would allow for more variation in block size to account for the fact that demand for block space fluctuates this would also allow some blocks to be larger and other smaller while enforcing an average block size limit third it would untie network security from transaction fees by instead burning transaction fees and incentivizing minors to a perpetual block subsidy finally by enforcing that transactions burn a specific amount of eath it would also help preserve the monetary premium of eath next headline well out know this is fun bits fun business a second Winklevoss movie Bitcoin billionaires is coming to the big screen there will be a movie made
