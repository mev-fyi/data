we make this mistake time and time again in this industry we place someone on a pedestal we make them invaluable we make it a crime to ask them questions to the point that we will harass and send death threats to people who are making that critique and what happens is that those people who always want to put up that wall uh and be invaluable end up being the ones who are the villains of the space they become these main characters and we find out it's all smoke and mirrors the part of the value of the blockchain is the transparency and we should welcome critique and criticism because that allows us to make our projects stronger we want to have stakeholders in this space who are willing to make mistakes learn from them explain them in the open get involved and iterate to make this space stronger and if we keep on putting people on pedestals we are only ever going to be disappointed
