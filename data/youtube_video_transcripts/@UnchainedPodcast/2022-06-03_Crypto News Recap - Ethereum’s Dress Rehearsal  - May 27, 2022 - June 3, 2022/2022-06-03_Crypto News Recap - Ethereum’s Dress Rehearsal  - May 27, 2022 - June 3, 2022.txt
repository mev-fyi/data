[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap ethereum's big dress rehearsal for the merge is underway ethereum's oldest proof-of-work testnet has begun its transition to proof-of-stake according to ethereum core developer tim baiko who described the event as the network's first dress rehearsal for minors the transition better known as the merge is scheduled to occur on the robston test net around june 8th about 10 days after a new robston beacon chain was launched on may 30th rosten must activate its bellatrex upgrade to make the proof of work chain merge compatible and trigger a terminal total difficulty or ttd hash rate number on the proof of work chain once both of those occur which is estimated to be around june 8th the merge should occur in two epochs or approximately 13 minutes this is the final testing stage for ethereum previously testing had been implemented on clients and shadow forks roxton is the first public test net to undergo the merge after robston gourley and sipolia will also be put to the test the roxton news comes just a week after ethereum's beacon chain experienced a seven-block reorg meaning two beacon chains were briefly running in parallel as nodes attempted to find consensus due to some validators running updated software which processed blocks faster than others eventually after seven blocks the validators agreed on the correct chain resolving the discrepancy the core issue of the reorg was validators not running upgraded software it will be mandatory to upgrade before the merge occurs speaking of ethereum and the merge a recent report from ethereum researcher danny ryan noted that liquid staking services like lido where users can earn proof of stake yield without locking their tokens into the beacon chain pose significant risks to ethereum notably ryan suggests that liquid staking protocols should self-limit the amount of eth they stake to avoid centralization and overall system risk for example ryan wrote if pooled stake under one liquid staking derivatives protocol exceeds 50 percent this pooled stake gains the ability to censor blocks in a regulatory censorship attack we now have a distinct entity the governance token holders that a regulator can make requests of censorship depending on the token distribution this is likely a much simpler regulatory target than the ethereum network as a whole roll up token op stumbles upon roll out optimism the second largest ethereum roll-up by total value locked officially launched its governance token op on tuesday via an airdrop that saw 50 of op's supply released however the token drop was not without its issues as op started trading hours before the official optimism website was ready to go due to traders claiming op tokens directly from optimism's smart contracts the early op trading took the optimism team by surprise we have not officially announced yet but we're already experiencing an all-time high demand the team tweeted on tuesday afternoon we're working to heavily provision more capacity before our official announcement in the meantime the public rpc may respond slowly during the time op became available via smart contract and the optimism front end was ready the token dropped from a high of four dollars and forty cents to around one dollar giving the highly skilled one three users interacting directly with the smart contracts a huge advantage in trading the airdrop at 11 am we deployed and loaded our smart contract with the op tokens for drop number one optimism explained our biggest mistake here was failing to make this contract possible claims were open and we had no way to stop them op is trading at a dollar and twenty nine cents giving optimism a fully diluted market capitalization of five point four billion dollars this comes in a bit lower than masari's projection of a launch market cap of roughly nine billion the op token will be used in the optimism collective token house one of two entities that will help govern the optimism treasury and network over the coming years the cftc goes after gemini the u.s commodities futures training commission is reportedly suing the crypto exchange gemini on thursday bloomberg revealed the regulator is accusing gemini of having misled the cftc in answers to questions about the trading of a potential futures contract pegged to the price of vtc on gemini's platform in 2017 and is alleging that the winklevoss lead exchange has violated the commodity exchange act along with various regulations solana goes down again according to data from solana's status page the mainnet blockchain went down for four hours and 10 minutes on wednesday the network was restarted late wednesday afternoon after coordination by solano validators on a google doc based on a report from solana the network was taken down due to a durable non-spug that led to non-determinism in the blockchain where nodes generated different results for the same block notably this affected withdrawals from major exchanges as explained by stakewiz.com a solana validator on twitter a durable nonce is a way in which a transaction can be signed offline ahead of time without requiring a recent block hash which expires after two minutes usage has recently increased particularly by exchanges possibly due to their cold storage setups network outages are becoming a trend for solana the network also faced two hours and five hours of downtime respectively on april 30th and may 1st of this year solana also experienced down times of 16 8 and 10 hours in january 2022 and 17 hours in september 2021. furthermore solana recently lost track of real-world time and is currently 30 minutes behind schedule due to slot times executing at a slower than expected pace while this does not have any real effect on the network it does hold economic consequences for the sole stakers as slower slot times mean less staking rewards tara suffered a 90 million dollar hack months ago and nobody noticed until now a 90 million exploit from october on mirror protocol a synthetic asset platform on terra was discovered this week by a blockchain analyst who goes by the moniker fat man blocksec a blockchain security firm also confirmed the exploit due to buggy code a hacker was able to drain 90 million dollars from mirror due to a flaw that allowed an attacker to use a list of duplicate ids to unlock more collateral than they had the bug has since been rectified though it is unclear whether mirror developers were aware of the hack when fixing it mirror joins ronin as the second time a significant hack went unnoticed for a substantial period despite the public on-chain nature of the exploits in addition to the 90 million hack fat man also pointed out another mirror attack that allegedly happened this week which saw over 2 million trained from the protocol due to a bug in the lunar classic pricing oracle as a press time this has yet to be confirmed tech experts criticize crypto a group of 26 tech experts in academics published a letter to u.s lawmakers that took aim at the crypto industry the group included the principal engineer at google cloud kelsey hightower harvard lecturer bruce schneier along with noted crypto critics david gerard molly white and steven deal the group urged pro crypto lawmakers such as senators ron wyden patrick toomey and maxine waters to take a skeptical approach towards crypto assets and to resist pressure from crypto lobbyists because blockchain technology will remain forever unsuitable as a foundation for a large-scale economic activity five on-chain stats to summarize may the first stat three through the end of may only three tokens in the top 100 by market cap bitfinex's leo tron's trx and paxos's pax gold are up year to date notably tara classic is down 100 year-to-date but is still the 82nd largest asset by market capitalization the second stat 53 000 on may 31st optimism saw 53 000 unique addresses do something on its blockchain its previous all-time high 13 300. the third stat 228.51 bitcoin's hash rate hit an all-time high on may 6th at 228.51 tara hatches fourth stat 51.75 ethereum nft sales volume more than halved in may compared to april according to data from cryptoslam interestingly solana nft volume only decreased by 18.43 and finally 105.52 billion dollars the difference between the d5 market cap on may 1st and may 31st total value locked across the d5 ecosystem fell from 247 billion dollars to 142 billion dollars in may as data from d5 llama shows time for fun vids if kobe were in charge nobody would get an airdrop optimism's airdrop as explained above was somewhat controversial this week due to a messy rollout the air trap became even more contentious this week when xerox john posted on optimism's governance forum calling for all op sellers to be cut off from future op air drops kobe a pseudo-famous crypto expert took umbrage with the idea in his troll-centric way i was extremely pleased to see this proposal cancelling the future airdrops of those who have sold their initial op airdrop seems sensible well-considered and targets the heart of any crypto protocol the price of its token wrote kobe in his parity governance proposal he went on to propose exceedingly sarcastic ideas like cancelling the op airdrop for actresses that sold any tokens in the past six months physically beating up any op sellers and my favorite considering issuing debt tokens that are acceptable by local debt collection agencies as an added revenue stream for optimism seems like the optimism governance structure is off to a good start this week in crypto adoption space burritos and kanye despite a down market c gemini laying off 10 of its staff due to a
