for 2019 thank you it's an interesting list as it always is and I always appreciate the great work that coin desk does for the industry so it's it's exciting to see and the art looks amazing by the way yeah I actually voted for you or nominated you because just if I thought over some of the big moments of the past year obviously the congressional testimony isn't around Libra were a huge watershed moment and I really felt like your speech in particular was probably the OMG moment within those hearings because you know at that time you just had such a clear voice expounding on the benefits of Bitcoin and decentralisation and then also if I look back I also felt like that moment where I knew through coins out of the toilet at magical crypto was truly memorable so for you when you look back at the year how would you sum it up what do you think were the big developments of 2019 yeah I think first of all thank you I really appreciate your support I know we've known each other for a long time and it's been such a pleasure and so I appreciate those kind words and generally I think everyone in the crypto community if I can call it that has been very supportive it feels like this year people started to collaborate a bit more um although now at the end of the year feel like we're sliding back into some of the tribalism of one of the things this year that for me was really interesting not on a personal level but just at a global macro level is I think the environment we've been in for the last ten years if I look at the last decade which is really the first decade in in history that we've had Bitcoin because the Bitcoin network launched in 2010 as I look back on the last decade and what's really started to come through in the narrative this year is this general sense that the world were living from an economic perspective from political perspective from a social perspective and from a technical sort of technology shift perspective there are a lot of concerns about how unsustainable the world we're living in is and that's been really interesting to see this year how all of these different narratives that have been evolving and really brewing for the last decade are all coming to a head in this really fascinating series of events if we look at all of the drama around Briggs it and the dissolution of you know the the eurozone if we look at what's happening in Hong Kong if we look at what's happening in Venezuela there's been just so many shifts in our world that have been a result they think of a lot of things that have culminated over the last decades since the financial crisis in 2009 and the subsequent policies that were implemented and it's been really interesting to watch how the narrative around Bitcoin has really shifted to account for some of those broader macro shifts and I think the narrative is starting to really coalesce around that broader macro narrative which makes it I think much more approachable it makes it much more interesting for people who think of the world more through a macro lens so in a way it's been fun to see the umbrella of crypto widening to include a much larger audience of people outside of just you know the technologists we started with and then the crypto enthusiasts who entered through this math sort of retail bubble in 2017 now we have Christine Lagarde at the ECB you know talking about a central bank issued digital currencies and potentially introducing a eurozone stable coin we have issue Jinping in China talking about issuing central bank digital currency we have a Mark Carney at the Bank of England speaking about it we have Jay Powell in the US speaking about it so I think again it's just been fascinating to see how the narrative has shifted and how the global awareness of Bitcoin and crypto currencies on what can be enabled has also shifted as a result in earlier when you were say that you know Bitcoin it within this larger picture appears to be kind of being something that's people recognize it's like having benefits when you say that is weak is it because of the dangers of centralization that people see from you know ish issues around things like Facebook or data privacy and so do you feel like that's what the narrative is that Bitcoin promotes well I think there's um really three narratives I think about the first is the technology narrative which is one that's been playing out obviously for a long time but I think this year is the first year that privacy has really entered into the popular lexicon is a topic of conversation and in fact the New York Times is doing the whole series on digital privacy and how you know our phones are tracking us everywhere we go there have been so many news stories about the erosion of privacy for private citizens for consumers at every level so I think the privacy narrative is really driven by the fact that technology you know is now such an omnipresent part of our lives but there are no rules there are no regulations that really govern the use of this technology and so the the technology narrative to me is one component where instead of being oriented around don't be evil which is Google's motto block stack which is a company in our industry has sort of adopted this motto of can't be evil and I think that's been interesting to see how building systems from these protocols and primitives upward that make it difficult or impossible for people's privacy to be infringed upon is part of the technology shift we've seen I think the second part of that narrative is the economic kind of fiscal monetary policy component and if we look at the erosion of the monetary base and the debasement of currency around the world as a result of the trebling of global debt over the last decade and is the fast sums of money that are being printed I think that's been part of the narrative around the value of Bitcoin and other assets that have a fixed supply where there is no central bank there is no entity that can simply print more although you know there are some challenges with that with certain crypto currencies that maybe have monetary supplies that are more flexible I think the last component is really a social component which is really interesting to me and when I say social I think part of its cultural part of its political and part of its really ideological but we are in the midst of this global mind shift where the world you know the the way the world operates the way we think the way culture is created and shared is starting to change obviously influencer culture is huge crypto is is a community that's driven by memes sometimes it resembles religion even you know there are these strong beliefs that are really strongly held and so I think it's been really interesting to see how the political climate political instability political uncertainty has contributed to the appeal of crypto currencies and the idea of these open-source sort of open communities that develop online and then I think it's also been interesting to see from a cultural perspective how there is this aspect of our culture you know people are not as religious as they were before communities are not as strong as they were before and so I think for a lot of people who come into crypto what's fun or interesting or exciting for them is this community this culture this set of beliefs they buy into and I think this year really started to appreciate Bitcoin as a social movement as well as the monetary movement and a technology movement but you've been talking a lot about Bitcoin and I know or at least I heard you have this coin minimalist t-shirt but obviously you used to invest in all coins and you know it's something that you've talked about and so I was wondering now nowadays where do you fall on the scale of the coin maximalism sure look I think the Bitcoin maximalism is is not a way I would describe myself I think that terminology in and of itself is like having to choose so a or B whereas my view is more a and B right I don't think that things have to be mutually exclusive look my view has always been there's a lot of known unknown unknowns out right around Bitcoin and all of these new protocols and just what's happening inin cryptocurrency and the broader world in general and so for me I'm spending most of my time nowadays focused on Bitcoin and capital markets and thinking more about Bitcoin because let's be frank 70 percent of the market for cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin and if we look at the majority of activity it's still centered around Bitcoin because it's been around the longest has the most market depth it's the most highly traded asset but that doesn't mean that I don't spend time looking at things happening in the Syrian community things happening it with new protocols and new crypto primitives things happening in different parts of the tech community that are adjacent to crypto so for example privacy is an area I'm really excited about free speech and communications an area I'm really excited about mesh networking which is more about connectivity is something I'm excited about and interested in so I don't identify as a Bitcoin maximalist that I do think a lot of the exuberance around new protocols and like Bitcoin competitors was very overhyped and I myself I think many of us got a little carried away with that and started to buy into that in that brief time period at the end of 2017 in early 2018 but I think over the last you know 12 to 18 months I've really come to appreciate and the ability to have focus on on Bitcoin and to just remove some of the noise because there's so much happening I think trying to keep up with everything just isn't humanly possible at least not for me oh my god that's like my job and I also can't do it it's not it's not possible anyway in a moment we'll discuss Libra and more about Bitcoin and privacy but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible are you interested in getting into

for 2019 we can't ignore it so you know you did say in Congress it's not a true cryptocurrency which I even think the creator's actually would agree with so it was curious to know like you know if Libra does get to launch what do you think its effect will be on the development of crypto yeah look I think again the delineation I tried to make during the congressional hearings was there's Bitcoin and Bitcoin has some really unique characteristics and then there's a wide spectrum of things some of which are more like Bitcoin but others of which are really not crypto currencies and their digital assets maybe and they again have every right to exist and I take no issue with their creation and their issuance and them being a part of of the global economy and the global tech ecosystem but I think categorizing them as a crypto currency and comparing them to Bitcoin both in treatment and in in fact is not accurate and so I am confident that the team at Facebook you know they employ some of the most brilliant people in the world I have a lot of respect for a lot of the people who work on the for a team they're very thoughtful they have clearly spent a lot of time thinking about how to build this how to launch it they've borrowed a lot of different components from different existing protocols of whether it's the governance mechanism whether it's in how the the wallets works so it's it's clearly something that a lot of time and energy has gone into and I think it will launch it'll be interesting to see how and where and and what the response is but I think Libra is really not directly related to what's happening in in crypto I think it feels to me a little bit like if you were calling 2016-2017 the narrative was blockchain not Bitcoin and I feel like in 2019 2020 the narrative is digital assets not digital currencies and said you know this trend of security tokens and putting us at some whop chains and having things like Libra it's definitely exciting and I think it's great to see companies getting more comfortable with the space and with these ideas through things like Libra but I think it's a few steps removed from what this industry and what this social movement if you will is is all about so if that's a trend that's probably more in the near-term there's one that I definitely think is on the horizon that a lot of people are talking about and you mention it earlier which is privacy you know but this is one of those areas where I always just feel like however the privacy issue gets solved it will only be solved until it gets cracked and like people will always be kind of pushing the limits on that so I was curious to know how you think about it you know how you think this will be integrated like will we continue to see these sort of like dedicated privacy coins or you know what what areas do you even think need to be addressed when it comes to privacy etc yeah I think the big question for me with privacy is but if you ask a normal person do you care about privacy the answer is always yes right but the reality is is that most people are not willing to take any steps at all to protect their privacy right and so yes this interesting sort of trade-off where you know I might I'm guilty of those I put my credit card information into Instagram on a regular basis it was pretty terrible for privacy I've tried to walk around Manhattan for a day with location services turned off but it makes my life really difficult so inevitably like once a month I go through this phase where I delete everything from my phone I turn off like location services tracking everything and then I try to live like that for a few days and then I just drive myself crazy because I want the convenience right I'm so accustomed to having the convenience of all these apps and products and services I'm dependent on and then I just turn it all back on so I think where we're gonna see privacy of all the what I think's interesting is this idea of premium privacy services where people are willing to pay to have privacy and I think there are already few companies that are doing this there's home which is outside of the crypto space they pretty manufacture a hardware device it's a home router and a home email server that allows you to you know manage your own email flow and it has a router the Casa node is another interesting hardware device I'm an investor in Casa full disclosure so I'm probably biased but that's a Bitcoin lightning node that you can run that also has tor enabled which i think is a really cool idea so making it easier for people to use tor brave as a great example right they have DuckDuckGo and tor enabled in their browser natively they're focused on enabling privacy for their users and so I think protonmail is another great example right encrypted email and the company has a very strong ethos around protecting privacy of their users so I think again the question with privacy's who's gonna pay for it and who's willing to go through that inconvenience and is it really possible to have privacy without making trade-offs and this is always the fundamental question even when you look at you know whether you should have privacy at the protocol layer or privacy at the network layer privacy within an application these are always sort of the questions you ask is what are the trade-offs you make around usability and then at the end of the day the real question is is our users willing to make those trade-offs particularly around experience and convenience as well as as but I think as more people learn about all of the ways in which their privacy is basically non-existent perhaps there will be a market that emerges for these premium and paid privacy services but I I think it's to be determined but yeah it's it's really interesting to me that the largest surveillance the largest surveillance organizations in the world are not government's they're actually private companies that have all these apps on our phones that have cookies and widgets to track our every move it's pretty astounding that we literally just don't care myself included again I think it's it's just very difficult when it's so ubiquitous yeah so also looking ahead to the future in a more specific way the Bitcoin having obviously is coming up in 2020 what effect do you think that will have on the Bitcoin price and on mining and security sure so our firm coin shares we publish a Bitcoin mining report every six months or so we just published our fourth installment which covers a lot of data around op X capex the cost of mining a Bitcoin in different parts of the world the amount of renewable energy that's used versus fossil fuels etc so highly recommend folks check that out if you go to our website coin shares Co it's right there easy to find or if you look up coin shares mining report we have the highlights on medium quick promo sorry everyone but it's a great report our team does a really good job with that I think that having the happening if you will is always a fun event we're about to go through another one they're always interesting they're always dramatic you know people always talk about is it priced in is it not priced in who knows I think the one thing that's different about this having is in the prior to having there was no directionality in the crypto market meaning I could only really be fundamentally long gone right and in this market now that we have you know CME's derivatives we have backs derivatives era sex is launching derivatives tacit has door there's like tens if not hundreds of places where traders can trade derivatives there's also much bigger market for a Bitcoin there are more people called Bitcoin there's bigger firms involved in Bitcoin so I think now that you directionality in a much deeper market for Bitcoin is gonna change the way people trade around the having but I do think the one fundamental thing we know is the Bitcoin that the daily amount of Bitcoin produced is gonna be cut in half and the demand for Bitcoin continues to grow if we look at the amount of Bitcoin that's bought through squares cash up if we look at amount the amount of Bitcoin that's put into our product the x bt provider Bitcoin exchange trader product as well as the grayscale product you know continues to rot as more and more certificates get created every quarter because people want exposure to Bitcoin in their retirement accounts and so I think if we look at the fact the supply is getting cut in half and demands going up most of us have taken econ 101 when that happens price goes up and so I do think there will be an impact but I think it'll be interesting to see how people trade around the halving and particularly some of these large high frequency trading firms like jump like Alameda like Cumberland how their participation in the market this time around might impact the way that price responds in in the short to medium term and any other predictions for 2020 and for that 2020s yeah we're at the end of one decade I think that's so cool like we've had a whole decade of Bitcoin and I think back you know 2009 was when I finished University and I started working and the world was such a different place then and in so many different ways again like from a technology perspective from an economic perspective and from a social and political perspective the world was a very different place ten years ago and all of the things have happened over the last ten years have been exciting and scary and interesting and so I think the next decade of Bitcoin is gonna be just as fascinating just as weird in just in the wild and I think I always love thinking about you know there are the known knowns there are things we know about like for example the having right we know that in four years from 2020 we're gonna have another having roughly um so there are things we know then there are known unknowns which is things we know we don't but we can kind of pontificate and speculate about what they might be and then my favorite area is unknown unknowns which is you know in in the olden days when people were making maps obviously humans in certain cultures had only explored certain parts of the world so they would make these maps and whenever they got to a point on the map where they didn't know what was supposed to be on the map after that they had never been that far they would actually put dragons and mythical sea creatures and they would write here be dragons on the map and I think that's pretty cool it's like here's the land of mythical mystical magical creatures already impossible as possible and I think some of what we're entering into this territory of the unknown unknowns like who knows what we're gonna find who knows what's possible and the thing is the pace at which things move today and the way that markets are so interconnected and the speed at which data and information flows and the speed at which social movements and political movements can catalyze I think that makes the unknown unknowns extremely potent and extremely exciting and so my focus for the next decade is continuing to build out you know aren't in our investment firm pardon here at coin chairs but also continuing to really focus on capitalizing companies products and services that are going to help us face the unknown unknowns at this time with Bitcoin as a tool yeah I think my unknown unknown that I'm curious about is what is the Black Swan event and defy that nobody can see that is going ha ha ha what I wonder about I was just like hmm like this all like super super super it like it's very enticing and interesting to me but I'm like uh there's at some point I feel like there's gonna be something that happens but anyway well it's like engineering has discovered finance for the first time and so I think it's cool like generally um I think it's it's always interesting and good to see people experimenting with new ways of constructing products and services but I think what we forget is in doing so we create different types of risk and I think again like before the DAO hack a lot of people had no concept of risk right and then people for the first time had a cop had that idea of like oh there's actually risk when we do these things because it creates massive vulnerabilities similarly you know the fact that everyone's creating bitcoin custody solutions and you know it's very likely that a large percentage of all of the Bitcoin in circulation are going to be custody to add a handful small handful of institutions that creates existential risk and systemic risk likewise you know defy has its own unique risks and I think again one of the important things I just try to keep in mind is how do we stay aware of what the risks are how do we educate people about the risks using history as a guide because these things have happened before and I think we're constantly in this cycle where we repeat the same learning just in different ways and with different tools so that's interesting and then I think again it's what can we build to help minimize some of that risk and I will say you know the crypto community is very creative there's a lot of ingenuity and so it'll be interesting to see what that and I think that's a known unknown by the way Laura so it'll be interesting when that known unknown becomes a reality and then I think the the part that will be interesting is seeing how the community reacts will they roll back the chain to recover the lost funds will they find another solution like what there are just so many different ways that the people would deal with it and I'm sure there are things that will happen that we can't even imagine yet so who knows yeah okay so listeners if you're one of the builders don't forget here be dragons that's right mythical creatures um and maybe we'll find new ones in the process yes oh yes I'm sure we will um all right well meltem thank you so much and some great having you on the show thanks for being uh none confirmed thanks Laura always good to chat with you don't forget next up is the news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires

comm /keep crypto clean hi everyone thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline + tokens camera is pushing down the Bitcoin price chain Alice's has an incredible analysis I should have edited that but it's too funny so I'm gonna leave it in of how the three billion dollar plus token scam and China is likely pushing down the Bitcoin price although the Ponzi scheme was shut down last summer and several individuals connected to it were arrested she analysis was able to track two billion dollars from the scam and believes at least one scammer is still at large and has liquidated about 185 million dollars via OTC brokers on Hobie definitely check out their post because the graphics showing how the flow to the OTC broker correlate with jobs in Bitcoin are pretty fascinating a second headline minuchin on Libre I hate everything about this robert hackett at fortune had a great feature on what went down with the publicity rollout of libre this year as he probably deduced from my headline Treasury secretary Steve Newton was not a fan of Libre when he got the pitch I especially enjoyed Roberts behind-the-scenes piece in which he placed his cutting room floor material which includes tidbits like that members of the leaper association have yet to submit their initial ten million dollar membership fee third headline parody shifts maintenance of its aetherium client to a dow causing a Twitter blow-up parody creators of one of the main aetherium clients will no longer actively maintain its code base and instead shifting management of it to a dowel called open aetherium given that the news comes in the midst of a five million dollar grant from the etherion foundation that was awarded last January before the full amount of the funds have been paid out this caused a bit of a kerfuffle former parody developer a free show dent tweeted - - yet a Steiner at the CEO of parody if you had listened once to my advice he would have never gone through such a public relations nightmare putting the client in a doubt right after receiving a tranche from the e etherium foundation however he did later apologize other people weighing in on the discussion looked for ways to pay off REE to maintain a client with this tweet by Taylor Monty Monahan kicking off the discussion OMG well someone a fing pay off you already for F sake give me a goddamn F address I will legit get out of bed for this atrocity and it is effing cold outside my bed she used slightly different verbiage not helping matters at all were some comments parody co-founder Gavin made and Gavin wood made in his end of 2019 piece for coin desk referring to how parodies parody has had about 100 million dollars of money that I had raised in an IC o---- frozen when a development exploited a bug he wrote quote if you take the view that an exploitable and obviously unintended bug such as that used by dev ops 199 to disable hundreds of wallets must be considered fair and intended use of a platform then it surely becomes morally permissible for one platform to actively support efforts to find and exploit those same bugs in competitive platforms hmm next headline meta cartel ventures dow revives for-profit investment douse meta cartel is launching the meta cartel ventures dow which like the infamous dow of your will be an investment dow however it is quite different from the original dow in a number of respects such as that part of it is structured as a limited liability company and that members have to be approved and can also rage quit at any time unlike the people who entered the Dow in an ICO and then were somewhat trapped in it when they tried to with their money and had to do so via Lee's child O's that would prevent their money from actually moving to an exchange for roughly a month and since grifter likes to clean keep it weird or perhaps because JK Rowling is a streak secret member of the Medicare tell pitchers doubt I I'm just joking they're the Dow the meta cartel ventures Dow uses a lot of funny names for the various roles and entities such as mages and goblins and a grimoire I had to literally um and use the pronunciation button on the dictionary to to be able to say the sentence however some of this terminology refers to simple concepts such as things like accredited investors anyway it's kind of a fun read actually to see what they've got planned and we look forward to seeing what happens with this doubt next story Iran proposes creation of a Muslim cryptocurrency because of course 2019 couldn't close out without yet another story about how crypto is becoming a geopolitical issue Iranian president Hassan rouhani suggested most Muslim nations form a payment system as well as their own cryptocurrency to help evade some of the sanctions so we will see what happens with that last headline blockchain capital year-in-review blockchain capital had a good year in a in review with lovely charts plus a few great 2020 predictions in 2019 that they said crypto markets rose 73 billion dollars but Bitcoin accounted for 93 percent of that growth they also noted financial institutions such as fidelity TD Ameritrade JPMorgan in fact entered the space while crypto companies matured with Anchorage Gemini and coinbase becoming qualified custodians as for their predictions my favorite of what they're calling their bold 2020 predictions are a federal judge rules against the SEC in a crypto case kyc AML become the primary regulatory battleground for defy and Bitcoin price blows past the all-time high all right fun bits impeachment plus Bitcoin equals funny yes I'm the queen of laughing at stupid jokes you can ask my friends in real life so forgive me but I found this tweet by michael goldstein funny you know what can't be impeached hey Khoi alright that's it for this week's news I don't know why I thought that was so funny um to learn more about Belgium in the topics we discussed
