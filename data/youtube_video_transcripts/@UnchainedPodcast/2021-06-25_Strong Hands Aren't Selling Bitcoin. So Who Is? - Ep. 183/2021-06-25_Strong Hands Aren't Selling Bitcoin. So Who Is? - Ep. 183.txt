laura the link is in the description today's guest is will clemente author of the btc by wc3 newsletter welcome will hey laura thanks for having me on i'm super excited to do this great so let's talk about bitcoin the market has been in a funk the last i would say maybe four to six weeks with bitcoin trading in the 30 000 range roughly and it even dipped as low as 29 000 on tuesday and yet people like you are not worried why not yeah so um i think i'm to reverberate some of the stuff that uh you know willie and rafael had said on your podcast uh i think it was a week or two ago that you had them on as well but you know um i primarily am looking at the on-chain data versus a lot of technical analysis and things like that although i i do look at that stuff but you know in terms of on chain this in my opinion is looks more like a kind of mid-cycle consolidation versus necessarily a full on bear market which you know not ruling out the possibility that we are entering a bear but at the time at this time it doesn't look that way based off of the data that i'm looking at and so when you say mid-cycle consolidation is that what you said what does that mean to you like what is happening yeah so i think you know we only have two sample sizes so i try not to um compare i guess the price structure of previous cycles but um if i was going to compare this to anything it would be the you know the consolidation between the two 2013 double pumps where what what you had was you know the long-term holders come in and kind of set the floor um and you know step in and buy discounted btc um you know bitcoin was heavily discounted but in terms of um you know in traditional finance if people would consider it a bear market and you know a drawdown over 50 percent but in terms of on chain um onshane did not look like we were in in a bare phase necessarily so i think that this kind of resembles that um and for some of those reasons one of the main ones is that you know you have um the long term holders really stepping in and buying btc here um while a lot of the mark participants that have been selling are all very young um and you can see that in the in the age of the coins um over the last over the last two three months um you can look at something called dormancy which is a variant of coin days destroyed so the way you can think of this is like the coin is in a wallet for one day um it's accumulated one coin day and so then if the wall i mean if the coin is then moved out of the wallet um it's then it's then destroyed one coin day and so looking at the coin days destroyed adjusted for volume is what dormancy is you can see that has been trending down continuously since call it uh late february early march and and that has continued to really um move down over the last couple weeks especially so um the selling appears to be coming from not you know ogs or or you know uh experienced market participants but rather people that have gotten in um somewhat recently um which you know a lot of people would think that it's primarily retail but what i'm seeing is it's actually um larger entities that are are moving out so um perhaps these are you know funds that had gotten in um you know after we'd broken all-time highs or kind of you know hopped in when you know tesla had bought um and you know paul tudor jones came out and and stated that he had a position um but you know i think i think those are the sellers that have been really um moving out over the last couple months um i think also you know one of the one of the two main drivers of you know this bull market were a grayscale um and then b as well i think there was a lot of capital coming in and kind of you know this uh market neutral position where um you know in the us we don't have this um but you know overseas they had these really um like fat spreads um and the basis between the the spot and the futures price um and so you could kind of lock that in by by going long spot short in the future and at that point at one point it had gotten you know spreads had gotten out to like 50 percent so i think there was a lot of capital that was coming in from you know hedge funds overseas um that were coming in and taking kind of that like market neutral position and and locking in that spread there so i think that was another driver of capital in um which now those the spreads are almost entirely gone i know some some uh are actually in some exchanges are actually in backwardation so i think those are those are two big drivers that had been bringing capital in as well and then just in general um you know the kind of march of institutions coming into the space um on chain you can see that is that is really slowed um you're just looking at you know you can identify um whale entities which are considered like entities over a thousand btc um and that's been trending down since since late february early march as well so i think you know if if we're gonna get this big um second move up um like second you know uh pump almost like similar to the the 2013 um i definitely think that you're gonna see you know an uptick in those whales because that's been trending down since late february at this point you know i don't think that retail really has the power to sustain an asset of this size where it did in you know 2013 obviously and then also 2017 um because you know people like to throw out those statistics like oh if everybody in the world bought ten dollars of bitcoin price would go up like yeah but i i don't i don't see that as um completely realistic um i think you're gonna need i think you're gonna need um some some larger institutional sized uh players to to you know send in capital to push this thing up which um you know depending on you know you have some people that kind of boots on the ground you know like the raw paws of the world um you know they might be able to give you a kind of better perspective on when that capital may be coming in you know perhaps it's just it just takes time um and maybe we don't see that entering until q3 q4 but for now we have kind of seen this at least on chain um just kind of uh plateau off and even slight decline in the institutional capital coming in yeah there are so many interesting threats and what you said there but one that i would like to pull on is what you mentioned about how the sellers are first of all recent buyers but they're also institutions which i feel is against kind of the narrative that um was prevailing in crypto as these prices were going up which was you know the institutions are buying and that was led by companies like microsoft microstrategy and tesla i almost said microsoft you wish right [Laughter] but i uh you know was surprised what you said there although the block recently did report just this week that a lot of these corporates that maybe had been interested that there isn't um a lot of them actually in the pipeline now you know to follow in the footsteps of those companies do you think that downturn kind of coincides with the remarks on twitter by elon musk about esg concerns um or you know surrounding bitcoin and environmental concerns or is there any other kind of um notable event that you feel coincides with when that shift happened yeah um i think you bring up an interesting point there that you know there had been this big narrative that um first of all like the institutions were going to dampen the volatility on both sides and we were just going to go up forever laura and we were never going to uh you know see any major correction but i think when what bitcoiners really didn't take into account was um you know the the impact that um the derivatives have on the bitcoin market and you know you look at the size of when we were up um you know in the 50 60k range um the amount of liquidity that was in derivatives versus spot um was just massive and so when you had you know this this big unwind um on the way down i think that really um i guess enhanced or you know kind of accelerated some of these moves that we saw these big liquidation moves down um and so i think in in to the upside as well that have you know we have short squeezes as well but you know i think a lot of this you know that big move down to that original move down to 30k at least you know that was a long squeeze right so i think the the leverage in the system which isn't necessarily all bad because you know you need liquidity but it is gonna cause these big swings up and down um as far as like what is you know perhaps preventing this you know institutional capital to march in i think you know first of all just from like a price structure standpoint i think if i was an institution i'd probably be waiting for some stability in price um i think at this point um you have a lot of uncertainty in terms of you know the momentum because you know bitcoin's obviously like very momentum driven and a lot of that momentum um has kind of been knocked out of bitcoin so i think perhaps um they're they're waiting for you know some stability in in the price but um also just like fundamentally i think you know the whole elon esg thing i think that did really um put a damper on on a lot of institutionals um opinions on bitcoin and uh you know all the stuff that's been going on with china as well you know if you're looking from the outside in and don't really have a deep understanding of um you know what what that really entails and how that you know essentially is long-term bullish for bitcoin that you're seeing you know hash spread out across the world um you know a lot of a lot of these headlines are are you know probably scaring off people um that are looking from the outside in um so yeah i couldn't give you like i don't know if it's one thing as well like it might be multiple maybe like a combination of of several things um but yeah i i would you know i do often wonder is is it just gonna take some time right because like you know they have these these really long processes that they have to go through um they're not like sailor where they have you know the majority of their voting rights um and and they can just make like a rash decision to just that's a large bitcoin position i think um even if they do it'll probably be you know something like like square did you know they put like five percent of their treasury into bitcoin so i think you'll see something like that if it does happen um but you know the optimist in me says that it's coming q3q4 but you know maybe not but i i i think um the esg stuff definitely put a damper on that yeah so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit about what the rest of the year will look like but first a quick word from the sponsors we make this show

reach new audiences come learn why nier is the infrastructure for innovation at nea.org back to my conversation with will clemente so something that you tweeted which was fascinating to me was a chart showing that each cycle after a bitcoin having has three peaks of supply being held by short-term market participants so can you explain kind of what that means and um you know how you extrapolate from that to this cycle the the takeaway here is that like you kind of have these hype cycles within the main um cycle of bitcoin and so you know bitcoin is driven by you know new market participants um first of all you know you have to having which is almost like this push um willy woo likes to analogize it's like you're you're in a bath and you push the water in the bathtub and that gives it that initial momentum going and then you know from there after that push then you know the the speculators come in and you know just natural human you know greed kicks in and people fomo into bitcoin drives it up right um but i think what what that's really showing is like yeah you have these like mini hype cycles almost within the main um within the main cycle itself where um yeah each each cycle you've seen these three very distinct peaks of um what i was looking at is like the portion of supply held by the shortage shortest remark participants i think in the chart it was like under three months old i think was what what i had um highlighted um so yeah it's showing right now at least um we've we've only had one peak versus um you know the three that have taken place in the previous cycle so i i'm maybe it you know maybe we don't have exactly that that three number because you know granted we only have two sample sizes but i i suspect um it would it's to be more than just one that we've that we've had so far and um it appeals it appears now that um we're still cooling off after that that first big um hype cycle of shorter term holders um stepping in which you know once again um like we kind of mentioned earlier it is also supported by this selling the age of the coins that are that are moving on chain um they're all once again like you know shorter term market participants um i think in this space a lot of times um it's beneficial to follow you know the the smart money that's been in here in in the space for a while um because you know they they've been through multiple of these cycles they've been you know through multiple multiple deaths of bitcoin um when when it seemed like all right yeah i think some guy actually created a website and it's called um bitcoin is dead.com or something like that and he literally highlighted every time bitcoin is dead and then the price what it did from that time which is pretty hilarious but yeah i think when you like in my opinion you should be following those those experienced market participants and they're doing the complete opposite of selling right now um it you know everything on chain is showing that um the longer term holders are actually um accumulating right now and there's a metric you know literally called a long term holder net position change which has been trending up for the last month month plus really aggressively over the last couple weeks um and then also you can look at um so so the way glass node distinguishes like a long-term holder from a short term holder is they have a they have a threshold of 155 days so you know the super smart folks over there they they did some you know statistical analysis and looked at um once once you get to that 155 day threshold which is five months um the likelihood of of the coins being moved back out of that wallet completely just drops off a cliff and you can see this and they put an article out in their research section of their website if you if you're interested in that so they they have that cut off there for the long short term holder thing but what you what you've seen is that you know traditionally throughout um the the bull market is that you know the longer term holders are scaling out while the shorter term holders the speculators are coming in and driving price up and then conversely in the bear market you have the the longer term holders coming in and buying increasingly cheap uh btc while the shortest term holders move out of the market right because it's no it's not fun anymore because price isn't just going vertical and so you see that in the in the previous two cycles as just kind of like an underlying almost like the current driving um the cycle but also um what in in 2013 between the two double pumps i think we touched on this earlier like the the long-term holders are what would set that floor in between the two um the two pumps where um if you look at this chart you know the long-term holder uh the supply held by them had been trending down throughout the first uh pump of the two and then in between that when we consolidated for i think it was like four or five months um then that was that was actually trending up um while the the shortest term holders moved out um and then in the second half then they then the long-term holders began moving back out once price started going parabolic again and then the longer term holders once again you know moved in and the speculators came back in and then of course moved into the bear market and then longer term began accumulating again um and then it very similarly too in like late 2016 there was that same dynamic where um the the longer term holders had you know kind of stepped in and set the floor so i think you could look at it two ways right like if you if you have a bearish bias um you can look at this and say yeah well this is what happens at the beginning of bear markets right like the longer term holders um you know they start they start buying but um conversely um and you know this is this is where i kind of stand is that we're in this more uh more like mid consolidation where the the longer term holders are actually um setting the floor um contrary to um the fact that we're necessarily in a bear um which is like one of them one of the other main things that i'm looking at to like distinguish the two is the number of new users coming on the blockchain where like usually at the end of the cycle um after after the big peak you start to see those new users just kind of drop off a cliff and no you know no new users a lot of that is you know new speculators coming in um are are coming on chain but we're actually seeing the opposite where the the amount of new users has actually been been going up um especially over the last two three weeks um which i think is twofold first of all is um you know people attracted by lower prices um because excuse me um an entity is not necessarily just a person um but it can also be a corporate treasury or an investment fund it's just an entity it's not necessarily determined by the size of their holdings so that that could be um not necessarily you know um it could it could be any any cohort but you are seeing new users coming on chain which is contrary to what you see at tops but i would be interested in to see um how much of that is is coming from latin america um like i know i know glasnow tries to to not cross the line of of going between like the analytic side of things and the privacy side of things which i think they do a very good job at um not kind of crossing that line which kind of goes you know against the kind of ethos of the corners but i would i would think it'd be fascinating to see how many of that um how many of those new users coming on chain are actually from latin america because that kind of coincides with right around when um you know the el salvador announcement came out so i i think that that's really interesting but um yeah new users coming on chain and yeah that that's not any resemblance of a bear market so um we have kind of talked a little bit about how there tends to be these cycles they usually coincide with the having um you know obviously if for whatever reason this time around uh bitcoin didn't actually follow this similar pattern that it had established after the previous havings that would be big news it you know would probably be analyzed to death but at this moment in time what's your projection for how things will go in bitcoin for the second half of the year yeah um so i think like one of the other things to look at is not only just the age of the of the wallets um kind of their their selling and buying behavior um and so glass node not only do they have you know the long-term holders but they also have something called um a liquid liquid supply which is looking at the behavior you know the selling behavior of the end of these um and so um for for the entities that have a very low likelihood statistically um of selling like not likelihood but behavior tendency to sell i think i forget the certain threshold but it's they're labeled illiquid if they have you know um under i'm just picking up another maybe like under uh 25 they sell under 25 percent of their holdings so when you look at those um entities they've been they've been adding really heavily here um versus that that all kind of got puked out um when we had that big dump down but over the last couple weeks not only is it is it long-term holders um but it's it's entities that have really no history of selling coming in and stepping in and so i think that process of coins that that kind of got puked out by those by the short term holders and are now getting scooped up by those um strong term know strong hands i guess you could you could call it um i think that process is just going to take some time um i think it perhaps it takes another month from here before we really see higher prices but um i think that consolidation process of of coins um moving into i almost like to think of it like you know somebody spilled water on the counter right and you need a lot of paper towels and so like these these strong hands these are the these are the paper towels coming in and soaking up the coins right and so like you know it that that process is is just gonna it's just gonna take uh i think it's a matter of weeks at this point um because i think we're starting to move in the latter half of that um but in the in in that metric um i i like to call it the like the strong term um the strong hands metric willy woo calls it the rick astley indicator um that that's starting to trend into um really strong accumulation and i actually worked with willie to kind of create a variant of that um which is like a very simple ratio of comparing um that liquid the liquid holders to the liquid holders and so what you see is that um you have this movement right now of um you know liquid to a liquid hands while um price is going down so like the the ratio is trending up price is turning down and so for like anybody who's um you know somewhat familiar with technical analysis that's like a classic bullish divergence where you have you know the indicator making higher highs while the the uh price is turning down and so the last time you saw that was in late january when we had that big correction after that first you know big blow off top um and then in that dip was actually when tesla bought um but you know that kind of gave us some juice on the way out of that dip but you also had this this um the second big um i guess you the this bullish divergence where you know the oscillator had made a higher high while price had made a lower low so once again like in that and that at that time you had those strong hands come in and scoop up those coins and set the floor so that that looks very similar um and the bullish divergence now is a lot more clear than the one that um occurred in january but that that's something i have a very close eye on um also also profit taking so you know i think you've heard soper before that's basically a metric that looks at um the profit taking of of coins on any given day um created by um entre analyst renato um and and so what you see in this is very similar where the profit taking has made a lower i'm sorry a higher higher low so you know it had a really strong drawdown and then it had another drawdown in the last week or so but it didn't go as far down so uh people didn't sell at a loss as much as they had in the first drawdown so like to me this is suggesting that um you know the the profit taking um in terms of that you know people aren't selling at the loss as heavily and so a lot of that a lot of the capitulation that was going to take place people have already done so and so once again like that that oscillator is making a higher high while price is making a lower low which is once again a bullish divergence um and and coincidentally that this also happened in late january same thing um but the last time there is a clear bullish divergence was in late um late january so that's that's another interesting thing all right so i guess we see where we are in the mini cycle um all right well this has been super informative and um yeah we'll have to see where we end up by the end of the year thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you laura this is super fun and um be happy to come on again yeah that would be great don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around

the issue notes deloitte's rob macy is that quote each quarterly reporting period effectively looks at the lowest price that bitcoin has ever traded at since its purchase and requires a write down for
