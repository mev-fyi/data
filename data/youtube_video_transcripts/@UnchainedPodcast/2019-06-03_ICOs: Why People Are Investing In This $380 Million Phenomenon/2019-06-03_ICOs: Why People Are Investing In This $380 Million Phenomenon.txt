start-up management and author of the business blockchain William is also a board member of Obi one and a board advisor to the etherium foundation joining him is Nick Shimano principal at early-stage venture fund Runa capital an author of the blog and email newsletter the control which is about token-based blockchain protocols welcome William and Nick how's it going hi Laura William let's start with you tell us what your background was before you got into the space and how you stumbled onto cryptocurrency sure I've been in technology for a close to thirty five years the first fourteen years being an HP hewlett-packard and in 95 I left HP to dive into the internet and I was doing very much similar things to what I'm doing now which is to write about it I wrote two books at the time and I used to do a lot of speaking engagements and was involved with startups that were early in the internet days more recently I did two startups sold the last one in 2012 and then discovered the Bitcoin world and how did you discover it haha via Fred Wilson's blog initially and the first time I saw it I was still too busy with my startup engage you at the time so I know and just for people who don't know that's Fred Wilson who is one of the VC's at Union Square Ventures yes and then as soon as we we saw old engage you know then I had a bit more liberty to doing whatever I wanted and I was lucky that I was living in Toronto I am still living in Toronto and this is where Vitalik Peter and the inventor of etherium is from and I got exposed to him and met him when he was writing his his paper and when I started to read the paper and talk to Vitalik it dawned on me very quickly that this thing was really going to get not just big but important I I saw very quickly the fact that this was a paradigm shift in terms of how software applications were going to be written and and that this was something that could be as significant as the internet 20 years ago and for the first time specifically the fields of cryptography the fields of peer-to-peer technologies and and decentralized methodologies were all coming together for the first time and working in harmony so it wasn't just about sending money peer-to-peer it was more that this was a new paradigm that was going to allow engineers software engineers to write applications in new fundamental ways so it was really a technology that was disrupting technology that's how I described it in in my book but the same way with the internet and the web it was a new technology that was disrupting the previous paradigm of client-server and you know and what does that mean client-server it was is this the way that applications used to be written before the web meaning that there is a computer or a server that would be serving the the resources and the computational power to programmers that would be on their client so the web brought a new paradigm which was still within the client-server for them but it used new technologies the Java technologies and the browser technologies and the fact that the clients became more smart and more powerful so with the with the blockchain we are doing another iteration of that model where the resources are not just in on servers but they are in the cloud which means that they are all over the globe they could be thousands of nodes that are spread out so you can think of the blockchain from a technological perspective as another evolution of cloud computing but that has a very strong peer-to-peer component which means that it is not just for the corporate world but it is really brought in for the reach of anybody so anybody can ever note anybody can be part of the infrastructure and that's a new paradigm that that we are just entering right now so Nick tell us a little bit about yourself what was your background before getting in encrypted currency and how did you end up working in the industry sure so before I joined coinbase I was in Business School actually on the East Coast and actually I guess before that is when I really just Bitcoin similar to to William and and and most people you know I heard about it on the internet and I think you know the first thing I read about it was the famous wired article in 2011 the rise and fall of Bitcoin that described how Bitcoin kind of you know grew from nothing to over you know $30 per coin and then crash back down and so I think I like a lot of people I was kind of drawn in by you know the speculation and the discussions of you know Silk Road and things like that but quickly I you know fell down the rabbit hole and started engaging online in different communities the main one being the Bitcoin subreddit and then in 2013 when I write when I started business school is when I kind of decided that I wanted to to make a career out of it and so in 2013 I basically talked to as many different entrepreneurs in the space as I possibly could and a lot of the entrepreneurs that I talked to then are now either you know in jail or just not around anymore but so that was kind of interesting and kind of told me where the space was I think that's kind of the people element of this industry I think it is massively undervalued and there's a lot of kind of excitement about you know about funding and prices and but a lot of people don't take take the time to sit down and like talk with the people that are kind of working in this space and that's kind of what I did in 2013 and identified Bryan Armstrong as kind of the most credible founder by far in the space and so quickly you know ended up working for coinbase while going to business school for about nine months and then moved out to California from New Haven Connecticut and have been out here ever since so that was kind of we're working you were working in biz dev I claim yes a lot of different things in the early days I joined kind of working remotely when there were about five employees and you know doing things like managing the the Twitter account and most of the kind of external communications on the blog things like that and also kind of in the early days a lot of the merchant outreach great and then when did you leave and and go to Runa capital and also when did you launch the control so I left about a year ago to join Runa and launch the control about four months ago now so right at the beginning of the year and what prompted you to launch the control I think it's still very early in the space and there's a lot of Education that needs to be done and so you know I was writing a lot of our stuff at coinbase you know in the early days and I think you know coinbase is done and continues to do a really good job making the technology kind of relatable to non super technical people and I think there's a lot more of that that can be done and so that kind of prompted me to you know to launch the control and it's kind of a reason also that we're you know we're working on on token summit and things like that and I think you know I also think you kind of do one of the best jobs of any in the you know in the journalism world of covering the space I think there's still not a ton of good journalism and so that's kind of the control allows me to one stay kind of in the space as much as I can as like a side project while also investing at Runa yeah cuz Runa does not invest in this space is that correct I wouldn't say we do not invest in this space we're actively interested in this space but we are a series a venture fund and the reality is there's not there have not been a ton of series a opportunities for companies with real business traction and you know within Runa I am a big believer in the space but you know other than me there's not someone who is just you're really excited about the future okay so I actually wanted to vote most of this episode to discussing the token trend and icos and all things of that ilk and I've discussed this topic with multiple guests in different ways since last summer some of the previous episodes that touch on this were an episode I did with Jerry Britt oh and Peter Van Valkenburg of coin Center another one I did somewhat recently with Olaf Carlson we of Pauline capital who is also a former coin based employee and Brock Pierce a blockchain capital in stammer ash neck of the argon group and for listeners I'll link to these past episodes in the show notes but I would like to discuss the trend in depth with both of you since William you're organizing the token summit that Nick mentioned and that's in New York on May 24th and 25th and Nick you're also a co-host for that event why did you decide to launch the summit like very broadly how would you describe kind of like what is happening now and how it's different from what we've previously seen in the crypto space sure I felt late last year in 2016 that there was a need to dive more specifically into the world of the token based economy which is something that Nick and I kind of talked about and I felt that there was so much activity going on in the space that I wanted to bring all of the the top players mostly the entrepreneurs and the investors and and the whole sector basically that was at the forefront of this this new sector which is one of the sectors of the blockchain again how do you describe this to people like you know when you're trying to explain to someone who isn't really familiar with what's happening what do you say what I'm saying here what we are saying here is that the the cryptocurrency is really what's really the is the first application of the blockchain so that gave us Bitcoin and it gave us cerium and many other cryptocurrencies but that's only one element what's really interesting the the real interest here is the intersection of the cryptocurrency with the business model so when you hear about all of these new tokens or cryptocurrencies that are being raised right now I'm not so excited about having new currencies and new tokens per se but I am more excited when I hear of a new business model that is enabled by the token or by the cryptocurrency so I'm going to use the words token link of the currency interchangeably because they kind of are very similar very very similar thing so I am more excited about how a given token which is a kind of currency is going to enable us users society government whoever to do things that we could not do before and and that's the frontier that I think we're barely scratching the surface on right now and what's an example of something that it will enable us to do that wasn't possible before so so for example if you take the doing the reputation markets where you vote with a token so the token could be could be a representative of an ownership for the user and and this is something we could not do before at least not not very easily so the the token is is is like a tool for the user that can be used as part of the application there are other examples where the token is something that a user earns by giving their attention so if you spend time let's say on a on a site like we steam it where you are writing some content and the content is being uploaded or as being liked it's being shared as you do that you are earning tokens which can not just earn but you can spend so what's going on here I'm interested in in exploring how mini economies which I call circular economies get formed where a user is earning tokens and is able to spend those tokens at the same time in the same setting so if I'm earning tokens because of users are getting the attention I can spend those same tokens to maybe boost my content or to to promote it or to to buy services in that marketplace so that's kind of the more exciting element and there will be many examples like that in the past if you get affected just to give you an analogy governments used to issue money so we are used to governments issuing sovereign money and currency whether it's the dollar or the pound of the euro and so on but in the future companies are going to be issuing their own currency and the currency that the companies will issue is going to have to be tied in to their products to their services so the next trend I'm seeing is not just startups and companies that are issuing the token and starting something new but we're going to see established companies that already have millions of users issuing tokens as well and and then linking that token with an existing usage that already is taking place but giving it a boost and and allowing the users to to earn currency provide other actions via their attention via their data via the fact that they have an ownership of sorts whether they have a right to do something to be a vote it could be an opinion it could be an action so we're going to see a variety of these types of functions so that's really the incentive for the token summit I want to explore all of these different ideas and models and functionality of the toka so the token is like a utility yeah and the reason that these developers or companies are not using an existing cryptocurrency like the coin or ether is because they want to be able to control the incentives within their little mini economy or their circular economy is that is that the reason that's one of the reasons so these cryptocurrencies are their own so they are like proxies to the to the backend currencies like right now the backend currencies in my opinion are either ether or Bitcoin proper so they are like the backbone of the crypto world what's interesting if you have your own currency you can have your own governance so each currency now becomes their own kind of mini government per se maybe government is a big word it's really it's it's a body that is governed in a decentralized manner where users have a say where there is oversight and there is transparency so these companies are are issuing these currencies so so that we can so they can have their own governance models but also another reason is because it's real money so they are using this as a funding mechanism as well and hopefully we'll talk about that in the segment yeah because there's Goods and Bad's about it there's some good elements about the fact that it becomes a new funding mechanism but the caution here is that I'm seeing some some projects getting funded just because it's easier to raise money with a with a crowdsourced manner by raising of it we're talkin yeah I actually I do want to dive into that in a big way but before we do that I just kind of want to give readers some perspective on just how big this trend is or readers listeners um well I did a little bit of math and I think it's like and tell me if if you have a different number I think it's north of 350 million so far that have been raised in these initial coin offerings is that roughly your estimate yes that's pretty close to yes between last year 2016 and more or less the first quarter of 2017 were we close to that number I had predicted originally just two months ago that we would reach 600 million in 2017 and I am pretty sure that we're going to exceed that number so we raised only in 2017 or preservative yeah including 26 oh wow okay oh yeah I think we're gonna reach a billion dollars very easily there are some big raises that are coming on the horizon that I cannot talk about yet not announced yet but they will be announced in the May and June time frames and for the rest of the 2017 year some companies are getting ambitious so I wouldn't be surprised if we reached 1 billion dollars in money raised by a new cryptocurrency offerings in that year alone and what other stats really stick out to you as the most eye-opening almost on a daily basis there is a new one so so this is almost I mean right now we are able to to monitor them and count them but there will come a point where it's going to be like another startup has been founded so like big deal so if you look at the traditional venture capital world that there are hundreds of startups being founded on a daily basis on a global basis so founding a startup and getting and raising money is not a big deal anymore and there are VC companies that don't even announce any more fun things because it's it's a it's a okay so what kind of event what's more important is what's getting done with the money so I wouldn't be surprised that at some point in time it won't be news anymore that a company is raising ten million dollars or twelve million dollars why I talk an offering okay yeah I I also feel like this trend is is moving in that direction at least at least for now we'll see but let's hold that thought and go to an important word from our sponsor on-ramp the best companies in the world obsess about branding killer

strategically poised for the future you can learn more and see examples of its work at think on-ramp com I'm speaking with William movie our general partner at Virtua Capital Ventures and Iktomi know principal and early-stage venture fund Runa capital and founder of the control both of whom are hosting the token summit on May 24th and 5th um so let's quickly run through some of the details around tokens um who are the people launching them what is the process for launching them what structures what kinds of entities are they then creating to launch them etc I want to just run through that quickly yeah so I would say this this is kind of rapidly evolving and it's still very early and how these these entities are forming and I would really I think you know people call them companies and the analog and the traditional world is a company but they're really not companies and I think it's best to think of them as decentralized autonomous organizations where there's an entrepreneur and a founding team but there's no legal entity and there's a number of different participants that play different roles in kind of bringing this entity to the world but I I really think of these structures as internet tribes and there are kind of their tribes that that are focused on different use cases and have different beliefs but at the end of the day there are collections of people from all over the world that own a token and have ownership in a product and kind of want to bring the product to the world so that's kind of how I view what's happening I think the problem right now that's happening is there's you know if you the the over 350 million in funding over the past 12 months the vast majority of these projects are getting funding before there's an actual product and if you look at like the past 10 years in startups broadly outside of like the blockchain world pretty much every company that has raised a lot of money free product has failed some of the the famous examples are clincal which was a mobile payments company that raised 25 million before products in the seed funding and disappeared in two years color and airtime are other examples of this that raised kind of massive rounds before an actual product and I think right now the token sales are being like William said are kind of in a lot of cases being used as funding first and I think this model over time will change and we're already seeing it change to some extent we're a founding team is raising a small seed round from more traditional investors getting to a product and then doing a token sale to give users access to the product and this is kind of again it's still very early and we haven't seen kind of best practices for how these organizations are structured but this is kind of how I see a best practice playing out on the future yeah that's true Nick so there's no right or wrong way to do the token sale it could be before the product is ready it could be after it could be a before funding from a traditional VC or or after and the way I've divided the phases to answer the question Laura is I see four phases there is the launch but in this case the launch is really the launch of the of the token itself or of the funding if that is the case that there's a development in many cases the funding will allow the development to take place a software development and that could take one or two years and in that development phase I am referring to the third phase which is it goes into a darkness period so we don't really know what it what goes on despite transparency attempts from the startup because at the end of the day these companies are like startups whether they are a protocol or a distributed organization or an organization with a new product they are really like a start-up so you cannot escape the startup characteristics which means that it takes a while for the product to become more mature it takes a while to acquire users it takes a while to iterate on the actual vision that you have because nobody is right from the beginning time will tell really what happens and at the last phase is really the rollout which is the market entry and that could be a year or two years and sometimes three years after the initial fundings ok yeah I actually Nick when you were saying that often times in the or in history we've seen that companies that raise a lot of money initially before they have a product tend to fail I wondered how that compares to Kickstarter and those types of things where oftentimes they did kind of you know dream up some vision for something and then get a lot of people on board and crowdfund do you have any stats on that on how successful it's been in the crowdfunding world I know I mean the failure numbers I don't know them off the top of my head exactly on Kickstarter but they're relatively high and I think you know Kickstarter has done a lot to improve this over the years and so I'm sure that it's kind of trending in the right direction but yeah I think you know Kickstarter is a good model to look to in terms of kind of getting funding on an idea and hasn't played out well for Kickstarter okay all right and then just nuts and bolts for listeners who aren't familiar yet with these tokens Hills what is typically the process for buying these tokens like if I'm a novice and I have a little bit of Bitcoin or ether maybe like a coin base or something and and that's it and I see some tokens he'll I want invest in what do I do all you do and this is why it's it's happening so quickly around the world is aetherium makes it dead simple to do a token sale all you do is create a smart contract and have people anyone in the world send ether to an etherium address kind of at a very high simple level that's what you do so you have you know ether in a coin based wallet or whatever wallet you have and you send a certain amount of ether to an address and in return you get toca given token for whatever the project is so it's and then where do I hold those tokens like if I receive them I'm holding them we're on our way out what address in the address that you sent from oh okay so you can hold this new token in in the same aetherium address yes and by the way I wouldn't do this from the coin base wallet because at least now from what I from what I know they're not supporting sub tokens I think that will change in the future but but yes you send from if you have a ledger wallet or you know the etherium is client or whatever the wallet is you send the funds and you get tokens whatever the token is in return okay so let's talk more about investing and before we do that let's copy on this section with the statement that no one listening to this podcast should take anything that we are saying here as an investment advice I covered personal finance for a long time and can tell you that if you want advice on your financial picture you need to talk to a certified financial planner who can look at kind of like everything in your life and figure out what your goals are and and all that given that though there is kind of a lot to talk about from the investment angle so what is the investment thesis here what gives a token value the way I see there's two there's two types of tokens and I think you know everyone has different frameworks I think William likely has a different framework than I do but I really think there's there's two types of tokens that that make sense to me right now one is called a usage token and one is called a work token so a usage token is a token that is required to use a service and I think you know the term protocol is used a lot and I think I think it gets overused and I think you know at a high level it's it's simpler to think of these as services and so bitcoin is the the best example of a usage token to use the Bitcoin payment network to send you no money anywhere you need to own Bitcoin and that's that's really what gives Bitcoin value is the ability to be used in this distributed ledger that anyone can participate in and no one controls so usage token is one type of token and then the other is what I call a work token and I think it's still very early in you know in work tokens but kind of at a high level work token is a token that users own that gives them right to contribute work to the network and earn in exchange for that work and so an example here is reputation which is the native token to augur the decentralized prediction market and if you own rap you can essentially be an Oracle in the system and earn fees and so you're you're owning a token not to use a service but instead to contribute work to iliza autonomous organization and so yeah I'm sure kind of I'm sure William thinks about it slightly differently than I do but to me those are kind of the two reasons that that tokens have value this is very good Nick no I agree with your classification and actually I talked a lot about the work talker and then I didn't at my last TEDx but aside from that I think the way to think of value beyond the way that Nick describes it is really at the end of the day if you think about it it's about adoption so forget for a minute about all this kind of new jargon about usage and work and rights and and tokens really at the end of the day if there is no adoption by the users there is no value no matter what the vision is because all of these companies or ICO projects or or startups really they are they are all based on assumptions they are based on a hypothesis that if we issue a token if we give certain rights to users if we allow them to do this and that then they will come and they will use it but just like it is the other startup if there is no usage there's nothing so there is a lot here that rests on whether there will be engagement with the users whether there will be a semblance of a network effect going on network effect means every time a user comes into the network the value of the network increases and and this is something we've been used to for the last 1012 years with the the internet but now it's another version of network effects where the users are part of the infrastructure so the users are all kind of supporting the infrastructure of the network because they are a node on the network but right now when like so many new tokens are launching every day like when networks haven't really been built out how does a potential investor decide between them is it just you know you try to invest in as many as possible and hope that that if you went out and even if the rest fail you still make some money or I mean how do you do that or or do you just wait until the network's get built or I mean it's not any different than investing in startups you have to have a hunch I got feeling for for the team for the idea for the product and and then you support them so I mean is there anything kind of more quantitative than a hunch that you can it's really experience I mean people think that I am seeing so many ICO projects now that want to reinvent everything so one of the trends is that we are moving off the moving off centralized services so the other big umbrella theme here behind all of this is there's going to be a decentralized version of everything you can think about starting with Facebook so there's like a half a dozen companies now that want to do a decentralized Facebook or decentralized reddit steamin is one of them and there are five others companies are doing decentralized whatever these centralized banking so banking without a bank or uber without uber or a stock exchange without the exchange because it's decentralized exchanges from peer-to-peer directly so there is validity in the fact that there will be a lot of decentralized services that will emerge and some of them will replace the centralized flavor but if I'm trying to figure out where to put my money then how do I decide between one ICO versus another so Laura I've got a perspective on this I think like ICO is a misnomer generally like because it evokes IPO and to your question about like how do you decide when you're investing in an IPO there's a lot of data that you can decide right the company's been around for presumably many years and it has revenue and you know all sorts of traction that you can look to in this case it's it's often a founder with an idea and a website and you know William is talking about you know you decide like you do or early-stage startups which is right but most people are thinking about this as deciding like investing like an IPO in startups the most important thing is the people and the reality is like most people don't have the time to meet the the founders of these projects and so our b-17 like the crowd really shouldn't be investing in this space then no I wouldn't say I wouldn't say that because I think you know being inclusive is is one of the kind of the fundamental principles of this space and so but I think maybe the crowd shouldn't be investing before there's execution risk meaning you know when there's a product I think it makes a lot of sense for teams to give users the product but I question whether the crowd should really be be investing you know pre product when in most cases they're not doing a lot of diligence aetherium is the best counter example to this right they raise you know 16 or 18 million before product and they've executed phenomenally and they're certainly kind of counter examples to to my belief but I would bet that theory 'm is more of an outlier than kind of the norm moving forward and what about examples where the network launches right when the crowd sale happens how do how do you categorize that that like an example maybe easy cash I think you know that's an interesting model because when the crowd lot when the product launches that's when you give access to you know to people and I think yeah model like Z cash is a good one rather than raising you know fifteen million dollars or you have anything and I think that will over time be proven to be the healthy model for the space so another thing I was wondering about is sometimes these networks seem to have good business ideas or or maybe not so good business it really depends um but then that kind of analysis is separate from whether or not the token makes a good investment because in that instance then there's a lot of other factors involved like how are they distributing the token or how is the token used in this system or just other things so how should potential investors kind of differentiate between those two things or or assess those factors yeah that's a good point I think that's why it's not all about just like getting traction you have to be thoughtful about like what the token actually represents and it's why I think kind of a framework for thinking about you know is it a usage token is it a work token maybe and I'm sure there'll be other types of tokens that emerge but yeah the the crypto economics if you will is really important and I think it's still super early in in you know crypto economics generally but there's a lot of really smart people that are thinking about this that's part of the reason I'm so excited about token summit is there hasn't really been an event where most of the kind of leading minds that are thinking about these things are in one room talking about you know things like crypto economics so another another factor or Laura for investing is is having a thesis so one way that investors make decisions is they have a thesis that they believe in which is a particular view of where the world is going and that I mean if you believe in it and then when you start to see companies that fit the model that you envision in your own mind after your own analysis then you start to say well this is the kind of company that I'd like to support because I believe in this particular field so it could be decentralized content so if you believe that content is going to be owned by the users themselves and that the publishing and the way it gets it gets distributed is going to be more decentralized as opposed to centralized then you would invest in such companies or if you believe that that storage computer storage or computing infrastructure it's going to be more decentralized and if you believe that users will be able to rent a small part of their computers let's say on a on a distributed manner and earn a few cents or dollars here and there and now we're seeing each sector is seeing out two or three players like the example I just gave there's a company called storage there's a company called SIA si a and there's a company called file coin and they all kind of find around the same area of cloud storage so so that's kind of one example if you believe in that you would invest in it there will be cloud computing resources that will be going kind of towards the blockchain like Gollum and others and and so these are kind of like some sectors that are emerging based on a belief of a particular vision that an investor might have so I'm going to jump back to something that Nick mentioned briefly which is what he was talking about well you know as I mean he referenced it and we actually discussed a little bit how some of these developers are launching crowd sales before they have a product and one of the more extreme examples of this recently was the gnosis crowd sale which sold 12.5 million dollars worth of tokens in less than 15 minutes and they only sold like 5% of tokens and so and at the price sold it that gave this reputation market evaluation of 300 million dollars which is pretty ridiculous frankly so what do you guys make of something like this what kind of lessons can we learn from well the way I explain this is that there is some financial engineering going on here and the the token issuers are getting very creative because there is there are no best practices that there is no right formula yet so there's lots of iterations and variations so so this particular one was very creatively done and I mean theoretically you could say that the valuation was 300 million because so many tokens exist and the ones that were issued are worth so much but again this is all a very assumptive very very we're just assuming that this is going to be the case so the proof is going to be in it going to the market and getting users and getting a product of the market now in the meantime the markets are speculating on this and this in return is is funding its funding these companies so I don't mind a little bit of speculation because it is helping to fund these projects but do you think that this indicates that there's kind of more like bubble activity happening because a lot of projects have been raising money without I you know without going to this extreme I would say yeah well there is going to be a point where the market will retract so we are going to be pushing the envelope and pushing the boundaries that the limits Didem to the most extreme limits and but if you go back in history of all of the major technological cycles nothing really ever great was done without some crash of some sort without some kind of irrational exuberance without some kind of euphoria at some point in time we have to push the envelope beyond the possible and the thing that the that we can reach the moon before we can just realize what is possible and then things will grow again so the crash of 99 2000 was back with the Internet back in the internet days yes it was bad into itself but then later it kind of paved the way for a lot of prosperity that's that followed so right now there's kind of like a wide spectrum of I would say anything ranging from kind of like scams it like on the episode I did with Jerry and Peter coin Center they talked about pay coin which was an outright scam that the SEC pursued and then there's kind of like less easily detected ones like you know maybe the developers raise money but they never really seem to launch anything they're always just working on the project do you and I mean frankly like it's kind of incredible to think like oh wow they could just easily raise millions of dollars and just kind of fund their lives but never really do anything that you know they offer to their investors so a you know short of regulation is there anything that that can either the community can do now or that investors can do to avoid these types of situations I think it's just important to push best practices and you know I agree with William that you know this speculative activity kind of fuels the ecosystem and it's natural to some extent and I also think even from you know something like the Dow which you know last year raised 150 million and and quickly disappeared you know it was a complete failure by all accounts but even that led to something like the etherium hard fork which I think was a step forward for the whole ecosystem because there had never been a hard fork in a project that was so significant as a theory I mean and it showed something new that could be done so I think there's like there's a lot of learning to be done from even the failures but I do think it's important to continue to be you know highlighting best practices and you know something like gnosis which you know it was the first experiment of a Dutch auction in the space I think you know not necessarily a bad thing that they tried it and I'm kidding just for listeners who don't know can you just quickly describe my auction yeah it basically lets the market decide the valuation so the valuation is where the complete allocation which in this case was 12.5 million wherever all the bids get filled and so rather than kind of setting a valuation it lets the market decide the valuation and in this case the market was very excited about the project and decided that evaluation should be you know north of 300 million and that was kind of that experiment hadn't been attempted before and I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing that it was attempted and I don't know you know the intentions of the founders and whether it was you know greed or something else but I think it's clear to me at least and you know again this has only been it's so very new for this is a couple weeks old but it's clear that Dutch auction is likely not a best practice moving forward but to to come to that conclusion we needed to see it happen before right so what are some other things that you would recommend as part of best practices I think you know I don't know all of them I don't know and these are just kind of my ideas I think it's still very early and I think that's part of what you know we're going to discuss with a lot of people that have actually done it before at token Summit but to me you know what I discussed earlier I think you know raising a small round prior to doing a big crowd sale is is likely better long-term than doing a you know a 10 million plus crowd sale before there's a product so to me that's like you know one of the best practices another is you know is crowd ownership so you know I was looking at the data the other day and in the case of like gnosis that the team you know the team only sold five percent roughly to the public and I think a best practice for for you know public ownership of a token is is more like you know sixty to eighty percent something like that so those are I guess a few examples and you know I'm I don't claim to to know all of them William do you have any to add yeah actually we it's funny I don't want to mention the talker saw it too many times we have a session specifically talking about best practices and the ones that Nick has mentioned are really good ones as well and again this is nothing different than how to start up really takes shape and there there is a conventional wisdom that more money especially initially it does not mean it's not necessarily better so less money gives more discipline to teams but from what I'm seeing discipline is not really the first thing that comes to mind here with a lot of these ICO projects many of them see this window and they want to swing for the fences and see it as a one-shot deal where they can raise money at once and and then see what happens again trying to emulate what a theory of did they raised a bunch of money and then they ran with it but then luckily for them there was there was a big vision behind it and everybody was rallying behind it but not every project is like aetherium not every project is like Bitcoin these are the outliers or these are more the exceptions in the same way that in the startup world and not all companies are going to be Facebook's Facebook or Google or Amazon these are giants that have become what they are today because of many reasons and major characteristics that were very unique to them and so yeah we are going to see more of those big companies emerge in the next two years but I think I get at the end of the day it doesn't look any different than what the startup ecosystem it looks like today because many of them are startups and and to just one more thing I want to say is that have we learned everything not not yet I expect us to make even more mistakes for the rest of 2017 and maybe into 18 easily before we figure out what the real best practices are and there's nothing really stopping these mistakes from being made no matter what people like me or NIC and others talk about and even if we show a bit of restraint and warn people none of that is going to matter I think the train is moving at such a rapid speed that right now this this mechanism is is seen as a low barrier as a low entry point of raising money and and then everybody is rushing to it so to wrap up what particular tokens are networks are you most excited about I could I mean I could share like again a lot of them to tying back to token summit a lot of them that the founders of the projects will be speaking at token summit so for anyone that's interested in hearing directly from these people I think you know token summit would be a good event and again to me the people behind these projects are much more important than any idea that anyone has and so a few examples one you know I discussed earlier augur augur is a decentralized prediction market that they actually did one of the the first crowd sales several years ago and have been quietly building since and I think a lot of people are wondering you know what what is going on but I think I'm really excited about what they are going to be bringing to market in the next you know six to 12 months and William what about you well I mention the ones that I own so I have to make that disclaimer the ones that I like that I own are include CI and storage for cloud storage I own and I like steam which is decentralized content with users being able to earn based on their attention I like economy economy because there going to be a fund a management platform basically they're gonna allow fund managers to to manage a portfolio of cryptocurrency tokens very easily and I like aetherium obviously because they are a new decentralized platform for writing applications and I like Bitcoin I also own Bitcoin because they are the backbone currency of of this new world I mean if there are others that that have some us some some emerging models I'm very intrigued to see what happens with the reputation markets with gnosis and an augur specifically and and then I continue to be amazed by how many new ones are being created on a daily and weekly basis yeah so we'll see by the end of the year kind of which ones have taken off so where can people learn more about you and get in touch with you so for me William I write on a regular basis on my blog which is at start-up management org slash blog and and that's really where my thought leadership is being published and Nick best to find me on Twitter quite active and we'll certainly if you tweet me I'll get back to you my twitter handle is empty money okay great well thank you both so much for
