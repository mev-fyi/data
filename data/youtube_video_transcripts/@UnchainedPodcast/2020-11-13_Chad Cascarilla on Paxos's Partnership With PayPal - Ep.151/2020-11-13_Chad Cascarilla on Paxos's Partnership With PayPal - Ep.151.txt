cryptocurrency full-time unchained and unconfirmed or now published his videos if you're not yet subscribed to the unchained youtube channel head to youtube.com c unchained podcast and subscribe today crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto earn up to 8.5 per year on your bitcoin download the krypto.com app now today's guest is chad cascarilla ceo and co-founder of paxos welcome chad hi great to be here thanks for having me laura so today uh being thursday not the date this comes out um it was announced that all paypal users can now buy hold and sell cryptocurrencies and your company paxos is its partner enabling this service behind the scenes congratulations what exactly is paxos doing with paypal yeah this is a very exciting partnership for both ourselves and i think for really uh the entire crypto ecosystem um and so we are offering a crypto brokerage service and what this allows is um any anybody really to come in and have a turnkey solution to be able to offer crypto to their customers and so very specifically in the case of paypal we're operating in the background as the custodian and the liquidity provider for them to be able to offer uh crypto to their us customers and uh those crypto services are bitcoin ethereum bitcoin cash and litecoin and uh we actually offer a very similar service uh for revolut amongst others and so this is something that we're increasingly seeing uh many different firms start to take up uh which is how can we offer crypto to our customers how can we do it in a trustworthy way how can we do it very quickly and that way we can have a deeper relationship with our customers we can acquire new customers and really we can be part of this ecosystem which i think is very exciting and very dynamic and which has historically uh you know been kind of just an early adopter ecosystem and i think it's it's really going through a phase shift now and i think that's what uh we're doing with paypal um and what i think we're going to do more broadly for the whole ecosystem and so how does a small company like paxos convince a more than 200 billion dollar company like paypal to partner with it yes well that is uh i think a great question because we've spent probably the last seven or eight years positioning ourselves exactly for this type of partnership and so we have uh really positioned ourselves as financial market infrastructure and so that means uh really in more common terms a regulated platform and a regulated platform is something that maybe isn't as needed in the early stages of a industry's development because you tend to have full stack solutions that are offered on the other hand as you become more mature as a as an industry you need platforms where people don't have to build everything themselves where they can come in and they can leverage other people's know-how and technology and that's what we've done and so ultimately as a a regulated platform we've built a regulatory stack and that includes being the first company to be approved as a trust company in the state of new york to operating crypto and blockchain and that was in may of 2015. started working on that in 2012 some some time ago uh really very early days uh there wasn't even ethereum at the time we started working on the trust company and the reason we did that is because we believed that uh not just crypto but crypto and blockchain would be able to transform financial services and that you would need an infrastructural layer and so we built the trust company and we were the first one we predated the bit license that's how long ago this was and then we went and got a number of other firsts so we built um you know give an example we have access to the federal reserve national settlement system we're a full member of swift we have a no action letter from the sec so we have all these things and we have plus more and more and we were first in all these things and um uh doing that really set us up because we were asking for permission not for forgiveness and also because we set ourselves up as infrastructure we're not trying to go acquire 20 or 30 or 50 million retail customers we're not even really trying to acquire and institutional customers our goal is to be a b2b or b2b2c company and so that's exactly what firms need who want to be able to come in have an infrastructure provider that they can rely on that they can trust but also one that's not going to compete with them yeah i do remember interviewing you in 2015 about that new york state trust charter and yeah at the time understanding it was significant in some respect but also not understanding why it would be useful um so you briefly mentioned the uh paxos crypto brokerage which is that service that you talked about can you just describe how it works on the back end yeah definitely and i do remember that uh 2015 conversation it you know it's it's amazing that it's already been five years it feels like it was yesterday five and a half years um and in some ways we were just we were ahead of our time a little bit and um but we really believe that uh crypto and blockchain and we still believe it are going to change the financial system that they're going to re-platform the financial system and that doesn't mean you don't need regulation and that's so that's always been our thesis you need to be regulated in order to be able to create a trustworthy ecosystem but at the same time um you know there's a moment in time when that becomes really relevant and i think that's when there's this phase shift from early adopter to mainstream which i think is exactly what we're undergoing right now so it's it's just an exciting moment um for us uh to be a part of that because ultimately i think that's what got us all excited about crypto and blockchain wow you could actually change everything and um you know it wasn't meant to just be a small community want to be something that's really big and i think that's the moment we have right now so that's uh something we're proud to be a part of and so for the brokerage how it works on the back end yeah so the way we have the crypto brokerage work is it's api based so anyone can come in and they can plug their systems into ours we offer custodial services we offer liquidity services so they can buy and sell or crypto on behalf of their customers or their customers can directly and you can integrate with us in actually a couple different ways um and we allow you to basically choose your own adventure with the apis and we did this deliberately so we have some customers where they might not have licenses to be able to operate in the u.s they can have their customers actually be housed and sit within paxos and this would be what we call a third-party integration and so we have customers they sit inside of us now the uh the partner their customers don't know that they're actually sitting inside packs unless you read the fine print you would know if you looked but they're able to keep that end relationship and so we're providing them with a regulatory umbrella as well as the custodial and liquidity benefits and then you have other customers where um they're highly regulated an example will be paypal um but um they are actually housing their conditional bit license inside paxos and so that was part of the press release and so we're really proud that was the first conditional vet license that was created it's what you need to be able to operate in the state of new york um if you're not a bank and so they were able to receive a conditional bid license and we provided the regulatory umbrella for that to be able to be housed and you know again we're providing custodial and liquidity services to them now of course you could have a bank that would come in and they wouldn't necessarily need any of our uh our regulatory umbrella to operate at all but they would still want to regulate a custodian and they still want a safe liquidity pool and so that's really what we're bringing here is different models for different types of firms you could be a fintech you could be a technology company you could be a bank it could be a broker and we have different ways of being able to allow you to integrate seamlessly turn key way turn on buy sell hold send and receive you know as you would like you can kind of choose that part of the adventure too uh but we're making this really easy and really seamless and so paypal has started with bitcoin ether bitcoin cash and litecoin are those cryptocurrencies that paypal selected or are those simply what is available through paxos crypto brokerage well uh i they're actually overlapping venn diagrams that's what they were looking for that's that's what we had uh we actually have authority to be able to custody and trade additional um uh tokens um and in fact we we have pax gold which is one of our tokens we have uh pax dollars so there are other products that we have uh that weren't included in the crypto brokerage launch but in terms of pure cryptocurrencies those are the four that we have uh that we're you know listing on both our exchange and really providing uh constant custody for so we're gonna we're expand those as our customers need more product uh but ultimately um want to be customer driven and um you know there's a lot of questions as you start to get outside of those four or maybe you know a handful of others about whether they're securities or not and i think that's always something that um you know maybe creates a little bit of hesitation for instance bitcoin bitcoin cash as a result litecoin which are very similar and then ethereum have essentially been grandfathered in um by the sec bitcoin explicitly and ethereum explicitly and once you start getting out away from these top four um there's always a little bit of questions around them and um uh not just uh for us but just the the industry in general and so that's something i think we just need to be sensitive about in a moment we'll discuss more about the regulations surrounding this but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per year on your btc download the krypto.com app now to see the interest rates you could be earning on btc and more than 20 other coins once in the app you can apply for the crypto.com metal card which pays you up to eight percent cashback instantly reserve yours now in the crypto.com app back to my conversation with chad caskarilla so earlier we were discussing which cryptocurrencies you guys offer and the new york department of financial services um has other cryptocurrencies that it has white listed in particular something like zcash for gemini um or not just for gemini but this is you know how gemini has listed that so would the cur the um assets on that list be the ones perhaps that would be up for discussion to be listed on paypal or through the paxos crypto brokerage service yeah so they have that uh white listing or i guess the thing they called a green listing um list and uh so a couple of our tokens are on there um you know our goal token our dollar token uh the gemini dollar tokens on there and then there's really i guess some ripple that can be custodied but not necessarily traded and then i think there's just a handful of others and so um those are certainly very logical ones um to to for us to list um really that's up to paypal whether or not they want to offer them to their customers but you know partly what we want to do is be customer driven about what we add into place uh when you start looking at liquidity outside of the top you know four or five and certainly outside the top ten you know they they're almost trading by appointment they're they're quite illiquid and um and relatively small cap and so there's the old 80 20 rule it applies to these traded assets just as much as it does to anything else and so while there's lots of uh tokens you know 80 of trading is happening in you know the top 20 or probably in this case the top you know four tokens and so i think everyone's always looking at is this worth adding into place you know could this create more confusion um how how safe is this as a general product offering for customers so those are all the considerations that come into place and not just the regulatory approval and so you mentioned the liquidity issue i'm assuming that the brokerage will source liquidity across multiple exchanges around the world is that how that works well we mainly source liquidity from our own exchange at the moment uh but we do use external liquidity providers uh now we're integrating with more and so our viewpoint is um we want liquidity to be as safe as possible and part of being safe is a couple of different things uh the first is uh do you have um an ability to uh know that the liquidity pool is clean so is it regulatorily clean and then secondly do you have an ability to know who your counterparties are so there's no counterparty risk and so these are really important and really relevant in terms of making sure that um you're not just providing liquidity but you're providing the right kind of liquidity so i have to say i'm a little bit surprised because yesterday i did look at the it volume and for btc it was 18 million dollars in volume yesterday and it was 78th in the world by volume so it didn't seem like a super large marketplace yeah well i think there's a couple components of that first is uh we're just a dollar u.s dollar marketplace so we're not it's not trading against tether so you i think you have to normalize against exchanges where they're calling it dollar but it's really a tether pair and when you look at it like that i think our volume is really not too much different from some of the other us-based marketplaces but secondly it's also about the tightness of the spreads and so that's what's really important so there's volume and then there's also tightness of the spreads and so we have all the largest market makers are trading on our exchange offering really great prices and we're able to trade away to other liquidity providers when needed and so that's an important function as well and i think that'll get bigger and bigger over time one of the key risks for us when you trade away is could you have counterparty risk could that counterparty fail who how do you fund the trade do we have to send our assets out and then they send us the payment you know so you have to work through a lot of the logistics um which hopefully blockchain by the way should be solving ironically uh but there is this concept of replacement risk in case someone fails when you agree to a trade and then there's counterparty risk which is is someone going to fail uh when they send you the assets um before you receive them and so um you know there's this real question around those and i think the industry is coming up with some good solutions side chains other things but it's it makes it a little bit difficult to feel really safe trading at a lot of venues because you're inherently um you know taking that counterparty risk when you use them yeah although i guess you could also argue that you're spreading the risk out in case if there's issues with any one exchange but um but anyway i actually i just also wanted to ask something a little bit um which i i think i could probably assume the answer but here we are with paypal offering this now to its 346 million um active accounts and as we all know the two most popular blockchains bitcoin and ethereum are seeing a volume of transactions that on many days will near the cap sometimes causing delays or fees so are you just kind of batching all the transactions to manage uh that issue well there's a couple components to this um so uh you know paypal um is just launching in the u.s so it's just for the us customers um but secondly um we are just batching um when we're sending externally and so that's market makers or others but what paypal is really doing is they're holding their crypto inside paxos's custodian and they're sourcing liquidity inside paxos and so that means a lot of those activities don't have to move through the on-chain issues that you're describing right and so now at the end of the day there's a knock-on effect because when there's lots of volume you know the industry does a very good job of using market makers to kind of um cross balance across all these different institutions to be able to source liquidity so inevitably there is going to be some component of um on-chain fees creating um friction and that friction will show up um in execution prices no matter what because it has to come from somewhere and the same with the dollars and so um i think you know we get around that um clogging of the network because essentially you're just getting you're just seeing the institutional batching of those movements because they're the ones who are providing liquidity to the retail players on our platform and paxos also has the white label stable coin business which has enabled it to power the huobi dollar and binance usd is paypal or is um paxo's cryptic brokerage working on adding stable coins or are you working on even creating one specific to paypal well uh for our crypto brokerage perspective we can absolutely add in um any of our stable coins to a customer if they would like them uh and certainly um you know that's something that paypal might want to do i can't really speak for where they want to go with their product roadmap but you know we're obviously a very logical player to offer that type of product because we're the only one who's done a white label stable coin we have regulated stable coins and the only other one is gemini and so we've really spent a long time making sure that we have a primary regulator we went through that at the beginning of the of the conversation and rock creating the trust and that's what's enabled us to now create regulated tokens and that's what's unique our dollar tokens that we've issued for ourselves or for our partners are regulated and so are uh so is our gold token and so not only are we regulated the tokens are regulated that puts it at a whole different standard and so we're happy to launch them for anybody who's interested in creating one and really being able to drive community engagement and i think some really significant customer acquisition benefits part of paxos's partnership with paypal is to offer custody of the crypto assets and after the news about paypal offering crypto buying and selling broke bloomberg reported that paypal was in talks to buy cryptocustodian biko how would such an acquisition work in conjunction with the custody service that paxos already provides well you know it's you know lots of things get reported in the press it's you know hard to know exactly what uh will end up being will materialize but um i think what's clear is uh the space is growing uh people want to be able to have in-house capabilities uh you also want to be able to rely on partners uh no one would want a single point of failure um and um uh we think that we're providing a great service that everyone can rely upon but you know people have different strategies and there's different capabilities and different things they want to do our uh crypto brokerage product isn't cover all facets of uh the crypto markets it's not designed to and uh so there's reasons why um i think firms over time will think about what should we build what should we buy who do we partner with and we're definitely going to be in i think most of those conversations but at the same time we're not trying to be all things to all people and in addition to the brokerage and exchange paxos also has a blockchain based equity settlement platform that received a no action letter from the sec it launched with credit suisse and society general how is this business going and will you be adding new financial institutions yeah so it's been going great we have instant uh nomura we have sock gen we have credit suisse and we have another couple of firms that have agreed to join up including uh one that will be going live shortly so that'll be an exciting announcement for us uh i promise that uh maybe talk to you a little more about that when it when the news comes out but then we have quite a great pipeline behind that and what's interesting about um settling uh tokenized equities is uh whether they're public or private is that it really solves a really big problem around capital that's tied up um operating costs that exist in the system but also it creates more access and it creates um new types of products that are possible and that's the whole point of blockchain is that you're really upgrading assets to be on a blockchain rail and sometimes it might be private chains i think over time they'll probably end up all on public chains personally over time uh but you know there's lots of steps in the journey but putting assets into uh blockchain rails change fundamentally how the financial system will work and the equities markets are the biggest part of the financial system they're 45 trillion dollars of market cap it's you know almost bewildering how big it is you know for crypto as exciting as it is it's only 350 billion dollars in market cap right so it's it's less than one percent the size of the u.s equity markets um and that's you know can you imagine the size of the global equity markets i think it's something like 100 trillion dollars so there's so much opportunity uh to change the financial system and that's part of what we're trying to do is be a multi-asset custodian that holds assets whether crypto cash securities commodities and upgrades them and puts them onto blockchain rails to move around and so on in terms of equities we've now settled over 16 000 trades we've been operating the no action letter which is deliberately meant to be limited in size and scope allows us to be live and to learn lessons and we'll be fine filing a clearing agency registration uh hopefully shortly in which we will seek approval from the sec to be a clearing agent we would be one of really three clearing agents in the country the dtc the occ which is the options clearing corp and ourselves this would be a really huge um accomplishment for us in the industry because you will now have a piece of regulatory infrastructure that can now move securities in a highly regulated way but do it in uh a blockchain based system um i think that'll be really seminal and then would that be something that you would only use with with this product or is that something that could open you up to um taking on other customers in other ways oh definitely it's um a clearing agent is very powerful uh regulatory um umbrella and so initially we'll be starting with just u.s equities but there's no reason why they can't expand to a whole variety of other types of securities corporate bonds are a good example of them and others and so the markets are very large there's so much opportunity in in what i would call traditional financial services to change how these assets move and so we're trying to start actually very specifically we're doing u.s equities but just broker to broker trades uh there is an enormous world out there of client-side trades where you're allocating them to the underlying funds securities lending trades repo trades to help do funding tri-party etf movements corporate bonds you kind of go on and on and on the markets are that's just enormous i mean it's a 10 or 15 year journey to address all of those parts of it but in order to even get started on that journey you actually have to be regulatory approved and so that's a key component of what we're doing all right well it'll be exciting to see how everything shakes out and congratulations again on the paypal deal thank you very much exciting times here it's great to be with you thanks so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you for having me don't forget next up is the weekly news recap thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline ethereum chain accidentally splits in two on wednesday

network distribution factor a ratio encompassing a broader economic group more equivalent to middle and lower classes which is calculated by taking the aggregate supply in addresses holding more than

everything you wanted to know about oracles it's commonly known in the crypto community that oracles are a tricky thing to use and implement well but this post by sam sun a security researcher now at

so updated its wikipedia page to say he was a family member right before he approached the security guards then sam walks through several examples of how price oracles have malfunctioned or been manipulated starting with the time a korean a broken korean won price oracle on synthetics enabled a trading bot to make off with 1 billion dollars which i've discussed with kane warwick's of synthetics on unchained you should definitely check out that interview if you haven't already other examples sam gives are people manipulating prices on uniswap where prices are constantly fluctuating
