the crypto.com app today today's guest is andre cronia developer of urine fiance finance welcome andre hi laura thanks for having me and um i i think i need to start off by apologizing for for all the effort you had to go through to actually get me on this call i do apologize for that i'm not i i just try to hide in my corner and develop so i'm i'm normally not very connected on social media or those kinds of things so i know it can be a pain that's interesting i didn't even know you'd gotten my earlier messages uh i i when when i finally read your messages on telegram i went through like the the twitter stuff and the email stuff and so you try to get me on a bunch of different methods um i i normally pack my my social media stuff into a day so i'll ignore everything for a few days and just develop and then like try and clear my backlog and then move on to the next cycle i see yeah there was a go-between i also tried to use i'm not going to name who that person was but afterward i was like does this person even have a relationship with andre because then later that person was like oh he stopped responding to me after this thing i said but anyway we're not going to go into that i also actually want to make another disclaimer before we continue which is that for the audience members who are watching via video andre preferred not to do video and i have to make another disclaimer even for audio if you're listening because there are lawn mowers going on outside so if you can hear that i can't control it um but anyway for people watching on video that's why we're using his headshot for that side of the screen all right so andre i i promise i am human i just don't appear in person at all anymore but i'm definitely not an ai no one has to worry about that good to know you're not gbt3 over there all right so let's start with a question that seems simple but the more i researched it the more i was like i don't know how simple this is what is why earn finance um it's it's a yield optimizer so the goal with with wiring was always to simplify and to codify knowledge so so what i mean by that is originally back in jan feb when i started it i was looking at where to earn the highest yield and the yield was by borrowing and lending assets so i would i would look at something like die i would see ave has got it at six percent compound has it at four percent so i should have my funds in ave and i would move it around like this um after doing this for a few days a the gas fees made it prohibitive even at that time and b um it was tedious to need to do it and move it the whole time so instead i codified the process which allowed it to switch between these different yield providers at that time dydx fulcrum ave compound and the next iteration i realized is i can i can refine this by making it more granular so the more often it moves the higher your aggregate api annual yield and to get it as granular as possible i needed more people to interact with it so i opened it up so that more people can deposit funds and withdraw funds and the more people deposit and withdraw the more accurately it moves between the different lending providers and the higher aggregate yields it creates for you and that was that was v1 yearn very simplistic very basic just a a give it funds and forget and it's going to move it around to maximize yield then came in projects like uniswap curve we had lps this was an additional way to generate yield so we built the y pool in partnership with curve finance which allowed you to earn trading fees on top of the yield aggregate lending that you got now and that was sort of the v2 year and again that was fine up until the whole liquidity mining yield farming governance token incentives which is the current phase and that required something a little bit more intelligent so for that we provided the vaults which have more mutable strategies the the thing is up until the vaults the everything could happen on chain all of the data you needed was on chain all of the decision making was on chain all of the logic was on shane but now with yield farming you needed to start to make decisions like what is the price value of comp versus what is the price value of a balancer token and which one is the more profitable one to farm and you don't want to use price data on chain because that can be abused and move funds around so that required external mechanisms for people to provide input and that was the original design philosophy behind the the wi-fi or the wi-fi token as well which allowed people in this space that are also into yield optimization and that have been using these systems to know how to identify these strategies to have a organizational tool whereby they are incentivized and can provide strategies into these systems that allow to optimize yield but that's that's more on the operational level from the user perspective the goal is always very simplistic you provide the token that it is that you wish to have and and urine does not expose itself to any impermanent loss systems so if you provide a die there is a chance you're going to get zero percent yield but you're you're never going to to at least not get the die back you put in so if i put in 100 die i'm going to get out a 100 die that's one of the core principles fortunately so far we've we've been you know performing 10 up with the current yield phase it's closer to 100 so so that's great but it's simplistic in it's it's deposit and forget so it's it's supposed to act like a savings fund or an investment whatever you wanna you wanna picture it as but it's i put funds in my funds are always readily available and they are earning the best yield they can within the d5 ecosystem without me needing to have the time or knowledge to go hunt for these opportunities or understand these opportunities or need to go through the smart contracts and see what's going on i can provide it and the system will do that for me with the current gas fees and things the system has also evolved a little bit to make it a lot cheaper to deposit and to withdraw and it also subsidizes any interactions that need to happen like selling a token for another token and that also in the current market is a definite value add for the whole deposit and forget mentality um so so even though there's there's a lot of intricacies the the high level is really just a a automated smart savings account yeah the way i've been describing it on the show is it reminds me of a robo advisor like betterment or wealthfront and um that is pretty fascinating because those you know our big fit tech companies and you're basically just you um but the other thing i actually wanted to dive into before we get into even more detail i thank you actually for that really wonderful description um on wiring is that you also have been working in crypto for quite a while before um so can you just tell us a little bit about your background before you came to do y earn yeah sure i mean my my background goes back a few decades so you know i'm i'm i i always feel so incredibly old when i'm in crypto because everyone is a 20 year old that just walked out of high school and i just now thinks they're going to reinvent the world but anyway so i think so yeah i think i might even be older than you but let's not let's not figure it out on this show that could be a sideline conversation so so before this uh before i started working on yearn i was a consultant slash advisor slash developer for a few blockchains um that i i liked the research they were doing phantom foundation is one i was very excited about the asynchronous bft consensus and how we could use that in a lot of other industries i've been working in as well fusion with their distributed key rights management that actually allows for cross-chain key ownership so did quite a bit of work there with them as well before that i i was just teaching myself really and i i try and teach by studying whatever's do so i did code reviews via crypto briefing which was basically looking at the icos at the time seeing what have they built trying to assess their competency but it was mostly for for me to learn as well because that was my my training mechanism to understand how everything worked and to see and the main reason for that is before crypto i come from a very traditional fintech background did telecommunications mesh networks from there moved into ai big data from there into traditional insurance traditional banking traditional loans heavily focused on on the retail consumer side um and and it was during it was during that time that i started looking at blockchain because there were all of these fantastic claims happening in blockchain at the time of of people that have and this was just during that like early 2017 ico boom where where everyone had a a white paper that was just more fantastic than the one that was released just before it and it really captivated me because you're was there was this entire this entire sector that that i've i've never really been exposed to where where they were claiming they had solved you know problems that we've been struggling with for the last 20 years so i i quickly got very excited and very disappointed when you know through this code review process and reading through the stuff i very quickly realized that it's mostly just on paper lies and most of these guys don't really have what they are presenting and offering so so that was a little bit of a cold wake up and then from there i realized i need to to help contribute and help build some of these solutions if at all possible and then it was late last year where where my passion for d5 really really started because that's the first time that there was enough assets and there was enough protocols and there was enough toolings that a lot of the traditional finance stuff i used to do are possible to do now and in a in a much more autonomous in a much more transparent in a and a much lower opex environment which was which was really awesome for me to be able to to to interact with and i mean before that used to be a teacher comp sci before that studied computer science before that studied law so it's been it's been a it's been a long path yeah yeah when i saw that you were a lawyer i was like oh how did he become a coder but i understand because i've had you know multiple stops on my uh journey to this point in my career um so let's dive a little bit further into the wire and protocol um something that i just want to make sure all the listeners understand before we continue with our conversation is all these tokens that start with y so like y crv or y die or y usdt what does that represent when there's a token with a y in front of it and how do you think this type of token has been useful for users and for the protocol so so any any y prefix means it's a it's a yield bearing token so the y is just for healed um so so that means so so let's take usdc as an example usdc at its base is a usdc stablecoin and if we think of it in terms of purchasing power it has the purchasing power of one dollar because it is a dollar denominated stablecoin something like why usdc is is a tokenized yield version so so it still has the underlying properties of the underlying token which in this case is purchasing power of one dollar and being a dollar paid stablecoin but now you have it's it's yield i i don't want to say futures because the yield you get is the actual realized yield but it's basically it's yield futures as well that you're putting on top of it so it's it's the current earnings and future potential earnings that are now combined into the token so so the nice thing about this multi-layer tokenization system is that you you you can keep adding properties on top of that so a good example is at the base layer you have usdc and that has the properties and qualities of usdc now you add y now you have the yield bearing as well which means this is an ever incrementing object of the underlying assets now you can add the insurance the fid on top of it so now you have fidy usdc and i mean obviously we need to fix the naming standards in terms of ux but but the nice the nice thing is you're you're always inheriting the properties of the underlying asset so all of the y tokens in the system are just yield bearing versions of their underlying assets which means they are they will forever be increasing in value as long as there is yield opportunities and if there isn't yield opportunities they will still be equivalent to their underlying assets they can't diminish in terms of value yeah and so i actually then just with people having that knowledge want to just walk through why why iron version one one more time and then version two one more time as well and just um just walk it through like how it works if someone were to put their money in i think v1 is pretty easy to figure out because you explained it you know from your perspective so maybe we can just review that quickly but then let's go to v2 just one more time because you know these are a little bit complicated or not complicated but just if somebody's in just ingesting this material for the first time it might be it might have gotten a little bit quickly for them uh not a problem so so so everything in yearn is just automation of something you can do yourself so so let's say let's let's stick with the usdc example and let's say you as a as a user of in defy or someone that has interacted with ethereum by a meta mask you have let's say 5000 usdc now now you wanna you don't just want to have that sitting in your wallet instead you want to be trying to make money with it so what you would do is you would go look at the current lending providers so you would go to something like loan scan or defy prime you'll you'll see what are the current percentage interest rates being offered by the different providers and you'll see ave is at six percent compound is at five percent dydx is at seven percent so now you go okay dydx is going to give me the most so i'm going to put my funds at dydx but now it's also the very volatile nature of crypto means that the borrowing and lending side also very quickly changes so tomorrow when you when you look at at the five prime again you see oh but dydx is now down to two percent what compound is up to 10 so now you withdraw your funds from dydx and you put it into compound now that's all it does the the the v1y tokens just do that but they do it autonomously for you so whenever someone deposits or withdraws from the protocol it it looks at the different providers on chain it sees what their interest rates are and if it can move to one of these others in other words it's lump sum that it moves would not impact the apr to such an extent that you would be earning less then it simply moves the funds over to the other system and it just keeps doing this automatically as people are interacting with the protocol which means you as a regional depositor just has to deposit it once you don't have to monitor it and you can just let it accrue the highest interest rates for you that it can and your money is always available so if you want to withdraw at any given point in time you can and it's really that simple it's it's just it's just automation of things that you could do yourself if you had more time and information in terms of the defy ecosystem and then for v2 that was the delegated vaults which basically allows you to do that with any token is that it or or it's that urine iron has to create each of those so so it needs a vault per token um just to keep it clean technically you can't jump between tokens but then you have to trade between tokens and if you have to trade between tokens it means there's slippage and and one of the core principles of of the urine ecosystem is that if you give it a 100 you need to get 100 die back you you you might get zero percent but you won't get negative um so for that reason we we have a a vault per asset so you'll have a link vault you'll have a die vault you'll have a usdc vault and and and this is where people often often get a little bit confused because they'll they'll see oh but if if they're on on curve finance they can earn 90 apy but usdc which you can deposit into curve finance but the native usdc vault is only earning 20 api i say only sarcastically because i don't understand how we're in an industry right now where that's considered low but anyway that's a different discussion but that's because we don't convert to the usdc because now if i have to provide that as lp to curve it means i have to convert it into the four representative tokens and that means you're going to have lp losses or impermanent losses so instead we'll have it in compound where it's forming com tokens which which might be less apy but it's not it doesn't have any downside exposure which is important um but anyway sorry i'm getting a little bit sidetracked so so the delegated vaults the process there is you can let's let's take link for example you can take your link tokens to ave you can deposit it and that gives you a credit line you can then against that credit line borrow usdc and then with that usdc you can do the process we previously described so all the delegated vaults do is they simply add that one step so they'll they'll take that credit line and they'll see okay but what's the borrowing rate for usdc versus die versus tusd and what's the what's the the interest provided on each one and whichever one has the biggest net difference between borrow rate versus interest rate you can gain from using one of the subsequent faults that's the one it borrows and then puts in the the one reason why the the delegated vaults are nice is if you do that in your in your own capacity and apologies when i say you i mean general you i don't mean you specifically um when when you do that then then you need to check the collateral ratio of your your vault and you need to check the health factor and every day you need to make sure you're not liquidated um and and these things make you a little bit more risk averse so you'll do a much higher collateral ratio maybe 400 instead of 200 because you want to be safer um but the vaults do this for you so now it can be a lower collateralization ratio because whenever someone interacts with the protocol it rebalances even if someone's not interacting with the protocol it has off chain bots even if those off chain bots aren't being used um systems like gelato have built-in monitoring for our vaults uh so so it it it it does the automation you can do yourself but on a much more granular and i i almost want to say safer level um i'm hesitant to use the word safer because you're adding a lot of different compound risks and smart contract risk and other risks on top of that so i won't actually say it but in in in terms of monitoring your health factor or your collateralization ratio etc it does allow it to act on a much more granular level but it's it's again it's it's just that automation that's that's well automated and for people who believe in one particular token they don't have to sell that token in order to participate in these different yield farming schemes and at that moment incur a taxable event they can um just keep exposure to that token so for instance um you know you recently launched the why eath fall and that's why people are so excited about that but before we discuss the why eath fault let's talk about your the yfi token this was the catalyst for a lot of the interest in why earn and one of the features of it that was so captivating to the community was the fact that it was what we would now call a fair launch because this was the first one i mean i don't want to say literally the first one because i'm sure charlie lee would give me a call because he and i have had um a long discussion about how he fair launched litecoin um but this i think in the most recent wave of new tokens was the first token that was fair launched and by that what we mean is that it wasn't listed it wasn't sold it could only be earned in the protocol there were no tokens that were pre-mined and allocated to founders or vcs so why did you end up doing what we would now call a fair launch for wi-fi uh i mean as i stated in the medium article i just wanted other people to interact with the protocol and do stuff i was doing um it's people people like to glorify it but it's really nothing glorified it's it's i'm lazy and i didn't want to do all of the work and i want to sit back and just let my money sit in the vaults and earn the max amount of yield and to do that i needed more people that that that know what i do you know more people that understand curve that understand yearn that understand being an lp to uniswap and that they are incentivized to provide strategies and to provide optimizations and to keep working on the system and for that reason i wanted to to hand over the system to them um so so it's really it's really as simplistic as that it's a it's a i needed more people to do this stuff so that i don't have to do it the whole time wow and but why not allocate some of that money to yourself because for instance decrypt reported that you spent 42 thousand dollars building why earn and then double that amount on audits and hosting and then in addition you had to take out a loan on your house and your or at least at the time of the decrypt article you were twenty thousand dollars in debt and kind of in the typical startup model um which has been dominant for the past few decades a founder would just you know take some equity for him or herself so why not do that um i mean i i had the same rights as everyone else so you know i could also farm the token i could also use my own capital um and and just for qualification purpose that the crypt article was a horrible hat job they used so many things out of context it's not even funny uh well wait but did were are any of those facts wrong that i just stated uh so so so they they put it in a light that made it seem like it was negative um i did spend that money on the protocol but i recouped it in protocol fees long time ago i i did have debt i did not take out debt specifically to build the protocol and the reason i have debt in my local currency is because the the interest rates i pay in the local currency are significantly lower than the rates i'm making with yearn um and when i say that i mean as an lp so so you know it was it was cherry-picked bits of information to to tell a story that was really not an accurate portrayal at the time so so so yearn itself is a is a profit generating system it's been profitable since day one and it's it's been able to recoup any of the expenses i've needed um and that's why that's why i i i didn't i didn't feel a necessity to to assign any token when you know i was i was happy to play with the same rules as everyone else um i was happy to use my own funds to mine the tokens so that i could get a portion of voting power um i was happy to participate in that same ecosystem so because if you want to if you want to do a proper exit to community you have to be willing to exit if if there's a if there's a founder portion aside it doesn't matter how small then people expect the the founder or the team to be responsible for it they they expect so so so so what i've seen with a lot of tokens and i didn't want this to happen is i've seen let's say let's say a traditional 30 goes to the team so now a lot of people that that that own the token don't don't think they need to do anything they can just sit and wait until the team does something because the team are supposed to maintain it and continue building it and improve it and etc etc etc versus if you have no team token if you have no founder token it's it's only the people that have that token it's it's in their control they need to decide what they make with it they need to decide what they build with it so so it's it's it's to it's to avoid this mentality of oh don't worry the founder and the team will take care of it because now now no the founder and the team won't take care of it like as as long as the protocol is of value to work on obviously i'm going to keep working on it this is my baby and i do love it but but don't don't expect you know me to to somehow magically do things for you it's it's it's a hundred percent in the community's ownership um so the community needs to you know get off of their asses and do something and when the community embraced this notion of the fair launch was that a surprise to you like were you trying to make some kind of statement when you did that or is it literally what you just said that you were like this is too much work for me and i really wanted the community to handle it and so i'll just give them a token and they can manage it or like or were you trying to make some kind of statement about you know vc coins as they're so as they're called now i i'm i'm i i actually wanted to to to write an article okay so so to first answer the question no it wasn't meant as any statement i i don't actually understand the current sort of anti-vc narrative um i mean from from the data i have it's it's more of a anti-unlocked tokens for team narrative because from everything i've seen teams dump their tokens a lot more than vcs dump their tokens so if you want an anti-narrative it should be anti-unlocked team tokens not anti-vc but that's that's a different topic it was as simplistic as i needed other people engaged with the ecosystem i i had tried a bunch of different models i tried to do um like work with other communities i tried to do community grants and see if that would get people interested it just nothing worked when i saw you know other people launching tokens in in every second day of the week and they get huge communities overnight so it was as simplistic as i knew a token was the best way to be a catalyst for more people to be engaged for more people to take over i i was i was not in my wildest dreams expecting it to be as phenomenally successful as it has been i mean right now there's almost 20 employees there's there's more happening on the forum and on discord than i can keep up with um so it's phenomenal to see um but it was i i i was expecting maybe you know four or five people that come to help me out not the 20 odd we have now which is really awesome uh but right so no statement so in a moment we're going to talk more about the wi-fi token but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible how much in fees

ethereum game on the market you can try out the game at playgu.co unchained pod for the d5 heads out there looking for a new opportunity why not go grab some chests back to my conversation with andre cronia so as we were discussing the wi-fi token just really took off and you know it had zero value as you said in your original blog post and at the time of recording it's worth about 28 000 so why do you think it took off as quickly as it has if we're talking about the financial value i have no clue i i even even the reason i built yearn and why it's so stable coin focused is because i very quickly learned i do not have an aptitude for for price prediction or knowing if something's going to go up or go down i i think ta is flipping a coin and hoping for the best so i very quickly avoided all of that stuff and decided i'm going to stick to to stable sustainable farming mechanisms so i i do not have any informed opinion as to why the token has done what it has done but the the the positive side of the value it's gained and the traction it's gained is that it's it's provided access to to a lot of the best minds in our industry i mean the the caliber of people working on it now thanks to the high price is phenomenal so so as a as a net benefit i'll say i'm very grateful it is as high as it is but as to as to why uh no cues and one thing is you know this could be a reason is the fact that it only had 30 000 tokens to launch but is that i think that's a cap right so i saw that there were proposals to increase that cap i mean that alone like the scarcity of it is probably a big reason um i mean there's there's there's other tokens that have been scarcer i mean there's there's a token called unobtainium which i think there's one of you know so i mean it's probably a meme right yeah so so so like but again you know it wasn't it wasn't designed with that in mind when whenever i have a price conversation with people i always tell them that you know it doesn't matter if if a wi-fi token is worth one cent or if it's worth a hundred thousand dollars the the system only cares that its value is one because one wi-fi is equal to one wi-fi as far as governance and the system protocol is concerned um so so i don't i'm tempted to say the price doesn't matter it doesn't actually influence anything it doesn't actually change anything and the protocol will keep working the way it is irrespective of it so so i tend to not really think about it um i i did not know the price is currently 28 unless you you you mentioned that a little bit earlier so so you know it's it's i actually lost i thought it was somewhere around the 20 so i see it's doing its thing again well yeah yesterday it was 22. so i don't know why it jumped so much but same no choose um and and it's good for the community you know they're happy about it they like to rally around those kinds of things i'm sure some of the people that have it probably do market making these kinds of things i don't even know there was another yeah explanation that sounded interesting which was tony shang wrote that for your second pull it was 98 percent die and two percent wi-fi and when people deposited in that pool they could earn wi-fi but since early on it was hard to get when they bought in they would be buying the two percent wi-fi with the die that they put in so they were basically buying wi-fi to yield farm wi-fi and then he was like well that would also push the token price up and i didn't know if you like purposely did that or if you realized that that would be an effect no it was definitely not a realization it was actually a i wasn't expecting it to blow up as quickly as it did so the the capital i was using was not sufficient to to to get enough wi-fi so that i can actually be a strong participant in the ecosystem so the second pool i actually set up so that it would be attractive for people to sell the wi-fi token too because there's a lot of die so you know they're they're incentivized they can add a little bit of wi-fi and get a lot of tie so it the the thought pattern was that it was a good mechanism to incentivize people to sell into the pool so that i could actually get more and that horribly backfired but while while i will say that that could definitely attribute towards the price for the first week which was the distribution system um you know it's it's definitely not contributed anything after that um because after the first week finished you know it it seemingly hasn't stopped and for the third pool this was actually really interesting so this is a balancer y curve wi-fi pull one of the requirements for people to receive the tokens that they earn in this pool is that they have to participate in governance and actually vote and i found this to be a pretty ingenious way to solve one of the main issues that other systems have had which is that often they don't get enough votes to reach quorum so i wondered how did you come up with this idea i thought it was super smart yes i thank you but like nothing i design is ever from a a thoughtful perspective um it was it was as simplistic as that point i i wanted to distribute the wi-fi token to people that knew how to play this game so so when i say that i you know i i want people that knew how to use curve i want people that knew how to use yearn that knew how to use balancer that knew how to be an lp and and at this point i i had taken them through all of these steps you know because because the the first pull you needed to know how to use yearn and curve to participate the second one you needed to know how to use balancer and then on the third one you needed to know how to use an lp and then i wanted to teach people how to use governance because that's that's why the token exists is for governance um so it was really just a a tutorial if you will in terms of the steps i wanted people to go through to show that this is a valid candidate to participate in the system because that's that's that's the the skill set i wanted for the decision makers and after everything meaning after your fair launch and now the crazy value of the coin i was curious to know how much yfi you own at this moment i currently have 10 which i'm very proud of i actually only managed to farm two and then gas fees etc was subsidized by the treasury um and they sent me the other eight and this was when it was i think around four thousand dollars or so so all of that's locked up in governance i'm just happy to have any kind of vote but i i have 10 to my name which i am very proud of yeah i think i listened to another show that you did where you said you only had one and a half and i was like it was very low for i i managed to form two and then i sold 0.4 of that to cover gas fees for deployments and then the arrest was gas subsidies that the treasury voted towards me all right so let's talk a little bit more about governance um why don't you describe the governance process in yearn uh so so originally there was just the unchained part you know that's that's simplistic you you lock in your tokens you can create a proposal people vote on chain on the proposal and executor is set on the proposal and when it reaches quorum someone can trigger the execute and that execute is normally a smart contract that then does some kind of function but but that's the that's the let's call it very rigid governance and only the on-chain governance i mean since then yearn has evolved and to be a lot more than just the the smart contracts you know there's there's there's content happening outside there's the the forums there's new strategy discussions there's strategists there's there's over 20 employees that are being paid out of the system so so there's it evolved a lot away from the very rigid on-chain component which is really just about the smart contracts into a lot more social governance system which originally was was just like forum polls um on the gov yearn um finance but that very quickly we saw was not symbol resistance and people would create a bunch of accounts and register and then mess with the polls so we ended up working with the balancer snapshot off-chain solution which we're implementing now in a bunch of different mechanisms but but even then you know right now there's voting in terms of how should how should time-based vote locking work or what tokens should be used in terms of voting because you know you've got wi-fi and governance you've got wi-fi and vaults you've got wi-fi and ave um which ones should be included so so there's it's it's very much an evolving system currently and at this point i'm just a spectator so so i'm actually i i often just see the new proposals being voted in and then participate in governance myself to to you know try and try and add my say but it's it's it's really evolving on its own at this point and i have no idea where it's going to end up in a month from now would do you think it would be better if urine went to a compound style form of governance where there was code attached to each of the proposals at the time of voting rather than you know the the system now where there's kind of this uh i guess like momentum built for something and then it's coded up um i i i do not think so so what the the problem that i have with that system is you spend a lot of time and energy into building this code and this code might not be voted in so that is a lot of resource time wasted because the the the difficult part isn't the discussions or the agreement on a vote the difficult part is codifying the smart contracts and making sure it's audited and secure and stable and is going to execute as you expect it to execute so so as someone that helps build these contracts i would much rather know that it will be voted in and then i'll build it rather than i build it and then i hope it's voted in um so so so i'm i'm much more preferential to the current mechanism and yearn than i am to the mechanism and compound yeah i think i'm with you on that one and i meant to say earlier that that question was when i got from uh i don't know if it's one of my twitter f it's somebody on twitter um named siege rhino um all right and i also actually wanted to ask about something else which is in a podcast conversation on uncommon core you said that you were unhappy because whales have been dominating the vote do you see any way to mitigate that so one of the things we're looking at is is time weighted participation currently where your vote is only so strong as the the time slope that you voted in for but even then you know a whale will just take a long end of the position the the thing is if you have something that has financial value and this is why i wanted it to avoid financial value originally but if you have something that that is connected with financial value then it it is gameable it's as simplistic as that and and the game is simply your capital so we're we're fortunate right now that you know the whales that are participating are people like framework ventures and these guys and they're awesome and they know how the space works and they're you know intimately familiar with dfi and they're actually adding significantly more value than they are you know in quotes subtracting by being a whale so so it's it's it's not something i i really care to fix right now it's something that it would have been nice to see an even bigger distribution but i mean most of these guys didn't get their tokens during the initial week distribution they kept accumulating after the fact so so if they have that much voting say now it's because they they they put their own resources into it so i i i'm a lot more grateful now than i was when i had that conversation for sure because i've i've seen the value they can add you're famous for saying i test in prod which means that you test in production and that the code may be unaudited or is unaudited and yet we've seen a ton of hacks and bugs and exploits and d5 this year so why why is that your motto um so the original reason for that was back in back in jan when i started this i i went the the proper route i i got audits a bunch of different audits i published the audits and because i published the audits people put money into the protocol and there were mistakes in the protocol even after the audits and and to me that was a much bigger warning sign because i saw that people people use these audits as safety nets the second they see an audit they don't they don't caution anymore they don't do their own research they just throw their money in and the the original reason i updated my bio to i test and probe and it's the same reason why i stopped releasing the audits even though we do the audits i don't release them to the public because i want people to have caution so one of the one of the one of the beautiful things about defy versus traditional finance is you're in control of your money when you put it into a protocol it is your choice to put it into that protocol it's not it's not a money manager where you give your money and you have no idea what the hell they're doing with it you at any given point of time can see where it is but now now that that privilege comes with responsibility so whenever people interact with my systems i i wanted them to pause and to think about that so that they go and analyze now i know not everyone has smart contract skills or capabilities but at least at a high level you you should be able to go look at these systems and and see where the money is going you should at least be able to trace the money that's that's we have fantastic tooling for that in terms of things like ether scan and eftx and a bunch of other tools that that you can see what it's doing and how it's doing it so it's a pet beef peeve in terms of how it's evolved because you know all of all of the projects that sort of followed yearn and adopted the eye test and prod motto they they took that to mean that i just yolo launch stuff and prod and you know i it you there's no consequences and and it's the reason i put that there is actually to make people more cautious not less cautious so i i want people to have more responsibility in terms of what they do with these systems and and the key word that a lot of people seem to miss is test i still test thoroughly i'm not going to stop testing and i'm still going to make sure that the systems are as secure and as good as they can be because it's the testing part that's important um but i know that's turned into a meme at this point where it's i i yolo deploy stuff and then you know hope for the best but but the the the motto and the purpose behind it is to tell people hey have a little bit of caution take a little bit of responsibility and do a little bit of due diligence it sounds like you were talking about yeah when you were talking about other projects but i won't ask you no i mean it's a very long list of projects that i followed that i've adopted the the whatever i mean yam did it sushi did it so many different flavors of food that i don't even remember did it like like like everyone did it and and and it ended up being almost almost a joke which really annoyed me like like i'm i'm i'm honestly surprised more money hasn't been lost i i think we have been so lucky that so far it's only been what the 750 000 from yam and i think the 13 000 from sushi and 30 million from sushi and that's it i i mean both of those numbers i think are ridiculous but you know given given the sheer volume of money that were was flowing into these protocols within 24 hours it's it's it's fairly small in comparison even though i i still think the fact that we as a community are glossing over it is beyond insane and i just wanted to call out so you said that now you are getting audits on what you release i've always been getting audits i just don't release them to the publics because i don't want to give people that safety net i but on the defiant podcast which was published just a month ago you were saying that you weren't doing security audits because they were so expensive you said it was twenty thousand dollars for the cheapest sixty thousand dollars for the most expensive yeah so just a month ago you weren't or we've we've always been doing audits we haven't been so so there's a difference in in what they what they do with the full formal audits is they assign x amount of people for x amount of weeks and they do manpower per man week audits those are very very expensive to do and i simply can't afford them but you can do spot audit so spot audits are normally like 5 000 or so and it's it's a much it's a much faster review um but i do those whenever we do a new system release just to make sure that there's there's a view on it i just don't want those audits to give people comfort and does that kind of audit account for the composability because there could be new attack vectors that get opened up when you know you're combining operations with you know maker and ave and curve and do you know what i mean so is that doing that as well oh okay uh no no no no no no no wait you're saying that those orders definitely they do not cover for that no no no no this this this is pure spot checks on the code does the code make sense does does this in isolation work when when you add the full scope you need the full audit and that you just have to have the money available for which which is is not viable right now but now with the treasury we can actually start setting out for that and talking a little bit more about the community and um maybe your position in it and the views of other people in march you quit defy at least temporarily calling the community hostile and the users entitled but then later you came back um and then in early august you said you were close to quitting this is the decrypt article that you took issue with earlier so you know you can feel free to correct any facts there but you know at that time why did you say the community was toxic and why did you ultimately not leave and in general what's your opinion about having a position like yours in the d5 space first things first the article garbage so i'll just skip over that one i i i was not planning on quitting on in august um that was quotes they used from fabe um feb march i i i rage quit i was i was sick of the current um narrative back then so so to give that a little bit more context back in feb march everything was the developer's fault like if if anything went wrong with users funds it was the developer's fault and everyone was screaming at the top of their lungs it was the developer and and that broke my back because i i it was just me there was no funding there's no support staff there's nothing like that i put disclaimers on everything i put warnings on everything and until date no one has lost money using my systems but there was the slippage thing with the zap where the user was trying to exploit the new curve pool we had launched which we hadn't announced and he was trying to use the imbalance to give himself a benefit there's the whole post-mortem on that there's a lot more data back in fave that you can go through if you want i remember waking up in the middle of the night trying to to to release reports trying to make all of these people screaming at the top of their lungs happy that that they are justified and and it was it was such a miserable time for me because as a developer seemingly everything was my fault if there was a user problem it was my fault and and this is a free system no one no one was paying a saint to use any of these things but users were were constantly attacking me the communities were constantly attacking me the the back then so-called defy police were alienating me in every single group so so i left because i decided you know i'm i have no reason to keep trying to do a a free public good service if this is how people are acting and the only reason i even bothered to come back was because i saw that all of these so-called defy police people back then had alienated themselves they they they had kept pushing this narrative that devs are evil and all that caused was devs to stop working so after a few months later it had changed quite a bit and people had started to accept that look not all of the responsibilities on the dev the dev is partially responsible and i'm more than happy to accept that but the lp where they decide to put their funds also take liability and because that narrative changed a lot it was a lot it was a lot more comfortable for me to develop again and that is why i'm enjoying development again because there's a lot more quid pro quo in terms of every person every every participant's responsibilities which i think is a lot healthier narrative than what it was back in march and to go back also to discuss the security issue you recently launched why insure finance and um why don't you tell us a little bit about what that does and how it works uh i mean we're we're just a front end really for nexus mutual uh they're the reinsurer and the underwriter so if there is a claim there as underwriter they're the ones that decide if it's going to get paid out if funds have to get paid out they're the reinsurer so it's coming out of their pocket why insurer just allows it to be proxied in front so no kyc no aml and you can still take insurance and then we just added a few nice to haves like nft on top so that it's actually tradable um so that you know if you buy six months worth of cover and in three months from now a protocol looks like it's becoming a little bit more risky maybe you want to sell that at a premium and create a bit of a secondary distribution market um but but that's really all it is it's it's a very straightforward solution and then one thing i wanted to be sure i understood was so let's say i put 10 000 tether in there is that also the amount that i'm insured for like is it a one to one ratio or so so so so there's two iterations of insurance the the second version which which i think you're referring to isn't out yet um the the one right now is is smart contract failure insurance so so you don't actually have to put any money at risk you just cover a sum so i'll take out insurance for for 10 000 usdt but i don't actually need to have 10 000 usdt into the system uh the second iteration that we're releasing which is which is the the fid token that is insured one to one so if i put in one usdt i get out one if i if id usdt which which is insured for that value but that's a that's a that's a little bit of a different system that that one hasn't been publicly launched yet oh okay yeah i think that's what i read about and i also wanted to go back to the fair launch topic and discuss the delegated funding dow vaults and i'm just going to very quickly describe this because um instead of asking you to do it because i want to ask a question about it but basically funders will put wi-fi into this fair launch vault and then they get an lp share and then if teams want to apply for a grant they can do so by setting up a git coin grants page and then they apply via the the um urine finance forum which is gov.yarn.finance and then there's a vote there and then if they are approved then the applicant will get a credit line a credit limit that's set by why borrow.finance and that's based on credit delegation which is uh basically an unsecured loan that's based on personal trust slash enforced by law um so one thing is when you were creating this i wondered it basically seems to me to be like the dao from 2016 but an updated 2020 version were you aware that that is what you were doing was that like inspiration or or did it just end up that way so the the the inspiration was from the 2017 vitalik article on the dow ico which the the the premise there was that you have a tao that manages it but it's also an ico in terms of funding and it can set milestones that are based on payments but but yes it's it's it's 100 inspired by that wow okay but all right but you're saying it's from vitalik's article but i can't remember like i don't think you were were you working in crypto in 2016 uh his came out late early 2018 actually um he wrote it in 2017 so so it's not it's not the original the dao um that was 2016. it was uh iteration on top of that okay and so i recently published a another podcast with olof carlson we have holly chain capital and we were talking about yfi and he was saying that in his you know mind like this is what you're creating is something that is a new structure that replaces traditional business structures what do you think of that statement um i i don't know if i'd say replaces versus versus a a a decentralized implementation um but but but now i'm being very specific on terminology because you you know business business structures exist because they function well so so we we we saw it with with urine governance as well where originally everyone was just participants and it was quite chaotic and eventually sort of leaders started popping up in their respective areas you know marketing had their own figurehead and finance had their own figurehead and eventually these people were elevated to the positions where where they're sort of the delegated decision makers and and that's very traditional business structure but but instead of where in a traditional business structure it's very top down this all occurred organically bottom up so so that's why that's why i'd say you you're still going to end up with the same sort of business structures if you draw it on a piece of paper i just think the way that you arrive at at who those people are and and how they are are empowered to do so it's very different because because now if if one of those actors are no longer functioning appropriately you know it's not a ceo that's firing them but it's it's it's the people in the forum that are delegating their power to them that end up replacing them so so it's this mix of of business and i mean if you look at traditional business structures you look at traditional democracy politics structures i i think they overlap a lot in in how they accomplish this and doing that all in a in a decentralized semia non way um i i think is very very cool um but i i don't think it replaces it i think it's it's just a different implementation thereof but you agree that it is kind of like a new type of business structure that we're seeing except just completely different from what's been around for the last couple hundred years yes i mean yeah yeah yeah so so she's thinking uh like it's it's a it's weird it being put that way but i guess which is pretty cool yeah i told a lot well often i were saying that we think this is going to be so incredibly disruptive to pretty much every industry but people can check back and um check in with me in a few decades and see if olaf and i were right but anyway um so we're not going to be able to get to all of these but here are some of the additional products that you have written about launching why trade finance why swap exchange why liquidate finance why borrow finance why insurance well we discussed why insurance finance but in general what's your vision for what iron could become i i mean wire and skull is very simplistic it's to optimize yield for people that don't necessarily have the time and knowledge to do it themselves um or capital for that reason um and everything that i pulled around it is to facilitate that single goal as an example why trade which is the the 1000x leverage stablecoin trades that increases trading volume on curve which increases trading fees for lps which increases yield why liquidate keeps the system safe in terms of delegated vaults but when it does liquidate a percentage of that goes into the treasury which again increases yield why swap is single-sided amm which allows you to to provide that single asset and still have lp exposure without having the impermanent loss side um so that again increases yield uh it's it's everything has a singular purpose and that is to increase yield because i want i want yearn to be the the one-stop deposit and forget automated healed money manager all right yeah and fascinatingly this will all happen in a decentralized manner or could um but let's actually just now discuss the world of traditional corporate structures prior to working on urine you were and maybe still are a technical advisor to the phantom foundation in early january one of its south african partners xar network said that it was repairing or sorry this was in july it was preparing civil and criminal action against you because allegedly work you had done for it later launched on phantom not on xar and when they confronted you you said if you guys wish to take legal action go for it additionally they said that you quote unlawfully and without authorization open sourced intellectual property intended for private use to the public and they also say that you are running a number of wire and iron domains in their private infrastructure including urine dot finance urine dot exchange urine dot fi etc what do you have to say about their allegations look it's it's a lot easier if i actually provide the documentation they sent and show that to people versus me saying that it's all garbage because you know it's he says see she said which which never really gets you anywhere um then the the the long and the short is all of this only happened after yearns success all of this happened and i have letters of them claiming if i pay them 85 000 us dollars that they will remove these notices and hand over the domains all of this stems out of there is no contractual agreements between me and them so there is no legal action they can take and the civil action they were trying to take is based on the fact that i had unlawful access to our aws account which was registered under my credit card that i have proof and evidence for as well so so nothing has come of this um there have been a few news this that have tried to write stories about this i even got legal counsel that reached out to each and every single south african police station to try and find this case they supposedly launched against me which greg himself later came out and said there is no case against me so it's it's i mean i don't want it i guess from fantasies but i don't know from tsar no not okay so so i i i don't want a bad mouth but like this this whole experience has just been a very underhanded way for them to try and get money fees on the ethereum blockchain have been incredibly high in recent weeks although at least at the time of recording at least gas fees have come down somewhat but somebody did tell me that the other day they lost 600 in failed transactions alone so i wondered have you ever considered or would you consider moving wire into another blockchain uh i would definitely consider it practically it just doesn't make any sense right now for for wiring to work you need usdt you need dye you need link on top of that you need compound you need ave you need uni swap with aggregators like one inch and paraswap and matcha on top of that you need metamosque etherscan remix so so while while i would gladly move to another chain that supported a everything if not a subset of what i just mentioned i don't foresee that happening within the next six months or even year and do you have any preference for any particular layer two solution uh i mean i definitely have my bias in terms of the projects i've worked with in the past uh but but i like like none of them have really been been tested so so so everyone always likes to use this oh but their fees are so much cheaper or their transactions are so much faster but but you know it's it's the highway analogy it's if you have a a autobahn that has no cars on it you can drive very very fast but if it's filled with cars you're going to sit in traffic like everyone else now ethereum is the traffic it it if you move all of that traffic to a different blockchain it doesn't mean it's all of a sudden going to be better it might be just as congested as ethereum unless you're willing to you know sacrifice security or some other metrics so i mean it's it's a it's a long-winded way to try and avoid answering the question directly because i i don't want to mention any projects because then i'm shilling some random coin again so and this was a question inspired by phil manley on twitter if you were to start some sort of cross-chain version of wire and what blockchain or blockchains would you add i i actually don't think i'm qualified enough at this point to answer this question i've been so i've been so bogged down in eth since jan that that i'm actually not that up to date with the layer one landscape at this point in time i mean i've i've heard a lot about something like dot but i haven't actually looked at polka dot i've done a cursory look at something like solana i've stayed up to date with fusion and phantom but i'd i'd actually have to revisit the landscape to to make that decision because it's going to be it's going to be a lot more around the tooling that's available more so than the actual capacity of the blockchain that makes sense that's interesting all right well there's about five million other things i could have asked you because there's a ton of activity going on in urine but maybe we'll just have to have you back some other time but in the meantime where can people learn more about you and wiring uh the best place for wired is to head over to docs.yearn.finance um the guys currently working on it have done a phenomenal job um if it's more about like the grassroots day-to-day stuff definitely the governance forum gov.yearn.finance and to learn more about me don't you know like i'm just i'm just a wheel in the cog don't waste your time and energy on it rather spend it on yearn because that's that's the thing that's going to be there if i die tomorrow um so like uh don't spend your time on permanent stuff not not impermanent stuff all right great well thank you so much for coming on unchained this has been so fun uh thank you very much laura thanks so much
