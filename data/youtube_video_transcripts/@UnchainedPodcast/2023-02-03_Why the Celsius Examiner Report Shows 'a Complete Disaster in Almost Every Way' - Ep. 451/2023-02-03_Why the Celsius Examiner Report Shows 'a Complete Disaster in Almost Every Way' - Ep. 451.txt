today's guest is Adam schuber investigative reporter at the financial times welcome thanks for having me on this week the Celsius independent examiner Shobha pelay dropped her 476 page report on the failed cryptolender and it was quite the bombshell what were your main takeaways from the report the main takeaway from the report is that Celsius was a complete disaster in almost every way imaginable and and almost from the very beginning in a way one of like the major things that came out uh in the examiner's report is is to do with the Celsius native token sale and the way that uh that with the way that the examiner portrays what was going on with cell is that Celsius spent an enormous amount of money including its customers uh Bitcoin and ethereum including investor cash simply on buying its own native token to prop up the price and and then the real kicker here is in the examiner's report one of the reasons that they were spending so much money buying its own token was so that Executives including Alex machinski could sell their token and so that their sales would not crash the public price and I think the amount is something like 68 million dollars worth of sale that Alex mercinski sold yeah and that's referring to the CEO that's right yes the CEO and former CEO and and founder you know it's a very long document it's almost you know with the appendices I think it's like 600 700 pages but it is extraordinarily damning yeah something else that really struck out at me is the marketing around Celsius and this is a lesson that customers are rather painfully learning now some of the claims that Celsius made about how its earned product worked or what would happen in the event of a bankruptcy were flat out false according to this report what were Celsius and machinski claiming and what was the reality so the way that the examiner puts this is uh sort of is very sober in a in a sort of lawyer-like way I think the lion says something like you know the business model that Celsius marketed was not the business model that it actually operated that's that's putting it mildly so for example uh you know Celsius represented that you know that it would pay something like 80 percent of its Revenue to profits to customers in the form of Rewards actually the rewards that are paid had nothing to do with how much money it was making because it wasn't making any money um they simply set rewards to to be competitors like say block fire Voyager you know other crypto lenders the uh you know uh Celsius was marketed that's extremely safe in fact internally it's sort of systems its systems its processes its internal controls were you know almost non-existent um there's a particular particular intern uh one one person internally said that it was basically a complete a complete stamp was like they recognized internally that they didn't really know what was going on in terms of the Investments they were making Celsius was represented as you know making institutional loans are fully collateralized in fact it was um doing all sorts of Investments that weren't institutional loans and even the institutional loans that they was making a big chunk of them were completely uncollateralized or collateralized with extremely illiquid at you know um assets that were basically worth the zero as collateral so there's a whole there's a whole sort of uh landscape of things like everything that Celsius represented about itself to the public almost every single one of them according to the examiner's report was wasn't was not true yeah and another piece of it that just kind of had my jaw dropping to the floor was that I guess in a lot of the video amas that um machinski did on YouTube he would often you know make these different claims that did not actually represent how Celsius was operating and then afterward there would be like staff meetings on whether they should edit them removing the information without actually alerting people that you know those were misstatements and so you know they were very well aware that what he was claiming and what the reality were were different let's actually now dive a little bit more into cell as you flagged early on what were some of the claims about cell and what was happening behind the scenes initially it seemed at the very start of Celsius you know the cell token was just um allowed to have its own price but from about 2020 Celsius began spending its own money spending its customers money spending investor money to prop up the price so they they would tell the community will we buy a certain amount of sale from the market to pay the rewards that we owe you um in fact they bought to keep the price where they wanted wanted it to be one you know I mentioned one of the reasons The Examiner said that they did this one of the reasons was so that insiders Executives people like Alex mercinski so that they could sell their own Holdings of sale without affecting the price massively another reason is keeping the price of sale up had a major positive impact on celsius's own balance sheet so Celsius you know had its own Holdings of cell token it recorded on its own boundary as an asset and therefore by spending you know money that investors were giving them um crypto assets that customers were giving them on buying sale it could inflate and protect its own balance sheet and one of the remarkable things in when the examiner details the collapse in in May you know beginning in May and then in June last year you know Celsius and was trying was still trying to prop up the price of Sal because because that was so much of its balance sheet um and there's a um I believe there's like a reference in you know in maybe mid-may around the time that Tara Luna was collapsing you know they're still they you know they're facing massive withdrawals and they're still transplant money on on profiting the sale price up when you read the report you get this sense of a business kind of geared towards propping up this sell token and it's sort of bizarre in a way um that that it makes it gives you the impression that there was like it was never really like a sort of a real real profitable business there yeah yeah and another piece of it was that Celsius during its initial coin offering had actually claimed that it had sold all 325 million cell in that Ico but only 203 million were actually sold and the company debated whether or not to tell the community that and ultimately didn't and then some of the other pieces just because I think the other theme that stood out to me was throughout it was very well the employees were very well aware that what was happening here was not above board so for instance like the head of trading said to other employees including the then CFO just to clarify between us three the last three to four months we bought more sell than what we pay as interest per week but we did not buy it for the interest payments that's just what we told the community and then even the Celsius employees kind of jokingly congratulated themselves on their good work which resulted in people thinking that the price of cell would go to the Moon haha so um they very clearly kind of understood what was happening here and which we'll talk about in a second they did try to change the behavior what about that stuck out to you did you also notice that same theme so two two things on that and just to emphasize just how sort of pervasive this or how important this new buying sell was to Celsius so that the examiner looked at well how much sell did Celsius ever release into the world into the into the marketplace through its Ico and how much sale did it buy and it found that it had bought more sale than it had ever released into the community um I think they say you know they in effect Celsius bought every cell token once and maybe even twice at least some of them twice on the um you know the other employees I mean that's definitely one of the things that comes out in the examiner's report there was a certain amount of understanding amongst you know I guess you call it c-suite and managers at Celsius people under stood that what they were telling users and customers was not accurate people understood that the business was not sustainable and they understood that you know the systems and processes and you know records that they had weren't reliable effectively you know people knew was a mess you know there was you know this wasn't the kind of you know only the chief executive knew what was going on kind of thing people knew what was going on and and there's also some some indications in the report that people were trying to fix it and and so they're sort of you can read that report and and you can take away two things about you know the people other than Alex machinski in the company either that you know they should have blown the whistle much much earlier they should have um alerted uh you know customers what was going on and you could look at the other way which is that you know people were trying to fix it you know they they weren't sort of necessarily happy with what was going on yeah yeah no I had the same exact two takeaways I thought why didn't anybody play The Whistle sooner um but then I did see uh they were trying to change it internally all right so in a moment we're also going to talk a little bit more about the balance sheet of Celsius but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 50 million people using crypto.com one of the easiest

Revelations was that Celsius had a hole in its balance sheet as early as the beginning of 2021. can you talk a little bit about what shoba play found there yeah so in a way everything comes back to this maniacal binding of Sal all the time um and so what what the examiner describes is that you know in around 2021 obviously the price of um you know uh Bitcoin ethereum have been rising and and Celsius realized is that a problem it had been using the coins that users have been given them to purchase sell and suddenly now it has this big coin deficit because it's spent it all on propping up the price of cell the price of Bitcoin has risen significantly and now in dollar terms that hold is is very large and Celsius does an interesting thing to fix it they used other customer coins so you know so we we've got a gap of Bitcoin we're going to use the other Bitcoin that we have that we haven't spent we're going to use the S collateral to borrow stable coins so we're going to go out and get loans using this user Bitcoin as collateral then we're going to use the stable coins that we've got to buy Bitcoin to plug the Bitcoin hole and so they've got this big balance sheet uh hole which is like a deficit in stable coins and there's a a very Stark chart in the examiner's report which shows that if you exclude the cell token so the inflated price of cell is disguising this whole you know for um you know at least since 2021 but you can see that there's been a there's been a overall coin deficit for a long time and it's been in stable coins now what happens when it goes bankrupt is you know people want their Bitcoin back Celsius has to unwind these loans has to pay back the stable accordions to get the Bitcoin collateral back to give it back to users and you have the sort of double tension where users want the Bitcoin they have to give Bitcoin back to pay off their loans to get the Bitcoin back and then that whole becomes sort of um unavoidable yeah it it's really the the work actually the even more worrying thing here is the reason why the examiner says that it began in 2021 is not because she knows for sure that's the case it's because she's only been able able to reconstruct the records going back that far oh so it may even it may even have been earlier wow well it looks that way given the fact well I guess that chart starts in like May 2021 and the deficit is already quite large at that point right so um clearly it happened earlier and what we don't know quite when yeah I think I honestly I feel there are so many Echoes of the FTX situation um because obviously you know they both had their exchange token that they were trying to prop the price up of and then both of them also are using as collateral to like essentially take out good money but that's what eventually buried them both so one other thing that I wanted to ask about here was you know I think the part that shocks me is what you were saying before about how the rewards rate was not related at all to how much money they were actually making when they were lending out those funds and it feels like they could have just had a sustainable business that they'd just done it that way um and so you know I don't know what your take is on kind of why uh they didn't or I think in this case it was really ax machinski who decided not to just try to go the sustainable route yeah I think there's a there's a couple of things there one is um there was this mentality and and the examiner really attributes this you know very individually to Alex masinski that they should be going for growth and so the important thing was just to attract users um in you know in in very large quantities there's a obviously a question mark over that given the precarious financial situation it's in and you know so is the reason why you need lots of new users all the time because you're in a precarious financial situation the second thing is that it appears that it was not necessarily well understood within Celsius exactly you know how much money it was or wasn't making or exactly what its profitability was um and this is in part because they just had extraordinarily bad records and so there seems to be a realization in I think in early 2022 and the the other thing actually to remember is that there's you know different people joining the company into like neural risk officer or you know that kind of financial option that kind of thing and so it appears in early 2022 people begin to realize like wait we are paying or you know quote-unquote Rewards in far and excess of what we're actually making like we do not have positive net interest margins we are paying users more than we can we we make and that we could possibly expect to make um and it you know in the exams report you can see Alex from sinski resisting that and I think he says uh there's a there's a quote there where he tells the CFO to stay in his Lane you know uh you know marketing is my job you know I I've brought in 20 billion dollars which is what it sort of balance sheet size was at that time and you know I can bring in more so that's a sort of a paraphrase of the interaction that's that was certainly a problem that it was not um the reason you know the reason it was paying out the rates that it was was not actually tied to what you could actually make yeah I also remember reading that interaction in the report and I uh yeah just my eyes widening so another Factor here was that Celsius also had considerable losses in certain Investments you know some of them you know were reported in the news previously but can you talk a little bit about those yeah so some of them are I think you could probably characterize some of them as bad luck and you could characterize some of them as Port investment decisions so it took out a a a um you know a massive loan uh using its customer Bitcoin as collateral and the uh the counterparty ended up not being able to return that collateral in part because the big price of Bitcoin had risen so substantially and it appears that you know that counterparty had just sold the collateral and then therefore you know the price had risen a lot they were short and they couldn't pay it back immediately there's stuff like uh there's a company called stakehound uh which seems to have just lost the keys to the ethereum that um Celsius had had um I think loaned to them or staked with them but they're you know they they were you know they made really large uh bets on gbtc the grace grayscale Bitcoin trust and really uh sort of I guess funny in a kind of grim way but you know in December 2020 when the gbtc gbtc was still at a premium they were talking about you know dramatically increasing their bet on gvtc and then obviously you know I think the very next month or the month after that they went to a discount and the state is a discount ever since um so Celsius like a lot of crypto investors had this you know loss from from piling into the gptc trade and the the key thing that the examiner points out about these Investments and these bad Investments is that one Celsius didn't tell customers that that's what it was going to do it told customers that they was going to do institutional lending and secondly it didn't tell customers about these enormous losses and so you know people in mid 2021 or late 2021 you know would have no idea that Celsius was not only sitting on a big balance sheet hole from all the money you're spending on propping up the sell token but it was also sitting on significant losses from these bad investment decisions and I think she really points out that in 2021 you know 2021 was the crypto Bill year uh lots of companies made enormous profits at least on paper Celsius made an enormous loss in 2021. you know the year that everyone else made money right yeah I mean it's it's shocking on a number of levels although I guess in a way we sort of knew that this just confirms so out of curiosity based off this report do you think or are you hearing anything about whether or not machinski could face either fraud charges or even prison time so we know that the doj is investigating Celsius we know that you know there's been a long-running sec investigation which would be civil not criminal we also you know we also know the New York attorney general has already sued him um so there's clearly like a lot of pressure and attention and scrutiny of his conduct you know I I don't I don't want to say you know what's going to happen next but you know I mean clearly uh clearly that's a you know that's a risk for him clearly one other thing that I want to ask about is that after these findings from the report State officials called for a similar independent examiner to conduct you know a similar independent report on the financials of FTX Alameda and their subsidiaries do you think the revelations here could influence that decision I don't know the extent that it's going to influence the judge I mean the situation in FTX is that you have the you know you have the new FDX management they oppose the oppose a new examiner so does the creditors committee so does the Bahamas you know Liquidators they all oppose it need to have the trustee you know finding this motion to appoint one it's it's clearly helpful for the trustee that you have now uh you know I think 17 or more States um you know you know also supporting a motion for an examiner but what it does show I think is I guess the value to the broader creditor base and to the public of of these appointments because you get you know you know the doj is not going is you know it's Prosecuting San mateman freed it's not going to write like a big report about what happened you know the FTX the debtors and the creditors committee they're interested in um you know pursuing claims right that you know it's not their job to write a big report explaining to people what's happened and also they're not you know they're not strictly you know independent from what's going on exactly you know like they're involved in the process you get if you get independent examiner you get this accounting of what's happened from somebody who's unbiased who's not involved who wasn't involved previously in any way I think I think it's sort of vital for the broader creditor understanding but also the broader public understanding of what happened to these to these companies yeah no I agree I I mean granted you and I are both journalists so we probably have the same view that the more information the better but I do understand you know these are expensive or they can be and that's the concern I think from those parties who oppose it um all right well this has been a fascinating discussion thank you so much for uh coming on Unchained thank you it's been fun don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap SPF is accused of misusing Robin Hood shares Sam bingman freed the founder of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX is facing allegations of criminal misuse of customer property and concealing his actions by the Department of Justice according to Federal prosecutors bankman freed used 56 million Robin Hood shares as a means to misuse customer money which they outlined in a letter to U.S bankruptcy judge Lewis Kaplan the shares were acquired with the FTX co-founder Gary Wang through a foreign special purpose vehicle with no connection to FTX or Alameda the prosecutors have taken control of the Robin Hood shares and other assets worth over 700 million dollars despite these accusations banquin Freed's legal team is arguing that he should still have access to his crypto assets claiming that the government has found no evidence that he was behind unauthorized transfers made by Alameda wallets SPF is not only being restricted financially but also in communication a recent Court ruling by judge Kaplan has banned SPF from having any communication with current or former employees from FTX and Alameda aside from immediate family members the ruling came after the crypto Mogul was accused of attempting to contact a potential witness in his case through the encrypted messaging platform signal that person is believed to be FTX U.S general counsel Ryan Miller judge Kaplan deemed the restrictions necessary until a further determination can be made which will be discussed by both legal teams on February 7th the restrictions were originally put forth as a modification of benkman Freed's bail according to the court filing the judge believes the evidence supporting the restrictions was clearly and convincingly sufficient judge Kaplan has also ordered that the names of the two people who co-signed the 250 million dollar bail bond for Sam Pinkman freed should be revealed to the public previously only the fact that binkmanfried's parents were among the co-signers was known but the identities of the others were kept confidential the judge has now ruled in favor of various news organizations that submitted petitions to make the names public however the ruling is temporarily suspended pending a possible appeal until at least February 7th and for those who are house hunting it may be your lucky day as a house in Washington DC with ties to SPF is now available for purchase listed at a price of 3.3 million dollars Alameda research the trading shop related to FTX is taking legal action against Voyager digital seeking to recover 445.8 million dollars according to the lawsuit Alameda claims that it repaid Voyager that amount in September and October just prior to its own bankruptcy and is now looking to retrieve those funds to repay creditors through a process known as a clawback in its claim Alameda alleges that Voyager played a role in its own alleged misconduct by acting as a lender either knowingly or recklessly however Voyager and its creditor committee denied this motion the creditors are expecting alameda's clawback request to be either reclassified as Equity or made secondary to all other claims the creditors argue that alameda's false statements about its Financial strength were the main reason for voyager's purchase of loans from its insolvent balance sheet blockfi is granted approval to sell crypto mining assets a U.S bankruptcy court for the District of New Jersey has given the green light for crypto lender blockfi to sell off its cryptocurrency mining equipment in a recent filing the court deemed the sale of these assets to be fair and reasonable in the current circumstances blockfi has set a deadline of February 20th for interested parties to submit their bids and all bids must be filed with the court by March 2nd creditors have until March 16th to raise any objections to the sales to qualified bidders additionally block 5 was allowed to offer bonuses to its top employees by judge Kaplan who cited the need to retain and maximize the company's estate Gemini is under investigation the New York State Department of Financial Services is looking into allegations against crypto exchange Gemini regarding claims about its connections to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or FDIC in reference to its earned accounts according to a report by axios some customers were under the impression that their funds in the earn accounts were insured by the FDIC based on Gemini's references to the agency and its Communications however it seems that Gemini was referring to its deposits at external Banks rather than its own products leading to confusion and claims of misleading Behavior the Federal Deposit Insurance act prohibits entities from implying that an uninsured product is fdeic insured through the use of FDIC and its name or advertisements grayscale faces a lawsuit over gbtc's advertising on a similar note Osprey funds additional asset management company has filed a lawsuit against grayscale

cryptocurrency bank that's come on everyone's radar due to its ties with FTX has temporarily stopped Distributing dividends the decision was made to maintain a highly liquid balance sheet and help the bank manage the recent Market instability however on Tuesday after BlackRock revealed that it holds a 7.2 percent stake in silvergate capital as of December 31st the stock price of the bank experienced a significant increase furthermore three U.S senators sent a letter to silvergate CEO Alan Lane alleging that the bank's dealings with FTX further introduced risk into the traditional banking system they demanded more information about a large cash loan silvergate took out from the federal Home Loan Bank or fhlb to shore up its accounts after Mass user withdrawals the Senators raised concerns that if silvergate were to fail the fhlb could have priority over other creditors including the FDIC Insurance Fund which could leave the ftic and therefore the American taxpayer

individuals will be able to experiment with partial and complete withdrawals among other features speaking of ethereum the total number of ether tokens in circulation fell to a new post-merge low with

media channels here's one on another update from Celsius this week bankrupt crypto under Celsius not to be confused with the energy drink Celsius which unlike the crypto lender will at least temporarily boost your mood I only 1419 page Court filing on Tuesday stating that eligible users will soon be allowed to withdraw about 94 of their assets that's like the length of two Lord of the Rings books said way too many of Celsius as creditors you guys know they they make books for adults now this should be good news I mean 94 also sounds like a lot unless of course it's your assets for what it's worth I think it's possible that we share like 94 of our DNA with the toaster oven they're just a couple of tiny catches transfers need to be less than 7575 when they were first made I also need enough money on the platform to cover your gas and transaction fees you need to update your customer information and you need to be at least five eight oh wait sorry sorry I'm thinking in my hand these users will find out whether or not they're ready to start the withdrawal process on February 15th that's right some single Celsius users are about to have two very dark days in a row I urge you
