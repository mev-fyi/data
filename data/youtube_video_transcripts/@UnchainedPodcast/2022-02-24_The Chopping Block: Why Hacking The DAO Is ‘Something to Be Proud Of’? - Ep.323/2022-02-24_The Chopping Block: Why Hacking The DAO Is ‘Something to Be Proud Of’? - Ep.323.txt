hey everybody welcome back to the chopping block every four weeks the four of us get together and give an industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we've got tom the defy maven and master of memes next up there's robert crypto connoisseur and captain of compound third we've got taroun the gigabrain and gran puba at gauntlet and finally myself i'm hasib head hype man at dragonfly all four of us are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice so um robert you're just commenting how incredibly young you look with your with your beard shaving off uh i i got the feeling that bitcoin's back at 20 bucks with how young you look how does it how does it feel to be unburdened by the beard you know i i shaved clean for the first time in two years i think it's going to be the catalyst to bring us out of this temporary bear market so time will tell but ask me in like three weeks if it worked is this part of like being a new father you're trying to reinvent yourself yeah exactly you know you got to start from a clean foundation so you know reboot you know start eating a little bit healthier you know this week too so you know maybe you'll have a younger fit or maybe baby only sees baby face what's the it looks like you're about to do an internet compound you know it's like showing up it's your first day i just really love decentralized money markets you know yeah me too you know it's like i can't wait to see if they exist yeah wow is the uh is anything weird in the new diet anything particularly crypto relevant is it like meat only no seed oils no seed oils nothing that comes wrapped in plastic nothing processed yeah i feel like since cove in my diet has gotten a lot worse than what it used to be yeah my mind too i gained like 30 pounds yeah i gotta i gotta work on that okay well we've got an interesting piece of news this week so so our namesake laura shin so first of all we we're we're all here to congratulate laura shin because one she just released her book the kryptopians it just came out this morning actually it was just announced that uh my place which i'm not at right now just received the pre-order book it just arrived this morning uh but i don't actually have it with me otherwise i'd be flashing it on screen but in the book it was announced that there was a huge reveal and the reveal is that we now actually know according to laura shen allegedly we know who was the infamous dow hacker okay so i think this at this point given how many people have entered crypto in the last couple years i'm going to guess that for a lot of folks this is ancient history so we need it we need to crack open the history book so the dow hack was a hack that took place i think this was 2016. yes 2016. so in 2016 one of the very first major projects on icos on ethereum was this thing called the dao and the dao was basically a decentralized uh essentially decentralized venture capital group and the dao was at one point it held something like five percent of all the ether in existence it was a huge project on ethereum background ethereum didn't have a whole lot else going on and uh it got hacked and as a result of trying to ameliorate the side effects of this hack which would have had the the dow hacker controlling a huge amount of the ether in existence ethereum very famously pulled the switch to hard fork into two versions of ethereum one which today is called the theorem classic uh which is a sort of parallel universe in which the hacker got away with it and owns all the ether that he stole and then the current version of ethereum which we know today is ethereum which is actually a forked and rewritten version of ethereum that made a temporary exception in the otherwise automatic rules of the blockchain that this hack got undone and the contract got fixed in such a way that it is no longer hacked so for a long time it was unknown who this hacker was and we just discovered that it is a let me see uh it's a 36 year old austrian programmer who is the co-founder of 10x which is some weird ico project that i don't know very much about do any of you guys know anything about this person or know anything about 10x or have any connections to this story so my only connection to the story is that the dow hack is actually what got me excited about ethereum and actually got me to notice that ethereum existed and was working so the dow hack is actually what brought me into the ecosystem originally i was not like an ico participant and i didn't think it would work you know to be honest but the dow hack was like the moment in time that got me paying extreme attention had made me want to build things into space i did at some point like invest like 12 in the 10x ico so i do know the project that way but i will you know caveat and say that anything is allegedly we actually don't have any conclusive evidence that this person is the dow hacker you know there's always the one percent chance that he's not so we don't want to have this person skinned alive but aside from that i have never heard of this person and if he is it's almost something to be proud of at this point years ago because it's one of the most monumental events in the history of both crypto and blockchains and ethereum period full stop you know it's one of the most controversial things to ever occur you know a huge amount of people think it was ethical and deserved and positive and it started to prove out most of the really important questions about you know is code is law or is code not law led to the fork of ethereum into ethereum classic and ethereum and i kind of think it's something to be proud of to be at the you know that cataclysmic event um but we'll see if at some point it's proven that he's actually the one who did it or if he admits to it speaking of proof and speaking of um allegations i actually found the the details of this article to be super interesting basically once the eth was stolen um it was swapped via shapeshift um which is a busy ring exchange for doing cross-chain swaps and busy swapped into two bitcoin um and then it was it was dormant for a while and then the later date they swapped it into grin or they sorry then they mixed it and then they swapped it into a grin which is another privacy coin and basically along this path it was revealed that analysis which is a blockchain analysis group was able to unmix the transaction from wasabi which is which is how he tried to gain some privacy for these for these bitcoins which normally would otherwise been you're very obvious but the what the who the holder was and so there's a unknown capability that chanalysis has i presume it was pretty somewhat easier this time because the transaction was so large in size so there's a very small anonymity that you just can't really hide a such a large bitcoin transaction um and then basically this uh swap from gr uh bitcoin to grin uh was sent to this person's grin node which was his nickname dot io it's so not very yeah stealthy there but pretty interesting you know details i also remember using you know shapeshift in the very early days um when you kind of do you know other types of swaps and just the fact that she analysis can also unmix mixed bitcoin in certain scenarios is also pretty interesting so i was slightly skeptical of the story of that it's as simple as chain analysis has some magic way to unmix wasabi transactions like maybe it's true but it seems more plausible that they just had not that big of an anonymity set and they just kind of chased down all the things in the anonymity said they're like oh this one is connected to this guy who like also has these other things or you know they're basically able to plausibly rule out some of the other outputs and as as such you know they they're going to go and say like oh we were able to figure out that it's exactly this one i don't know if that's true but that's my gut feeling here is that this is not like a large scale because this is the first time we've heard about this right and this is not a live attack this is this is something that's like purely intellectual curiosity who hacked the dao at this point given that obviously they didn't get any ether they have eth classic and i mean who's going to cash out the eth classic that the dow hacker stole so it does seem like i don't know i don't know if you have perspective here but i feel like this may be overrepresented what chanalysis did here i will say one thing that i remember um was that you know there's this very if you were in ethereum uh at that time there's a very early testament that 90 percent i'm sure of people have not heard of called the morden tesla it doesn't really exist anymore and um if you were paying attention on twitter in maybe like five or six months ago laura and a few other people were like hey does anyone have an archived copy of the moored intestine and nothing rang a alarm bell in my head more that someone is trying to do some type of like deep analysis because the people who are who are actually asking for the copy were like hudson from the ef or at that time i guess people just left from the flashbacks like laura and one of the two alex's who worked with ef i forget which one it was either the one who went to balance or in dns or the other one vandisend or the other it was like very like particular people very close to ethereum foundation plus laura and that like clustering was very odd to me and so it it did actually seem like there was some much more weird digging going on the the moored intestine thing was like the big big thing so i think i suspect that so the mordan testament was like what you know like like one of the modern east testaments but it was it was deprecated in the hard fork it was kind of basically killed by the dow hack so i suspect there might be some truth to this because it was really hard to find anyone who had like that testament archived and the fact they were able to go back to that and they asked on twitter like that part i guess wasn't said in the article but like i mean you can go find the tweets like if you search more than tesla i don't think they're deleted uh so i'm i'm a little i have a little more hope in that regards with regards to the grin thing i i didn't i'm a little less i'm sort of in your boat that maybe there's something else going on like it's just like the volume didn't make sense although one hilarious thing to think about is that east classic has had so many hard forks at soft forks and itself forget about hard forks i i mean like actually just forks from like miners not mining it and like big trades getting front run that it does make you wonder if if uh if it is really this person whether like they were making like large transactions and like some of the exchange softworks that we saw on etc i don't know if you guys remember like etc basically 51 attacked it at one point right i was wondering if some of those are actually related to this person trying to like do this grin thing because the timing was around the time grin was like sort of coming online so there's a couple things to corroborate these other other aspects that i don't think were mentioned uh but the morden testnet plus this this sort of like etc forking being around weird transactions like there's there's something there i i don't think perhaps perhaps there's more to it but like yeah there's a lot in the story that does check out so it feels like behaviorally the story of okay we found all this evidence that it's you we present you with all the evidence you're like no no it's not me and you delete all your social media records and kind of run away i mean to me i'm like okay that's kind of all the proof that i would need to know that this person is probably the hacker because at a certain point like you know you you're protesting a little bit too much and then running away a little too fast i give it 99 they could be scapegoated you know there's a lot of different factors which make it like not definitive in my mind you know just because you delete your social media presence doesn't mean robert how big are your 10x bags that you're uh i own the whole project i don't think he was actually able to cash out that much though which which is the funny part like most of it is still sitting there um in these classics so i think it was only like a few mil or something like that from the article so maybe this gets uh this gets to a slightly related but kind of crazier thing to think about like we've been it's been raining cats and dogs of like attackers being found in a short period of time and it kind of feels like a lot of the reason that this has happened is like whoever did the attack whether it was this person directly or like this person was just an accessory they were unable to get out of more than a certain percentage so like the bits in x hacker right the actual hacker as far as we know could only get out of 900 million dollars out of that like four four point five well that's what's missing so i'm in the best case scenario the the person who isn't caught got away with that that's a pretty low take rate given how much they were able to get out of right so i i think like the moral of the story is eventually whoever actually does this stuff realizes it's actually really hard to get out in like serious size and then they start trying to like get accomplices and the accomplices get caught that's my that's my sort of rough theory as to like how how we kind of have some of the bumbling mistakes we've seen is this even illegal though was this even a hack like like basically they he stole the money and then they just changed it so that the money was not stolen so it's not like a normal defy hack where the money's actually permanently gone in this scenario like everything was kind of reverted so like uh really who who lost here was reverted on one chain right every ether holder right every ether holder lost the blockchain fractured into two every user every developer lost in some way i think there's kind of a stretch though like eve classic is nothing you know it's not like oh i'm missing out on some huge chunk of value uh each classic is basically worthless so it's like in reality you know you don't actually lose that tom i'm excited for your your your twitter dms shortly yeah who loves i mean this is also like the number one event that like bitcoin maxies point to in terms of the like flexibility of ethereum monetary policy okay for sure it was a narrative for sure i mean it's a big loss of credibility i feel like yeah like the community decided that the hack was so bad that they made a new version of the blockchain without the hack right and like yeah that was an unbelievably contentious decision at the time and probably still is right so who lost in some ways it's it's ethereum in general lost and all of the users and developers now it's years later you could say that like maybe you made everyone a lot stronger and i think in other ways it did but like everybody lost right sure is it the point is there's there's like a group of depositors that is short you know tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars um it's sort of more of a i agree a branding and sort of uh narrative loss uh more than anything else but it hasn't been repeated right people want to do this with the parody multisig as well and it didn't happen we don't know we know that people wanted to do it in large mass i would say that parody was much more contentious than the tao in the sense that like parody was like we're going to exit ethereum and then they did right and like rug pulled the client it was a very different it was even more more crazy that they it's also possible ethereum would be worth more today if the dow hacking never happened so we can't we can't you know measure the counter factual loss of value right it could have been that it would have taken much longer for robots maybe never have made compound with the dow hack didn't happen that's what we learned on this episode that's true i probably i never would have like looked at smart contracts if it hadn't happened so i don't know you would have just gotten rich off 10x never had to build anything yeah no i wouldn't have i wouldn't have because i wouldn't have gone to the ethereum ecosystem at all yeah like i hated crypto before that like i way long ago like dabbled in bitcoin and was like yeah bitcoin you know whatever it's not going to take over the world and then the dow hack is what got me excited about crypto why did it get you excited about crypto why what was exciting about it the fact that you could build using a computer program like a you you can start to program financial assets on a blockchain like like the fact that like the dow was even deployed was like such a monumental achievement i think for society at large that like the doubt as a smart contract getting deployed with the ability to like gather funds and deploy those funds and like like it was incredible like it was so inspiring like it made me like immediately look at ethereum it's like something usable you know is definitely one of the more sci-fi things that i read when i was learning about crypto i was like holy [ __ ] that's so cool yeah it's like the dream of you like of like crypto itself and like you know some people like need certain like events in the world to like get it and like have it click and like right now with like the truckers in canada like people are getting like why you want like censorship resistant money like even though people like got that like 10 years ago like people are like learning the lesson like the dow was like to someone who's like a builder it's like you can build extremely complex financial infrastructure on a blockchain it was like wow light bulb moment you know i feel like the other thing about this story is that it's another vindication of this narrative increasingly arising that crypto is actually not good for laundering money and it's like all these big hacks they keep getting unwound or they keep getting found or they keep getting frozen and um i think we're just gonna keep seeing more of it so the ammunition on the side of no crypto is actually not great for stealing funds or laundering money seems to be getting stronger uh every time that we uncover one of these one one thing i i just want to point out with 10x i didn't really know much about them although clearly there was i mean just go look at their chart 100 inside your trading on this and like you know you can just like see the volume like 100x in the light like like last two and a half weeks yeah it's like this this is this is a chart of like hey someone's going to talk can you throw this up on the screen yeah throw it up on the screen just go to the 10x one month chart it's like up or down it goes up and then down but it's like you can you can see the downward thing is like this like perfectly linear line like it's it's like hilarious maybe it's like the bet that the attention is going to go up and then the price is going to go down people realize that he's a bad guy it's a beautiful chart um the one month the 30 day oh 30 yeah oh just like look at this linear thing coming down it's like look at the volume look at the bottom it's like wow it hasn't had that volume in forever yeah yeah true that was actually the other interesting piece of evidence i think it's less damning it's kind of more circumstantial which is like um i forget the name of the the dow hacker but he was basically suggesting to people that they should short ethereum right before he drained the dao um which is like like you know i don't know why you would do that it seems pretty um leaky but programmers are very rarely good traders a lesson i learned uh first hand in trading uh yeah one one one other thing is the 10x co-founder guy definitely started scammy yeah he's sorry it's a ton of scammy like d5 forks in the last year and a half so i don't i don't know if that i don't know what that what you want to make of that but like he he was tweeting he was tweeting today and like then i was i looked at what he made i was like wow okay you were you made a lot of these like pangolin wash trade or sorry um pancake swap like uh wash trading things robert you've come a long way as an investor i still invest in [ __ ] coins like 10x though all right from from humble beginnings to more [ __ ] no no no no no no no they're now they're now [ __ ] nfts that's true yeah i still get suckered by all the new things and shiny things on the crypto menu that's fair that's fair what is crypto for if not losing money to dumb things um speaking of uh crypto and dump things so i think we should start doing like a weekly segment on dumb dows so there's a new dow that is trying to buy the denver broncos which uh is a sports team it's american football team uh estimated sales price of four billion dollars that i guess is going to go on auction and uh buythebroncos.com is is out there trying to it doesn't even have uh it looks so george unite let's open the broncos together it doesn't look like they even have any place to actually put money yet they are recruiting people who can maybe help them figure out how to set something up on juice box i suppose i don't know like right now so far i think historically the biggest dow is the one we talked about last time assange now which was about 50 million so this thing is about one percent of what it would need to be in order to buy the denver broncos i don't know what do you guys think the likelihood that we see bigger and bigger dow start going after more sensational things like this here's my prediction and i could be proven completely wrong and i hope to be proven completely wrong i think what will happen is over time instead of capital being formed to do something cool like this because like they're never going to hit their goal right you're going to see like more permanent pools of capital available like either from daos or like protocols or whatever that are able to like respond to these events so like we're already at the point where there's like protocols and dallas with like a billion dollars right it sounds crazy but like it's true they do they have like a billion dollars and like yeah the denver broncos are like completely out of reach even for like the biggest protocols and the biggest dials but like a minor league team does not right or like you know like things that don't cost four billion dollars are like that that is available right so like i don't think we're gonna see these like quick let's fundraise as much money as humanly possible to like do this things like that's a really hard coordination problem i think what we'll see is dowse and protocol treasuries and like these players like emerge to like have hundreds of millions of dollars available to like like seize opportunities that like eventually like oh we should call you know m a down you know you want to do like a spack for daz a doubt back yeah exactly so which football player is chamath i don't watch football so i don't know anything which football player which football player is like he's a cheerleader back promoter the cheerleader the one who's like the promoter yeah gotta be some celebrity who's going to like make the sec angry and that but there's always going to be one right at least one yeah i feel like you probably need daniel sesta to go in and be the guy who tries to buy the sports team sifu or st or the 10x guy apparently he's quite charismatic out here yeah i mean i'm just saying there has to be some like cheerleading maybe tom brady is the like is like the football spa a douse back driver because like he's already done all these crypto commercials he's like he's just like primed and you know you know i i just like think that that that will be the catalyst although one thing to remember is probably the longest running dow like structure in the u.s uh that's like largely capitalized is the green bay packers where like people in the town like own shares on the team and they get some dividend they can vote on some things right like they do actually have these kind of like cooperative ownership structures and sports i just tend to think most of the people who want to do it right now are unequipped to actually do any of it led in part by a fact that like all the news articles for this thing uh tended to quote uh phd students who were advising the dao instead of anyone working on the dao which i found hilarious speaking of um dumb daughters because maybe this shouldn't just be a recurring segment this is my current like my current favorite uh dao or spac dao this is fry's dao um they're buying fast food restaurants and that's pretty much it i i feel like generally like the dow formations are get anything for donating well you get a token you get fry's token and in theory you get some repayment from the cash flow from the from the fast food restaurant you know normally they're doing something very epic you know they're buying a copy of the constitution they're donating to julian assange they're buying them every broncos but this is just uh buying some fast food restaurants so respect you know start start small starts practical what voting rights of the token have like voting on which chain to be a franchise of or like how how does this like what's the token purpose here other than just like yeah i think it's just like a governance token you know we put a bunch of money in a pot and then we can we can vote on which you know or maybe they want to open a franchise you know they have a lot of they have a lot of options this isn't even a spec this is private equity like i feel like cryptos is getting more mundane yeah yeah i mean it's private equity except people are trading like the the the mezzanine tranche of the fund or something right it's like yeah that one's gonna end badly well clearly the franchises are gonna lock them out at some point right and just be like [ __ ] you like it just seems like unlikely that won't happen i think that one's gonna have a principal agent problem and the people organizing the dao are gonna figure out a way to get all the money and the people who are investing in the fries are not gonna get any money imagine if your dividends were paid in fry nfts though then you've given all your money to people who go out and buy real real world businesses make the real world money and you get jpegs like that's probably right i think a lot of nft projects aren't so different especially these ones that are funding movies that haven't been made like it's not so different there will be some weird thing that goes on the difference of the franchises i think or franchisors will just you know put a foot down on this here's a chopping block experiment we should profile a bunch of bad dows and then the audience should tell us which of these bad dolls the four of us should take our real money and put into one of these bad dolls so a year later we can come back and be like oh man we lost all of our money in fry's now but let me tell you about the experience along the way in a way that would make us really like credible we could do a dating game for dallas where we bring three bad dows and then like one person who's like i want to join a dao and we ask questions on their behalf and then they have to pick and then we yeah that sounds like an amazing game show actually would be kind of funny i i'm imagining now dow dating and i feel like um i mean we we've talked some about protocol m a it'd be interesting to see if we end up doing dow m a and you know so one of these one of these kind of failed takeover bit downs is kind of like okay well we didn't buy the blockbuster or whatever but you know like the nfl dow or the broncos down like rolls up a bunch of the smaller ones like buys up fries down it's like you guys don't need fries like let's just go buy the broncos together all i will say is i've been spending a lot of time thinking about how you would do an m a protocol i've noticed that i've noticed that give us the rundown of m a protocols the the tlvr is like if you were watching the uh fey rari merger and disclosure robert and i are investors the fey rari merger was a very contentious thing and most of the contention was price discovery where like someone set a price someone said i want one tenth of price and then people were like okay we're gonna like pull all of the the conversation offline and come up with the price and come back so it was like it was like a contentious thing i think if you can make a protocol that separates price discovery for two dowels in such a way that each dow votes on like putting a portion of their treasury to be the to sort of be the backstop price and then you have this kind of like continuous auction where people who own both side of the token can vote basically lock their tokens and then at some point in the future decided by governance basically the trade gets executed at the final price now now you have to make this like resistant whales you have to have some rage quit things that people you know some of the fey argument was that there wasn't good enough rage quit so there's a lot of details to make it work as a protocol but if you can make the price discovery some type of like thing that you see where people can like basically vote on the final price or like stake for the final price i think you can alleviate some of these problems and make it relatively generic for like certain types of governance contracts and eventually denver bronco dow will use this to acquire freido and we will have calder here you will have called it here first robert yeah your point around price discovery i think is is well received but it's made me think why people who are not auctioning things or selling things that might be interesting targets have not tried to solicit taos actively this is a pool of capital that is uh not super price discerning and actually looking to actively looking to deploy you know you would you would think active actually trying to get these people to bid on your thing is is probably a good use of time and money versus like you know just leaving it to this sort of standard you know high net worth or pe farms or whatever i mean the whales still have ex more power in this thing but they i think at the end of the day you want to incentivize the whales to just like show their cards before the thing happens and like somehow that's more how you want to design this because like right now you have this weird thing where like some of the whales want to just like only discuss things off-chain and then the price discovery is extremely slow well this is kind of a more general topic i feel like i mean you saw the same thing with sushi when there's this interplay between the deal-making that tends to happen you know in the context of a dao oftentimes there's deal-making that needs to happen behind closed doors for people to feel like the negotiation can kind of happen in a way that is suitable to both parties um but the the nature of a dao culturally kind of demands that all the negotiating happen out in the open right and it kind of reminds me a little bit of you know democratic countries that kind of feel like look we should be beholden to our you know electors in the way that we make decisions diplomatically but it's also necessary for diplomats or legislators to be able to go behind closed doors and kind of hash it out and then come out with a proposal that they present to the broader constituents how do you guys think about this dynamic in the in the in the world of dao's because it feels like this is this keeps happening right you have this this feeling that look the founder or you know a group of people who are kind of responsible for bd at the protocol level they want to have the flexibility to be able to you know go behind closed doors and negotiate bespoke deals and maybe present them to the dow and communities by and large really resent this they don't like this phenomenon but it seems pretty universal i think it's effectively always going to happen there's no there's no doubt that like i mean that's just the nature until we actually private smart contracts actually work and like can do a lot to facilitate a lot of discovery without publicly showing your you know imagine you could sign a commit reveal to a blockchain that only like some subset of parties you want to see can reveal and then you can reveal your bid and then people coordinate that until we are at that point which we're not uh from a program from not from a technical standpoint but from like a programmatic stance it's just like the programming that right now in the ass like no one's gonna do it like it's not like it's just like really not at this stage that that's ready to do like like it's not theoretical it's obviously theoretically and proof of concept practically possible it's just not in like hey you're gonna put this in like rainbow wallet possible um uh and i and obviously without you know five years more of engineering that might be not be true but right now that's still gonna happen i think that's why you want something where it's like people vote on this auction then they get a certain amount of time and then they have to reveal their preferences right like right now the problem is the preference revelation process is like extremely asymmetric and like one side will reveal one thing in a way that like forces the other side to take longer to reveal instead of like shorten how fast they reply right and if you can make it something where they have to like kind of have a back and forth that will actually at least you know in a lot of cases i think reduce the complexity of these deals well one interesting case of dow governance quote unquote coming into play was uh in the last week we saw a huge drama play out in terra so tara for those who are not familiar it's a level one blockchain it's been around for a few years now it used to be a stable point it it still issues a stable coin called ust and it's a little bit complex to explain all the moving parts but basically one of the most popular protocols on terra is a protocol called anchor anchor a d5 protocol in which we are actually dragonfly as an investor and anchor essentially what they do is they offer very high yields to people who stake some of their assets including stable coins into anchor and anchor uh because it offers very high yields so you know on the order about 20 yields those yields in this environment are not really sustainable it's very difficult to get 20 yield doing anything right now given the way that yields have come down in defy so anchors reserves were draining over time and if anker were to lose a lot of the supply that were locked in anchor it would have very negative effects for the overall terror ecosystem as well as for anchor itself and so uh there was a proposal in anchor governance and interior governance broadly to inject a bunch of capital to backstop and kind of you know help uh strengthen the reserve to allow anger to be able to continue offering these high yields for a longer period of time and so apparently what happened was uh lfg which i think is the something something guard they ingest injected 450 million into anchor uh in order to protect the reserves and we also saw very recently they announced a one billion dollar fundraise uh to create a billion dollars of btc that is going to be backstopping the terror ecosystem further so a huge amount of capital that is going in to protect the anchor ecosystem in a way that obviously you know i i was reading through some of the uh forum comments in the governance forum for anchor it was very interesting seeing this phenomenon of a lot of folks who obviously don't directly have access to that capital it's kind of maybe even slightly unclear where the capital is coming from but they're just like yeah we should shove a bunch of money back into anchor to to keep it all going curious what you guys think of this whole terra anchor saga and where you believe it might be going i mean tara is a little bit between a rock and a hard place like people clearly there is a large percentage of the ust in anchor that is exclusively there to get this yield and if that yield goes down or disappears that kind of unwinds and obviously that greatly impacts the lunar price just by virtue of the fact how territory is designed i feel like this is the 450 mil seems like maybe a stop gap right like you kind of need that money to maybe make sure that this thing doesn't bleed out immediately but it feels like maybe the rest of the money could have been better spent designing new sources of demand for ust which was i think you know part of the thesis of some of the products they've been developing so far and i i don't this doesn't feel super sustainable to me like i feel like a billion dollars could go a long way towards developing new dapps or partnerships or use cases that are going to generate you know new organic sources of demand for ust so they have to keep you know sort of burning the cache so to speak it's an interesting point i i agree tom i mean it's if you squint it's like an extremely simple ecosystem which is luna makes ust and the demand pretty much all of the demand for ust comes from you you can earn 20 on it there's a little bit of demand outside of that right but like it's you can earn 20 on it and that 20 percent comes from luna and this works you know eventually it gets so big that there's sustainability issues if it works forever and it's small it's you know it's a perpetual motion machine and everyone high-fives i think long-term something has to change fundamentally in the economics of the system you know this can keep working for a while right like just put this in a spreadsheet you know if you're paying people 20 you know let's say on their ust which you created from luna anyway like this keeps working for a while you know but eventually becomes unsustainable and i think one of the primary foundational pieces of the economics of the ecosystem will change it's going to have to it might be the yields go down it might be you meant ust not with luna maybe it's you know something totally left field who knows but like i expect something's gonna have to give uh you know tom you raised this point of like look you could take that billion dollars and do a lot more things with it you know you could build more use cases build more partnerships and uh to a certain extent i i kind of disagree in the sense that um we have run out of ways to use money to buy adoption um we're like so far down the utilization curve of money that you just think of all the captive capital right now in crypto especially among the later ones we're just thinking about the current generation of like you know all the folks who like polygon and avalanche and and tara and uh you know near protocol and all of them have raised craploads of money and um it's very unclear what their how they can use it to do anything and that's ignoring even the previous generation right like think of how much money filecoin has how much money tazo's foundation has how much money uh you know these eos for that matter has or tron has all of these folks have huge balance sheets and they have absolutely nothing to spend it on and so i think we're in the situation now where the the uses for capital to produce adoption or to produce partnerships even has incredibly has become incredibly inefficient and what you see now mostly is that there are tons of bidding wars um between all these protocols and their balance sheets for partnerships right if you if you're if you're tom brady or you're melania trump and you want to launch an ftd project you just go to all these foundations you say hey i'm going to launch an ft project give me your best price and you know it's like okay 5 million 10 million 15 million to to launch a project on top of them that's where these treasuries are mostly going so i don't know that tara had a whole lot of other ways melania clearly didn't talk to the solana foundation based on all of the logistical fuck-ups and also then all of everyone working like anatoly and sauna twitter being like we're not associated with this whatsoever that's true true i i bring it up in uh in jess but you know most projects do look like that i don't know i think some of those products are just like fundamentally crap or like unneeded um and so it's like yeah four four billion dollars is not gonna save eos like it's just impossible um but it's like you know stable coins are like the killer app of crypto i mean there's like what 13 billion and like tyler's sitting on tron like like what what is that doing is it being used for gambling using for you being used for payments i i like stable coins are fundamentally like the killer app of crypto so far and so i'm not super convinced that they've tapped out but point well taken this is why i think the 450 makes sense because it takes a while to sort of build these things out and deploy you can't just like you know uh put this money to work overnight and expect dividends in the form of new applications but it's like you need to do something you can't just sort of like keep holding on and hope that people are going to stick around i mean one thing i would add is that unlike some of the other stable coins that are sort of similar in structure like cello the terra design never had an explicit reserve and this is basically bolting on what you've seen in some of the other stable coins of like a basket of other crypto assets as a reserve so it's not like it's unheard and the size of given how large luna is relative to zello i think actually they're still under capitalized on a dollar per dollar bait redemption basis like if we compare it to other sort of under collaboration so it's not so crazy size wise you know i i do agree that it's kind of like hard to buy like there's customer acquisition costing crypto feels like 0 10 or infinity right there's like there's no in between cac it's like it's either it's really it's either nothing people are using it for free uh because they're earning fees or something or it's like a little bit and you can get them or it's just like you're paying infinite to keep them so i think it is a little hard because it's not as kind of discreet in a lot of other industries i guess also the the terra ecosystem ecosystem's a little weird right there's like there's been a bunch of new protocols like mars protocol has like a three-month ust lockup for the record i don't really own any usc or use it i i've used it a few times but like not seriously and part of the problem i had with it was like the only application you could really if you're not in korea with disclaimer in korea there's tons of stuff you can do with it but like there wasn't really that much right there's like anchor astro mars uh and i do feel like until they have more protocols that are just like the base core blocks they can't it's really hard to just like pay for new users right for like polygon or avalanche just everyone just redeployed unisoft compound ave right like and that that was enough to like but like tara doesn't quite have that like the only thing that's there is anger right so it i don't think they they could spend their way out of this in any scenario unless they make the backstop make people have confidence in it well if doe is listening in the interest of uh replicating the successful d5 protocols from amateur chain i might suggest he make a ribbon clone which seems to be the thing that is missing from the from the uh terry ecosystem so far so you know you gotta have every lego piece together and don't get around joe is also an incredible hustler and finding random teams building all this stuff so i just think it's like there's a car before the worst thing and to save point i don't think throwing money at the the horses is going to work it's might as you might as well load up get as many carts as possible i mean ultimately it's buying them time and it's it's a real question of whether tara can use that time profitably to change the calculus because what what may end up happening is that you know six eight nine months later down the road we're in the exact same spot and it's time for another billion dollars a backstop so hopefully that doesn't happen obviously we're you know a dragonfly we're long uh anchor so we hope that things work out but um it's clearly not in a you know very promising position right now given the given the state of the yield situation but speaking of yields um one of the big pieces of news this week was block fi so block blockfly uh entered into a settlement with the sec it agreed to pay a hundred million dollars in penalties and to pursue registration of its crypto lending products so for those who are not following the saga block fi it allows you to get yield on your crypto it's a kind of centralized company that has become increasingly popular in the last few years and uh the sec uh well actually many different state regulators say securities regulators started going after block fi in their states basically saying that block fi was offering securities unregistered securities and that's not cool and so this culminated in the sec uh finally uh extracting a massive penalty or relatively massive penalty from block five 100 million and uh block blockfi agreed to stop offering their uh yield products to any of their customers until they register so this is um interesting on a few dimensions i mean one is that okay 100 million is a big penalty but it's also not a big penalty relative to the market cap of block fi which is you know you know they sort of built a business by doing this and then uh were able to get really huge and then essentially you know take uh i don't know like a few percent tax on their business to go and fix it after the fact but of course it also reverberates across the industry in that one it creates a path for other regulated institutions to start offering the same thing uh in terms of crypto lending products and it uh ultimately maybe produces even a little bit of a moat for block fight given that they are going to be the first to be registered presumably with the sec um for the offering of this uh crypto lending product so curious uh robert in particular i'm i'm uh wondering what your reaction was to this news well i think in some ways it's good because you know if you're a business that accepts money from retail customers and does whatever you want with that money to generate a return and then passes that return to customers that's clearly a security right and you know i think that's been relatively obviously a security or a securities related business for a really long time they weren't just gone after for offering security but also being an investment company as well as fraud you know it should be clear that like if you are a very traditional organization that is doing that you will have to comply it doesn't matter that it's a new digital asset it doesn't matter that it's a new type of asset if you're in the business of taking money using your discretion and skill and excellent prowess to make a return and handing it to customers that's old school wall street right and so i see this as no surprise i imagine that there's a lot of folks in the regulatory space that are not surprised by this outcome either you know at compound you know labs we offer a product called compound treasury which operates on the assumption that you know giving money to a business to generate an interest rate for you is a security and so it's only offered to accredited investors you know as an exemption from registration but knowing that businesses will be able to just register this with the sec is extremely positive um i think not just for businesses that look like block fi but for other types of businesses that don't look like block fine i assume next up are securities exchanges that are trading crypto right and eventually you'll see all of these businesses and things like them not just lenders but trading platforms brokers you know all of these you know types of entities you know being registered businesses you know yeah it's not they're not trading equities or they're not supporting the equities financial markets but they're doing crypto and the crypto financial markets and i think long term it's going to be really positive for the space in the short term obviously it's chaotic but giving them an opportunity you know to become you know regulated and registered businesses is extremely positive long term makes sense spoken like a true elder statesman of lending i i agree i think it seems like a good thing for the industry that we finally have some regulatory clarity even if it only comes through enforcement some clarity is better than no clarity even if uh it'd be nice to have that clarity ex-ante before people end up running a foul of the lines i actually really liked um matt levine's take on this which was like you know normally if you want regulatory clarity you can hire a bunch of lawyers and spend a lot of time and maybe after several years you'll finally get approval or yes no or a path forward for whatever the product is you're trying to build or you can do what block fight did which is build it and then take a small haircut after the fact but having already built a great business it does seem like encrypted that is often the best path forward given that um there doesn't really seem to be a lot of responsiveness or quickness to actually get um clarity on the products people are building so it was eos the most successful regulatory clarity entity in history based on this it's got to be yeah unfortunately we didn't really get a lot of clarity from eos right because like if you if you look at the history of the sec going after token issuances as securities it's like you know slap on the wrist like you know didn't have to register can slap on the wrist didn't have to register telegram nope you can't do telegram telegram token was like too security like uh you can't do the d5 money market car lending thing that was just 100 all day all night yeah it was all fraud oh i see okay never mind never mind that one then but uh and then xrp is still up in the air unclear where xrp is going to land and of course you know ethereum whatever statute limitations i suppose dao was the security according to the sec so it feels like we're we've kind of got a big range and there's not a lot of clarity even from what the sec has gone after i mean i think it's going to get more interesting as the nft scc goes after nft stuff or like see if some someone goes to start going after nft stuff i feel like these things are all things you know the block by settlement to me just read like i read some tweets from lawyers from 2018 and then we zoomed forward and picked a number you know like like it wasn't like people weren't already saying a lot of this stuff right it's just that right the government decided to pick a random stopping time and a random number and then we got an answer yeah no i think that's fair that's a fair uh fair critique all right so we're winding down on time but one thing i want to make sure that we get to is uh there's been a an amazing discovery in the world of defy um so we were talking earlier about stable coins with terra and it turns out the renowned stablecoin known as ohm uh otherwise uh called olympus dao it turns out that it was recently discovered by some leading uh scientists and researchers that own bonds actually serve as a volatility reduction strategy tarou do you want to cover this yeah yeah so you know i've shielded um om is not being all like pure ponzi in this uh in this show many times i spent you know my theory for whenever you should try to figure out if a crypto project is uh just a pure ponzi or whether they are there's some some actual like sort of mathematical reason that it should work is if you see it last a really long time and then some there's a huge crash and somehow still is not dead uh and you see that like a certain number of times right because like something that's like a pure ponzi fake algo stable coin you know you'll see that you'll see the death spiral really fast right we've seen enough of these it dies once it dies once esd maybe have a little like fake second bump but yeah you know yeah yeah yeah yeah okay it's it's the bigger it's not the suicide roller coaster it's like one instant you know yeah yeah and om had this interesting thing where it like somehow didn't die even though like theoretically right like everyone was like oh a lot of algo stable coins they're just these like kind of overly simplistic controllers you know like somehow you you can't really get them to work without putting huge backstops just to be speaking of for instance backstops like the cello and terra models effectively end up needing some backstop and you hope your staking coin is a good enough backstop but eventually you have to diversify and offer kind of different types of yield different types of duration risk to people on the other side and so om you know i think i think it it certainly fairly has gotten a lot of criticism because they created the greatest meme in crypto of 2021 and you know there's a lot of stuff that probably was ponzi like like the staking mechanism was really just not really doing anything for the protocol but this bond mechanism that they invented and now is the reason that it became like the third most forked contract on evm chains and and that the third most involves my heuristics like throwing out safe math and throwing out libraries but whatever like assume that like third most did with the hero6 i used for this one of the reasons so stable is that this bond thing actually does work in some way there's there's some sort of meaning to like why having having bonds as a way for a dow to rebalance his treasury like works really well and like people have said this forever like tom has probably said this since 2020 that like dallas should be like issuing bonds and like you know there was all these versions of it like um options and stuff like that none of them caught on but the own bond is like is this cone of truth and uh yeah you know this paper kind of formalizes that and argues that look you can actually lower the volatility of the asset that way by adding more bonds and as you add more bonds you can make like the dallas treasury management strategy stable so it was more like you know i i i'm not sure you know i talked to i actually met the um folks in denver i don't think they like invented this figure like real with that assumption that this is it was just that they were like fly by the sea of their pants and they kept adding all these features and somehow the frankenstein worked and like you know under the cover you'll be like okay there's actually like life underneath it's not just you know the dead robot well that's the magic of darwinian evolution right there's no there's no single hand controlling all this but what rises to the top is the uh the adaptations that lead to survival it's just like you know think about a year ago from right now that was like peak algo stable that was when mark cuban got rugged on titan do you remember that like that was a year ago that felt like that was like a year ago time has lost meaning in this industry but but my my point is like there were so many things that died and ohm did not so like there's some cone of truth and that was hopefully what we try to illustrate so the last thing is that i think a few of us were in east denver over the weekend which was uh absolutely incredible event uh huge numbers of people there i heard that there were 15 000 people at east denver and from what i heard the last denver which i think is 2020 there were 1500 people and there were thousands of people on the weekends i remember you could get a free ticket for it because they like had extra capacity yeah it was pretty nice totally crazy just like people spilling out under the street they're like you know lines like two blocks long to get into the venue all the hotels are booked out and everything um so it's great to see obviously people excited and great to see a lot of energy around um ethereum and crypto i will say though that like i i was a judge for the hackathon and i don't i don't i feel like the projects were not substantially better or they're not like 10 times more projects so i feel like a lot of people were in town just to party or you know talk about their project or whatever but who knows maybe maybe just my my bias so are you saying that it was the modern equivalent of what bitcoin miami was but for ethereum that sound that sounds right to me yeah except for the weaker form of coven spreading that is true that is true there was there's some poll i just saw on twitter that was like did you get coveted at east denver and i think it was like 60 yes 40 wait 60 yes yeah it had like it had like 150 responses so holy crap okay well the the other thing was that uh so when i was in line um at east denver because you have to take a cover test actually get in and clearly wasn't very effective because obviously there's a lot of code spreading there when i was in line at east denver everybody in my group who was in line with me they had all joined crypto in the last year and none of them were devs so i i think it is it does vindicate a little bit this you know this is the kind of bitcoin miami for ethereum in that um there were you know almost everybody there was into nfts and that was their that was their relationship with ethereum and what was happening in this community um which just kind of shows how big the tent has gotten and um you know crypto i don't know i feel like more and more i feel like an old man in the space uh given that i'm like wait you guys don't know about d5 you guys don't know about look you're getting old robert's getting young i know i know we're going we're going opposite ways we're passing each other in age terrible in a year i'm going to ask you to invest in my new idea [Laughter] wait time is a circle is that what you're saying time is a circle yeah times a circle i'm going to go back to the outset yeah yeah yeah robert i would be like look we got he's so young we have to invest in him yeah that's gonna be our that's gonna be our memo you know how right now there's high schoolers who are doing defy eventually there's gonna be like middle schoolers you know they're already middle schoolers buying nfts man that's the thing that's good i mean like half that conference was kids i mean the i've never i mean maybe this is a funnier observation like i've never been so many places that checked your id like and like were very like it was very clear that they were like the rari kids were not they weren't even at the bottom of the they were too old they were too old for that yeah they're kind of the median they're the medium now that's nuts that's nuts anyway all right guys well this was um an interesting couple weeks hopefully um we'll be back soon with another episode of the chopping block can can i ask you a favor yeah can we get laura as our guest next week and like oh yeah yeah yeah let's do the deep dive we should we should have a deep dive i i totally agree okay next time homework assignment all of you out there and all of us on the show we got to read the cryptopians and then next time we're going to have laura on for a history lesson and pitch us which shitty dow to put our savings into oh yeah yeah yeah the [ __ ] the shitty doubt i think that the shitty dow thing has got to be sticking point yeah we need to do that for real we got our marching orders all right all right thanks everybody you
