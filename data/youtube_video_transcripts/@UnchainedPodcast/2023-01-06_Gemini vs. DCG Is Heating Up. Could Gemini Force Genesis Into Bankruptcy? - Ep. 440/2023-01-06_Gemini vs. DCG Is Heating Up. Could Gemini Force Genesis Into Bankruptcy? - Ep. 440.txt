Ram alawalia CEO and co-founder at lumita welcome ROM pleased to be here thank you for having me Laura this week we saw tensions ratchet up even further between Gemini and Genesis dcg over the 900 million dollars in Assets in the Gemini earned product which was lent to Genesis to produce a return Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss wrote a public letter to dcg CEO Barry silbert in which he said you have been engaging in bad faith stall tactics among other things what were the main points of this letter and what do you think its significance was so overall the picture for dcg is looking increasingly grim and we'll get into that it's a really unfortunate state of play for dcg Gemini earning and gbtc holders the letter the open letter that Cameron Winklevoss posted on on Twitter has a few notable highlights I will call out two sentences in particular one he calls Barry's Behavior as not only unacceptable quote but also unconscionable that's one the second this is a key sentence he says you referring to Barry you took this money the money of school teachers to quote fuel greedy share BuyBacks illiquid Venture Investments and Kamikaze grayscale nav trades that ballooned the fee generating AUM of your trust all at the expense of creditors and all for your own personal gain now those are obviously fighting words what Cameron is doing is he's coming right up to the line of accusation of improprietary behavior without crossing the line what Cameron has done with that second sentence has put Barry into the same class of actors as Celsius and block Phi block 5 of course has an SEC enforcement action they're bankrupt and Celsius today was announced at the new New York attorney general is taking action uh so what he's claiming is that dcg has borrowed customer funds from Gemini earn through the subsidiary Genesis to engage in self-dealing uh that's the reference to personal gain by borrowing to fund this levered bet on gbtc so he is also using this term of unconscionable activity so he is coming right up to the line he's not saying he's committed fraud but he is getting as close as you can to intimating that there's improper Behavior one other thing I noticed was that Cameron also told Barry that dcgs and genesis's assets were Beyond commingled would you say that's accurate this is a a a legal question but let's look at the facts Genesis was borrowing deposits from Gemini earn and other creditors Genesis then made loans and the primary counterparty the primary recipient of those loans was a dcg so dcg netnet is borrowing from Gemini earn now what does he mean by commingled those are questions we don't really get into but the usage of the word commingled he's being very deliberate in that word choice what other institution was recently taken down because of commingled funds that's of course FTX and SPF so he's been very deliberate in his work choice of course this letter was reviewed by a number of outside console before us published and would you say that the demands by Cameron to get in a room with Barry are reasonable and also kind of like a standard way to Hash this kind of thing out yes it's extraordinary reasonable because Genesis is in default they're past their three-day cure period notices of default have been sent to Genesis which by accounts seem to be being ignored and what dcg and Genesis and Gemini are attempting to do is an out of court workout that's a great idea because it saves significant amount of legal fees number one number two it creates all it creates Clarity for all the parties involved as opposed to going through a public lengthy court process where you don't have Clarity on what the outcome of that would be this also explains why there's been so little updating of the Gemini earned block site it must be incredibly frustrating of course for anyone that's a Gemini earned client and now we know why at least per Cameron's claim it appears that dcg is not going to the table they're not engaging now varying dcg's defense they are saying they've put some counter proposal on the table so you know those are both sides of the story and of course Cameron has put out a date of January 8th which is this Sunday for dcg and Genesis to reply by and so but if TCG does not if by Sunday they haven't publicly committed to doing so then what can Gemini do at that point so well then Gemini can take action uh such as filing involuntary petition for chapter 11. so just be clear though so dcg and Genesis won't ever say that they're not trying in good faith to seek a settlement they in fact are throwing indications out there they're making attempts and the interpretation from Cameron is that those are really faints that they're not really sincere and that these are quote stall tactics so it appears that the strategy of dcg in Genesis is to buy time um and avoid accepting the Creditor committee terms because as soon as those Credit Community terms are accepted dcg would in effect be in a form of corporate indentured servitude where the cash flows that are generated from grayscale and dcg are diverted to May coal Gemini earn and other creditors over many years okay yeah talk a little bit about the what the Creditor committee has demanded and whether or not you think that that solution is likely to happen so I have no insight into the Creditor committee terms of negotiation in general when you have this type of out of court workout there are a few levers so one levers pay us now X dollars and the second levers pay us over time the remaining balance the third level is convert debt to equity I can't imagine uh there's much interest in converting debt to equity we've got retail investors that thought they had a savings account and these creditor classes have to be treated equitably and fairly otherwise that can be contested in court so the outline would be something like hey here's maybe 30 to 40 cents in the dollar just inventing some numbers up today and then the balance paid over time via the cash flows from dcg and grayscale so after Cameron's tweet Barry rowback dcg did not borrow 1.675 billion dollars from Genesis dcg has never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all loans outstanding next loan maturity is May 2023. and this is where he says that dcg did deliver to Genesis and to Gemini's advisors a proposed on December 29th that hasn't received a response so why do you think it is that Barry's saying that dcg has not borrowed 1.675 billion dollars from Genesis this is a very surprising statement because in the dcg letter to investors Barry describes how they have a 1.1 billion dollar promissory note that is due in 10 years in June 2033 he doesn't name the counterparty to that he does say in the immediately following sentence I'm looking at the letter now as we shared in our previous shareholder letter in August 2022 dcg stepped in and quote assumed certain liabilities from Genesis related to 3 hours Capital default so uh I think Barry engaged in seller financing meaning that they purchased the defaulted three hours Capital receivable from Genesis and they finance that using a promissory note meaning that they would agree to pay Genesis back over 10 years that's my interpretation of it it leaves more questions like why isn't Barry stating who the counterpart is he's saying he did not borrow 1.675 billion from Genesis he is saying the letter that he did borrow that dollar amount then you can just simply State who the counterparties are he has stayed in the letter that 575 million was borrowed from Genesis to be clear and that low maturity is in May 2023 he is disputing that he borrowed 1.1 billion dollars from Genesis another thing that's very odd is look several creditors to Genesis have contacted me and I've seen the balance sheet of Genesis uh at least the balance sheet that they curate and present to their customers so it's a certain redacted kind of balancy and you can see that there's a 1.1 billion plus asset on Genesis balance sheet so you can see that these numbers do tie out to the dcg letter and also that loan is treated as a loan to an affiliate but it raises more questions for example if that is a 10-year loan as say in the dcg letter is it the case that Genesis is treating that as a current asset now Genesis would have a an interest in treating that as a current asset so they could claim that they're not in solvent so they could claim that their current assets exceed their current liabilities and this would explain what haseeb pointed out some time ago which is that the 10-year loan has a callable feature in the event of chapter 11. what callable future means is that if Genesis goes through chapter 11 then that 1.1 billion is is due upon demand due immediately so it just raises further questions and Barry's not answering those questions and that you're talking about who's Steve Qureshi of dragonfly Capital that's correct okay all right in a moment we're going to talk about um another a number of other developments involving Genesis but first a quick word from the sponsors to make this show possible join over 50 million people

Wednesday Genesis CEO durar Islam wrote a letter to shareholders that the firm needs more time in addition this week the company laid off 30 of its staff what are these developments say to you about How likely it is that the company can actually pull through Genesis is of course buying time I don't think they need much time look Lehman Brothers in a three-day weekend which is a far more complex institution file bankruptcy papers so dcg is less complex than than Lehman Brothers um look they're looking to buy time uh because as soon as the terms of the credit committee are accepted it would imply significant layoffs for dcg as well as Genesis and it raises into question uh what happens to the gbtc Holdings would they be sold on the open market uh Etc yeah so now we're talking about grayscale there are so many different entities here that start with the G um so before we get into that um I do want to ask about a couple of things involving Gemini one is that there's a couple of lawsuits or quasi lawsuits against Gemini one is alleging that the earned product was actually a security and therefore it should have been registered with the SEC and the other one is what's called a request for a class action arbitration just a different way kind of of doing a class action lawsuit and three and Gemini earned users have filed that against Genesis and dcg saying that Genesis failed to return Gemini earned users digital assets as required under the firm's Master agreements do you think that either of these lawsuits have any legs yes let's start with the master agreements so the master agreement has a representation to solvency what does that mean it means that Genesis is repping to any creditor that they're solvent and this is why you see including the communication this week and including the dcg letter to shareholders that they keep insisting that Genesis has a liquidity issue and not a solvency issue if Genesis was found to be insolvent and they took customer credit or funds in then they would be in violation of contract law so one of those claims which you pointed out I think has Merit under the basic question around how did dcg feel the impairment or the whole that occurred on genesis's balance sheet due to the defaulted three hours Capital balance you can only fix an equity Hole by adding New Capital dcg has not added enough Capital to repair the damage from the defaulted loan there was a set of transactions and call in around this 1.1 billion dollar loan which appears to an attempt to restore to solvency so I think there's some Merit there uh but again I have not seen the line items on Genesis balance sheet the second question around was this a Securities offering I believe it was look what is a security it's when you offer an investment contract to a party uh with an expectation of Prof profit and you rely on the efforts of others those are the the prongs of the Howie test by the way the loan agreement acknowledges or at least contemplates the possibility that the loans could be considered Securities so you know Gemini had very good lawyers when they drafted that agreement and what it says by the way is that if these loans are treated as Securities then the loans are Unwound I have to be paid back immediately of course that's a moot point now because Genesis has suspended uh all withdrawals but I do think that that exposes liability and of course uh it's been publicly reported that state attorney generals are investing investigating Genesis it's been alleged that the SEC is also investigating Genesis which would be very ironic since ccg filed suit against the SEC uh but my Layman interpretation is that that is an unregistered security offering made to the public with insufficient risk factor disclosure such as a PPM okay wait I'm sorry PPM can you define that PPM is a private placement memorandum so when you invest in a private company you receive depending on the nature of the filing and so forth but there's there's a disclosure of risk factors uh and if you invest in a startup or you invest a in a credit instrument the PPM would have 10 to 20 pages of risk factors there is no PPM the disclosure merely states that Genesis is the counterparty to the loan so if you're a retail investor how do you have sufficient information to underwrite the credit risk and beyond that what business do you have investing in in a commercial uh credit operation right the standard for offering a security to the public is very specific that standard is called the S1 filing and that S1 filing is what we also call an IPO clearly there's no S1 filing here clearly there's no IPO it looks like an unregistered Securities offering May to the public okay yeah so now let's talk about dcg and by extension grayscale which we kind of got up to at a certain point do you think that Gemini could force Genesis into chapter 11 bankruptcy and if so what would happen to dcg and grayscale yes Gemini could force Genesis into chapter 11 through involuntary petition it just takes three other creditors to have a minimum bolus of exposure and my understanding is that other creditors are already taking this line of action that are outside the Predator committee so that is likely the course of action if there's no resolution by the Sunday January 8th that 1.1 billion dollar promissory note that dcg cites in their investor letter it is a noose around dcg's neck because it links Genesis to dcg because Genesis primary asset is this loan to dcg the 1.1 billion dollars so it gives a pathway for creditors to Genesis to have a claim on dcg itself wow and so essentially that would also then take dcg under or well well then you have to start asking questions around is dcg going to be exposed to chapter 11 but now now it makes sense why Barry is saying they did not borrow from Genesis you see he's trying to distance dcg from Genesis he's trying to eliminate those obligations and also you can see this around the grayscale trust grayscale trust removed Genesis as one of its authorized parties so Barry is looking into the future and he's trying to take actions to limit his liabilities wherever he can but the answer your question on dcg yeah look the picture is grim Genesis is is insolvent they had two and a half billion dollars loaned a three hours count but it's defaulted not only that we know that the value of three hours Capital assets have declined over time um I have a tweet thread on this analyzing the the Holdings of the three arrows capital for the bankruptcy docket those tokens are trading down worse than the overall market so there should be yet another impairment that Genesis experiencing here because they should expect to receive uh less recovery wow so I mean since you admitted that you believe that a chapter 11 bankruptcy for Genesis is one of the more likely outcomes then it sounds like the same would happen to dcg well it's I think there's a there's a real possibility that that could take place like what we don't know is the terms on that 1.1 billion dollar call alone if if the term of the loan requires immediate payment then yes dcg's at Great risk because dcg is not going to have 1.1 billion dollars in cash line around dcg has something like 500 million dollars in gbtc Holdings that they could liquidate and of course the discount keeps widening perhaps in anticipation of that uh but they still would have a 600 million dollar shortfall where is that cash going to come from yeah grayscale generates maybe 170 million dollars net income per year that's not sufficient cash flow and there's a 575 million dollar loan payable in May 23 which Barry acknowledges in the letter and his statement this week to its subsidiary Genesis so there's not enough cash to go around there are too many obligations for dcg to me dcg has two billion dollars in loans outstanding again per their own letter and if you value if you sum up the value of dcg's assets it does seem like they're well short of that and so if dcg goes under then presumably grayscale would go under and that would unwind all the investment trusts no no I don't think we're going to go that far I don't think we're gonna go that far so yeah just to uh I want to be very clear about that one right so what the likely course of action would be in the chapter 11 process first you know liquid Securities would be sold off first that would include gbtc they would attempt to auction and find an orderly transaction as opposed to dumping on the market right the other part is uh the appropriate response would be to seek a buyer of grayscale intact it would be this to auction off the business in whole and that makes sense because grayscale is a bona fide business make 170 million in in net income okay okay so maybe that would happen well in the meantime we have some other interested parties that aren't actually traditional crypto entities who've been poking around here the hedge fund fur tree has filed a complaint against grayscale um it looks like they've taken an interest and there's also Valkyrie that's proposed becoming gbtc's sponsor and manager talk a little bit about these developments and what you think the significance is yeah they're really strange bedfellows coming together here and really putting their boot on the neck of dcg so fir tree is a value investor their three billion dollar asset Center management they generally invest in value stocks like oil and tobacco you know they don't appear to be long the crypto sector also they have a short on Tether they were short on usdt they initiated that Shore or at least they announced that short March of last year and they expect that that short will pay off about a year from a year later that puts us to three months from now um of course usdt is maintaining its Peg so my interpretation of the fur tree complaint is that it's a way to add pressure is to shake the stools supporting the crypto market and dcg in Genesis is a weak stool it's worth pointing out it's weak leg in the stool it's worth pointing out that the fur tree complaint one alleges that BCG and grayscale isn't sincere about converting to an ETF that they want to keep this as a cash cow second they don't seek remedy from the courts right if you think that you want to change the behavior of a grayscale that you would ask the court for some kind of relief instead they ask for information rights they're asking for data books and Records so I believe fir tree is trying to shake the stool and making it more difficult for dcg to raise outside Venture money because if you can raise outside money then you can start plugging these holes and getting back to business Valkyrie has raised their hand and said look we can be the program manager for grayscale will charge only 75 bips not 200 bips one and two they would elect for the reg M which would enable the Redemption of gbtc at the nav of the underlying Bitcoin and that mechanism would close the gap so Valkyrie does appear to be like this white knight or this hero that could save gbtc however per the trust agreements there's no legal mechanism for grayscale to change the program's bouncer unless greyscale agrees to do so so grayscale would have to terminate itself there's some ongoing legal analysis around whether if you get a majority of gbtc shareholders can they make a legal motion to modify the program sponsor we'll learn more about that but even that you know is a difficult path to uh to move so all to say I don't think the fur tree of The Valkyrie really do much other than adding pressure on dcg making it more difficult for them to raise money they're trying to maybe disallowage the grayscale asset from dcg all right so we kind of addressed this question but I just want to ask you a little bit more directly so at this point in time what would you say is most likely to happen in this whole situation so January 8th is the key date the Cameron's put out there and say look we need a response by this day they put some proposal dcg has to accept or reject that proposal or or counter and appears that they've countered um it doesn't look like that that proposal will be accepted which would be very unfortunate uh we can come back to why I think they ought to accept the Creditor committee terms in which case then Gemini could as agent ins follow through an involuntary chapter 11. right so Gemini really does have to go down that path if they're not getting uh good faith engagement from Genesis because if they don't go down that path then they're not representing the interests of Gemini earn and they could be exposed to liability so there's a shot clock on January 8th there's another shot clock on these notices of default which Genesis has received I've been informed that from multiple creditors it appears that they're ignoring that third there are these additional class actions and fourth and the longer this goes on more Regulators take a look at this again we saw the action from New York attorney general against Celsius that was about six months after Celsius suspended withdrawals maybe five months after so again there's an SEC investigation allegedly time is not on the side of dcg this is why dcg needs to accept the Creditor committee terms it'll be painful I guess substantial dilution but the Alternatives of shrinking the pie paying out legal fees and more liabilities and the lack of clarity around what a potentially disorderly liquidation of these assets could be through a bankruptcy process they don't help the crypto sector it doesn't help crypto jobs doesn't help the crypto asset class all right well I guess we'll see if dcg ends up taking your your advice um okay well thanks so much for enlightening us around this Grand Saga and also for coming back on Unchained my pleasure thank you Laura have a good one don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap at his arraignment Sam benkman freed pleads not guilty Sam Pinkman free the former CEO of FTX pleaded not guilty to eight counts of fraud money laundering and other Financial crimes at a court hearing in Manhattan on Tuesday the charges included wire fraud violations of campaign Finance laws and securities fraud if found guilty the sentences for all the charges adds up to 115 years in prison he has also been accused of violating political contribution laws by donating to candidates and committees in New York under another prison's name during the hearing judge Lewis Kaplan granted a request from penguin Freed's lawyers to seal the names of two individuals who had secured his release on bail with a bond Federal prosecutor Danielle Sassoon told the court that bankman freed had worked with foreign Regulators to transfer assets that ftx's U.S management had been attempting to seize as the process plays out SPF is not gaining more allies Reuters reported that Daniel Friedberg ftx's former Chief regulatory officer provided information to U.S prosecutors the FBI the southern district of New York Court and the SEC about the activities of FTX and its sister training firm Alameda research bankman freed who was released on a 250 million dollar bail bond will remain under house arrest at his parents home in California however his bail conditions have been amended to prohibit him from accessing or transferring any FTX or Alameda Associated assets notably though 12 SPF linked wallets transferred 144 000 worth of assets to different destinations which included transactions on January 2nd and January 3rd raising suspicions from industry Watchers Regulators in the U.S sees ftx's stake and Robin Hood the US government seized 56 million Robin Hood shares with about 450 million dollars from FTX this year's ownership is being disputed by FTX blockfi and creditor Jonathan Ben Shimon the Department of Justice believes these assets are not part of the bankruptcy estate and may be subject to forfeiture proceedings the doj is also trying to seize FTX assets held in accounts at silvergate bank speaking of the crypto-friendly bank The Wall Street Journal reported that during their recent Market downturn silvergate was forced to sell assets at a loss in order to meet 8.1 billion dollars in withdrawal requests the bank also reduced its staff by 40 percent an affidavit signed by bankman freed in an Antigua Court in December revealed that he used funds borrowed from Alameda research to purchase more than seven percent of Robin Hood's stock Additionally the southern district of New York created an FTX task force to trace and recover lost funds belonging to customers of the collapsed Exchange as part of the bankruptcy proceedings the debtors of FTX will request the return of seized assets worth 296 million dollars from the Bahamas monetary Authority moreover the country's Securities Commission is disputing statements made by the new CEO of FTX John Ray III calling them unfounded and based on incomplete information New York AG sues former Celsius CEO for fraud the New York attorney general filed a lawsuit against former Celsius CEO Alex machinski accusing him of defrauding investors of billions of dollars through false and misleading statements about the safety of his crypto Exchange the suit alleges that the fraud occurred between 2018 and June 2022 when the exchange froze withdrawals the Attorney General is seeking to find moshinski impose monetary damages and bar him from working in the Securities industry or leading a company in New York moreover bankruptcy judge Martin Glenn ruled that the tokens deposited in celsius's interest-bearing accounts belonged to the company this means that Celsius can use its 4.2 billion dollars in crypto assets as it sees fit the decision affects 600 000 holders of high interest Accounts at Celsius who are now considered unsecured creditors the ruling could also settle a key legal issue in the insolvency cases of Celsius and other companies that went bankrupt last year including FTX and blockfi since it determines the ownership rights of crypto assets at digital exchanges trading firms and other platforms many customers had argued that their crypto assets were not the property of the Celsius bankruptcy estate but the firm argued that its terms of use granted ownership rights to Celsius judge Glenn mentioned that he has not yet made a decision regarding the legal ownership of approximately 700 million dollars worth of cryptocurrency assets used as collateral for Fiat loans to individual customers three AC founder claims dcg and FTX conspired Cameron Winklevoss was not the only one to take a hit at Barry silbert suju the founder of bankrupt hedge fund three arrows capital or 3ac accused dcg of collaborating with FTX to attack Luna and Steve Lido's ethereum liquid staking derivative Zhu claimed that dcg covered up its losses from 3dc's bankruptcy with a 1.1 billion promissory note due in 2032. he also alleged that dcg used tactics similar to FTX misleading investors and attacking 3ac while avoiding questions about its own Financial standing it looks like zhu's usage of Twitter backfired on him and his co-founder Kyle Davies following unsuccessful efforts to contact them Liquidators ultimately served the 3ac founders subpoenas in a tweet tagging their frequently used Twitter accounts coinbase settles for 100 million dollars crypto exchange coinbase reached a 100 million dollar settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services following investigations into compliance failure the nydfs found that coinbase had failed to adequately review customer identities and transaction alerts along with the surge in customer growth the exchange was fined 50 million dollars and required to invest another 50 million dollars into its compliance program coinbase has positioned itself as a law-abiding exchange however the settlement shows that even exchanges with a reputation for following the rules are under increasing scrutiny from regulators Stefan oulier CEO at front Financial told the block there is a view that okay The Regulators have made their point and they will leave coinbase alone for now Finance Us's deal to acquire voyager's assets is questioned by the SEC the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission filed a limited objection to binance Us's proposed one billion acquisition of Voyager digital the regulator cited a lack of detail in the purchase agreement about the exchange's ability to close the deal among other things the move follows a warning from the committee on foreign investments in the U.S that would conduct a review of the deal that could delay or block it the sec's objections have been communicated to binance Us's council with a revised disclosure statement set to be filed before the next hearing on the matter the Texas state Securities board in the Texas department of banking have also filed an objection to the sale alleging that Voyager and binance us are not in compliance with Texas law BlackRock bails out a Bitcoin miner BlackRock has
