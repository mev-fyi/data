fourth installment in the y bitcoin now series which takes a closer look at bitcoin in the context of larger macroeconomic forces such as the pandemic and geopolitical moves happening in crypto my guests for today are adam back the inventor of hashcash and the co-founder and ceo of blockstream and david shaw the inventor of ecash and the co-founder and ceo of elixir welcome adam and david hey it's great to be here nice to see you yeah likewise good to be here so just a quick note before we begin i've been a little bit under the weather i've managed to to gather the fortitude to do this episode hopefully it will all turn out fine but i just wanted people to know uh that's what was happening while i was trying to prepare for this all right so let's start with the first question how did you both become enamored with the idea of digital currency at a time when that was something that wasn't even really on the radar of anybody in the world and the internet wasn't even really a big thing and why don't we start with you david well sure uh yeah so uh well in 1970 in the spring i moved to berkeley to start my phd in computer science and uh i uh well i was transferring actually i had a regents four-year graduate fellowship at ucla but i decided berkeley was more my kind of place so i moved to berkeley and i you know really focused on privacy and the uh trying to foresee how the world would the digital world would play out and i realized that privacy was a key ingredient in that and i started developing you know a few technologies to see where this would all go and the first one i started with was actually voting and which more or less immediately led to what's called mix networks today and that's something i published in 79 as my master's thesis and then appeared in cac in 82 i think but it's pretty well referenced work and many people have implemented this over the years it was put in the public domain and uh it's the only real way that's practical at all to create what's we call a large anonymity set which is the figure of merit in any kind of privacy system right it's like how many people are you actually anonymous among assuming that the bad guys can see everything that everyone sends to everyone else that's the threat model you know and we learned from snowden now that that's the real threat model um so that was kind of where i started i thought yeah this is really important if the government can see who talks to who and when then you don't really have a basis for for being a participant in a democracy this could be a kind of a chilling thing and so then the next step to come to your question about money was well then i thought well great so i can participate in this upcoming internet thing or this you know the future digital world we didn't know exactly how it was going to play out in ninth in the in the late 70s but uh i'll need some way to pay things and and and be paid to do things and uh if if you know that payment system allowed the linking of who's paying who to be recognized you know by people listening in on the network then it would undo all of the the what we call traffic analysis protection now called metadata shredding the the hiding of who talks to who in the messaging system would be uh obviated would be undone by learning who pays who because then you would you'd know anyway so i thought well we need a payment technology that will work in this privacy uh protective metadata shredding sphere and so that's when i uh in the let's say in the early 80s i had i invented ecash which was a uh a privacy protecting uh digital bearer instrument and that's something that i think people have really recognized it's i mean it some sense you could call it bitcoin zero because but it was it has certain advantages over bitcoin in that of course there's very strong privacy that you couldn't break even with um unlimited computing power and then it also had the the property that when you had this money no one could take it away from you so that you know nowadays you could take uh you could change uh things on the chain if you really want to sometimes it happens but with ecast there'd be no way to take money away from you because you would have these digital signatures on serial numbers that you chose at random and no one would see them even if they had quantum computers or unlimiting computing power they couldn't figure out which serial numbers you chose at random and have the signatures on so you would be protected uh in the holding of your money so it was a digital bear instrument of that you know no one had ever thought of anything like that and yeah that was a really big deal so that's how i that's how i came to it okay yeah let's uh we'll dive a little bit more into ecash in a moment um adam what about you how did you get into digital currency so early on before anything like bitcoin was on the scene so i started a phd uh in 1991 and i guess the year before that i had a friend who's doing a master's degree and this is a university of exeter we had a distributed systems group with some parallel hardware so you know lots of processes high speed interconnects and it's a kind of interesting challenge to program those things and that was the topic of my phd actually initially was more about distributed systems so i came to know about the byzantine general's problem and things like that before other people who maybe heard about that topic first in the bitcoin or cryptocurrency context so any case my friend there was um trying to accelerate the rsa encryption algorithm on these parallel hardware because at the time cpus were a lot slower than they are now and so even between qrik messages was somewhat slow on a general desktop processor and that kind of thing so i got interested in got to the technology before the kind of you know the very interesting balance of power change of being able to have end-to-end secure messaging that governments couldn't encrypt and so on so it wasn't long after that that pgp came out and pgp had that very interesting property i think the internet itself brought a lot of kind of freedoms and more direct participation for example in media and blogging and conversations is less hierarchical you know some initially some government friction and adapting to the concept that you know while they could maybe influence a large media organization it's very difficult to influence millions of independent voices with their own views on things and you know of course that's progressed a lot since you know the 80s and 90s but from the interest in pgp i joined the cypherpunks list which is basically a group of people interested in technology like that so um internet technology with some kind of privacy benefit or changing the balance of power so the kind of things that snowden came to blow the whistle on people were suspicious of and these were the kinds of people that were suspicious you know is the government really actually recording all this stuff and there was a whole like a political battle about the banning of encryption actually or the banning of export of encryption from some countries or you know discussion about countries banning encryption software that the national security apparatus couldn't decrypt and some of those things pop up even decades and decades later so it's kind of disappointing that that's still ongoing but i think my my view was that we have in laws and regulations established rights and it's a kind of natural balance in society that for you know respect and privacy and personal independence and so forth that you have various rights but they become harder to enforce or eroded by the mechanisms of the internet so those are things some of the things that david was talking about that you know actually to even hold on to the rights that you naturally assume and expect in the physical world some of those start to get eroded because isps are keeping logs initially for other you know for service reasons but once they're recorded then people start to ask for access to the logs you know different law enforcement so i'll say they were interested in privacy technology and red you know spent much of a time when i should have been you know working on distributed systems actually reading all kinds of uh applied cryptography papers including david chum's some of david's drums papers and um implemented some of them in cryptographic libraries and actually implemented a an ecatch library that implements david's ecash protocol the the online version not the more complicated cut and choose offline version and also a related system uh by stefan brandt's which is just another another variety of that so i implemented both of those systems in a library and you know there was there was a great deal of interest in privacy technology but all of the networks were operated by volunteers so you know the cost of the servers the cost of the bandwidth advance here and it was a big gap in the technology that there was no way to pay for anything and as david said you know as soon as you whip out your credit card and pay for something now all the privacy has been undone and gone so clearly electronic cash was needed so there's a lot of excitement about david's company digicash at the time which which was deploying the technology that he talked about some some decades after he first published the blind signature paper you know people wanted to see that deployed in some way or other and and that was for a time deployed in a kind of demo server but it was i think bitcoin which came very much later struck you know approached from from a different angle which is a it was more distributed but less private and the reasons for the distribution or decentralization are sort of censorship resistance survivability you know so it didn't depend for its viability on any any group of individuals or companies right it would just keep operating as a fabric so there's no not really any prospect of the internet disappearing because there are so many different service providers and operators and so it is with bitcoin that there are you know so many different companies offering integration services and wallets and doing mining and providing various infrastructure services so bitcoin becomes much more of a fabric and so more survivable but it's not as good from a privacy point of view so you know with my kind of interested in interest in applied cryptography when i saw bitcoin and started taking more interest in it it struck me that you know now that it was here and it addressed sort of robust survivability that maybe there would be some way to improve the privacy and of course there have been incremental improvements over time but i proposed something called confidential transactions which is a way to encrypt the values of the so so how many coins are being transferred but still have it be publicly auditable so it turns out you can do that using zero knowledge proofs and you know challenges to make it compact and efficient so that's been implemented in sort of related systems so like side chains to bitcoin so kind of modular layer twos to bitcoin and some other systems and there are a variety of uh price technologies in surrounding cryptocurrencies which which are interesting and i hope that you know one day as the technology matures bitcoin itself will incorporate more strong privacy either in layer one or in a layer two um so it's gonna it came out from a price technology perspective i think bitcoin adds one other dimension which was not something i was focusing on before i mean i think that you know in the in the early to mid 90s onwards there are a lot of people interested to try and find a way to deploy electronic cache either you know using trolls protocols or other protocols or independently and finding difficult like technically challenging to do that and so i was part of that kind of group of researchers like how finney and nick sabo and other people that were discussing those things one thing that bitcoin adds that wasn't to my mind the major concern at the time is a digital gold like aspect right that it that it would have also some kind of monetary reform or return to a gold standard but a digital format you know we were looking at it from the point of view we needed electronic money with strong privacy and bearer properties but if that would have been denominated in u.s dollars or you know some other stable large country currency we'd have been very happy and felt that we'd uh achieved the objective say bitcoin adding that is a new dimension and um i think likely helped its you know popularity and adoption as well yeah super interesting points and we'll dive into some of these a bit more later but one other thing i wanted to ask about those early days was was there a sense at that time that uh it was kind of like an active group of people that were all working on this or did it have this feeling more of people that were kind of loosely connected on the internet and then each of you were sort of tinkering on your own like you know i'm just trying to get a sense of the feeling during those days whether or not it was something that felt like it was almost imminent or if it really felt like well these people are trying different things but you know it's probably kind of far off in the future let me maybe maybe i could speak to that adam because i think we're talking about two different time frames here totally right and i'm talking about the 90s i'm talking about you know i invented all this stuff in the late 70s and published it in the early 80s and uh i did another thing which was you know really fundamental that uh opened up this whole discussion adam mentioned the crypto wars without calling them that but that you know governments were in this mode of you know saying that you couldn't export cryptographic software or that you couldn't in fact they were putting secrecy orders on uh researchers in the united states uh people i knew uh independently created ideas in the government governments and you can't talk about that it's a national security you know you they're gonna put you in prison if you talked about it well adam i i mean you have your famous t-shirt the rsa teacher can you talk about that for a second because that yeah it's it's related to what david just mentioned yeah so well i was living in in the uk at the time and so the i mean you know various countries had different export controls and regulations but the us was the largest exporter of software you know the nexus of a lot of internet software development and so the fact that it's had this non-expert policy on cryptography was a concern and struck me as kind of silly because so i set about making a very small program that would normally be unexplorable and it's you know it's like three lines of pearl code or something so it's very small and i made a t-shirt and sold some t-shirts and there are people did other things with it you know like got a tattoo or you know put it as a signature line on the email and so on and say and i think there was a law professor who there was a procedure where you could ask if your software was exportable so there was a law professor who was trying to fight this export regulation through us courts and he asked for approval to export this you know three lines of poll and he said he couldn't and it's also very anachronist because there's the very strong us uh free speech and it particularly applies to written you know to books you shouldn't you know ban books and things like that and so there were people that you know put the pgp source code in books and freely exported them but to do it electronically would have been illegal or something so it struck me as kind of sort of silly but at the same time serious you know it was hampering business and it was meaning that de facto a lot of software wasn't as secure as it could have been so it was a way to sort of put some political commentary on it look you know here's the de minimis thing that they would apparently consider to be unexplorable so anyway so continue with your line of thought there well but just to make clear for people like you printed it on a t-shirt and then so if people flew internationally with that t-shirt on then they were breaking this law is that the case i don't know i mean if you can export a book can you export a t-shirt at a bit of a gray area i guess but at least it it people thought it was an amusing kind of way to protest something that they were quite unhappy about it was a serious thing you know because it was impeding internet commerce basically because people didn't feel they could trust encryption and it was also pushing jobs away from the us you know now there were people in europe writing cryptographic libraries because the us counterparts wouldn't be able to export them or you know international companies setting up offices in europe to do applied cryptography implementations and things so it was it was quite the inconvenience and it eventually got overturned but not not before there were you know test cases and a lot of drama so the uh the crypto wars as david called it yeah that was a real thing in the in the 90s and so david yeah we interrupted your line of thought what were you gonna oh well i'd like to let's let me just turn the big old heavy tv camera back to you know when this all was really in play so as i was saying uh a number of my uh colleagues and friends had secrecy order placed on them by the united states government which made it a federal crime to uh reveal what they were researching even though they had they weren't drawing in any classified sources so that's a doctrine that sometimes referred to as born classified which we have as an official policy in the united states when it was relates to nuclear weapons technology it makes a certain amount of sense to me i guess but you know to apply that to cryptography seemed uh a bit out of range and so actually so i was a graduate student at berkeley thinking about you know liberty in the digital world and uh what it would be like because you know it's a lot more kind of bi-stable you know because if you everything's digital you could spy on everything pretty easily or i developed these technologies that would allow you to protect your privacy so you it could go sort of one of one of the two ways but all the privacy technology was based on encryption and special kinds of encryption that i developed you know and uh so i really pioneered a lot of that stuff and i think that's what inspired the cypherpunk movement i mean that's what everyone says but the other thing that i think really uh is very significant is that this all could have gone a very different way because the the the national security agency which is our main cryptographic uh authority in the united states you know for protecting secrets and breaking codes uh they got a new director and this fellow came in and he started writing letters to all the scientific associations like that you know the acm and the ieee which are the main ones for computer technology telling them that they should not have conferences or even sessions at conferences that covered uh cryptography because this was you know an illegal export and that they would you know he was going to throw the full uh force of the us government at them and uh you know their unbelievable uh penalties would would accrue to them because this was totally illegal and with my perspective at how uh how important all this encryption would be to deciding which way the world would go and you know being a relatively i don't know berkeley young guy uh caught up in the whole atmosphere there and uh everything i thought there's only one thing to do and that is to organize a conference on cryptography but to do it secretly not to use the phone so we i did it all by in-person conversations and by uh and i mailed out invitations uh to a bunch of you know basically a guy named lynn edelman was a researcher from from the rsa uh name art the a he had a list of look at a printout in those days you know and me and my girlfriend sat in the apartment you know we uh cut those out and glued them onto these envelo you know and we mailed these these things out in the in the paper mail and um so there was a a conference and most people interested in the in the field came to it and it was uh in santa barbara i stood up there on the stage and thanked everyone for showing up and i announced that if they you know since they paid 100 bucks or whatever it was 80 bucks to uh for the registration fee that now they were that was a membership fee and a new international association for cryptologic research international scientific associations are protected by the united nations and so you know there was a bunch of people in the front row uh all who registered for the conference as private individuals not affiliated with any institution but they all happen to live in laurel maryland which if you know anything about the nsa that's where they they are so and so all when i said this they just you know these people all turned green it was that was it it was over i said okay we're having our next event we'll be in uh udina italy and here's henry becker he's going to be the chairman of that that'll be in the spring and you know it was over so you know the government tried to make cl cryptography born classified and they they threatened these big organizations and that scared them because those bureaucrats didn't have a lot you know a skin in the game but i i felt it was just too important so i risked spending the rest of my life in jail to set cryptography free which i did and i i'm very proud of it and at that conference i published the uh the ecash paper uh and um you know and that conference that association by the way is very robust and exists to this day it is the main uh by probably the only real organization in the field of cryptography it publishes a journal through springer verlag all of its proceedings are published it has three annual conference three countries every year in different parts of the world plus half a dozen workshops so it's the the international association for cryptologic research it's called and uh it's it's it has enough money in the bank you know to where whether the pandemic even if it has to pay for conferences for like a year or two if no one comes it still it can afford that so uh we resisted like joining these other scientific associations so it's maintained uh very independent and robust uh uh position and done a great deal to uh you know facilitate and build up the the scientific community in the field so this was a pivotal pivotal thing it's so fascinating i love that story uh so in a moment we're gonna talk more about ecash as well as hash cash but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible how much in fees are you paying for your crypto purchases crypto.com is waiving the 3.5 credit card fee for all crypto purchases which means you can buy crypto with a zero percent fee apart from your crypto purchases you can also get a great deal on food and grocery shopping too get up to ten percent back on ubereats mcdonald's domino's pizza walmart and many more when you pay with your mco visa card no card on the crypto.com app buy gift cards and get up to 20 back from merchants like whole foods safeway burger king papa john's and dominos download the crypto.com app today and enjoy these offers till the end of september back to my conversation with david shaw and adam back so david you did allude to this briefly earlier you created the ecash system which had as its currency cyberbucks how did ecash work and um and you can also explain digicash okay well that's a lot of yeah it's a kind of a lot of stuff by the way but if you come to if you go to charm.com that scroll down those projects and one of them is the ecash project and you can see there's a whole digicash museum there and so you can see all about the history of it and pictures of the people and all this stuff and you can see uh interestingly the banners of the original cyberbucks accepting shops on the internet and so there's a whole bunch of them here do you want to list some of those for people i don't really remember them but you go there because you can click if you hover over them you know if you're on a laptop then you can uh it'll show the name and if you click through you can see like from the wayback machine what their home page looked like so you can see all your people selling interesting stuff uh so the deal was if you put up a shop and accepted ecash we would i would give you a hundred cyber bucks and there was okay it wasn't wasn't a you know we just said well we're going to have a million it was limited so the idea of a limited issue was something a lot of people had talked to me about you know because it's a a lot of people feel that's very important to do so we did that and and uh you know it was a it was a a pretty successful thing but i think adam will recall this back in those days you know it wasn't that easy to install the client software and get it to work and everyone have different versions of different operating systems and uh it was computers were very slow for processing that you know all this and um you know we were using modems and all that back in those it was not uh easy it wasn't easy for us to uh make it a seamless uh you know experience on your smartphone or something it was uh it was really something you had to want to do so it was kind of hard to compete with credit cards and all that when you know as as the internet it just you know accelerated but we did license and build for different banks uh also their own system so the largest bank in europe at that time was deutsche bank and i went over there and i talked to their board and they were all excited about it and they decided to back us and you know people say digicash failed well it's not really true it was taken down because they were willing to invest you know quite a lot more money in it and and the the people who got control of the company didn't want that they wanted to kill it so it was a sad thing but the but deutsche bank was a very tough customer you know if you can imagine a german bank you know the biggest bank in europe they had their data center was in an old bunker with several stories underground and they wanted every kind of backup and you know recovery and everything so we had to build all this stuff for them we satisfied them but i think it's quite an achievement so it was a very industrial thing strength ecash banking system if you will uh that attached to their you know what are called current accounts for their uh you know a regular consumer bank accounts and uh and there were shops that were accepting and in those days of course it was before the euro right it was deutsche marks and so you could you could use deutsche bank issued deutsche marks and buy things online with uh and so we made all that for them was all deutsche bank branded and then we had mark twain bank in the u.s which uh offered u.s dollars and say they were an international currency bank so they had some other they could do various conversions so that was great and then we had advanced banking in australia which i think was like the number two or three bank at that time now it's been merged in uh they were issuing in australian dollars and we had bunches of people wanting to use it and you're starting to use it in various countries and i mean i think my congressional testimony in the u.s is you know maybe noteworthy but i also spoke to a bunch of other governments and visited many central banks around the world and uh you know i told people at that time what i really told them was you know if your country would take the initiative and issue its money in ecash you could be the electronic commerce leader of of the world this would be a tremendous economic opportunity for your country and that's what i was pitching when i had that opera a chance to uh just to speak to those because i was invited to a lot of central banks and you know visa international and citibank and all these i was sitting there in the board rooms and meeting the executives that come to visit me and you know all this stuff so i mean there was a lot of interest in what we were doing uh i have boxes of press clippings from those days because when i issued when i announced the you know i did the first e-cash payment the first world wide web conference from cern to uh amsterdam and that's when and and and then more a little press release and this guy sent it out uh from the company and it was the new york times picked it up it was it was all over the global media in about 48 hours and there was so much interest in the idea that a number itself could be worth money you know that i was interviewed in all kinds of languages i don't even know what languages i have all like a whole archive of videotapes all you know those big old video types of of tv shows where i was interviewed and there was so much interest in it yeah and let's just look under the hood and talk a little bit about ecash um so i know i believe that blind signatures were one of the breakthroughs yeah so can you just explain that sure yeah absolutely so i mean there's you know uh there are many kinds of digital signatures digital signature is a pretty general uh term these days in its usage but uh we have one type is blind signatures and i invented them especially for payments and ecash now actually i was hoping that they would be used in a whole range of other applications to do with what i call credential mechanisms and i wrote this paper that appeared in you know was mentioned on the cover of scientific american it was also on the cover of the best journal of computer science cacm at that time you can see it on my website there's another one of the little project uh things there at charm.com but you know i created a whole a concept for how you could use the mixing to have perfect uh privacy and who you talk to and ecash to make your payments and then the digital s the blind signatures could be used to basically prove things about you without revealing who you are and so like you know classics they have a kid's at a bar and they want to or somewhere they want to get in they would say to prove that they have a they're old enough or there's they have a driving license or they're from a different state or whatever but they don't want to give their address and all this other stuff well that that's what you could do with the credential mechanism you could prove exactly that you qualified according to whatever you know to one way but you wouldn't have to reveal which way that was you would just reveal the exact one bit that you were qualified you give a signature that would prove that irrefutably and that was so that i found a way to basically turn the databases that companies would have about you inside out so that now you maintained your own information about yourself and whenever they would normally ask their own database a query they would ask have to ask you and you would prove the answer was correct you give the answer and prove it was great if you wanted to answer it so that was a whole comprehensive thing so blind signatures went a little bit beyond so i was hoping the kneecaps would be like a trojan horse you know people would start using it for payments and they'd start to say hey wait a minute i don't have to reveal my identity to make payments that's pretty but if i want to i can prove that that shop got my money so that's pretty cool maybe i could use that to check out library books or you know maybe for these other things and then it would the credential mechanism would kind of grow organically and that's why i went to a lot of effort to publish it in these mainstream publications to try to really distill it and work with artists to you know get the concepts across and and all that but so the idea of a blind signature is very very simple in those days we had carbon paper i don't know if people these days know what carbon paper is what it is yeah we have carbon-less garden paper i guess you know about that it copies through so basically the uh the easy way to understand the cash that's very close to the reality of it the blind signature is that let's just say i make i take a piece of paper and i write a random serial number on it that only i know and i put an envelope with some carbon paper inside or carbonless lining or whatever i give it to my bank and they and say here's me you know take the money out of my checking account and validate this with your special worth one dollar stamp or it's like a signature that they can make but on the outside of the envelope they get they return the envelope to me then i can remove the envelope now i have my own random serial number with their the carbon image of their unforgeable worth a dollar stamp on it so now i have this dollar but no one knows the serial number and so i uh i'm sure i have the money and so when i go and i you know no one can take it away from me they can't you know screw with my account or anything so then i take it to a shop and they say that looks nice you know but we got to check that you haven't spent that serial number before so they check with the bank that's the so-called you know what i call the double spending uh problem in those days and you hear a lot about it these days right a minute so the the bank would then say oh yeah that's our signature but we haven't and we haven't accepted that number before and so we will honor this and put the money on the shops account but of course we have no idea who the payer is however you know the user is very well protected so i didn't mention this but that serial number it's actually the result of applying a hash function so you if the bank says oh we already saw that number you know it's not valid then then this the retail the shop would say oh that's interesting can you please show me the number that when you hash it gives you that serial number and of course they wouldn't be able to do it so only once they sign and say okay we'll accept it then i give that hash pre-image and then they can then they know and then and so that's it's totally secured in that way but it's there's a so but the privacy is let's say asymmetric and and i i was very happy with this on in those days it really worked well uh you know that we have there's something called the bank for international settlements which is the central bankers uh central bank you know they were i visited and then i spoke there you know it's a whole thing and they promulgated they said they have a publication those days called you know definition of criminal use of payments and they listed them and they were you know very strident about it all it was basically extortion black markets and bribery and so it turns out in any of those scenarios as the if you used ecash instead of a suitcase full of 20 bills right but if you used ecash that no criminals would accept it because since you knew the serial number that you created you could always kind of tell the bank or the government or something look out these guys are going to be spending that or you know so no ex no no blackmailer would take payment by check or you know no black markets can accept fed wire or you know these things so it was a way to protect the privacy of the individual and we said unconditionally because the blinding and the blind signature is not just cryptography it's it's what we call uh information theoretic statistical security there it with unlimited computing power quantitative whatever you cannot learn anything about what's blinded in there it's so it's uh uh unconditionally uh protects you as a consumer your privacy was uh and the protection of your money that you held was perfect but on the other hand it wasn't really a suitable currency for you know paying bribes to politicians and things like that so i felt it was a really superior form of money and in fact if we could get rid of paper money and switch to this we could get rid of a lot of uh corruption and problems which are you know let's also briefly just go over what happened with digicash he did talk about that a little bit um you know it had offers of investment from places like ing investment um there was even a plan i think for ing bearings and goldman sachs to bring digicash to the stock market and bill gates expressed interest in integrating it with windows 95 netscape expressed interest visa wanted to invest 40 million dollars and none of these potential deals happened and in subsequent reporting i guess some sources say that you wanted too much control and employees also felt you were too paranoid or greedy or stubborn and that's why these deals fell through yeah that's our great what's your yeah what's your name i'm doing this to make the world a better place and that's why i put my life on the line and that's what i've been working on all along and uh you know i think it's really true that the powers that be wanted to kind of you know stop this from being what it could have been and i really but when you say that do you mean like do you mean microsoft and visa and netscape or what do you mean by what the powers that be because they were interested in in you know using this and integrating it with their businesses or investing in it well i mean what about like policymakers regulators things like that uh i presume but they i don't think they were the ones who stopped these deals were they well i think it's it's a you know one thing i'd like to say is that it's a it's a testament to the significance of the ideas that i developed and that there was so much interest and we had very serious conversations with a number of these organizations it's true um and you know we were represented by investment banks and you know and so forth and so on but if i if there was ever a scenario in which i felt that the potential of this was going to be uh taken forward and used to to really plant that seed of privacy that i'd hoped for i'd uh you know that was the last thing in the world i'd want to do would be to stop that so um yeah when you start to really see the you know we're invited into the corridors of uh massive power it's quite an eye-opening experience and uh you know i i was at the uh invited to i spoke at a conference of central banks in in milan and um i mean in rome and um uh they told me that you know i mean that wasn't the airport was clogged up we said it was like the private planes i mean they closed off avenues and we walked uh across a bunch of streets police blocked it all off walked right in the vatican you know it was only for us i mean they said noah's non-central banker had ever been even allowed to attend any other meetings and i had me speak to i mean people recognize the significance of what this was but i i'm not sure that anyone was really interested in the uh disruptive uh power of it um yeah and uh and that you know and it's not like i had a monopoly on this as adam mentioned there were other kinds of blindable signatures that were contorted in a way that they they didn't really fall under our uh control so i think that i mean this is you know i don't want to get too uh broader perspective to answer your specific question but what i would say is that the i mean it's just a little bit more generally you know if we want cryptography to rise to its potential to make the world a better place for people then probably we need to do that in a way that is a more of a works in a more comprehensive manner and is not more or less a guerrilla action on the side and that's kind of uh what i've been really trying to do and that that puts the burden on on us to figure out how you could really use this uh in a way that you know would address legitimate issues of society and at the same time you know liberate people and human potential you know this is the thing that will take civilization to the next level yeah it's interesting because that description of the guerrilla action on the side is almost a description of bitcoin um but anyways no not at all i wouldn't say that no no i'm i'm a huge fan of bitcoin i think bitcoin changed the whole landscape well yeah i would say ecash is bitcoin zero bitcoin one is bitcoin made a lot of people rich no question and bitcoin too that's that's coming you know and maybe it'll it it needs to be a little more hard to take down and a little more a bit a little bit real privacy and uh maybe integrated with some other features yeah we're so just to give people a sense of the timeline so you left digit cash in 1996 uh digit cash went bankrupt in 1998 and meanwhile right in the middle there in 1997 adam sent an email to the cypherpunk mailing list about hashcash so david do you want to dispute the what i just said there i'm sorry i i i laura i just thought it was timeline right such a pleasure of speaking with you but i'm not sure i feel like i'm being cross-examined that you know a lot of what you said has been said none of it's exactly accurate and what you said is not exactly accurate i don't want to be put a position to criticize any of this but i mean i mean if if i don't have the facts i didn't leave did you cash in 96. you didn't okay no in 94. i don't know what you're referring to i mean the hashcash was just something that adam developed as you know for to protect against spam by using computational cost and this was something that was already you know remember i mentioned the cryptography conferences that i created so years before adam's mention of that it was already you know published by dwark and uh no or at the conference proof of work of work for preventing spam so yeah it was already you know i was so i mean what do you mean the adam wrote a letter to what i already know years earlier i was there when cynthia presented you know moaning or was my co-author on the the offline e cash uh article right so just so just for listeners cynthia twerk and moni noir pro wrote the uh proposed proof of work much earlier than adam uh wrote the hashtag proposed hashtag to the cyberpunk mailing list they presented it at the the flagship conference i believe they presented it in 1993. i was there i'm that's all and to show that all of these things were happening right around the same time that's all so that's fine you know it's really true without the proof of work you know let me say this i uh there were a lot of people you know a lot of cypherpunks that i invited to visit us and work for us at ecast it was a very open company we had a research component so i had a lot of interaction with people like us zuku you know was uh there for quite a while i worked with him yeah to on uh you know try to help him develop his own competing systems while he was there in my under my employ on my nickel and uh i mean later zuku wrote he wanted to come to crypto he had no money i said sure i'll pay for you to come yeah and you know and i picked him up at the airport or whatever it was you know help him out i mean you know and then and nick was there yeah so adam in 1997 you sent an email to the cypherpunk mailing list proposing hashcash what problem were you trying to solve and how did hashcash do that uh yeah so i was running uh remailer so a way to send an anonymous email and communicate on username discussion groups with anonymity and as i mentioned earlier the the technology for these things was basically operated by volunteers so the problem or one of the problems as an operator of these things it wasn't that expensive to operate in terms of bandwidth and server resources but it seemed that some people didn't like free speech or you know ability to communicate privately or anonymously and had taken it upon themselves to spam through 3d systems and it it wasn't even commercial spam this is you know random numbers just just trying to be disruptive and we think because it was happening to multiple remailers so probably about 30 to 50 of them at various times that uh that the people doing this were trying to annoy system administrators who operated using their servers so the users distributed discussion groups and they use a lot of bandwidth uh like a university site or a big isp use enormous amounts of bandwidth and so you know it would start to annoy the system administrators if people were spamming through the remailers the reaction would be maybe to block roommates or something like that and i think that was what they were trying to achieve so it occurred to me that um it would be good if there was a way to combat this spam problem and because it was involved in privacy i had to think about it in a different way because the usual anti-spam technique the system investors can i just interrupt you i've heard you give the same presentation before but i'm just wondering i mean but dwork and nora had already published proof of work as a as an anti-spam mechanism sure so it was this was at the premier conference everyone in the field knew about it it was in published in the springer lecture notes and it was in every library computer science library in the world practically it's very widely disseminated so why did you have to think so deeply about it well i wasn't there's two two things here right one is okay but i have one other question for you i'm sorry i don't mean it i know you've made some look i value what you're doing and i know it's tough to operate a remailer in those days were there also mix masters were those running in those days and yeah the real deal that was right so because you put yourself in a very difficult position knowing the linkings right but if you had cooperated with others in a more open system using the mixing technology you would have been uh maybe there were two generations marie miller so how cool you wrote the first one which was just a kind of nested onion but because it didn't standardize the message sizes you could say that a globally you know that that wasn't very good for uh passive traffic analysis if you if you like yeah i see i guess the second generation was mixed master so i was running actually it's backwards compatible but i was running a mixed master email for a few years oh great and yeah and i mean so in terms of hashcash i was not aware of dwark's paper until somebody sent me a link to the publication a couple of months after i'd posted the source code for oshkosh and so some years later i got around to kind of writing a paper about the experiences of people using hashcash for various things and in there i cited a number of things obviously dwark's paper as i was aware at that point but also there were some other related things i think in in a way of thinking the sort of very invention of public key cryptography with merkel puzzles is is a kind of proof of i mean it's not exactly proof of work but it's really it's a very interesting competition yeah you know if you look around there's a lot of linkages and reinventions in this space you know so there have been other things where uh people have published something like there were for example client puzzles which was another kind of hash based uh proof of work by uh arie jules and brainard probably also in one of the cryptography papers and they were not aware of hashcash for example right so the original walk in the oil was using asymmetric techniques there's a lot of reinvention of course i didn't publish it in academic paper and i so i just published on a website so you know fair enough they wouldn't have been aware of it but just to say that there's a lot of kind of reinvention and in my experience the um building things in an applied way sometimes brings together new ideas right so yeah you can have an idea of inventory right exactly right so there was a kind of general uh thrust of it so i have you know done general publications and things but more in the uh distributed system space so because it was a kind of applied thing for emails i just put it on a you know like a tech report on a website kind of thing so anyway um okay yeah go ahead finish yeah so i mean the the idea there was to to think about it in a way that could preserve privacy so there are a few features about it that are privacy related so it adds uh it has a timestamp but there's some randomization of the timestamp so that you wouldn't reveal you know from a black box if you're looking at from the outside see the messages are going in you wouldn't reveal who's likely sender by looking at the timestamp so had some features like that so then just the idea is to as the same as the walks in in the kind of concept level which is to to create cost right that's the basic observation right the the problem with commercial bulk spam is that it costs effectively zero but i think the advantage of that kind of system is that it doesn't you know it's not as attractive because it's not respondable but it's uh it's more scalable it doesn't require any infrastructure really you can just attach it to an email and actually much later in 2004 how finney kind of got a bit closer to assembling these different parts together so he used hashcash as the proof of work and he used the chom blind signature based token server and he assembled it in an ibm tamper-resistant secure processor that he ran so had it kind of had the central point of failure risk but but he introduced mining effectively into the conversation so he was using hashcash say i guess it was a you can find a website online somewhere somebody's archived it so basically you would do some work you would send it to this ibm processor that was running in its server and it would send you back a charm token and because of the kind of trustworthy computing aspect of this card if you assumed that that he wasn't including with ibm which would be a you know a big stretch to say that they you know they designed this card he colluded with him right so it's it's a it's a serious piece of hardware that banks by and it can provide a kind of signature of execution so you get you know you can verify what code it's running with reasonable security not not as much as a bitcoin network because that's you know anybody can fully verify and you don't depend on this kind of you know trusted hardware uh sequence but nevertheless it's kind of interesting assemblage of parts so you could call that kind of bitcoin 0.5 if you like in the uh you know the bitcoin zero without the proof of work well he's got proof of work in there and he's bridging the technologies right so it's it's centralized it's got the strong privacy because you get in exchange for your work the tron token and the scarcity is there so it's introducing digital scarcity and i think that how funny and exactly a few people were more interested in monetary reforms so you know return to a gold standard or re-establishing something like that so people were looking at the electronic cash uh problem from different directions you know some from monetary reform perspectives some from a privacy perspective a little bit more on the kind of privacy bearer cash perspective i would have been okay with you know dollars or any reasonably stable currency but then bitcoin you know if you scroll forward to bitcoin it you know it loses some of the privacy but it does plus or minus what how finney's he called it our power reasonable proof of work so it basically does that but in a distributed setting and the privacy it loses is is a side effect i think you know most people who were involved would like to establish a way to to bring it back but it's more technically challenging to do that as david would have a lot of experience in protocol design around to to do that in a way you know you end up with big as their knowledge proves some more cryptographic assumptions so bitcoin is using actually quite basic cryptographic assumptions so it doesn't really do anything advanced with zero-knowledge proofs and things like that and so for both of you when did you hear about bitcoin and how and what were your initial thoughts so do you want to go david well you know i'd rather not comment on that exactly uh i don't think i've done so publicly can i we just go back before we ask answer that often asked question because i think it's very interesting conversation uh about you know these early days and you know one of the things that's colored my thinking adam on this and i'm curious on your thoughts on this but was really you know in the in the mid 90s the as i think you've pointed out the computing power and the network connections and all this you know it wasn't really up to doing a lot of stuff and the idea that you know you'd have all these servers running all around the world you know supporting payments i think it was somewhat inconceivable to us we were we were happy that we could get this client side you know to just make a payment in a couple minutes do any cash payment and that we could get the servers to be able to handle their side of it uh so instead of having you know replicating that server so to speak many times but what we did consider and i think it's not i don't believe it's ever been discussed publicly but several of us in the digicash company uh were working on a more distributed version of ecash that was not you know or somewhere in between so it was uh i mean you can think it's very easy to uh imagine distributing ecash in a simple-minded way right where you say well we've got you know 10 servers now and if a majority of them agree that it has you know they all sign and then they all uh check the double spending and if a majority say it's okay then it's okay you know if you were to combine that with you know what i published as my dissertation at berkeley right which was a blockchain everything about blockchain except for the proof of work part right uh then you you know because that was a majority rule network right so that's kind of what we were thinking of as a as a step to distribute this uh process because it wasn't really the resource to just uh i don't think uh you know at that point so that would be that would have been something that would have been uh achievable to make them somewhat more decentralized you know more in the uh classic bft kind of uh model right um yeah i mean i think i never really talk about it we didn't that's our it's on us i guess oh yeah so we um i think greg maxwell had a look at doing that as well uh so just just to kind of make a threshold you know like k of n yeah yeah signers and you you can see in a straightforward way that that work i mean that should that should work you know if you can do a single single blind signature you can make k of n inefficiently maybe more efficiently with some more thought and i think state chains which is another kind of bitcoin layer 2 is contemplating doing the same thing the the i think greg had some source code but hadn't published it for the kind of threshold blind signature approach but i think the the challenge and the block stream actually has a kind of federated blockchain which is also kfn so it kind of fits into our thinking for a layer 2 security but the the advantage for bitcoin itself in the layer one is it's a kind of uh we we published a paper on side chains and and coined the word dynamic membership signature because you could think of the proof of work as sort of evolving and signing in some way with the work the you know the the most work the longest chain with the most work signing off the majority of the work signing off and you know each signature or each edition of a proof of work you can have a freshly anonymous participant so i think bitcoin stumbled across i mean nobody knows who satoshi is or how he hit upon this idea you know whether he came at it from the byzantine generals uh fixed membership uh bft protocols or he started you know straight from anonymous proof of work but it it doesn't have the membership challenge and something with a membership is no that was the that's that's the big breakthrough of exactly of bitcoin and thank god that it happened and it's a fantastic you know it's changed the world in a dramatic way and so yeah so let's let's talk about bitcoin because we're well over time and we're running out so um yeah just how did you learn about bitcoin when was that and what were your initial thoughts uh so i learned about it in i think it was like august 2008 i got an email from satoshi nakamoto with you know the abstract and asking for the correct citation for hashcash and i sent him a couple of other papers to look at one of them being b money and i looked at it in more detail actually well when how finney started posting his experiences running it and you know understanding how it works so he posted some longer commentary on i think the cryptography mailing list or the cypherpunk's mailing list you know i suppose for somebody who's you know spent much of his professional career working on applied cryptography you know like libraries and private enhanced technologies and things the thing that will strike you initially until you've become accustomed to it is well that's that hasn't got very strong privacy assurances at least compared to the previous systems and that the security margin on a double spending is kind of 50 50 right so you're you're sort of trusting that the economic majority is honest to some extent not not in all it depends on the aspects of the system you're protecting and so you know coming from the normal cryptographic kind of asymmetric crypto you typically have an enormous benefit as a defender versus the attacker you know you're going to do some computation that takes a fraction of a second the attacker is going to sit there for you know thousands of years with using an enormous amount of compute and probably going to fail to decrypt your message so you're used to this kind of enormous asymmetry bitcoin is like well it's you know it's the good guys best of the bad guys it's the fair fight kind of thing right so it takes you a while to get to get over there but you know then you reflect on it you say well you know on the other hand it has proposed a novel news solution to the kind of dynamic membership design generals like problem space and as i mentioned somebody who'd read leslie lamport's paper while i was doing my computer science phd so something interesting and new in that space and it's here it's bootstrapped you know after a while it had a value and so forth when there were exchanges i guess over a year in before there was a price at all right this is people playing with it start with the bootstrap story is kind of interesting but you know the fact that it's deployed and it's decentralized so there's no really identifiable nexus of you know a company or an individual that you would ask to switch off a server or you know block something so i think it's an interesting trade-off right because with the digit cache and related blind signature based protocols you've got a very strong assurance that you can't selectively block transactions and the only thing that a party operating it could do is shut down right they could say well i refuse i mean i can't block anything selectively so what do you want me to do right they're all indistinguishable to me assuming that the sender wants privacy whereas bitcoin is not not so much in that vein it's more than you know people are transacting their sort of pseudonymity like the coins are kind of pseudonymous there's no kind of wallet identifier tracking at all it's gonna imperfect but there's a de facto fungibility in privacy and an assumption that there's an economic incentive that sooner or later some minor somewhere will process your transaction even if the first one chooses not to for policy reasons and it's like plus or minus hold up it's a bit of a gray area you know there are companies that specialize in tracking coins have been stolen so those ones are kind of a bit gray but you know some of them move once in a while in small numbers and there are mixes in the network doing kind of coin mixes or coin joins and things like that so it's an interesting system in which to try and deploy privacy improvements so you know the lightning network which is another layer 2 has some mix like onion routing technology and the layer 1 coin joins and liquid which is a layer 2 that my company block stream is working on has confidential transactions so a different kind of privacy not sort of linkability privacy but privacy of the amount of value being transferred and david what about you just briefly we're gonna move on to some other questions in a moment like i said uh you know i was pretty familiar with all the different aspects of it so uh i don't really uh comment on that but uh what i what i could say would i like to say i think is that i mean to adam's point yeah the you know i think they're now the technology is out there both on the bad guy side because of the quantum computers and all this possibly percolating and then um you know some of the new stuff that has been done to speed up mixing by pre-computation very dramatically and to make real quantum secure bft uh you know those things uh can come together and create something that has all the the the real goodness it's much much more definitive a far higher uh barrier against being taken down and even by national adversary and the privacy then you get the full anonymity sets uh and you know you might have also privacy in the messaging who talks to who that's uh that's a great thing so i think there's a whole there's another shoe to drop in this space and that but you know i'm the i'd i would never want to be thought of as someone diminishing uh the significance of bitcoin i mean to me that is like this game-changing uh world-changing thing and it's uh as you know technologically it's kind of a complex beast but and i think it's showing its point in the way to you know different things that we could try to improve and i i i appreciate the way you're you're tackling it adam that's like uh you know trying to add things onto it to make it better and i think that that's that's promising and but one could also you know take it all to the next level and that's something that uh i think is also i you know laura your viewers should you know keep their eyes open for something uh really dramatically uh different you know i think there's another there's there's room there to really take it to the next level so yeah so bitcoin has gone from a value of nothing basically to currently having a market cap of over 200 billion dollars and meanwhile we have this pandemic going on which is causing this economic freeze that has led to governments printing more money and there's all kinds of other factors going on like china launching its own digital currency and these other central banks you know eyeing the same idea so when you look at these different forces where do you think bitcoin is headed next to the stratosphere as adam did you recently say three hundred thousand dollars uh yeah i mean actually there's been some recent discussion on a different track which is this uh stock to flow model which is a kind of um just a curve fit on previous year's price movement but actually the 300 000 comment was before which was just um you know you've got you can't make predictions about these things but just looking at the use case and the similarity with digital gold so i was just looking at well you know go look up the metrics well how much gold is there in the world and people are not exactly sure how much physical gold there is in the world but they have a rough idea and you know so what's the market cap of gold and divide that by the eventual supply of bitcoin and you come out with a number that's like 300 to 500 000 per coin but then that depends on the gold price which is also the moving target and of course with all this pandemic economic uncertainty gold is typically a kind of macro hedge so your price is up surprise surprise but uh you know bitcoin price is up two and i have to suppose that while a lot of people have heard about bitcoin there's probably you know many people who haven't taken the plunge bitcoin has differences to gold you know you can send it at a distance you can verify it a little a lot of sort of more transactional value a utility value i guess um so we'll see i mean i think it's it's certainly a very interesting experience to you know send some bitcoin i think you know in our company we sent uh a bitcoin transaction i don't know like 100 000 or something involves multiple people you know decrypting and signing different things and you end up with a small blob of text and you're like wow this is you know a hundred thousand dollars of bearer money it's just a amazing phenomena right to contemplate as somebody from a computer science background that's really a a very interesting artifact from the world so as technologists we're very enamored by you know the potential of this building block i think um and what it what it can do for society to have you know kind of dependable electronic money from a monetary reform perspective and of course it seems that the economic commentators are saying that even though there's been a lot of money printing it hasn't translated into much price inflation yet obviously there's you know there's more money in the system but the economic downturn is suppressed price inflation people are not spending money and so the suppliers are having to you know coax people to buy things by reducing prices to what they would do in a robust economic situation if you printed this quantity of money so we don't know if and when that will take effect i think the experience in japan has shown that countries can have you know low inflation rates for a very long period of time so you know some people are looking at the us for example as a major economic factor in the world which say that might be in the future but i think more recently the us has even said that it has a an economic it's considering an economic policy of creating or targeting the creation of price inflation so i don't know it's uh we live in interesting times i guess is the thing we can say there yeah and just for listeners who don't know i have mentioned this before on the show but stock to flow is this ratio of the existing supply versus the new supply so for instance with bitcoin um you know it's relatively small but actually it's still greater than the ratio for gold um but after the next happening it will actually drop below that of gold um however one interesting thing is that somebody um took that and applied it to the price of gold over the course of history and there was not a correlation so then they felt that that disproved the stock to flow theory so we will see how this bears out um you know i'm not sure uh whether or not that will apply to bitcoin um but david what about you where do you think this is all headed well i i i i'm extremely optimistic about the you know the future i mean all the trends that you mentioned laura seemed to indicate that uh you know i mean if you're afraid to go places in person you want something you can transact with uh online and you know these there's a ton of uh of uh crazy stuff going on with governments uh you know uh these days so i i i it it must all be pointing in a very positive direction but we're not seeing it right now that dramatically because you know as as was said we're not people aren't really spending that much so i think it's yeah this this bodes extremely well for the whole space bitcoin uh especially and um yeah so i it's this is uh i mean it's a you know it's sad to have to i mean i'd rather not think that something that i care about like bitcoin is is gonna benefit from you know all these bad things that are happening to the planet but uh in fact yeah i think it it it seems like it will really uh uh yeah this all should be very positive for it but uh yeah i'm also i'm rooting for the planet though too you know yes and for humanity so we can all go out and hang out yeah yeah yeah well at ethereal next next time yeah yeah okay well this has been so fun chatting and um i really enjoyed learning about your early work in digital currencies pre bitcoin that was very fun where can people learn more about each of you and your work well i would like to suggest people also could look at the xx network you know we we're live in beta and we've got a lot of good stuff uh running and it's a look at the white papers it's that's really solid stuff i'm extremely uh it's best stuff out there by far i think i'm very extremely enthusiastic about it and we've got a lot of good backing so please yeah have a look at that and uh but if you're wondering about the historical stuff look at charm.com and look at the cash museum and the different other things multi-party computation we didn't get a chance to talk about that's another interesting uh vector on all this like kind of generalizing the smart contracts and and the icr and the history of it if you're interested in all that so this it's all up there and uh i guess the one aspect that i would like to also draw attention to is you know this kind of cryptographic technology can also be used in elections and voting and online voting and so on and that is a very much related to you know to to payments and uh and messaging and i think this is a an area where i'd like to see a lot more uh i think there's a lot of potential there and so i've been pushing working on that for for a long time and you can read about some of the stuff up on my site uh that i've been doing on that so we're we're making great strides in that actually uh there will be some new work coming out very soon so uh yeah trom.com and xx network xx network is the url yeah all right and adam so i have a personal webpage on cypherspace.org c-y-p-h-e-rspace.org which has for example pictures of the t-shirt that you mentioned and various cryptographic libraries and things i've implemented over the years and on twitter i'm adam 3us and blockstream which is the company i co-founded some years ago now is blockstream.com i think you know we were talking about the um dwark proof of work in hashcash so i think that's been something that's uh there's been discussions about various times and so one kind of question i turn my mind to as well you know is there you know why are people using hashcash for the proof of work and not other proofs of work right so you know there's the client puzzles that jules and brainard produced there's the original proof of work by uh dwark and eor oh i see so the mecca the hash cash mechanism itself is the one that's prevailed yes well i think there's a specific reason in hindsight so at the time i did it it wasn't used for that purpose it was just used for one one use stamps but the the result is that you get a compact proof of work because it's fixed size whereas the dwark and the oils were like broken asymmetric signatures so signatures were low key sizes so that you could brute force them and create forgeries and things like that so there's three variants and two of the variants have progress so you need like a poisson process for fairness like a level playing field in crypto mining the third one which is based on in in dwark and neor is based on uh these square roots in large prime fields and there's an algorithm in there called tinnelli shanks which has some randomness but it's not clear if that's sufficient to have a level playing field because there may be other slightly less optimal square root algorithms that the single fastest computer can tend to win and that will be a problem again and then the other side effect is that those systems have they're not as easy to scale in terms of the difficulty so with hashcash the the stamp was you know compute a million tries so you know uh 20 binary digits of zero at the front but these days it's enormous right it's 70 80 leading zeroes and so if you scale some of those kind of broken signature based schemes you end up having to increase the prime size or the feature transform size and you get an enormous proof so the proof of work might itself be bigger than the block of transactions you're trying to prove about plus the fact that they're not poisson is like a stumbling block if you certainly mean so anyway that's what like in hindsight so it's a good cure it's like a curiosity right so well you know given that there were these parallel different variants and and the the other one by jules and braynard is actually interactive so it's not you know it's a proof with respect to the server so that's not amenable to uh you know independent verification let's say to the audit function so anyway i'm really glad we had a chance to speak about it thanks that's so interesting yeah and so you i'm i'm now i'm glad to hear that the proportion you took is really really uh turns out to be the superior one and uh congratulations on that that's excellent i'm gonna mention that going forward i was unclear i was looking forward to this chance you know we've met before but i've never i wanted to ask you about this because i thought it was going to come up yeah i mean it's um i think it's also you know very simple so simple things win so when i was designing it i was thinking about you know should i introduce floating point to make it harder to make an asic you know sorry i was thinking about spanners are very determined economically they'll make asics so should i make it complicated should i involve memory i looked at it afterwards i was like you know what i think simple is better so so if i kept it to you know a standard sha-1 function at the time so you'd be able to verify it even with a shell script using the sha-1 function right so so anyway simple wins and it and it happened to have the poisson function which i was actually determinedly trying to eradicate because it was a nuisance for spam purposes but turned out to be an advantage for uh distributed fairness or something like that all right well i you know i'm not going to even try to pretend to translate all that for my listeners but hopefully the more technical ones will have understood and um at least now we have an understanding of why your proof of work was perhaps more widely used than the original version um okay well this has been so fun chatting with you both thank
