me a quick note before starting my twitter followers might have seen that this episode was initially supposed to be a conversation between arthur and willie wu however willie's sick so even though this is what i think of as a topic episode which is usually conversation between two people on various topics we are going to do it with a single guest but for those of you who are familiar with arthur's blog i'm sure you're quite well aware that he is expert enough to handle all this alone so arthur this has been one of the most tumultuous times in crypto history not only are the crypto markets just a shade above their all-time highs at the top of the 2017-28 bubble but we've also seen multiple spectacular implosions and bankruptcies tara luna three euros capital celsius and voyager meanwhile amidst historic inflation some say bitcoin has failed to act as the inflation hedge who has touted me and on top of all that we're heading into ethereum's merge quite possibly the most anticipated upgrade to a blockchain ever you have been in the space for a very long time as far as i can tell at least as early as 2014 if not earlier so i was just kind of curious for your overall thoughts on this kind of crazy moment in crypto years from now how will we look back on this time i think that this is no crazier than the belt gox failure in 2014 in february uh no crazier than you know ethereum and bitcoin ico implosion in early 2018 you know it's this is new technology we're reconfiguring how humans want to do finance over the internet it's extremely speculative it's extremely religious and exciting and there's haters and there's people who love it there's all this emotion then you make money with it and so i think this these events over the last you know six months let's call it 2022 i would say are par for the course for crypto all right so let's just start talking with them about the merge because this is what everyone's been talking about in general i find your trajectory around ethereum quite interesting because you used to think ethereum was worthless so let's just start at that time what was your thinking about ethereum initially so initially when the for the pre-sale happened 2014 or 2015 whatever it was um it was probably the first major you know ico of this ecosystem and i didn't really see value in going out to the market and saying hey give me a bunch of money and i'm not going to fix the price or the supply of what i'm offering and so it's almost like if we take 100 million dollars we take 10 million dollars you as the person who's putting in this money aren't really to me it didn't seem like you're getting anything beneficial so i'm like well why would i want to invest in something like that where's the scarcity how do i how do i know that i'm actually like committing my spares my scarce capital today and i'm going to be better off than somebody who comes in six months from now and i didn't see that and i wrote about it and i said you know this is a complete dog i'm not investing in this uh man of course i was wrong which is fine that's the name of the game um when you're talking about financial markets you're wrong more than you're right you just hope that you bet on the things that you're right on more than the things that you're wrong on so fake plated short ethereum that would have been not such a good idea but yeah i missed it uh i missed the pre-sale which is fine you know you can't can't beat everything and subsequently i think i wrote a piece called two-digit coin um when ether was around five or six hundred bucks remember that was in 2018 i got that one right it went down to below 100 for for a period of time and then as sort of the d5 ecosystem started to have some some green shoots you know after the march 2020 meltdown uh there is somebody posted on twitter or i sent an email out or remember where it was and there's a chart it showed the complete value of all dapps built on ethereum was greater than the value of ethereum so one of two things has to be true either all these these dapps which were down you know 95 from the highs of 2017 are just completely worthless or ethereum is extremely undervalued and i took the road of ethereum is extremely undervalued and so i went along a lot of it um and very good trade covered up a lot of the other bad things that i did with my portfolio over the same period of time but so that's sort of my you know rocky road of ethereum and you know starting in you know early 2020 and then 2021 you really had this explosion of defy and all these new financial primitives people actually starting to use these things you know hundreds of billions of dollars of total value locked and you're starting to see the real value proposition of what ethereum can do and what it's enabled some really smart and innovative engineers and financial technologists to build for this new ecosystem and i've seen you you know talk and write about this about how you feel that defy or total value locked is a proxy for the value of ethereum and i've also seen you talk about how you could value a blockchain or the price of its token by comparing it to the revenues of existing financial services so i was wondering because in the case of ethereum obviously there's more than just d5 so i was curious do you also factor in other things like nfts or dows or like in general how do you think about kind of like other types of activity and their relationship to the price so i'm extremely bullish on the concepts for the technological concept of nfts and i think i've written that it i think allows us to trade human culture now obviously people think some of the human culture that it's currently being traded is extremely vulgar i have a crypto dick but on my uh twitter profile and all sorts of um jpegs that are worth you know hundreds of thousands of dollars and people like what is this why are these people trading these images that i can copy and paste and i don't think they get the point it's the same as you know while you have a look for your watch um a swatch is just fine that's a hundred dollars that you have a hundred thousand dollar watch right it's all the same stuff uh in my opinion and so i think the nft technological construct is going to unlock trillions of dollars of value in the ways in which we interact socially with each other over the internet and we can now trade these things that are representations of communities and culture and whatnot so but again extremely early nfts have kind of gone through like half a market cycle of the first one so obviously most of the stuff is going to go down 99 if not you know completely worthless but that's just how it goes but i do see extreme promise in that but i don't think the nfts are really driving throughput obviously you know open seas um open opencv looks rare and a few other platforms are doing quite well in terms of activity generated but they're not at the same level as the total value of all of the the financial aspect of ethereum and then you haven't really even gone to like the self-serving identity and you know ethereum name service can we replace dns and all these other things which is still extremely early so i think the financial aspect is very easy to understand especially for a former financial market professional i understand trading i understand markets you know you charge the training fee people come on there they exchange assets it's quite easy to understand some of this other more meta stuff i think it's going to take a little bit longer to be recognized as a big value driver for the network okay well i will keep reading your blog post i'm very interested down the line when you come up with a way to figure out how to add that into the value um to see how you do it all right now let's you know talk more directly about the merge one of the premises of your thesis and in general kind of the main thesis behind this ultrasound money meme is that after the merge ethereum's monetary supply could become deflationary however for the last month or so usage on ethereum has actually been down and so actually at current rates of usage eth will still be slightly inflationary after the merge i mean if they if that level is maintained and i was just wondering how you thought about that do you think that most likely usage will increase that this is just sort of a blip or at a macro level it doesn't matter right because if we if we take if we take the bitcoin example the bitcoin inflation rate reduces it doesn't go to deflation after at least it hasn't yet after a habit yet the price still goes up right and now we we expect that every having over a period of many years the price of bitcoin will appreciate whether or not that continues to hold true who knows but it has in the past three or four times and it's happened previously so ethereum doesn't need to go to deflation i mean that that's even better if that happens right in terms of the the pro cyclical nature of the reflectivity of the price and the usage and the price and the usage but even just reducing the inflation rate what is it like 90 and whatever the that number is in terms of the amount of ether that's going to be committed versus the consumption that's happening versus the applications of the blockchain it's still a massive reduction a massive change in the inflation that's what we care about we don't care about the absolute target at the end of however many decades or hundreds of years we care about the change today and what that pertains to the future and so cool okay maybe it's not deflationary it doesn't matter if the inflation rate was at x and now it's uh you know when 0.1 of x that to me still means that uh at the margin you're going to have more demand from people who need to spend money on gas than their supply being admitted naturally through the network and also the merge you know won't really do much to improve scaling issues so that could potentially lead other layer ones to continue to take market share from ethereum do you think that could have a depressive effect on the price of ether is that not something that you're i mean that's just that's just par for the course right everyone knows that doesn't scale whatever that means right um if you're the solana guy well it doesn't scale but then your network goes down i don't know we can talk about when that happened another day but that that's that that meme hasn't changed today or tomorrow yesterday like who cares that's that is what it is but we have a one discrete opportunity we have a proof-of-work blockchain going to proof-of-stake and you have this massive reduction in the amount of ether emitted and no other blockchain has this set up like this and that's why i like this trading opportunity or you know this value play for ether because it's just so idiosyncratic to ether and there's only these one-time events and so who cares if heath doesn't scale unless you're telling me that after the merge no one's going to use unit swap no one's going to use ave no one's going to use open c and that the network uses goes down to zero who cares if solana's advertised tps is higher it was the same advertised tps before the merge the same one after the merge so it doesn't it doesn't matter now let's talk about this the trades that you've been talking about or kind of your you know plan going in which i find it fascinating that you reveal all this publicly but anyway uh in your essay flexiv you walked through the way the futures contracts are currently trading and then what that means about the market believes what that means about the what the market believes about the merge and your conclusion was that the market's confidence in a successful merge is understated walk us through how you reach that conclusion well i say i take myself for example right i i still don't believe it's going to happen i mean obviously i believe in the macro sense that it's going to happen but if you ask me today like is the eth merge 100 gonna happen no i don't know tech's hard i i have faith that these guys can pull it off but as somebody who you know has run a tech company stuff's always late stuff doesn't work and so i'm fully prepared for you know it happens and then oh something up they didn't really anticipate and we could be talking about you know a massive rollback of these changes i literally cannot give you a probability on that happening now obviously people much smarter than me say no no it's fine there's all the testing blah blah blah but if you've been around in this space for as long as i have you get a bit jaded because everyone's always talking about what they're gonna do well do it and show me prove it to me that you did it and then it worked and then i'll believe you and i think that's where we and i think that's where a lot of people are in the ecosystem is like show me that it works and then i'll then i'll be leaving and then i'll be really okay with you know probably going even longer than i thought it was going to weigh into it and so i think that's where you get the hedging from people who have eve it's like okay i have this discreet event i know that it's it'll happen on around this this september-ish time frame and it's either going to work or it's not gonna work so why don't i guess hedge away that you know maybe a few months of that time period see what happens worst case scenario doesn't work okay i've completely hedged myself and so then i can like uncover my hedge once things the dust settles and then reevaluate my my position best case scenario oh boom goes swimmingly just buy back my hedge okay i lost 10 20 but that's better than like being down 50 right so the risk reward for a lot of people who you know can't have 100 confidence in this very technologically um difficult event it makes sense to hedge it and that's why i believe you see the curve on the futures contracts the futures contracts trade below the spot price because there's a lot of pressure from people who are long eve saying i just want to hedge this time period when it's over you know good or bad then i can you know know what to do with with my position so in early august you gave some price predictions for ether based on what the fed did and how successful the merge was can you walk us through what uh how you you know came up with those different scenarios and also talk about how roughly a month later um your projections have changed if at all so yeah i mean i guess at the end of the day there's there's the macro liquidity dollar issue right and i think that's represented by bitcoin because bitcoin is just pure crypto money and it's a the mirror image of the us dollar financial system we want to do something different we think it's better maybe it is maybe it isn't and so it's a reaction to this system and so obviously it's going to be very tied to the liquidity considerations of that so you have essentially the federal reserve holds all the cards they either can turn it on and turn it off in terms of us liquidity and right now it's off right and uh and so the question is are they going to turn it on any and very soon or not so that's a binary outcome we'll know when we know you know powell will get up there and tell us you know we've achieved our targets and we're going to make money easier or not right so that's and then you also have the ethereum merge is either going to happen successfully or it's not so you have you know two outcomes four possible possibilities and so you kind of just have to think through what each one of those represents in terms of your idea of what a price is and then put a handicap probability on on those and so and then you get your expected value if your expected value is larger than the current spot price then you go long and if it's not then you either do nothing or you're short and so want to approach it from that perspective because i can't sit here and say that i'm going to be right on my calls if i've looked through all the calls i've ever made with my portfolio i've been wrong more than i've been right but i just have to bet correctly on the ones that i'm right about so uh you your ultimate call was that by march 31st eighth would have a price of twenty eight hundred dollars can you talk us a little bit through your thinking around why that is i mean that was just i don't have the math in front of me that was just purely 25 probability of each outcome i had an expectation of a price and i had a rationale behind it and then i just plugged in the math and then out came that number okay yeah we'll just link to it in the show notes i mean i i find it fascinating because i think so much of the crypto world just is looking kind of narrowly at what's happening in crypto um you know there are obviously certain players in crypto who have that more macro perspective but i liked how this analysis sort of combined the two one thing that is looking like it's gonna cause a little bit of chaos in ethereum or maybe not i don't know what your opinion is is that the ethereum proof of work chain it looks like will continue you know who knows how kind of robust it will be but i wanted to hear your take on that how will that affect events as they play out around the merge i don't think again this is all predicated on the reason why ethereum is valuable is because people use it right and the majority of people who use ethereum are not very technologically savvy so if i come to you and i said hey there's each proof of work and eve proof of stake which one do you want to use like i don't know what does that even mean i guess when he's ethereum right i just want to like go on my meta mask and like go on unit swap and buy some coins right they don't they're not there's this thing of like what's going on in the the details of like you know how consensus has arrived at and security considerations essentially they don't give a about that it's i just want to do what i was what i want to do i want to use this this new you know ecosystem and it's pretty cool i can just go on my browser and go to metamask and do stuff so to the extent that you know from what i've observed and maybe you can correct even corrected my wrong majority of the service providers or the major adapts in ethereum are all following the proof of stake merge they're not following the proof of work some of the major stable coins like i think tether and usdc have come out and said we're not following the proof of work so you have some of the major assets some of the major services that the average user interacts with are not going to be supporting this other change so where are the users going to come from are they going to like go and configure their metamask so that they can get on the proper chain and find a proper node provider who's like up to date with the proof of work chain and like go through this whole process maybe they're going to try to set up their own node or like just like it just gets really really complicated really really fast and what you get to the conclusion of is they will have no users now they may have a bit of people wanting to trade it like me because it's interesting and you know if it has a value above zero it's just free money but how are you gonna convince the average person who's currently using ethereum why they should be using the you know ethereum proof of work chain um and i think you know you could have a similar sort of analysis of like bitcoin cash and some of these other go back to the forks of like all the different bitcoin forks that happened back when we were talking about the block size debate was that 2017 how many of those have actually done very well in a price performance versus the asset they were supposed to supplant bitcoin from that period onward and the answer is none of them because the users don't care i mean we care because you know we're in this this is what we do for a living and we're there's all these tribes on social media and like people are slinging mud at each other and all that kind of stuff but the person who's using it the person who gives value to these networks couldn't give a about proof of stake or proof of work they just want to use ethereum so if metamask has a theorist proof of stake that's the ethereum that they're using and so how we how will you be trading the proof of work coins that you get if i if i get some proof of work coins um i will try to sell them at a very opportune time maybe that's as soon as they come out maybe it's not i don't know it depends on the the hash rate where they're trading on different exchanges and you know it's it's such an interesting trading opportunity and just making sure that you're all set up and ready to go and you know looking at the derivatives and the spot and you know there's going to be mispricings everywhere assuming that this happens so maybe you're closer to it than i am i don't know if um one of these mining you know consortiums have gotten together to really put forward a credible proof-of-work split that's going to be traded and the blockchain is actually going to work so we can actually send different coins around the different centralized exchanges and obviously the centralized spot of chains are gonna have to support this thing whether or not they have the same appetite to do that today versus back in 2017 i don't know yeah you know i now i think i should have checked the facts on this before because i i thought that there was a centralized exchange that said they would oh yeah it was polo hello they have uh it's but it's it's it's an ice it's an i.e or an iou it's not a if it doesn't happen then your ius is worthless because they actually are going to have this and you lock your ethereum you get to split it into this iu token um but if the iou token if the eighth pow whatever that is whoever launches it never happens then that iu tokens are worthless so you you know great you've had a trading opportunity between now and september the 15th or whatever it is but post that who knows okay one thing that i find fascinating is that kevin joe made so much noise about this because he traded the dao classic or ethereum classic i should call it coins um i think to to his benefit back in the day but i my take is that like that works because it was a surprise and so i was kind of like why why was he signaling what he was going to do but anyway maybe i'm wrong maybe by making noise about it he got more people interested but anyway one other thing that i saw that you wrote about which was fascinating was you talked about how ldo was another way to kind of bet on the merge you talked about how it was like a riskier but still attractive bet and i wanted you to uh to talk a little bit about that like what's your thesis there and why is it riskier but so they're the number one validator people stake their ether into this pool and they stand to benefit that's their only business is doing this right so if the merge doesn't happen or it's corrupted or doesn't work then their business model is complete so whereas ethereum if a theory of merge doesn't work there's the 3m right now works like it works just fine i mean i'm sure some people say it doesn't work just fine but the apps are used people use them the blockchain exists network operates so okay they fit up real bad and doesn't work they can always go back to what they were doing before but that ldo doesn't have a business model other than please give us your eth that we can validate on this new proof-of-stake instance of ethereum that's why it's extremely risky because there is no fallback option if this doesn't work then there's no value there and you've probably heard about how lido is potentially essentializing for sun ethereum after the merge to the point where in effect like let's say let's say there's some huge huge percentage of people that not only stake but want to get liquidity out of their stake tokens and there's this perception that there will be sort of a winner take all liquid sticking provider and many people expect that that will be lido and because lido has on-chain governance but ethereum doesn't some people are worried that lida will effectively be a centralizing force and sort of kind of almost be like having on-chain governance just amongst the ldo token holders so as curious for your thoughts on that like is that something you're worried about or concerned about or not really it's a it's kind of a free market someone can obviously spin up a new value or service charge a lower fee and offer more incentives whatever those are maybe it's governance tokens of their own uh making a creation and spirit trading volume away or so not trading volume but um locked ethereum or mind share whatever so i don't really think maybe there's a period of time where they have a lot of influence but i think the amount of different ways in which people can change the game would to me point to there's going to be competition in this validator space because it is a very lucrative business if you can get it right similar to how we all freaked out about you know one minor having 51 percent of the network you know back back back in the day with some of the chinese miners and you know those fears came they passed you're still here uh so i think maybe that's that's a wall of worry that people will just climb over so you don't think lido will be like 80 of liquid sticking derivatives or anything like that it could but i'm thinking it could what i'm saying is that that situation is not gonna persist forever okay yeah we'll have to see how that plays out that's something that i'm definitely um watching so one other issue is that after the merge the shanghai upgrade which will occur like maybe six months or a year after the merch will begin to allow stakers to withdraw and i wondered how you expect that to affect the price of youth i have no idea i think it's too far in the future to understand what the price implications are and one i don't think really matters for today in terms of what you're gonna do if you're taking a more short-term view on this merge like the price impact over the next you know three to six months all this supply supposedly unlocking in six months like you have to assume that they're actually going to do it on time right which is a big assumption given that you know everything's always delayed um so i six months maybe if they do it i think we'll get across that bridge when we come to it if we have some confidence that that is actually going to happen in that time frame so it seems like you're very bullish on ethereum at least so far i haven't heard you say anything where you're looking at any kind of risk or um or not sorry not that you're not looking at the risk but you don't you don't seem to see that there's like any big risk to ethereum it sort of feels like at least at this moment maybe i just haven't found what it is but it almost feels like you feel like it's the leader and there isn't really anything that will sort of undercut it my my bullishness is predicated on the supply demand and balance there's lots of bad things that are going on that could be bad for the price of ethereum but for the simple fact is under the current usage even though it's down the supply is going to go down by 90 percent of what's emitted therefore if usage continues even at these levels the inflation rate drops a lot therefore the price goes up that's it's as simplistic as a as i want to frame it and that's what gives me confidence because i don't have to care about all this other stuff unless i believe that usage of ethereum is going to go down you know go drop off a cliff go down 95 at the same time the merge is happening and what about for usage that shifts to layer two do you feel that's additive still to ethereum's price or will that take away from it i don't know i'm just i'm just looking at the change from t minus one to t plus one and you tell me that's down you tell me that change is ninety percent okay well i don't care if it's inflationary deflationary that's that's a big change in the structure of the market now obviously all these other things are going to be very pertinent 6 12 18 months down the line right but from from a discrete change today this is massive and it allows me to be a lot more confident in the face of a lot of the negative things like us dollar liquidity you know that calls you know looking more and more like i'm gonna be wrong on the short term on the fed pivoting we'll see uh what the the liquidity situation looks like so absent this this very unique structural change in the supply demand and balance i would not be doing any trades in ethereum over and above just holding the position that i already hold because i would think that the liquidity considerations of the dollar is going to overwhelm all of that okay so we'll we'll talk about that a little bit later but and and in fact i also want to ask you some questions about

spotify or wherever you get your podcasts back to my conversation with arthur so as you mentioned the upcoming merch is being called a triple halving and many people um you know make that comparison between how ethereum will likely go deflationary obviously bitcoin will still be slightly inflationary and i just wondered how you thought this whole narrative around youth becoming deflationary or the ultrasound money meme is going to affect bitcoin's narrative of being digital gold well i think people in my opinion don't understand what ethereum actually is ethereum is not money because money has no use ethereum is used you use it to use to power the applications on this network bitcoin has no use it's just money just like the dollar has no use it's just money and that's why it's a good form of money because its value cannot be conflated with actual utility of other stuff and so because ethereum's goal is to be this decentralized compute or you know this digital existence let's say that the deflation gets so severe that it becomes so expensive that nobody uses it because gas prices are just too high because of the inflation rate well guess what's going to happen they're going to change the inflation rate because it doesn't it contradicts the goal of ethereum being a decentralized computer that people can actually use the average person can actually use and i go back to what happened in 2016 with the dao incident where you you know they've had this emphasis dao and the code wasn't properly written or properly written however you want to characterize that and they did a rollback to you know protect some of the value of people now that's not money when you do something like that that means that your priority is not being sell money your priority is allowing the average person to use this network and to feel some sense of security and that's completely fine because it didn't advertise ethereum as being the digital gold of the internet that's bitcoin and so i think people are sort of conflating the two yes right now because of this you know monetary issuance issue and how it's changing with the merge issues deflationary people using it to buy gas usage and this whole reflexive process but if that gets too too aggressive if the price goes too high then it actually is detrimental in my view to everyday person being able to use ethereum and the applications built on top of it oh interesting wait just the price of ethereum and not gas prices you're you're literally just talking about the price well you've got to buy it you have to spend ethereum you have to spend ether to use the application like you want to use units imagine if the price of affiliation was you know a million dollars um and you had to spend an obscene amount of money in and gas terms even like you know some fraction of an eve right to use an application that's obviously not good it's almost like okay imagine if you're if you're saudi arabia and oil now is two million dollars a barrel yes that'd be great to sell all this oil but like nobody can buy it and so people are going to use a different form of energy so you actually the cure for high prices is high prices that's what they say in commodity terms right you actually you know spur innovation away from the source of energy that you're using if it gets too expensive for people to use that's not money that's a commodity ethereum's commodity it's not money right i mean yeah i think it's slightly different because ethereum can the decimal points go out like 18 18 places so you know and the gas is still sort of basically priced in us dollars but one thing i just wanted to ask about that was so essentially what you're saying is that you feel that bitcoin's narrative as digital gold is going to hold even though ethereum might be more deflationary or more or more scared or at least the scarcity will be decreasing yes because i think ethereum is trying to solve a different problem it's not trying to be money and and to the extent that and they i think they've the core developers or whatever the the political will of ethereum displayed this very clearly to us in 2016 when they bailed out everybody after the dow by doing a hard fork etc if you want to say is the real theory of money right that no one uses it but and there and there and that should tell you all you need to know about whether or not ethereum wants to be money and it might not be and it might not be the inflation rate that is what the the thing that shows everyone that ethereum is not money there may be some other compromise that they have to make because the goal of we want to be this decentralized computer for everybody in the world conflicts with immutable money i don't know what that is but i think we have a one-on-one sample set of what they did when they were confronted with that sort of choice they made the choice on the side of let's be the the power of the decentralized computer i believe they continue to have that vision and so that's why i don't believe ethereum is is digital gold or the money of the you know cryptospores so uh but i was curious for your thoughts um even more around bitcoin's narrative because this idea that bitcoin could be an inflation hedge was you know a long-held theory that some people now say it sort of been proved wrong you know obviously bitcoin actually decreased from its all-time high of 69 000 in november down to about 18 000 in june the same time we had high inflation so i wondered what your thoughts were on the inflation hedge theory of bitcoin i think everything it's a cherry-picking of timing right so if we take if we compare apples to apples let's and we say okay there's a universe of these risky assets that are supposed to protect our protect our money from from inflation so we go back to bitcoin 2009 right and we take bitcoin and we deflate it by the fed's balance sheet and then we take s p 100 we deflate it by the fed's balance sheet we take the nasdaq deflated by the fed's balance sheet we take gold by the fed's balance sheet we take you know u.s treasury bonds whatever bitcoin outperforms everything over the time period is when it existed deflated by the increase of the global reserve currency by its central bank the fed bitcoin has beat inflation now okay take a particular time period and that might not be true but over the history of the asset it has and i guess that just goes to you know if you're trading something like this timing is everything so essentially you feel that like on longer time periods this will become more evident and that really the macro driver was was the main cause for that yeah i mean it's one of them but i think that's that is the thing right if you look at the whole history of bitcoin and you deflate it by the system then it's trying to you know replace the dollar then it's done well okay yeah it overshot its value and then came down 75 but it's still over the entire lifespan of of what has existed has outperformed yeah so basically yeah you're you're sort of zooming out so um i mean you've i alluded to this theory a few times here about how the bitcoin price is just a measure of viewless u.s liquidity can you talk a little bit more about that just unpack that for listeners we've been referencing it throughout the episode but i wanted to make sure people heard it yeah everything is in phases where you can't say that something is disrepresentation forever but over the last let's call it 18 months um bitcoin has chucked and jived as the liquidity conditions of of the dollar have changed and and then i wrote an essay about this few weeks ago putting up my little index and this is literally just like a compilation of stuff i've read in other places but at the high level it's the fed and different you know governmental agencies provide the dollars the base money of the world for banks to leverage and leverage into the financial economy stocks bonds and whatnot and so the more credit um created by banks the more business activity right because business kids can borrow money and they can hire people and we can borrow money in our credit cards and we can get a house and we get a car and all the all these different things we buy all this stuff because there's just all this credit available and then things get out of hand like okay we got to rate it in and they started raining and the credit and because it's leveraged the downside is just like whoa holy like and then you get things crashing and you get three arrows and you get celsius and you get you know all these different things which are just a derivative of dollar liquidity dollars for less dollars supply discredit throughout the world and these you know liquidity goes to where it's best um cater to just like water and as they removed remove that then everything that depended on the credit collapsed and obviously bitcoin is just supercharged to that because it's really it's this new system you know it's only a decade and a bit old a bit unproven and so it's going to oscillate very violently with um how that uh how that goes conceptually and i created this index i put it on i put the little bloomberg thing on my twitter i think some people created a trading view but um yeah that's the overarching theory and i think it fit quite well with the peaks and bottoms recently since sort of like early 2021 to today-ish in terms of how bitcoin has responded as dollars became more or less available in the global economy and i don't think that's going to change anytime soon so i think that's the thing that i'm focused on and not the rate of which the fed does the fed funds rate because as i've done more research and talked to more people and learned a bit more about how u.s money markets works it's almost like a smoke screen this whole quarter point here 75 basis points there it doesn't matter it's just for show it all matters like are there more dollars available to be leveraged by the financial economy or are there not and track that and that's and literally you can forget everything else about economics doesn't matter you might as well not even like look at earnings who cares it doesn't matter that's all that matters i find that absolutely incredible and yeah i just love how like i feel like the whole first half of the episode was me you know asking all these questions about the emerge and you're just like it like none of this matters it's just like this one change that's the important thing and so i love how you've simplified this down as well even for bitcoin which is interesting but one thing i want to ask was so you know if we're getting if we're like you know it seems like the crypto world would like to get more institutional money in or just in general more mainstream people into into crypto but you know as we've seen the correlation between bitcoin and the stock market is very high so why would um either you know hedge funds or everyday investors why would they add bitcoin to their portfolio if it it you know seems to act so similarly to nasdaq and do you think that these will ever decouple at any point i'm sure there will the couple there's always changes do i know why i don't know um but why do why do institutional investors want to trade this or large money managers because it goes up a lot and right and so they're all trend followers so if they see like some kid who just bought a ferrari because you know he or she put a little bit of money in bitcoin and it went up or some coin or shiba or dogecoin or whatever it is right and so look at me over here like sleeping away trying to make five percent on my portfolio maybe i should add a little bit of that get some of that juice and i guess this is trend followers that's all they are um and so like when we talk about like institutional money managers there's highly paid fomo advertisers they're just aggregators of money i don't think they are any smarter than anybody else they're just plugged into a particular way of raising money and they have their own sort of objectives that they need to hit and one of them is if people are doing something and it's going well or has gone well and i'm not doing it then i'm at risk of my job versus if nobody else is doing it i'm not going to risk my job if i'm wrong investing in this thing and so on the upside there's career risks of not being technologically innovative and investing in these new things and on the downside there's career risk of of believing in it and sticking with your guns and staying and nursing these losses and so you know the institutional investor or whatever you want to call it they'll they'll come at the top by the top and they'll sell the button every single time it's just how how their incentives are are structured as as money managers this is hilarious i mean i i guess like yeah i i i find it funny because you used to be an investment banker um i don't know if you would put yourself in that category but you feel like at least for crypto they're just sort of following absolutely because there's nothing it's not in their best interest to to to be early because if they if they're early if they earlier they lose money they lose their job if they're late and they lose money or they're you know coincident then who cares everyone else everyone else lost money too you can't blame me okay and are you worried at all about a recession in the us and how that might affect the price of bitcoin and ether no because the real economy whether it's the us china europe you know russia africa whatever is it relevant to the financial economy unfortunately in most respects right because the financial economy cares about the supply of dollars and that's a political decision made by the treasury the fed and you know the elite politicians in the u.s of what the policy is going to be around the amount of credit of dollars expanded to the world and you know at a very high level you know the politicians and not just america but most advanced economies don't actually want recessions and are perfectly happy to print more money to cover up the structural flaws and however range things globally in the real economy such that the real pain is put off to the next administration and so there there is the okay well if things are going bad hand out more money stimulus print more money get the stocks look at the stock market to go higher let me get elected or let me keep my unelected position whatever it doesn't really matter and then when the things are felt five ten years out of that i'm not involved like i'm not around but let me just get elected and so i think that's the that's the impetus in in around the world and so and the easiest thing and every single time is print money governments know how to do one thing very well they have a very powerful thing called the money printer and they will use it every single time to avoid having to do things that are difficult like actually sell to the population like why we need to change things like energy policy or why you know we made these assumptions about population growth and you know dependent to uh working age population like we need to change our assumption though those are hard decisions not very popular though much easier to print the money something i also found fascinating in your writing is that you wrote that you believe central bank tightening is tightening up liquidity is uh the indirect cause of the terra luna collapse we don't have to go into all that i i feel like you you know kind of have explained this theory but it was curious whether or not you thought an algorithmic stable coin would ever work or if you think that type of stable stablecoin is forever doomed anything's possible the track record has been 100 to the failure rate um due to the the the fact that is an algorithmic stablecoin is the same thing as a government fiat money except the algorithmic stable coin doesn't have an army with a guy with guns who can enforce the usage of their currency and so that is the problem how do you how do you get demand for the currency when there is nothing behind it now obviously dokwan's innovation if you want to call it that was let's offer a really really really high interest rate and then people are going to plow into this thing and that's how we're going to generate that that excess demand and maybe somehow in the future we'll have some intrinsic demand for our currency that will you know paper over this issue of what happens when the peg goes breaks on the downside he tried and he failed and that's just that so you you know speaking of kind of all of these recent collapses you've also written about how 3ac collapsed and took down a lot of other players and crypto with it and it was just wondering as you you know watch this whole thing play out what are your main takeaways for the crypto space and in particular i think for crypto lenders we're all human we all make the same mistakes different different flavors like this the whole credit collapse i was uh reading a book by russell napier uh he was in clsa research analyst in the uh late 90s in hong kong he was covering southeast asia during the financial crisis and it just struck me how the same things that cause this credit collapse crypto are the same things that cause these financial crisis the same thing is that cause the ldc crisis in the 1980s and the same thing is a cause over lending to argentina over the money time that has defaulted to international vendors the same things that cause you know the russian debt crisis it's all the same thing at the beginning there's value and credit is allocated to that value and you make good loans and then as people see that it's successful they give you more money and you run out of credible stuff to invest in and then you just have but you have to ship the money out the door otherwise you don't get paid as as the intermediary and so well i you know and it's the same story every single time and you get the lending standards get less and less and less and less and less same thing happened in subprime right living against houses you know it's a decent business running into every single house you know people with like income that don't match the house that they're buying maybe not so good but it always started with a good business and then they got to be a bad business because there's just too much money chasing the past amazing returns to the opportunities that are available today and that is the that's the the lesson and we'll never learn it and we'll do it again when you say we're going to do it again you feel at some point in crypto there's going to be like another big blow up down the line because some people were saying things as credit because at the end of the day like if there's if i can earn three percent on a government bond in domestic fiat currency terms but i can earn 20 percent lending to this newfangled technological thing could be the railroad could be the telegraph could have been radios these all happened back in you know late 19th century early 20th century could be three euros in the in the super cycle could be you know crypto lending this like you know smoke screen over these centralized entities that were trying to say overall decentralized and blah blah blah right it's the same stuff people want the higher rate of return that's offered in the in the domestic bonds especially if inflation is higher than these bonds and they're like okay i got to do something i can't get step of money in the bank and like lose money in real terms look at this new technology over here and we've been conditioned as you know everyone's like oh yeah where's the new technology the technology the new technology is going to make all the money we got to be in the new technology so let's lend to the new technology and at a certain point the the lending standards do not represent what the actual value is and then we come down and it's a cycle and hopefully the the trend line is up and to the right in a in a much slower fashion than you probably would want and then we have extreme observations around the trend line so pretty much this whole conversation we've really talked about bitcoin and ethereum and i think i've read you know in your blog post that you kind of really are betting on those but are there any other either blockchains or other technologies that you find interesting that you are also you know either betting on or just keeping an eye on i mean you know on a routine basis i like not to plug this particular source but i think to do a good job uh token terminal i you know open it up i look at i go to i go to revenues and it goes seven days i look at which protocols are making are making the most money which people are actually using which people actually spend real real money right maybe it's bitcoin eth staples whatever not the actual currency that they've created out of thin air to hand out to people but who's spending real money to use applications on a network and then i go down the list and then i like okay do i own any of those uh why or why not do i not have a position and or maybe there's you know they're not actually a coin it's just like a service and they don't i can't own a coin in that particular thing or maybe the tokenomics of a particular ecosystem or project aren't to my liking but whatever i want to earn yield real yield based on people using these things on this ecosystem that i believe in and so that's kind of where i spend most of my time because i'm not super super technical so being able to suss out whether or not some particular new layer one could be the ethereum killer or not the ethereum killer like this is beyond my my abilities focus on things i'm good at and so earlier you know we did touch on nfts and you talked about how you felt they were valuable because they were ways of monetizing culture what are any particular trends in the nft space where you're kind of you know feeling like those are poised to either take off or where you're expecting more growth in the future i i honestly have no clue but that's why i particularly just focus on where the places where people congregate to trade these discrete objects right and so that's all i care about because at the end of the day i don't know i can't predict where human culture is going to go or whether or not some famous artist is going to take this protocol over that protocol or how they're going to how you can issue concert tickets in nft or loyalty programs or all this kind of stuff right i i don't know it's not really i can't really handicap that it's not really my area of expertise but is there a central point where a lot of people go to actually trade these assets and purchase them and experience them okay i want to know where that is i want to know where can i get in on that game because then i don't have to predict what the new thing is or you know is yuga labs going to come out with a new project that's going to be hot like i don't know i'll buy one of them if it's cool but um like being able to like make a really concerted business on that and a big bet that really not really my forte that's fascinating because i i don't know i don't know you super well but i would have imagined you'd be someone who would be good at predicting that kind of thing but anyway so i wanted to ask you about your writing process i'm a writer and i'm a fan of your writing and i always find it really impressive when people who are not professional writers are great writers and you fit that category you're an investment banker turn crypto entrepreneur and you know i and many other people in the crypto space just love your blog posts so i was just wondering for a bit of personal history how did you become such a good writer i mean i don't really like writing that much but i had some very good english teachers in in high school and there's one guy i remember deceased now but so we would we had a class on british literature and i think we were studying like shakespeare or whatever it was so like and he was famous in the school for having what i thought was called like spot test so we literally we get in the class we were supposed to read a particular you know set of pages in the play and then he would print out a section at play and then he would remove certain words from it and you had to like supply the word from the dialogue and then you'd have to give definitions of of particular turns of phrases or whatnot from from a piece of shakespearean literature and so like he got very protandic in particular about uh certain things took british literature through him we you know in high school we had to write a 3 000 word essay on a poem i forgot which poem i wrote it on i took a russian literature class from here i had to write a paper on the art of leo tolstoy which actually got an a on so i was quite surprised so yeah i think i had good training in high school and then i just like to read a lot of stuff and so i copied with other people who are better than me at it their style terms of phrases different concepts um i guess try to read riley fiction nonfiction i love sci-fi you know all sorts of different things a lot of history and then at the end of the day i'm trying to write something that i have an idea of a investment concept or a thesis i have a position on it in my portfolio and i'm also i'm having a conversation with myself through the writing i'm trying to justify to myself why do i have this position on and a lot of times as i start writing something i had an idea of something i wanted to write and then like this sounds like like this argument's weak like and i sell the whole position i get out of it because i can't even explain it to myself much less offered out to thousands of readers of why i'm in this particular trade and therefore i need to be out of it and so i think it's a very cathartic process of writing and because i use it as sort of a litmus test for my own ideas because i'm trying to make money on them maybe that's why the quality is good i just love what you said there but i was curious wait did you say that you previously didn't like writing or that you currently still don't like writing no no i like as a kid i wasn't really like i wasn't really into english class okay okay yeah because now it seems like you take great pleasure it's fun i like it yeah from the humor and and all that actually something that you just said reminds me of something that i did want to ask you about it wasn't in my script but i think this is a perfect time to ask it you at the beginning talked about how crypto is quite religious and bitcoin uh maximalism recently has been kind of undergoing a change you know there are prominent people who either previously were known to be bitcoin maximalists or um at least just consider themselves bitcoiners if not maximalists who now have you know publicly kind of renounced maximalism and it almost feels like there's like a narrative changing around that and i wondered you know what your take was on that some of these people are saying that a lot of the bitcoin maximalists now their arguments aren't sound that they're sort of chanting these different mantras or whatever and it's just sort of a religious thing but there's no evidence to back it up and i was curious for your thoughts on what's been going down with all that right not really follow the the consternation of um emotion around like oh is he a maxi or not or like to me it doesn't really matter but the fact that there's people who believe strongly about something and believe strongly about the opposing opinion to me is evidence of the thing that we're doing right it's money it's all fake it doesn't exist it's it's this thing that we're trying to connect the future human productivity today i'm trying to give you this thing that i call a bitcoin that has some value and i want you to do some work for me or give me a real asset or give me a slice of bread or whatever right and same thing with a dollar or any of this other stuff and so it's it doesn't exist it's completely made up it's complete myth and fiction and that's why i think it lends itself to religion it lends itself to people being super about it and then they change their mind and they you know they become the prodigal sons and daughters and maybe they'll come back into the fold later and so it does feel extremely religious and exactly and you change the reformation right you have the enlightenment you have this this change of energy around the different religions and then you have the orthodoxy who never changes and these schisms and it's just the same thing it's all the same and so you don't feel that any parts of the crypto world are more religious than others meaning more faith-based rather than evidence-based it depends on what you're trying to with the the ecosystem that you're involved bitcoin is pure money there is no utility as of yet other than being money right that's what it is and so of course you're going to have to be very religious about things because you don't have any other like real thing to tobacco it's not like a theory where okay there are these applications that are being used we're we're lending we're trading we're all on this network right we have this value here because like hey we've got this network we have this immutable chain of data therefore it's valuable and that's it right and so i think depending on what you're actually involved in will determine how much your religion you want to call that has to be imbued to to give it that value and the more you tend towards the thing that's monetary in nature and pure money it's pure fiction it's purely a construct of humanity and the way we want to organize ourselves socially and we have these units of account that we use to convert value amongst ourselves and that's going to be very religious yeah and i wanted to ask about when you keep saying bitcoin is money people typically say that that will have sort of like three features like store a value unit of account um just for oh ex you know used for exchange so i was curious like where you see bitcoin fitting that and or not quite fitting that yet depends on what you're using it for right some people like oh bitcoin is that useful because i can't go pay for a cup of coffee okay can you pay for a cup of coffee with a bar of gold um probably not but if somebody gave you a bar a gold would you consider it valuable yeah i would um why because everyone else said this is valuable right it's the same argument um you know so it's like oh yeah the dollar is it's gonna explode today because of all this rampant inflation but you need to pay your taxes and dollars if you're american right yeah yeah so it's useful yeah right yeah okay it's useful right so it's all context so i think people again it's like religion you take a context you extrapolate it to the maximum maximum and you look silly and i think that's what people do with bitcoin and every other form of monetary value i love it i love it i i just feel like throughout this episode you've always just gone for the simplest explanation which i think is what makes you a very clear writer as well and why people like your writing because i always say i mean so as a professional writer i do have to say people generally don't value writing you know so many times like writers will you know try to get a gig and they'll be told like things like oh we'll pay you for exposure or we won't pay you but you'll get exposure or whatever when i take away has been that people think that typing is writing and i i'm always trying to tell people no no no writing is actually clear thinking that's what writing actually is and if you can find somebody who's a very clear thinker like that's extremely valuable so um i just love how you've done that through this episode and i think that you know that explains also why it is that people just love what you write so yeah i think it's also a thing of like people people don't recognize like the power of ideas right if you think about the you know the total wars that we fought over the 20th century this marxism right like how well look at the impact karl marx has had on world history or keynes keynesian economics and all this crap that we learned in school um it's all these ideas of these dead people who wrote these these essays and people last on them and these ideas are still around with us today in religions ideas by of humans on on different things they wrote some books and you know billions of us believe it or not believe it and we'll kill each other for it and so i think at the uh at scale our writing is extremely powerful and but you know the unfortunate part is just like crypto 99 of all writing is trash and so you know you just assume that everything is trash and you pay accordingly which is you know good or bad thing wow i love it now you've also explained my experience over my writing career all right arthur it has been such a delight to have you on the show thank you for illuminating everything from bitcoin to ethereum to macro stuff to nfts
