liquidity providers today's episode is sponsored by ey blockchain ernst young is committed to supporting integration of the world's business ecosystems on the public ethereum blockchain today's topic is whether ethereum needs to worry about these eth killers the new generation of them the prime examples being solana and binance smart chain here to discuss are kane warwick founder of synthetics and kyle simani managing partner at multicoin capital welcome kane and kyle thanks for having us hey laura good to be back on the show i'm looking forward to this this would be a fun spicy spicy debate yeah should be it should be good fun yeah i know you know that was exactly what um kane and i were discussing when we were figuring who his conversation partner should be so um listeners should know that the impetus for this show was a recent tweet storm that kane wrote up saying that he was concerned about the solana and binance marching communities quote genuinely gaining organic traction much more so than say eos or tron of the last cycle kane can you explain your thoughts more on this score yeah so you know i think uh back in 2017 2018 uh you know tron and eos made a pretty decent attempt at generating some traction and getting you know smart contract developers to migrate um you know certainly eos threw a lot of money uh at that process and we just saw that you know they didn't really get much traction obviously it was a different part of the the market cycle it was a bear market it was much harder to get uh you know uh traction back then but what we're seeing now um you know especially with the high gas prices on ethereum is that there's appears to be a bit of an opportunity for chains like solana and finance smart chain to really start chipping away at the dominance and you know my my thread was really about a bit of a wake-up call i think that the community can't just be oblivious to this that you know this is actually happening and we need to at least consider uh the momentum that these chains are getting and kyle i'm just curious do you um agree with keane's description and i'm assuming that you would not be super concerned about this because you have invested in both um the solana and uh finance so what's your take on what you're seeing yeah so i'll preface everything of course this kind of whole podcast episode by saying that multi-coin is is quite long eth uh we're actually more long ether than bitcoin um and we're even more along that than on soul and finance um so yeah we're long kind of all of the the primary subjects of this conversation we have felt for a long time that the ethereum approach to scaling was just not going to be sufficient not that it won't work but it will just not be enough um and two years ago it was a kind of a fuzzy claim but there wasn't enough kind of clarity on how exactly it was going to work but but our intuition was that it just wasn't going to get there and you know fast forward today and we have a reasonable sense of how the zk roll ups are going to work and how the optimistic bullets are going to work and we can kind of sort of reason about how the interoperability with between these things will work um and i feel more convicted than ever that the the scaling solutions that are here today for the ethereum ecosystem are simply not enough i think solana is is not sufficient by probably two to three orders of magnitude i think what the theory of ecosystem is proposing is like five or six orders of magnitude away from being sufficient but i've just always thought you have to just try other angles and see how where these things go um and the primary constraint is just parallelism um and uh i think that's super important i think it's very important for the long-term health of all decentralized finance and all of crypto to make sure we maximally explore um the full design space and trade-offs of these different ways to scale um as opposed to being dogmatic about which which set of ideologies is the right approach we're bullish all three approaches obviously to different degrees um but we certainly think all three have a lot of room to run over the next 12 to 24 months and when you mention that about parallelism are you saying because you just feel like sharding is not the way to go or what did you mean by that if you look at roll-ups roll-ups specifically break what i call logical centralization meaning right in a in a roll-up if you have a transaction happening the base layer that the base layer doesn't know what roll-ups are um it's actually just not a logical concept that exists in the base layer um and similarly if you're in a baseball if you're in a roll-up roll-ups don't know what other roll-ups are either um and so um there are ways to bridge those things together into semi-ish seamless ways to make them interact with each other but it by definition requires some additional developer tax um that developer attacks whether it's some sort of state channel interface over connects or something over thor chain or something over some whatever starkware is doing some stuff and zk sync guys are doing some stuff there's a whole bunch of people working on different theoretical you know ways to bridge all of these things together um i have no particular views of which of those methodologies is best in fact there probably isn't a best they all have different trade-offs and so as you look at how kind of this heterogeneous layer two world is going to evolve um there's gonna be different layer twos and there's gonna be multiple instances of the same layer two tech um and then different you know tech text and making all those things interoperate across your knowledge flavors optimistic flavors different latency flavors um depending on like what the user's preferences are what the the gas fees are at the moment in the network there's just a tremendous amount of complexity in all of these things to be clear none of these problems are intractable like they're all by definition tractable problems um but the amount of developer tax it will create for developers to provide a good user experience will be very very substantial by definition that means developers will spend a pretty large percentage of their time and energy dealing with all of what i'll just call this like plumbing crap instead of like actually building good user facing applications and so as i think about kind of long long-term horizon development i think that that's very concerning if just like developers would have to spend too much time thinking about this stuff and so that's kind of the primary concern and so do you have an idea for how ethereum could scale in a better fashion or is it just simply that you think it goes back to that scalability trilemma like you know obviously binance smart chain and sauna are more centralized so is it just simply that you think at this point the best solution is just just to have a more centralized chain and to compromise on decentralization so i think there's a skipper dilemma is basically not not correct for the most part in degrees of correctness matter so like today ethereum people will tell you to run the 500 laptop that that's not true like look at the gas limit i think it's 15 million if i'm not mistaken per block you're like that's not running on a 500 laptop like it's just not gonna happen a thousand dollar laptop is more realistic and that's probably generous if you look at solana today salon is running on like call it a three thousand dollar server 3500 server what we're talking about here is like a three to four x difference in price on like what hardware you need to do it so let's be clear about what that you know just an absolute dollar term is what that means um and it's not 20x difference or 50x difference it's three to four the second thing that matters is then to say is okay obviously if the hard requirements are higher that by definition there are fewer computers in the world of a higher hardware of the higher hardware standard but like to what degree fewer computers and then like and then what's the diminishing marginal return of having like as you go from one thousand notes to ten thousand nodes you get some marginal degree of censorship resistance as you go from ten thousands to 100 000 nodes you are by definition getting less censorship resistance um this explicitly has diminishing returns and so when i look at you know people say like you're compromising on on the trilemma like it's like true in a very theoretical sense but like in a practical sense like does it matter and like to the degree like the hardware cost matters it's like okay is it three thousand dollars is that is that the delta or is it like something else well the bitcoin and ethereum communities both had very strong ideological beliefs on you know what's called hardware costs as like the primary constraint um which is fine like those beliefs are reasonable but like there was no god forsaken like reason to believe that those were like the right bounds to use and i think it's actually quite important to test what those bounds should be whether the number is four thousand whether it's twenty five thousand whether the number is two hundred thousand um probably shouldn't be two hundred thousand probably shouldn't be twenty five thousand below four thousand it's like pretty pretty great to me and it's not that clear to me that the answer has to be below 1000. and kane what do you make of what kyle singh and his take on your tweets worm i mean look you know i think uh broadly it's it's accurate you know and and i don't disagree that there is going to be a lot of uh thrashing i mean we're in the middle of this right now right like the synthetics project has spent upwards of you know 75 of its resources over the last six months working on scaling right um now you know that's an investment that we decided was worthwhile making and it's an investment that's going to pay off for the rest of the community because you know we're going through a lot of uh issues that other people then subsequently won't chain link's doing the same thing with us um you know there's a couple of other projects uni swap etc that are kind of taking the brunt of this work but i i don't think it goes just to be clear are you talking about um working with optimism you're working with optimism yeah to you know to get through optimistic roll-ups and and get through the process of of working out how to onboard from l1 to l2 um you know contract modifications etc so you know there is definitely a lot of overhead there and that doesn't even speak to what happens once it works right and once we have l1 and l2 and once we have multiple l2s and you know all of the the interactions etc it is going to take up a lot of resources i think i suppose my my view is that it's just by necessity a thing that's gonna have to happen right um you know when sbf and i uh had our debate a year ago now or nine months ago you know one of the things we sort of uh talked about was this idea that like yes maybe if everyone could converge on a single solution um you know we could avoid fragmentation and avoid dealing with all these multiple layers and all that stuff it's just not going to happen right like you know as much as we might want that to be the case it's just not going to so um you know we need to be realistic and accept that there will be some level of fragmentation um in in this process and it is going to be overhead for engineers and and developers in space and people building the space um but i i think it's it's kind of a necessary process that we need to go through um and then i to the second point around uh sort of decentralization and what the threshold of hardware is i think there was an interesting kind of thing you slipped in there which was you know a 3500 server in a data center somewhere that's not exactly you know the the kind of expectation i think we have around like running an ethereum node right like a thousand dollar laptop or a 500 laptop you know there are there are other requirements to run a solana node that are maybe over and above commodity hardware commodity access to data availability or whatever that that i think are pretty critical in order for that throughput to be achievable um and i think running everything inside a data center or multiple data centers or whatever um is like not just a a quantitative change i think it's a qualitative change like if i can't run a node in my house because you know my my bandwidth is not sufficient and you know my cable modem or whatever that puts a severe constraint on who can actually participate in the network which i think is important it's an important thing to to note well so let's now just talk about kind of the two main eth killers um of the latest vintage that everybody's been talking about how would you guys characterize how binance smart chain and solana have kind of filled the gaps that ethereum is leaving with its high gas fees and you know it's issues with scaling i i think you know finance smart chain has taken a very smart approach like everything that binance does is very smart they're a very smart and efficient organization it's just they may not be aligned with what the ethereum community for example and in fact i mean they're not right like you know finances is a company that is you know trying to maximize profit right and and they're very effective at it um and i so i think that the the finance smart chain traction that they're getting is not necessarily at the expense of ethereum i mean i think it it probably is pulling some liquidity away but i think it's liquidity that right now is priced out realistically right there's there's obviously some additional incremental loss but at the moment it's basically people that are priced out that are using finance marching um but you know you can very quickly spin up the same code bases and and you know clone stuff or make minor modifications to get it running on bsc so it's just going to happen right it's just a realistic thing and it's you know that's where i say i think that the fact that ethereum has taken longer to scale than we would have liked has created this market opportunity for someone to do that the fact that finance are the smart people that are doing it you know it makes sense that it would be financed right i think solana is is different in that it's much more of an existential threat to a um because this question of wonky considerations for the average person around how decentralized is it what you know what hardware can you run it on what are the requirements etc the average person doesn't care that much right i think the average person if they looked at ethereum and solana versus bsc they'd probably say like yes i understand that this is a fairly centralized network and it's run by a single entity effectively um and and they can make a distinction there i think it's much harder for the average person to make a distinction between ethereum and solana and so i think solana is a much larger threat uh to ethereum and and you know is something that the ethereum community needs to be mindful of that you know you can lose market share like leaders fall behind all the time in especially you know in nascent phases of tech revolutions right it's very easy for for someone to fall behind we just need to keep ourselves uh accountable and make sure that we're aware of and we can't just hand wave it away and say oh solana is not you know a threat to a theorem because of x wires that you know ideological view that we might have i think it's really important and just to go back earlier when you were talking about how easy it is for developers to build on uh binance marketing it's because it's ethereum compatible so it's literally like almost like a copy paste type thing um however so it's fascinating that you say actually salon is the bigger that because solana is not ethereum virtual machine compatible so why do you think that salon is the bigger threat i mean again you know i think it's it's that distinction between most people can differentiate between ethereum and finance smart chain i don't know if most people can can differentiate between uh ethereum and solana i think also there's another barrier which is you know if anyone can just copy-paste code from ethereum to finance smart chain you get some interesting second-order effects of you know things blowing up and rug pulls and all kinds of crazy stuff right which undermines that ecosystem i think the barrier to entry of having to actually write your own code in solana means by definition you get better engineers you get better teams they're they're more credible teams they're going to be able to take that code and develop it further and it's just an ecosystem that's going to be much more competitive with ethereum realistically oh okay so i see so you're saying it's going to attract developers as opposed to like right now binance smart chain might just attract more users who are priced out of ethereum but maybe not so much developers and that's why salon is the bigger threat is that is that it yeah i think so i think you know there is a filter in in solana where like you genuinely can't just take you know solidity and drop it in and run it right like you need to actually rewrite smart contracts from scratch and and that means you need to i have a better understanding not a perfect understanding necessarily and there's definitely some clone projects on solana that have kind of taken code and just ported it across but i think that in general it's not as easy which means that you have a filter and you get better engineers and better teams okay and kyle uh obviously kane and i covered a lot with that so you can kind of respond to well no i just i was asking some follow-ups because i was curious so go ahead and respond to whatever you'd like yeah so i i agree with almost everything kane just said and as someone who obviously has spoken to a lot of ethereum projects over the last 12 months and said hey do you want to pour to solana i've actually seen the um both ideological challenges and engineering challenges and getting them to do that and um like you know last let's call it last september october i thought i was being successful and i since realized i failed completely like i think my hit rate was actually zero again there's partly ideological reasons and then as canada two is actually more important is engineering reasons um one thing i've observed across the ethereum community is you know these engineering teams who are all kind of oriented around solidity um and solana is built on rust russ is actually in basically every way actually a modern and better language it's just intellectual and kind of tool chain firepower behind it because it's just an enormous kind of global global thing but most liberty devs don't know rust and vice versa i think it's been very legitimately difficult for ethereum-based engineering organizations to you know figure out how to hire grow augment their teams and then kind of manage two you know side-by-side teams i think it's just a legitimate kind of difficult thing to do um so concur with everything kane said there the key thing that that kind of gets kane's comments about kind of existential threat i think are accurate and i think this kind of all gets down to like the ideological beliefs around basically like what degree of weak subjectivity is sufficient in these systems i would argue everything in the world basically is like weekly subjective um and what i mean by that is like the bitcoin maximalist view is you need to be able to um verify every single transaction from genesis in 2009 all the way to today and if you can't verify every single transaction yourself then like the system is bad and evil and that's like the purely objectivist view um but i think that's just an unnecessary bar to hold any of these systems too because like your life is weakly subjective what do i mean by that um well first like you read the history books and like you don't actually know what happened 500 years ago like it's just been like some guy wrote it down and that guy passed it on his kids and that guy passed it on his kids and like you don't actually know so like even like basic concepts like history right are by definition with these objectives um but even on like on a more practical basis like i'm in a building right now the two of you are also in buildings right now like there is a roof over your head there were architects that designed the building and like you're generally not worried the roof is going to collapse and kill you and like you get in a car and like there's a bunch of pistons firing and it's literally lighting stuff on fire and it's exploding and like you generally don't care or think about it and like you don't my point is you don't have to verify all of these things yourself right so so the world works on a weekly subjective basis where you don't need to verify everything the question in my mind is what degree of weak of subjectivity are is okay for some sort of global permissionless financial system and like one view is i have to run my own node uh and that and then the dollar cost and let's say bandwidth requirements have to be below some threshold let's say i don't know it's a thousand dollars and i don't know 100 megabits per second or whatever pick your numbers i i think that's probably too restrictive my intuition is that like as long as you can get to like somewhere between 10 000 100 000 around the world it's enough that all of the other 7 billion people know that like those other people are sufficiently honest and it's visually well intentioned remember that's gonna be organizations like coinbase and like ftx like it's gonna be a ton of like well-known you know like reputable institutions and not just like guys you know and on guys in their basement and so as long as you have a sufficient number of them who are distributed around the world who all concur on the same consensus set like what what are you getting as you go from let's say 20 000 nodes to 2 million nodes yeah and and that that extra degree of censorship resistance and that extra degree of of inclusion to me well i mean i would i would love it to have it the the forced engineering tradeoffs it makes i find to be um in terms of gas cost in terms of latency in terms of then all these other weird secondary effects on devx and ux i find those that kind of to be the the threshold for the trade-off or and so yeah it's an open question but i think is cain's alluding to like that's kind of the existential open question i think most people in crypto have taken for granted that the answer to that question was like in this pretty narrow range and i think salon has opened a lot of people's eyes and say hey maybe the range is a little bit wider of like what is actually the right answer and that's kind of what we're seeing happen right now so one thing that i want to explore a little more here is um just you know how binance martina has actually gotten a lot more traction early on than solana like it's just fascinating both of you i think view solana as um something that could really be more of an ethereum killer than than binance marching and yet you know solano really does not at the moment have the same kind of traction that even finance smart chain does or you know has had at different times over the last few months like you know there was a period where for instance among the different automated market makers pancake swap actually did have higher volume than uniswap obviously now with you know swap v3 that's not the case but um can you just tell me kind of like how you see this playing out in the short term since it is at the moment finance marching that has posed kind of more of a threat to ethereum i mean my view i guess is that uh bsc is kind of an anomaly right it's a bit of a blip it's there's a moment in time where uh ethereum scaling has been slow enough and and you know the amount of activity that's been generated on the chain is and i mean i don't i think you know this is one of the things that i think the the point of that thread was about was that like we need to kind of not be so oblivious to these things right i think there were a lot of people in theorem community that thought you know l1 probably can handle most of the activity that we want for the foreseeable future and yeah it's important that we scale but it's not like an existential threat we're not going to get caught out and we've been caught out like there's way too much activity to the point where there's an overflow of activity that should be on ethereum that has just drifted off into this other chain right and that's just a missed opportunity i think for the ethereum community uh completely does that get pulled back in when you have roll ups and and you know things like polygon and you know zero knowledge uh scaling solutions that are much sort of better and at scale yes i think all of that activity that's happening in finance marching to a large extent the vast majority of it will come back over once once uh you know um the gas prices are low enough on on these other solutions i think where solana differs is that you know again it's it's going to be a harder road for them to scale and to get you know activity to come across because it's not just as easy to kind of you know port something across you can't just do the pancake swap thing right someone needs to build the pancake sloth of uh of solana and it needs to be built from scratch and rust and that's just harder to do um and and it's just harder to kind of transfer that across so i think you know my my sense is that finance marching will maybe lose some relevance uh once we get scaling um whereas solana i think once it gets momentum it's going to be hard to unwind that because they're building a parallel ecosystem with different engineers different skill sets different you know approaches and they have really taken a you know to kyle's point they've accepted that there is maybe a wider range of um you know sensitive persistence if you will right if that's where it kind of ultimately comes down to that is acceptable and that you can have you know fewer nodes and it's probably fine and the vast majority people don't care as long as there's some people who care um you know people are going to you know sort of be happy to to trust those people that do care as long as they know that there's sufficient number of them and what is that number and what's sufficient you know i didn't know that this was gonna evolve you know devolve into like an epistemological debate but i think it's a good point right like if there's not some answer right that the ethereum community and bitcoin community have like gotten right necessarily right like we don't know what the market will bear the market might be willing to bear much more because they're not as ideologically concerned as as we are the market might be very happy to have a much wider range of answers to that question kyle did you want to add anything yeah i think the other thing i would add that i think is important to think about is stability and ability to project how things are going to work in the future like gas fees is like one obvious problem and that's kind of the most salient one you see at the moment but i would actually argue that that's not the biggest problem the biggest problem is if you're going to be twitter or you're going to be bet any bank or nav or reddit or whoever doesn't matter pick your big company of choice and you want to say okay we're going to like go embed crypto in a fundamental way into our application right whether it's with some social tokens or even embedded cloud or some trading whatever i don't really care something and you have 100 million daily active users on your app right if you have underlining today and you reasonably expect you're going to grow over the next three years you'll have 200 million users in three years or whatever you have a very understanding of how the system work at the current moment and actually are you more importantly you need to understand how you expect the underlying system to continue to evolve over the next two or three or four years at a minimum um before you make any sort of large technical commitment like that and the biggest challenge the ethereum ecosystem faces actually today is that it is actually impossible to answer the question what does a scaled ethereum application look like in 24 months it's not that i don't know or that kane doesn't know it's that it's actually not possible to know because you have too many things that are interfering with each other right now from these various optimistic world flavors zero knowledge flares and state channels it's just there's just too many things that are all about to run into each other um and no one knows how it's gonna all play out and so you just can't make any projections um you can be optimistic i think it will get figured out and that's a reasonable thing to believe um some people believe it with higher probabilities than others but you you can't know with any degree of certainty how do how does an application actually function on ethereum at some level of scale in 24 months it just is not possible to know and i'm not sure when it will be possible 24 maybe um one it may be 12 12 i think it's pretty optimistic um 24 is reasonable but it could be 36 months before before that answer is really knowable and being able to provide stability over a long horizon for large companies to um you know commit to is extraordinarily important because when you have a large user base the number one thing you can't do is just screw up your entire application i'd say the reason i'm actually most optimistic solana is it provides that stability in that um like in terms of just how does it scale and then also in terms of just like the core development environment which is like it's based on the rust community and it seems like rust is gonna like slowly replace c plus plus is like powering the guts of like everything in the world i mean the linux like linus turtle has recently said like they're gonna start rewriting parts of the linux kernel and rust and and so kind of that degree of of technical depth and kind of integration into just all software around the world like there's real deep important considerations here um that that's lana kind of naturally benefits from all right so we're going to talk a little bit about some very specific events over the next few years to see how this might play out but first a quick word from the sponsors who make

back to my conversation with kyle and kane so actually one note before i asked my next question um kyle what you were saying about rust is interesting because as you know i've been working on this book and um what you were saying about it replacing c plus plus reminds me of how um gavin wood when he left the ethereum foundation and started parody they chose to make their next client in rust and he his previous client had been c plus plus so um yes i've you know uh heard a little bit about the benefits of that language and um it i do you know see that there are developers who are going in that direction um so let's just now talk about all these different layer twos because you're right right now ethereum is in this somewhat messy period with a lot of fragmented layer two scaling and different projects on different layer twos so for both of you how do you see ethereum best navigating this period while um we have these other competitors that are able to already handle more transactions per second i mean maybe i'm i'm being overly optimistic here i think the the period of highest friction is probably the next six months uh in terms of you know getting some level of consensus about where we should be trying to scale ethereum based uh applications i think one other consideration though to to go back to what kyle had said before for a large organization is not just throughput like that's not the only consideration i think there is an important consideration which is you know this idea of credible neutrality and yes ethereum might be fairly opaque in terms of you know what the roadmap looks like and what something will look like in 24 months or three years but i think that at the moment even if you ignore uh maybe the fact that you know solana's more centralized from a node perspective it's far more centralized from an organizational perspective you know there is a a group of people sitting you know uh in in a couple of places around the world that are kind of driving the majority of uh development and i think ethereum is in a very different place and so if you're if you're looking as a large organization that's trying to work out you know which platform do i believe is going to be uh you know the the best place for me to put resources into i think we're already seeing that large scale you know particularly for financial applications maybe less so for social things and your twitter and reddit and things like that but certainly you know from financial applications uh ethereum is the place that you go you know as long as you're not so concerned about throughput you know if you're trying to put 100 million users on on something that's probably not going to be viable but when you're you know issuing a bond or something like that you know i think we're seeing that ethereum you know they're not you know we don't have central banks issuing bonds on bsc right for for various you know obvious reasons um and and so i think that ultimately what it comes down to is can we get to a level of scalability where we start to see some traction i don't think we're going to see twitter fully decentralize itself in the near term anyway but if we see some social applications that are running on rollups or you know zero knowledge scaling solutions that are getting some level of traction that will provide confidence i suppose in larger organizations you know to start to look into this but it is going to be an incremental process i don't think we just see a wholesale migration to any decentralized you know platform whether it's solana or ethereum or bsa kyle what do you think i agree with everything kane said there here i think how does ethereum kind of deal with this um i'm not sure what the answer to that is because the problem with ethereum is that it's not a thing or a group of people it's a whole bunch of different people within a whole bunch of different places who disagree with each other on a whole bunch of different things so i'm not sure what you can do about it and the reality is that in the long run the experimentation going on now is necessary because you need to find the right set of trade-offs and it's not clear what the right set of trade-offs um are and experimentation is the only way to figure that out so um i mean the best thing they can do is move as quickly as possible and like try and play nice together as best as possible i i think the other thing that i really think about here is that like what happens when you have an application that's like well-known like a consumer-grade application that's well-known that there's like help 30 million or 50 million daily users they're not like like 500 million daily users but like 30 or 50 kind of scale and what's what's the highest probability platform that that app if you assume that application has to exist at some point which i can actually assume 100 probability that such application will exist um if if i didn't then i wouldn't have the job that i have then like what's actually the highest probability location of where that application ends up living on the surface the answer is obviously ethereum but actually if you appeal and back and think about it a little bit more i would actually argue the only answer solana because as kane said like the scaling is going to be incremental which i agree with that that statement and and so you've got all these people around the world looking crypto prices and experimenting with stuff and playing with things and they're all trying to figure out how to make stuff work um and if you just assume your default is i have to have support for 50 million users then you kind of limit your choices really fast and and so if one of those things starts to work and reasonably in your future and gets to you know reasonable degree of skate you know like user scale that's like widely recognized and understood i think the relative perceptions will change really fast the biggest surprise actually multi-coin in the last nine months has been the price of each btc we were convinced btc was going to perform this cycle because of the these big institutions coming in were going to be buying bgc and not buying eth uh we thought they were going to be concerned about eth2 and and proof of stake it's confusing and the monetary policy is undefined and we really thought that that kind of degree of confusion was going to cause each btc to go down we were obviously dead wrong bbtc has way outperformed our expectations and so that's forced us to reconsider what are the marginal buyers caring about and they seem to be undervaluing the digital gold thesis and overvaluing the productive utility asset thesis of things that are productive for large numbers of users that do useful things and so if you kind of just lean into that even further and say okay well as this stuff evolves how are those where are those dollars going to migrate over time it just seems pretty logical to me that those dollars are going to migrate to where they see the 50 to 100 million daily active users and i i think the probability that that application ends up on ethereum first is actually much lower than the market kind of assigns just looking at how our views have changed over the last nine months on ebtc i think the market's fuse can change on seoul anything else as well so something you know i just kind of need to pull together a bunch of different strands here because i feel like some of the comments have gone one way and and at other points a different way but you know for instance earlier kyle when you were saying that you actually had not convinced any developers to move over to solana you know despite all we're saying about the superiority of rustin about um you know how i it's just a salon offers a better experience for developers and blah blah blah um why do you think that you didn't convince any developers to go over there and then yet you know it's just funny that you mentioned that at the same time that you're saying oh like you know the the next really big application for that size i you know 30 to 50 million users i think will be on solana so i'm just kind of curious to hear how you put all that together oh sure to synthesize that into like five words the answer is on a global developer basis solidity rounds to zero like it really does the number of solidity developers in the world rounds to zero among all developers and so that's why it doesn't matter and that's why we actually the salon team has stopped trying to convince developers to port over it just doesn't matter oh i see so since there are just to be fair and to be clear i'm not saying that the those developers don't matter as people are what their products are working on i'm just saying in the aggregate universe of total developers the number of solidity just doesn't matter okay so then then essentially for solana to take off it um needs to just pull in new developers who aren't currently in crypto or in into blockchain anything is that yeah or they're disenfranchised with eth or they come from the russ community or i mean there's all kinds of weird way or they or they work at binance or ftx or coinbase they work at or block fi whatever they work in any of these places and they say oh actually best example here is probably jump jump capital right like jump is the largest market making trading yeah i'm trading they're the largest market maker in all of crypto uh there's they have the venture arm which is capital and then trading is like the main the main org single largest market maker in all of crypto and they're one of the largest trading firms in the world they have 900 full-time employees and they're you know deep in crypto and they're trading on d5 they're turning on every single centralized exchange around the world and right they're saying like okay we think we can build a big part of the future using their their new oracle number called pitt that they announced and like jump obviously trades on you know all these assets on all these venues around the world obviously they're going to pipe in a bunch of the data that they're trading from these other places in the solana right and and so you just look at people like that and it just makes you wonder like where did that where does that thread go maybe a counterpoint look i love the jump guys and and you know i talk to them regularly i think they're an amazing company and and they do a really good job and they're amazing market makers but i think what's interesting is they still have a very tradify dna right like they're they don't quite get everything d5 there is an aspect of like understanding it from an ideological perspective so you know when we were talking about this oracle network that they were going to launch one of my concerns with this is that they are looking at it from a very different perspective and maybe that's fine right and the trade-offs and optimizations they're trying to make are coming from a very different angle of like a trad phi centralized angle and and not quite rocking maybe what the the trade-offs are that that need to exist for smart contract developers to want to adopt something so i think jump is actually a really great example of how someone can maybe get it wrong uh and and you know go okay we're over optimizing for throughput here like these guys are you know hft they're they're like that you know through foot to them is like they can't get you know they're addicted to it right they can't get the they can't get themselves out of that mindset and so i think that the fact that you know the siren song of solana attracted jump is kind of indicative of one of the dangers of maybe not having that deep understanding of what the trade-offs are in decentralized finance that the solidity engineers who've been working you know there for the last four years have like deeply ingrained like we understand how these things work and we understand why they work that way we did all the dumb things two years ago three years ago four years ago and we've learned our lessons someone who's coming you know from a very centralized track five perspective is maybe not going to have that understanding and may optimize for the wrong things and i think in the case of jump and this oracle network on solana i think they kind of have i think they would have been better off building something and integrating with existing uh systems in in the ethereum network like chain link for example um they're going to hate me for saying this but i i honestly think that they would have added more value there you know how they done that but that's that's my opinion i've told them that myself but i think it's a really good example kyle what do you have to say there's open questions that like we have sometimes we iterate on these internally sometimes it kind of pours out on twitter of like what exactly makes d5 different than c5 i'm like what are actually the the properties that matter that are different kind of that's kind of the crux of what kane's getting at and like there's a few obvious ones and there's a few that are maybe more debatable so like the most important ones are obviously non-custodial like probably the single most important one the fact that you can have contracts hold assets instead of people or organizations you know that kind of paramount to this whole thing um the fact that it's transparent is probably you know super important and up there um the fact that you can kind of trivially rehypothecate collateral between systems is is really important beyond that it's not clear to me that there's any actual differences between d5 and c5 on a strictly financial basis there's obviously engineering differences especially as it pertains to distributed networks versus central databases but on like a strictly financial basis i i think there's the only properties that matter that differ and so if if that's the case then it's not clear to me why anything jump is doing is wrong but there's maybe an argument that i'm i'm myopic and missing some things and there's some other stuff that needs to be considered yeah i you know i i don't think that strictly missing something but i think it's it's kind of a question of like what are you optimizing for right and i think someone coming from c5 or coming from tradfi just has a mindset of what they're optimizing for they're optimizing for throughput they're not necessarily factoring in the social consensus aspects of these things right and maybe that doesn't matter but it seems to matter in d5 like there is a component of that that is important to to factor in like why do people trust something you know is it like genuinely incredibly neutral like uh you know are we concerned that it's controlled by a single entity it's all of these considerations i think come in to you know what's going on here right and i say this as someone who launched a project that was extremely centralized in the early phases and you know the ethereum community uh was was very vocal about how terrible that was and what a bad person i was for for doing that um but you know we obviously had a plan to decentralize over time right but when you have something that's coming from a very sort of centralized uh place without maybe a plan to uh kind of decentralize over time there's going to be some questions about is this a place that i want to commit resources to because you end up with you know a situation of platform risk and i think ethereum has platform risk but it's a different type of platform risk than say like facebook yeah um i actually also now just want to ask a little bit about d5 composability because that was something that obviously at a certain point uh was a concern um but now that we have all this fragmentation anyway on these different layer twos they just wonder does that make it less of a factor than it used to be and make room for these competitors to gain market share i mean i solana certainly the fact that it's not uh you know taking the same sort of approach to scaling and having all these multiple layer twos i think will have an advantage in composability like just by definition right um you know if we've got four different credible choices that a d5 team on ethereum can choose right between like arbitrarium optimism you know uh polygon and you know stockwear or whatever like you've got you've got these it just makes it hard right we could have a situation where four of the top d5 projects all end up on different networks um you know so that's just something that i think we need to to be aware of whereas solana you deploy on solana you're there that's it you're all in the same place in my conversations with traditional finance people um and i imagine a lot of keynes he's had in the last few years as well one of the coolest things is they see the composability and they're like oh that like the light bulb clicks very quickly and and so i think it's it's a pretty important thing to them is that like they they tend to understand relatively quickly that like this is one of those step function improvements that the new system enables the old system could not do and it's it's certainly i think intellectually the coolest of them and certainly the most kind of developer centric also of them kind of those those native new d5 properties um and solana clearly preserves those those the best and and so i think there's going to be a real group of people who are drawn to that i think for the most part the world does not fully appreciate the degree to which these things are true at the moment but as ethereum kind of continues to become more heterogeneous across layer ones side chains and layer twos um and as solana just maintains everything organically working in like a single composable shard that will become a lot more obvious to the world in six to 12 months time than it is today where today it's kind of mostly just people like us theorizing that'll be very obvious and and i suspect a fair number of people will be drawn will be drawn to that um because they will perceive it as the right thing to optimize for um and it is a reasonable thing to want to optimize for and so do you think then we could see kind of like d5 moving to solana because so my next question for you was about you know obviously we've seen these nfts taking off in the last several months and both selena and binance smart chain are creating their own nft platforms and so then i started wondering oh like are we just gonna see different parts of the crypto ecosystem on each of these different chains you know like maybe d5 moves to solana or or it grows its own kind of organic defy community that is more composable than um a defined ethereum is right now or or something like how do you think that kind of these uh more niche interests in crypto will affect this competition i i don't think ethereum where it is today will be displaced in any meaningful way in any foreseeable time verizon but even for like any particular use case uh well i mean the use case is just whales like that that's just already true the retail dollars have peeled off to polygon and dsc i think the bigger question is where do you onboard nit new users into the system and specifically you can argue that even the major crypto companies binance coinbase ftx whatever um they all have some degree of id log audiology built into dna companies based on like the founders and like the vps of product and whatever like just there's like we're all like everyone here owns a bunch of crypto you know outside the job and like they all have ideological beliefs about x and y and z but like the people who work at like i don't know um let's just say revolut for example or whatever are like and new new bank in brazil like those people for the most part they look at crypto like their ideological beliefs are like 10x is not 100x lower than the people who work at coinbase and bindings and fcx and so they really don't care about all the stuff that we like to spend our time thinking about and so they're just going to be looking at like okay well like where where can i bring the users to get okay i want like a d5 you know money market and i want some loans and i want over collateralization and i want these risk parameters and i want some usd and usdt and i need like okay where do i get and like oh great solana okay like they're just gonna not care it's i think extremely rational for actually i think the substantial majority of worlds the world's companies as they look at crypto to kind of adopt that view kane do you have an opinion i've said this before on on twitter i think the demand uh it probably in some solana thread where people were um you know annoyed by something i said but um the demand for decentralization doesn't come from users right like users don't care they just want to consume something that has some benefit to them right i think the demand comes from the engineers who you know have a belief that not just that they're ideologically aligned with the network but that there is some practical benefit to being decentralized right and that you know being more decentralized has uh has more benefits right that but there has to be some practical benefit if there isn't like my thesis on ethereum is that like being on ethereum will over the long term be better that there will be practical advantages to being on ethereum because of the way that it's it's constructed and if that's not true then yes like of course people are just going to go to bsc or solano or whatever so you know when revolut or you know or a bank or like some some fintech looks at which of the platforms we can deploy on my my genuine hope is that the practical benefits that i believe that ethereum has will be obvious there you know why why are you going on here versus going on bsc right i think for for ethereum vs bsc you know we can kind of laugh about it because it's pretty obvious what the benefits are like you know i could just run my own database if i'm revolut i already have that right um so you know it's it's kind of obvious that you don't go to bsc but i think it's less obvious for solana and i think that's the concern i guess that i have that's to bring it back to you know the initial the kind of starting point that like if the practical benefits of being more decentralized are not 10x better or at least 5x better or something then yeah we could just see people you know going to a network that um you know maybe makes that trade off uh you know a little less harshly than ethereum does so a couple things first you know i really was expecting you guys to disagree more so it does surprise me how much you are agreeing we're both whales so like you know it can't be uh it can't be too bad right we can't hate each other okay well kane out of curiosity i mean it just sounds like you would never build on solana even as you talk about what the benefits would be to building there so why is that like ultimately what it comes down to is i don't just have an ideological alignment to ethereum i've got a financial alignment right like i you know i've got a big bag of ethan i'm i i'm here to make as successful as i can right so and this is i think the interesting thing about you know when you talk about uh someone a coinbase versus someone a revolut right like you know someone at revolut probably doesn't have a bunch of equity in like microsoft and isn't like in revolut advocating for like adopting you know microsoft like it's just not it's a weird thing in crypto where like you have this weird financial alignment of all these different players in the ecosystem i don't know if it's good or bad it's just a thing that exists right and so you know for me i advocate for ethereum because i'm both ideologically and financially aligned with it which also comes back to you know an earlier point around um i think that's why i'm pushing so hard for us to converge on optimism as the scaling solution because i think if we have a canonical l2 solution that is like you know the the consensus solution it will be much easier for us to compete with solana over the next six to 12 months right if we don't and it is super fragmented and there's no understanding of where i should go what i should do or which place i should be deploying to i think it'll it'll erode the value prop of ethereum much more so that's why i'm so aggressive about advocating for like we all need to get on optimism and even if it's not the perfect solution it's the best solution that we have and it's better that we all converge on something which is not too dissimilar to spf's argument of why we should all go to solana interestingly right so i think we're you know we're kind of in the same camp there i guess just with different conclusions one thing i will say is you know i think however much you advocate that everybody get an optimism like that boat has already sailed you know like already there's a fragmentation so yeah let's talk about eip 1559 most likely we'll make east deflationary um and that could actually obviously give some adrenaline to the price so do you think that would then change this dynamic that we're seeing where these other chains are taking market share because kane as you pointed out you know you're financially aligned to ethereum but obviously bnb and um and sol have really shot up this year you know they had lower prices and so it's easier to to get that big um jump so once we see um eip1559 go through do you think that then that could change that dynamic i think it makes it worse actually right like i think the price appreciation yeah no it's the price appreciation of these and the starting point that you know that most people got in uh it really makes it hard for that wealth effect to kind of spread right like if you think about the average person who comes into crypto and they want to maybe deploy 10 grand of capital right which would be pretty high but let's say they get 40th right now unit bias is a dumb thing right like if you believe that ethereum is going to appreciate on a percentage basis more so than solana or bse and you're just purely looking for you know capital appreciation then you should buy those 40 but there is an element of people want some level of meaningful ownership right and if i turn up and i can get much more meaningful ownership of something like solano or bsc it's not just unit bias there's there's other factors there where people feel like they just don't have a decent stake of the network right and so i think that that wealth effect that has really you know uh kind of accelerated for for bsc and solana is quite powerful in terms of locking people in um how distributed is it and you know how widely does that go i don't know the answer to that um but i do think if continues to appreciate and you get to a point where you know either 10 grand or 20 grand or something like that it actually makes it harder for someone new to the space to come in you know how how good do you feel about owning half any you know with your 10 grand or something like that like how how aligned do you feel to the network if you've got 200 millionth of the network or something like that uh it maybe just doesn't it doesn't psychologically feel that good so i think that's something that i i worry about is your price appreciation could have a negative effect the flip side is things like polygon and you know arbitrarium will obviously launch a token i'd say um you know optimism will pretty obviously launch a token so when these new uh layer two tokens launch i think that that will provide an opportunity for people to feel like they're getting in early at a lower you know price point lower network value um and that they can get alignment with even if they missed the e train or a boat or whatever analogy you want to use that they'll be able to you know get some alignment with these layer two tokens and i think we're seeing that with polygon kyle what do you think i think the 1559 narrative is extraordinarily bullish eve over the next minimum six months probably 12. there's never really been an asset in the world that has a credible claim on negative issuance a lot of people will find that very appealing and very intellectually interesting and then combined it's got these cool d5 things happening um and then move to proof of stake like it there's that kind of you know to 12 month horizon for you looks looks very very good which is why we're longitude the problem is can't alluded to is as the price of eqsd goes up ethereum becomes more expensive to use and and like even arbitrarily and optimism i don't think will be cheap to use they will obviously be cheaper a lot cheaper than the eth main net is now but assuming there's no subsidies i think you'll still be you know two three four five dollar transactions transactions are not going to be one penny or two pennies look again two dollar transactions are manageable for most people but like for the people who are putting in a hundred dollars like that's still not reasonable people are putting in you know a thousand dollars they can live with it but um for actually the long tail of retail it just it just doesn't work it still doesn't work it's just like a big logistical challenge and 1559 will short term feel very good um but like medium term could be problematic as cain alluded to so kane when you wrote your original tweet storm you might have seen ryan zur formerly of polychain capital and the web3 foundation tweeted back at you recommending that you reconsider it the quote us versus them mentality of maximalism and consider making synthetics cross chain and then he was like single chain apps are going to get dusted it is programmed so would you ever consider making synthetics cross chain and why or why not i so i think i have like three draft responses to that uh and i just i kept not publishing them maybe one of them was like a bit too aggressive and i was like i'm just not gonna go there um i really like ryan so um so i didn't i was like i got enough people that uh that i have debates with on twitter i don't need to make another uh twitter enemy um but his point broadly is true right like i i think that you know the ethereum community uh spends a lot of time talking about you know btc maxis and and how ridiculous a position it is right um we need to be very careful to not fall prey to the same kind of thinking right where we just assume that our position is true by default and never challenge it i mean that was part of what that thread was about that we should be challenging our assumptions and saying like is there something we're missing here the market is sending us a signal we can't just bury our head in the sand and say no the market's wrong we're right right like that's just not the right way to approach this problem if the market's making bad decisions for the wrong reasons on some level we've still failed because we haven't given the market the information to make the right decisions for the right reasons it's a communications issue but art like like regardless of what the reason is the market is doing something that we don't think is a good idea so we're wrong right like just by definition right um and and we need to work out how to fix that problem um so i think ryan is right to come back to like would we look at cross chain i mean we looked at running on eos in 2018 right like we you know we were genuinely considering that um we ended up deciding not to do that and and doubling down on ethereum and i think that was the right call but synthetics has very specific challenges around running cross chain the interesting thing is going from l1 to l2 and running across both chains will make that problem a lot less hard in the future and and you know we will be able to support other chains much more easily because all the infrastructure will be there i would imagine most likely it would be other roll-ups whether they be zk or other optimistic roll-ups would be the more likely adjacent place that we would deploy um and for the reason that you know kyle sort of mentioned as well like we don't have the uh the infrastructure to spin up a ross team to go and you know uh rebuild all of our contracts and deployment solana and and that would be very challenging we could do it you could do anything but it would be a lot of resources to throw at something like that so i think it's going to be much more likely that evm compatible uh chains will be where we go in the short term but we're not ruling anything out you know we try not to be and i should also say like when i say we there's a community that decides this stuff like i don't decide i'm just someone who says things on twitter like at this point right so you know like personally even if i said we'll never do it i can't guarantee that that doesn't happen you know the community could say actually this guy's an idiot let's go on solana tomorrow yeah i think your twitter bio right now says former benevolent dictator of synthetics is that yeah but it's true yeah it's true yeah so in the same vein of my previous question i was just wondering so obviously you know we have this thor chain that now makes it easy to swap between different chains and so if we're starting to see things like that then does that make this question that we've been discussing in this episode moot meaning you know will we eventually just see users seamlessly going to different chains rather than staying in specific ecosystems and if so then will that just kind of make this multi-chain world that kind of grows the pie for everyone and it you know it it's like ethereum will get bigger sauna will get bigger bsc will get bigger etc and it's not going to be kind of this little you know like uh tribal tribal view of crypto yeah i have some non-consensus views on this question um so one of the common things you see is people talk about like you know back in the day like make in the early internet software days uh like making standards work together and there was competing standards and those people got together and then trying to make interoperation standards and there's a whole ton of history of this happening at many different layers of the stack for like networking pieces of the stack through like kernel pieces all the way through like the browser and html and all this stuff kind of a recurring theme in the history of software and the biggest takeaway from kind of that seeing that history play out many times across many layers of the stack is that the answer is always interoperability and that it's not one size fits all and things kind of evolved to deal with the backwards compatibility basically like different things evolve at different speeds and then everyone has to realize they have to play nice and they all have to talk to each other later on and a lot of people have have used that historical framework to say they were therefore with very high probability the future must be multi-chain for that kind of same basic reason i think that's wrong-ish it is obviously right-ish today um and that i mean if you look at our portfolio like we're a big thorough chain position there's a lot of position to get position like we're we are obviously money says that we believe that's happening and i think with basically 100 probability that will continue to accelerate the world become more heterogeneous both within ethereum and outside of ethereum um over the next minimum 12 months and probably 24 to 36. but like there are real costs to having multiple chains uh and those costs are not just like developer the dev x costs or like some standards organizations cost it's actually user costs in terms of forms of gas and the form of latency um the moment you do anything cross-chain you guarantee are increasing gas costs and you're guaranteed increasing latency cost and those two dynamics did not exist for all kind of previous iterations of these types of like what i'll call stan interoperability kind of standard battles at least not in such an explicit way where the cost is not measured in billionth of a penny where the cost is measured in like dollars that's a really really big difference and so being able to stay synchronous being able to stay composable i think is uh is a lot more important than uh the kind of historical perspective would lend you to believe um so that was my long rant i'll i'll end it there kane do you have an opinion and like broadly i agree right like i think yeah i think there's a reason why we're not talking about cosmos for example right and and there's a reason why we're not maybe maybe it's a bit unfair to polka dot right i think but still like you know this kind of architectural decision of creating all of these little zones and having them all talk to each other um i just don't know how how sort of credible that is as a long-term solution right that's why that's why again i think solana um you know going down this path of making trade-offs that you know ensure composability for you know the longer term uh versus you know things like sharding and and you know various optimistic roll-ups in different flavors you know competing with one another i i think it's it has the best chance of unseating ethereum right like it's it's the thing that concerns me the most right because it's a good pathway and you know when you get to start from scratch three years after someone else has done a whole bunch of dumb things right you can learn lessons from that and you can make optimizations and improvements right um it's just a reality right like you know we're still very early like we don't have enough uh attraction and momentum as an entire ecosystem to say that you know any one particular thing is going to work and continue to exist right so um that doesn't mean that i don't think ethereum can fix some of the issues and and you know i think some of the trade-offs that it makes are the right trade-offs um even though they're challenging but i do think that uh ultimately we will probably converge on a network that people you know will will use because of that composable factor right i don't think we're gonna have these weird zones and i think there'll be a way to kind of you know aggregate them all seamlessly uh you know potentially like um like we've seen in the amm space and in d5 where you get these aggregator layers sitting on top but they have to be in the same place for that aggregation to work right it's really hard to aggregate across these different zones because the cost and latency that it introduces and the lack of composability so i just think that uh that we will end up in a situation where you know most things the vast majority of liquidity you know it won't be winner take all but it'll be winner take most and and most of the liquidity will end up in a single place and that will be the place where people go my hope is that that's an optimistic roll up on ethereum um but i can see a world where that's not the case as well interesting yeah speaking of the aggregators i did notice you know one inch is on uh binance merchant but i don't believe it's on solana so that's kind of interesting given everything that we've said so far um well we're well over time but there were just kind of a number of different topics i wanted to hit so i just wanted to make sure to ask questions about this those items um where can people learn more about you should view and your work yeah so it's easy to find me on twitter my twitter handle is just my name so it's at kyle simani um and then multicoin has a blog we publish stuff every now and again our website is multicoin.capital for me twitter mainly um my handle is k-a-i-y-n-n-e um and i publish stuff on the synthetics blog as well predominantly so that's blog.synthetics.io all right great well thank you
