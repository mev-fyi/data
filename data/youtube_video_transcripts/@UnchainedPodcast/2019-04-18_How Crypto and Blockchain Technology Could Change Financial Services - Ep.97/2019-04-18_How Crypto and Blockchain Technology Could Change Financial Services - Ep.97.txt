[Music] hi everyone Laura here two announcements first this is a special episode of unchanged from the CMA Global Leadership Conference in Naples Florida there I spoke with Arthur Hays co-founder and CEO of bit Mex Dan apr√®s chief marketing officer of digital asset and Alexis Ohanian co-founder and executive chairman of Reddit and co-founder of initialize Capital we cover how public and Commission chains will compete with or complement each other our blockchain technology will affect incumbent financial services and how it has already improved in itself hint as a store of values one answer we discussed whether or not crypto represents a new asset class why the crypto winter is helping to improve the space and what the launch of backed and fidelity digital assets could mean going forward it's a great episode I hope you enjoy it the second announcement in case you haven't heard it on the regular Tuesday episodes is that the 100th episode of Unchained is coming up which is crazy so for the 100th episode I want to hear from you you might have heard that I'm soliciting voicemails and audio recordings from you and past guests I have a bunch already that have rolled in and super fun listening to them I love these messages they are great thank you to everyone of you who sent one in if you haven't yet and you want to join the fun and also if you want to hear yourself on a show

months cryptocurrency anti money laundering regulations go global are you ready avoid stiff penalties are blacklisting by deploying effective anti money laundering tools for exchanges and crypto businesses the same tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy do you have an idea for a blockchain app but are worried about the time and cost it will take to develop the folks at asier have you covered the new Azure blockchain dev kit is a free download that gives you the tools needed to get your first app running in less than 30 minutes learn more at a kms unchained or by following them on Twitter at MSFT blockchain hi everyone welcome to our panel crypto and Orden flashing and the crypto revolution I'm really excited to be here and to talk with you about what might be a little bit less familiar to all of you than some of the other panels today why don't we start with a little introduction from each of our panelists we actually selected these panelists that kind of magically represent sort of the spectrum of things going on in this space so Arthur why don't you start so Martha Hayes co-founder and CEO of bit Mex we are the largest trading platform for crypto we do about two and a half billion US dollars a day of transactions on our derivatives on our platform I'm Dino pray I'm the chief marketing officer at digital asset we are a blockchain start up in the the permission space dealing with solving problems for for traditional finance for institutions and traditional assets headquartered in York and led by his life masters and we being around for about four years now I'm Alexis Ohanian previously co-founder of reddit and now co-founder and Managing Partner of a seed stage venture firm called initialized capital and we've made a few crypto investments were early investors in coinbase d/dx coin tracker and a few others so now I want to get to know you a little bit I'm just curious to know how many of you feel like you could comfortably give an explanation of Bitcoin to another person okay how many of you feel like you could comfortably explain what a blockchain is just someone else okay and what about etherium how many of you feel like you could explain that okay a little bit less all right so we actually have some decent fluency in the room but why don't we start with at least a slightly more basic question and through this I think you'll get to understand sort of the spectrum of views that we have in in this panel but the Bitcoin white paper came out about ten years ago and since then the technology has developed in numerous ways many of them unpredictable and I'm just curious to know what each of you think the future this technology will be you know why are you in this and down the line how do you think it's gonna take and frankly also have will it change the lives of the people in here who work for financial services no first so I got involved in Bitcoin when I lost my job in 2013 and I started trading at full time for a job and then I got into trading derivatives over that period of time and what really struck me about Bitcoin in the whole crypt of industry is for the first time you basically have direct market access for people who otherwise when interact with financial markets especially in North Asia where I've but the past 10 years of my life it's really compelling to see you can open a smartphone open up an account and start treating pretty quickly in this new asset class and I think 24/7 trading of all types of different assets is something that's going to be the future and that will bleed into the other markets that we're all familiar with you know FX fixed income and equities so my journey started in this space and in 2014 I started a company called hyper ledger where as a co-founder and CEO and really that was one of the first sort of what now become known as permission blockchain so recognized Bitcoin and personally was very very fascinated by it but realized that part of the technology that's one specific use case peer-to-peer electronic cash and there are lot of properties of that system which are ingenious to solve that particular problem but started to look at how we can actually apply that technology to to traditional commerce and traditional financial systems so really it was about looking at that permissions technology where you know your vendor you know your your customer but you still get a lot of the same benefits that you do on though on the crypto side or the public side of freeing up these these siloed assets and complex workflows which introduce risk and latency in the systems so the enterprise space is a little bit younger than the crypto space released being about sort of four or five years now but it's very much coming to the point now where we're moving into production with some of the most but some of the largest financial institutions in the world and I think the the audience here on the enterprise side can can benefit a lot from having that that real-time data the audit ability that you have with public chains but still keeping information confidential and secure and allowing you to actually innovate a lot more faster upon that that base I got exposed to it on reddit of all places those early communities were largely you know technologists and crypto anarchists and and it was the world of hobbyists you know I personally held some for for a while now just as a curiosity and when initialized made the investment in coinbase I believe it was 2011 or 2012 was that seed investment and at the time you know Bitcoin was probably at five dollars the idea then was hey if this works this can be discouraged the internet now with the benefit of hindsight we're still not there yet clearly I do think as a store of value Bitcoin has been and this is particularly for people outside of this country has been a tremendous resource and we're already seeing even anecdotally money getting moved out of countries on thumb drives where where gold is literally being confiscated from people as they make their way out of there was an example a friend of mine tweeted a few weeks ago out of Venezuela but they were able to get that currency though the currency they had stored digitally in Bitcoin out and safely and so as a store of value I think we already have some really good proof points and even though those currency swings seem rather intense to someone who's lived in a nation where there is even more political uncertainty and even more currency fluctuation Bitcoin actually doesn't look so bad and and now what I'm really excited in is investing in companies that are building infrastructure level technology to do hopefully a lot more using the blockchain as a technology and and not really paying any attention to currency speculation so I think you've just heard here we've got these sort of like parallel tracks all unless you could say one is using that technology in existing financial services the other is using it in what I call creating this parallel financial system almost so I'm just curious to know like how do you think these two tracks will develop will they be in competition or are they in competition with each other are they going to converge in some way do you see private and public blog chains working together in some fashion down the line so when when sort of started in the permission space I was hanging out with those those crypto anarchists and bitcoiners of which I am largely one myself but you know when I would started doing that everyone was saying oh you know you've found Bitcoin and you're here to help build something better or I'm here to improve bit and that's not at all what we were trying to do and and really I see them as completely independent tracks that they aren't competing they're just two very different applications of the same technology then in some ways happen to look very similar with the solutions and in some ways are entirely different so if you're not building a peer-to-peer electronic crash which really that the key property is censorship resistance if you're trying to apply that to two institutions you have those you have physical locations who abide by regulations who have obligations to their customers and to their shareholders censorship resistance isn't really something that that most people here are trying to solve for so it's a very different application some of the same underlying technology is similar but yeah it's in seen and competing anybody else have an opinion on that I'm curious to know what the public blockchain people think yeah I mean at this point if you don't need such as of resistance why would you ever use a public blockchain that's extremely expensive it's extremely slow and you have to have a totally different toolkit of engineering skills you know the coding on the actual Bitcoin D is actually pretty difficult and which is why you know theory M is a Java based sort of scripting language and it makes it a much easier for people that get into it but if you're just an enterprise and you want a better way of transferring data or a better database then no private you know DLT type block chains are for you you don't really need to interface with Bitcoin of some other public chain yeah yeah that would the first question we ask when we see these crypto pitches is does this even need a blocking or even does this even like can a just standard basic database just solve this problem because there is this there's this hype cycle that we've gone through and that it were fortunately at the outside of it now but but people will just try to shove like they'll just try to shove a blockchain in anything where it doesn't actually make sense at all and where a traditional database is actually perfectly secure and perfectly reasonable if anyone recall Long Island blockchain might be instance yeah literally putting it in a sock just to take advantage of hype yeah that's a bad idea so we're not speaking of though investments there isn't this view that crypto represents a new asset class and Morgan Stanley recently put out a new report saying that that's what they thought that it was what do you guys think is that something that is true or not what are you what's your take I think it's sort of a blend it's still extremely small any of that market caps what two hundred billion dollars Apple has more cash in its balance sheet than the whole value of the industry that we're talking about so it's insignificant in terms of where it is today could it becoming a bonafide asset class in the next ten years maybe still jury's out on whether or not Bitcoin is actually secure over the long run it's had a decade which is pretty good but it's still an experiment so I say you know jury's out but it looking like it could be a new way of raising capital sending value around the world I was really tickled by all of the talk of VC being dead because of icos now this part of this was my own self-preservation instincts right no one wants to think that they're gonna go extinct but I have to be self-aware enough to think okay well like and we can we believe we can do everything in tech better cheaper faster why not VC but we've seen from the ico surge and then crash and all of the just garbage coins and money scams and just awful things that that really should get prosecuted to the fullest extent because there was I mean actual charlatans taking advantage of people but we've seen now this this kind of realization that that maybe there is something more here we just have a long ways to go and need to be building really earnestly about it and as an asset class I mean I I aim for about 10% of my net worth in crypto and and my bet simply being that if this future that we hope for technologically pans out this this will be a really material investment but it's still tremendously risky that's interesting and when you when you say that are you holding your own private keys some in a couple of cases for some of the more speculative coins but for the others they're actually just stored on Shane plug coinbase and I trust their security better than better than mine well so actually let's let's talk about that like you know this is kind of a new paradigm right where this is when people use digital money now it's generally in the it's under the purview of a bank where they can call the bank and say hey something that happened you know there was a proton in charge or whatever so how do you think we can get like real adoption is it going to take a lot of Education what what will it take for both institutions and people to get into the space and to safely hold on to their coins we've got to make money at the end of the day so you know institutions need to look at Bitcoin or Bitcoin trading poly is the easiest thing for a financial services institution to look at and ok can I make five to ten bucks for a seat for a dude sitting there or women trading most likely probably you will not make that amount of money and which is why you've seen some of the bank's backtrack their crypto desks or they've sort of put them on on the back burner so it's really about how much money can you make what's the volatility what's the volumes you know we sort of come off about seventy percent in terms of the the price this year volatilities down massively exchanges are firing people so it's a very volume different business and there's no volume there's no excitement and you know the institutions won't get involved but at the end of the day it's can you make money trading it and if the and if the answer is yes they'll find a way to do it yeah and I think there's there's still a lot of infrastructural pieces that need to be built out when you compare you know the traditional equities market to to the crypto markets they still look very different in terms of 2.0 you know holding your own private keys or custody solutions you've got exchanges where a lot of the focus has been in the initial days but operating as custodians and and our central securities depositories and in many ways and they're still sort of one you know even more centralized ironically than than traditional finance is which has multiple different legal entities playing different roles and within that service so I think that we'll need to start to sort of tear away different aspects and different roles within the market to allow institutional access to really arrive and that that is being built now and then to your earlier question on perhaps how we see these two converging between the permission world and the crypto well I think that that could potentially be a very interesting match where you're actually using the public chains essentially as a settlement layer of the the ultimate underlying asset but all of their financial workflows and the lifecycle management around that could be done on a per mission distributor ledger amongst traditional financial institutions and speaking to custody we've invested in a company in Canada I wish I could tell you about but they're not public yet but they're working with a big B Bank and and I think this is this is a perfect example of the kind of infrastructure investment we want to make because like it or not every industry is going to be a software industry and especially when it comes to to crypto you know these are these are banks that we protect not with guns but with code probably some guns too but but the the strength of your security really really relies on the strength of your engineering I can safely say that even in the valley the the best startups are fighting for a very scarce resource that is extreme top engineering talent and with such high competition among the most appealing companies for an engineer to work for that does not leave many options for the Fortune 1000 and so a big trend we're seeing especially in early stage is is companies with top-flight engineers who are starting their own businesses building software and solving these problems at an enterprise level now we're like 10 years ago they would have done a software-as-a-service business we're like yeah take out your credit card for $10 a month you can sign up for Dropbox right now what started as a little interesting project by Drew now a multi-billion dollar company but today we're seeing that engineering talent goes straight to enterprise because they know they have this unfair advantage because engineering talent is so so limited right now and and these solutions that we are going to need have to be built by someone getting your blockchain app off the whiteboard and into production can be a big undertaking from connecting user interfaces to integrating disparate systems and data blockchain app development can be time intensive and costly well the folks at Asher have you covered with a few simple clicks the ash blockchain workbench can create a blockchain Network for you pre-integrated with the cloud services needed to build your app and with their new development kit users can extend their app to ingest messages from BOTS edge devices databases and more it's free

how effective anti money laundering tools help keep your crypto business safe and trusted learn more at Cypress comm slash Unchained cipher trace is securing the crypto economy I want to also just bring in kind of some of these moves by Wall Street too to figure out where all this stuff is going because here in 2018 we've seen this massive bear market in the crypto space and as we talked about the speculation from icos is dying down and yet fidelity is watching trading for institutions and backed now this joint venture by the Intercontinental exchange and Microsoft and Starbucks is going to launch so why do you think we are starting to see I guess traditional financial services get into this space despite the lack of adoption and their market they probably started planning it and you know last year fall crazy and then now it takes a while to get up get ramped up and you launch it to a massive bear market so I think it's probably just uh the path dependency of when the decision was made versus actualizing the outstripped product I'm sure if you had to pull these same executives today and say please go to your board and approve a Bitcoin something or other right now they probably get shown the door so it's I think you know luckily they've gotten it through you know the committee that they need to get through and we have new products to address new markets that are going to be coming online but I don't think that's any verdict on Bitcoin being any better or worse right now yeah I think you know that the key point there is that the lag between in enterprise software is very hard it takes a long time to do right particularly when you're you're building or replacing mission critical systems at September systemically consequential markets and so yeah I think that the these projects probably got started a long time ago but they're also probably looking at the long term trend here this isn't just a you know what's the price today and what's the interest that are building out the infrastructure to it to enable access to this that that frankly their customers are demanding and and 1tc and so you know we are seeing that you know the fruits are that starting to be born now and I'm sure that will continue next year yeah and I still yeah I deeply believe that this is a worthwhile investment to be making now we're obviously all on a panel all about blockchain so we believe this but I feel really privileged because we have a front row seat to all these emerging technologies and and I literally every day of meeting with founders who I have to decide are going are they going to credibly build the future or not but a very small percentage of them actually do succeed and and there are there's a disproportionate number of very smart very driven sort of credible founders who are building the infrastructure around the space right now that leads need to believe that there are real solutions that are going to be made here and and the best part of this crypto winner is it scared away a lot of the charlatans and scenesters the people who are building on crypto right now who are you know credible builders who come from from companies they don't have to but who have come from companies where they shipped real products who are smart who are driven like the ones who are building right now and who are building in the space are are very encouraging yeah that's it so from my point of view it's it's good to see that hype fade to a certain degree both on the crypto side and on the enterprise side because you know as that like I said there's so much more focus on what's real yeah the things like crypto kitties get attention because they're fun and it brings a theory em down but now that the other hype is starting to dissipate and there are actually real projects emerging yet that have often been a little bit quieter than some of these very high-profile funner more crazy use cases but the real projects such as the one you know that the edge ASX have the Australian Securities Exchange I mean they're literally replacing their entire post trade system for equities with a distributed ledger with a digital asset platform and that is going into production in q1 2021 but you know it takes time but as the hype dissipates people will focus more on what's real what business problems can we actually solve because ultimately that's where the the biggest returns are going to be yeah the part that that has me so excited are the things if you think of that ledger that's like a physical book like literally can old-school ledger that says you own a small share of blah blah blah and you paid this much for it and here you go thinking of that as a global book that everyone has a copy of that we can all check in sort of real-time is is very appealing to me because it can replace a lot of things today that are so boring but necessity necessary in systems where there isn't sort of trust and that usually involves lawyers and accountants and I almost was a lawyer so maybe I'm still bearing some grudges against that industry but there are so many needless hours that are wasted by humans that are this work done by lawyers and accountants and that that can be replaced with a kind of of ledger and we're seeing this where you know I there are some interesting projects around everything from like real estate - you name it where it is really beneficial to be able to use software to decide ownership and create markets that literally never could have existed before because to take fractional shares of ownership and actually trade them would have required insane amount of tedious time and work and and just wouldn't have been viable but these are in their infancy right now and so I can imagine having having seen having tried to buy into a commercial real estate project as just an individual accredited investor and dealing with and just even seeing all the emails and signatures and PDFs it is it was long screaming for a software solution and this is one or for instance like the technology built on blockchain can really solve it's Caleb Lee and and create some really interesting new financial opportunities let's put a bit in that because I actually want to come back and ask you a little bit more about that but I also want to go back to what you were saying before where you know we started by talking about these moves by these traditional financial services firms where they're gonna start trading Bitcoin and ether and stuff like that but then you were also talking about what you're investing in and what developers are building how how do those two relate to each other because on one side it just sort of seems like trading and speculation and then on the other side it's like building technology so what how did those connect well I think it's some of it comes down to founder expertise and background and there are the the really interesting infrastructure solutions that are being built now for the enterprise are usually coming from founders who have spent time there who already have the relationships who saw this and Attis you know they were they were tapping into their are slash bitcoins subreddit during work hours with their wheels spinning trying to figure out a way to do their day job in the financial world better cheaper faster using this software and and but we definitely see these two camps there's there's the the founders building tools to solve firms a coin trackers one that lets just retail investors just better track their crypto taxes this is a very important thing a bunch of taxpayers learned last year and to build software to do that because you know TurboTax out-of-the-box is not handled to equip calculating your tax exposure from all of your trades across here in different exchanges or what have you and so there's that sector which is still sort of working to just solve problems for the average consumer but then there's this infrastructure one that folks you've been talking about where they're not getting headlines because it's not as cute as crypto kitties but but because someone has a relationship to the financial world they know they know what it needs and they're willing to do the long slog of development that could I mean very well take years before they even get something to their customers but they're willing to take it because they can see 10 20 years ahead it doesn't seem like there's any other way to do it yeah I think I completely agree with everything you just said I mean where were a particularly fun mix and I was a lot of the people I'm a bit of a sort of naive optimist when it comes to technology you know looking at it what can we do what's possible then partner that with people like our CEO blade masters who have been there done it at you know JP Morgan for 27 years who actually know why things are the way they are and you know it would be nice you know someone to disintermediate CSDs or make real-time settlement you know t0 across the board but there are practical reasons why this is not possible or take an act of Congress to actually change some of these regulations so that's probably not the best thing for a startup to be at are trying to be taking on so instead we're working with those same institutions and they recognize that too and they are actually adapting and evolving so agree you've got to have that that mixture off of the deep experience of being there done it across the board and then also a little bit of you know new startup and enthusiasm to to get keep going for as long as it takes well so but I am curious because I feel like these are still you know pretty different tracks to one beyond this what they call decentralized finance track where it's not a company but it's this team of developers and then they you know get this crypto asset and incentivize the heat bears on this network and I see these developers they're building decentralized money markets or decentralize derivatives or decentralized exchange and I'm just curious how does that and the does that end up really competing with traditional financial services down the line or do they work together in some way or what's the vision there I don't think most of these things are actually decentralized I think a lot of this talk about the centralized whatever service is is because at the end of the day I think recently the ether Delta that the founder was paid a four and a thousand dollar fine of the SEC for her so-called this centralized application so they centralized a fine right on him for his decentralized application I think I also read hide X which is a large larger decentralized exchange is now instituting kyc on their platform which is kind of in crown giris with this whole aspect of anyone can trade but then we're doing kyc nu so obviously somebody's afraid that they're going to prison for something which then means it's not really too centralized so I think a lot of these this decentralized is just a way to get money from people who don't know what they're talking about or don't know what's really going on behind the scenes so really the only pseudo decentralized asset out there is probably Bitcoin and that's not even that the centralized in and of itself so I think we have a long way to go before we get to this utopia of decentralized applications we really have a lot of centralized moats in different parts of the ecosystem yeah yeah this is like much to the chagrin of a lot of the crypto anarchists who I'm sure got were most excited earliest the sort of earliest adopters of Bitcoin I do think ironically most of the applications are gonna end up looking very much like the traditional financial sector just done better cheaper faster because of software what's what's I think always been true as I've seen it in technologies is users will gravitate towards the better user experience the thing that is better the thing is cheaper the thing is faster and and and I think to a certain extent participating with the existing system allows for a better user experience in nearly all of the sort of typical use cases and so then you're really you're really then optically or if you're trying to go the fully independent sort of Technica's dream playbook you're really just trying to fulfill a need for a pretty small sector of the market which can be done and god bless you good luck but it's yeah I don't know I think what we're gonna see in the next 10 years is gonna look a lot more like traditional finance just done like I said better cheaper faster then the sort of utopian crypto future yeah completely agree with buy it and think you know what end-users really one largely is convenience and and they're quite happy in many cases to trust them to teas such as yourselves for for these services they don't trust blindly or completely but they're they're happy to like you know coinbase most most Bitcoin new Bitcoin users buy on clean base and leave their coins on clean base it's a centralized entity and they some of them never leave that system so I think with the decentralization a lot of people often get caught up in thinking that's the goal with Bitcoin decentralization wasn't the goal that censorship resistant cash was the goal and decentralization was a requirement in order to achieve that goal and there are many benefits to centralization and on amis of scale and there are some decentralized blockchain systems which are trying to decentralize Amazon Web Services but having massive data centers co-located with tons of storage it's very hard to compete with because of the price pressures on that likewise in financial services I mean when you've got central counterparties and CSDs playing central roles in entire markets there may be downsized to actually even attempting to decentralized sighs yeah and I I let me I don't want you to think I'm totally well okay the only part I will point out though it is really special about this that that release valve does exist though and and I think history has enough examples my father's side of the family all fled Armenia during the the genocide with whatever they could stuff in their clothes right like there are enough examples from history we're having this kind of store of value that isn't in ways you know censorship resistant governors is we're gonna call it is actually I think a really important part of this technology it's not a thing that hopefully any of us will ever have to really need need but there are so many people in the world for whom that is I think a powerful and and and very appealing value to it that that even as we basically reinvent the wheel I thrilled personally as the technology that this this sector now does exist because I think that right is one that humans deserve to have so before we continue I just wanted to know we have a little under 10 minutes left and so if you do want to ask a question you can ask it through the app and I will see all those but I do want to ask my next question which is you guys are kind of a more sober Bunch than the typical developers that I interview because a lot of them are all about like the centralization and it's good at you know all this gonna take down the financial services system and for corporate you know yeah are gonna be too big to fail and and all that but I've always wondered listening to them you know at the beginning of the internet everyone always said like oh it's gonna be peer-to-peer communication everything and now everybody just uses you know like Gmail and Facebook Messenger and Twitter and iMessage whatever so so it's gone this route of centralized even though the vision originally was decentralized so I'm just so curious here we are seeing also all this regulation and obviously in finance when you deal with money there's a lot of compliance issues so do you think that will give a further edge to to more centralization in the space rather than decentralization it really depends on what you want out of the product that you're looking for so if you need to run with clothes on your back and then some type of money bitcoins a great option if you just want to speculate on some sort of financial asset do you really care that you have to do kyc or maybe it takes a day or two days to get set up with an account if the product makes sense and the user experience is nice I mean we have you know Robin Hood were essentially retail consumers in the US have basically given all their trade data to hft firms and they're making a killing so it's all about the user experience we're repackaging very simple financial instruments and making them friendly on a tap and people like that and they don't really care what happens behind the scenes so I don't think that the consumer really cares they're lazy if it looks really nice it has to centralise I'll use it if it looks really nice in decentralize they'll use that too but the underlying mechanics of the micro structure of what you're offering is irrelevant yeah same way that you know no one really cares about what's behind the hood but I know Google servers or or any any tech company rap that you use Hoover just works if he was decentralized or it's a single company it's all as the price is the same and the experience is the same the car arrives most people don't don't care so I think blockchain will it just be a behind the scenes technology that has end-user benefits or financial institution benefits but ultimately has to compete on its own merits against other traditional technologies and new technologies it's I don't Li be underscoring what they're saying it is it's got to be a better user experience now if someone comes along with the decentralized uber that effectively lets me as a driver I mean I'm not long on that because it'll all be self-driving anyway but that would let me accrue more ownership in the greater company like okay maybe this is interesting enough but but the end the day the car still needs to show up as fast or faster right the user experience we like to think that is this user experience 10x better than what exists so was uber 10x better than hailing a cab in San especially in San Francisco yes it was a hundred thousand times better or really anywhere and if it doesn't answer that with a strong yes it's probably not gonna be enough all right yeah well well I think we'll find out because I think the whole I see a craze was based on this idea user ownership and it so who knows if that was you know in a zero now right I will I will play devil's advocate to myself I think the one area where we're starting to see the pendulum swing back a little is around privacy controls and I think I think Facebook is teetering on a point of sort of general like there's a there I did you see the launch of portal know any God I live in a bubble anyway Facebook wants to put a screen in your home and a camera and record everything and you can talk to your relatives but the the the backlash within this sort of early adopter ecosystem was strong and those would be the exact people I would expect to want to have this thing on you know cyber monday ordered for Christmas so it leads me to think that there is some movement away towards some of the be like sort of the the Facebook over share when it comes to privacy but if you're actually trying to pitch me on you want to build the next Facebook simply having it be decentralized still isn't good enough no matter how like tense it all makes us feel it sucks got all of our photos and knows exactly whose profiles we look at and how much time we spend on them and how Facebook used to have software to predict when couples would break up that this was years ago I don't think it still exists but the we're all kind of okay with it right we're like yeah all right whatever and that's that's just the reality unfortunately I know honestly the more I learned about privacy no more I'm shocked that people don't care and the more it makes me frightened for the worlds that I know I'm in the minority because it's true most people don't care um so let's go back to token high Security's in this short amount of time we have it's funny because last night at dinner art there was saying that you weren't super interested but Alexis you just said you worked so I want to hear you guys talk about it what's your take on token I securities what's you know what do you think the potential is and why are you excited or not excited about them I'm not excited because I think one of the reasons why I kind of like the ICO as it was before the saft monstrosity was anyone with a website and a Bitcoin or ether address could put up some gobbledygook of a white paper and say if you believe in what I'm saying give me some money and I'll ask you some tokens at a later date has people got afraid that they're gonna be put in jail for basically giving offering these maybe securities maybe utilities what-have-you they sort of migrated to a very legalese term sheet which looked like some sort of reg whatever offering and that sort of sort of got away from the whole ICO game the sto or the securitized tokens I don't see how retail investors who have been powering this whole bull market in the whole crypto space are gonna get excited about an equity that just looks a little bit like digitized token and so I really don't see any sort of really USP on these securitize offerings and they're just going to be very heavily regulated and can these startups afford to pay a ream of lawyers to get licensed in every single jurisdiction that they want to trade in I just don't see it yeah i this is one where you're gonna probably be surprised to hear me say that I would love to see the SCC do some really thoughtful regulation around it because I do think well-done regulation could help enable a ton of activity that just doesn't exist right now we know there's so much capital seeking yield in the world and I'm thinking of traditionally really sort of non dividable or non easily securitize Abul assets that could be but the 100% I mean the costs that'll get it started will be tremendous this would need to be and we are seeing the more thanks to a lot of very well-funded VC firms very over capitalized early-stage company that basically says yes look we're gonna spend a year building this technology we're gonna spend countless dollars on lawyers and and be like a fat startup to try to make this happen long term I'm still excited on the the shorter term the we talked a little bit of crypto kitties I am interested to see what happens around these non fungible assets and you're gonna really have to bear with me here but did any of you collect magic cards none of you okay one great ok so right there is a baseball cards there we go even better ok everyone did awesome so right there's this there's a value there because there is a scarcity of that one Billy Ripken special limited edition card where has a profanity on his bat right it's a great card that is a special thing because of the physical world we only printed a certain number of them and you can prove that this is the real thing there is a version of this there are versions of this and the infrastructure for it in the works right now for digital versions of this these non fungible assets and crypto kitties is one kind of weird game version of it I would love to see a digital Magic the Gathering version of it and there's a if you go on eBay right now for like a Black Lotus card and a market if people have determined that it is worth a lot of money and I think that there are ways to look at things like what fortnight has done to generate literally billions of dollars in revenue with digital goods that you cannot move out of that one ecosystem and actually allow it to be tradable broadly but it still very early days yeah however I would just say you know to those points with security tokens if it's if it's sort of on a public chain sense you very much agree with Arthur in that you know really the what's the incremental benefit of doing an ICO over a typical equity issuance and and really right now the only increment benefited skirting regulations and as those regulations are clamped down on the people that are doing that you start to just rebuild exactly the same system as today so if the the sec were to come in with with a more relaxed regulations for the ico market or a security token market they could equally apply that to existing equity crowdfunding today and allow the same access through the same system so I'm not sure what I see there the incremental benefit of building that entirely permission system on top of a permissionless base which is inefficient why not just use the existing system and improve that prove that you have today yeah well I think these are all the sorts of questions that we all have to use when we're engaging these various projects whether in the public or private space so thank you so much for all your thoughts thank you you [Music]
