[Music] givedirectly is a non-profit that lets you send money directly to people living in extreme poverty and it's now raising crypto funds to support a basic income program in liberia just 333 dollars will fund a year of basic income for a recipient this panel i moderated which you'll hear in this episode helped raise over 900 000 which will support 27 villages with a basic income for a year to try to get to one million dollars i'm working with them to offer a special match for unchained listeners when you donate any cryptocurrency to give directly this month it will be matched which means doubled there are fifty thousand dollars in matching funds so if we use the whole match that's fifty thousand dollars times two plus the nine hundred thousand dollars from the event equaling one million dollars in crypto supporting a basic income for thousands of households in liberia next year visit givedirectly.org unchained and your crypto gift will be doubled again that's givedirectly.org

you can store manage and grow your crypto portfolio all from a safer wallet visit brave.com unchained to get started hi everyone thanks for joining us and i would like to introduce has team qureshi managing partner at dragonfly capital and caroline who is co-ceo at alameda research and arthur brightman of tasos was he i guess you could maybe give your views not an effective altruism yeah um so i i do consider myself an effective altruist which makes the less maybe less interesting answer um why do i consider myself an effective altruist so effective altruism is kind of a bundle of ideas but the core of the idea is basically the notion that we should try to think scientifically and rigorously about how to do the most good and it kind of points to the fact that a lot of people when they think about doing good whether it's doing charity or trying to be impactful in your personal life or your your community engagement most people kind of they approach it and just sort of doing things that feel right or that feel good to them and effective altruism is is a a sort of framework of thinking about um sure it's good to do good things but you should try to apply the same level of importance that you apply to things like you know to business or to technology or to you know things that we think are really important we should take the same standard of care toward thinking and making sure we do things right when we're trying to do the most good that's effective altruism in a nutshell and i think to me as you know somebody who spends a lot of my time working on uh really difficult challenges um i think helping the world and improving the world is one of the most important things that we do and therefore it should require the highest level of thoughtfulness and rigor around making sure that we do as much good as we can when we're trying to accomplish that and caroline do you have an opinion on this um yeah totally agree with everything hasid said yeah i guess i've been kind of involved in effective altruism for a while i think i first found out about it in like freshman year of college and i was kind of like oh well yes of course like this all makes total sense that you should you know be thinking about costs and benefits and you know adding it all up and trying to maximize your impact uh when you're you know doing philanthropy uh just like anything else uh and yeah i think over time i've kind of only been become more convinced for the most part that the effective altruism movement is kind of like onto something good uh and we're definitely still like figuring a lot of stuff out and i feel quite uncertain about a lot of things uh but i think like it's you know goals and intentions are uh overall quite admirable i'll i'll do it very quickly philanthropy wonderful thing and charity will give you like helping the less fortunate wonderful thing and obviously if you're going to do it you don't want to be ineffective so you know in some sense you know you say effective altruism it's almost you know unimpeachable um but you know if you go in details i think the movement is very very tied to a uh utilitarian view of uh of ethics and i think it would uh reject utilitarianism as the uh as an ethics framework i think that you know eventually you cannot um ground ethics in anything else but human intuition you know there's no um you you can't derivatives from reason and so ultimately the best thing you can do is get some sort of logic closure over human ethical intuitions and i think that the ontology is a is a better match than uh than utilitarian edx so i i do think that you can be cognitive about it but i would say there's a tinge of scientism when you try to uh compute uh dly and everything and and try to compare things which i think are a bit uh incommensurable i'm being pedantic here i think you know overall we're very well aligned with the with your overall goals you know saving lives is a wonderful thing this is you know this is more of a full disclosure in the sense of like okay this is how i'm thinking about this i'm not not fully on board with the whole uh uh quality daily program all of that but you know i i think these are mirable goals overall in general okay and actually um before we continue because it looks like haseeb wants to maybe rebut or something oh no no i also i i think uh well first of all i i i don't think that well wait but before you before you do that arthur can you just define deontology because like you just threw out a bunch of big words but i don't know if everybody even knows what they all are yeah yeah so i mean you could bro in rose strokes you could look at three on three different principles of ethics um uh utilitarianism essentially tries to say let's do the most good for everyone you know pain and suffering are bad things we want people to be happy so whatever action you can take that make most people happiest is is a good one deontology is more there's a list of things that you can do which are interestingly good or intrinsically bad and primarily you should not be doing bad things like hurting people so even if for example hurting people could you know eventually cause a lot of happiness you should not be going out and you know hurting people and virtue addicts is no what makes you a good person is more about uh intrinsic virtue um it might be your intentions how you're thinking how you be how you behave not directly your actions and not directly is your consequence um there are many other sources of ethics that exist but these are broad uh these are the main broad ones i would say and and definitely there's a utilitarian bend to effective altruism uh i would say a lot of people recognize themselves more in deontology or probably in some mix um between the two depending on the situation and depending on context and i think it's i think it's okay i think it's okay that overview of edx might might have some internal conflict it's something that we've evolved it's not it's not a it's not a true you know ethics is not the truth of the universe that we go out and discover it's something that's intimately tied to human nature and so in that respect i would reject what peter singer is saying when saying like oh yeah you know we reached the conclusion that everyone is doing something bad at all times if you're doing that then you know that converts to what you know in some sense you have to ground ethics in something and that thing is human nature and not not some external objective reality okay let's see yeah so i'm i'm a little loathed to turn this into a debate on the philosophy of ethics because i think that you know this is a this is ultimately a crypto giving panel but i guess what i'd say as a kind of somewhat mild defense of effective altruism is i think you know crypto is actually probably the perfect place to encapsulate the difference between utilitarianism and deontology because so just just to just to re-articulate right like utilitarianism the idea is that you know as long as you get the right outcome um then it's all good right whatever you do just get the right outcome and that's really what matters and um deontology says there are some things you should never do even if it gets the right outcome right like even if it makes everybody better off don't do this because it's wrong in some just deeper fundamental sense and um you know crypto is exactly the place where the way that we look at everything in crypto is through the lens of game theory right we look at the incentives and we say look we don't say there are good incentives and bad incentives and this kind of incentive is evil and this kind of incentive is virtuous and that's why you should only get these ones we say look the important thing is we want the protocol to be secure we want miners to do the right thing we want people not to get hacked we want to create this like global property system and uh it you know when you're if you're looking at that lens and that comports with the way that you think the world ought to be the way that people design these crypto ecosystems is really kind of this utilitarian kind of effective altruist sort of mindset which is let's design the system that improves the outcome for the most people and uh in that way i think for a lot of people in crypto certainly not everybody but for a lot of people in crypto this you know utilitarian approach to thinking about what creates the best possible world really resonates because it resonates with the way that crypto designers create these economic systems and of course if you look in the regular world nobody designs economic systems the way that crypto designers do right there is no top-down view where we write a white paper where we like show you know we write these math proofs that show how we're maximizing utility for every party like the real world is full of deontology right the real world is like no no you never do this you have to give subsidies to farmers you have to like make sure that you have a you know child care subsidy and blah blah and it ends up being this big distorted mess of incentives that maybe get it right but like most of the time don't and um it's kind of like i mean i think like covid is a good example where a lot of deontology stuff just goes out the window look we're about to die there's a pandemic coming we got to lock things down we prevent you from leaving your house we're going to force you to go get a vaccine you know you're not allowed to work it i think um the last couple years and living in crypto i think is a good way to test your intuitions of which of those two sides you tend to fall on whether you're more utilitarian or more deontological and i think you know caroline and i are definitely more on the utilitarian side arthur much more on the on the deontological side but uh again we could we could go this is the oldest debate in ethical history so we're probably not gonna resolve it on on this zoom panel well but i i love how you related it to how yeah crypto networks you know like they only function well if the game theory has been designed right right so to that end i mean like if so obviously we do already have some crypto organizations that are trying to do philanthropic things like bit give or give crypto and so what do you think would be the best way to kind of like design these for you know whatever your uh desired outcome would be and caroline or or hussybor arthur any of you can answer this well so give directly is a great example of this right it's actually it's actually um a really elegant sort of economic expression of how to make giving better so before you give directly most there was always a perception that if you just give money to poor people they'll go spend it on dumb things right they'll go spend it on booze or just you know random crap and like they're they don't know what's good for them and so that's why the charities that traditionally did the most work in very poor countries would be like great we're a chicken cherry and we're going to give them chickens and they'll grow the chickens and it's going to be great and the idea is like look we will buy you books or we'll give you clean water or we'll find some specific thing and we'll create this really complicated supply chain to get it to you right and um you know generally speaking people from first world countries love these kinds of charities because it's easy to imagine like look if i just give them money who knows that they'll spend it on but if i give them books you know i they'll read they'll get educated like that's wonderful right so they send them tons and tons of books and um you know as was mentioned in the previous panel a lot of times what happens with these charities is that one they're very expensive to administrate and there's you know there's a lot of costs that gets lost in the middle but also the you know a lot of times what happens is people get the books or the chickens or the whatever and they go sell them because they don't need chickens they don't need books they need like this other thing that only they know they need and it you know there's this there's this classic economic argument of why gifts are very inefficient and it said you should just get cash and give directly is the it's the it's the charity instantiation of that argument it's like look we let's assume that people are rational actors which you know welcome to crypto right as people are rational actors and they know what's good for them they they understand their situation better than you do and if they have a bunch of money they're gonna go spend it on the thing they actually need whether it's like their roof is leaky or you know their kids are sick or you know some other thing that they you know they'll just go spend their own food and it's very difficult for us to anticipate that but the people who actually are in need know exactly what they need and so you should just give them money and they'll figure it out that's precisely what give directly does and has demonstrated through their own randomized controlled trials that uh they end up having more positive impact per dollar transferred than the other comparable charities that might just give people medicine or clothes or books without actually knowing what they in particular need and wait but also what about i'm curious about give crypto because that one is obviously different they're giving crypto and i you know of course hopefully this is not um too negative of a question but my obvious question is the people on the ground there what if they can't turn it into their local currency or otherwise use it you know then what good does it do so um you know and i'm not going to pretend to be some expert on give crypto so maybe they have some way to make sure that it is useful to people but is is that kind of like like it like is it is the best way to effectively use crypto in philanthropy to just adopt the give directly model but do it for crypto someone else want to take that uh yeah i guess i don't i could say say something though i don't know a ton about give crypto uh so i can't really speak to their model uh in particular yeah i mean i think like yeah i'm not really sure in practice kind of how useful it is to give crypto to people in developing countries uh i think that like we have seen like i guess people saying give directly that direct cash transfers are a great way to help the global poor yeah i also think that sort of crypto is potentially an exciting way to sort of democratize finance and to uh kind of yeah basically make it easier remove a lot of the frictions that people experience with i don't know banking systems with yeah countries with potentially oppressive regimes uh stuff like that and kind of just yeah put people in charge of their own money um so yeah i don't really know how useful it is right now to give people crypto but i can see it as kind of a potentially useful thing someday at least yeah i would say the the potential of crypto transforms um things here it is mostly more in terms of like bringing cheaper transfers or bringing um cheaper access to financial infrastructure overall but you know that's something that has yet to uh to happen or to continue happening and so if you know if the matter is is making a direct gift then you know if you expect a person if you expect that once a person receive you know cryptos are going to start creating it if you had to pay for whatever they need then you might as well send cash directly you know it's not there's nothing uh there's nothing magic in uh in in sending it in versus any other form of payment uh to to come to to to add to what essie was saying about um living directly i like to compare it with basically it's the index fund strategies of you know of charity you know you could try to pick stocks and do all sorts of trade and you're gonna end up paying a ton of commission and a lot of people like doing this because they feel like that they're doing something and they're optimizing and so on so forth but at the end of the day having luffy and just going straight to the point uh is a lot more effective uh and this is the same thing you know it just cuts out a lot of the uh uh impression of like doing something you know like really doing you know the oh you know if only we do that and this and that but at the end of the day uh it's it's it's a lot more direct and and a lot more effective than almost every other intervention and steve did you you said earlier you had some thoughts too on that question no i mean i i agree with it and i think it's a it's a good example of the effect of altruist approach in action but in general you know i think the question of giving crypto for skipping dollars my understanding i'm not super familiar with give crypto but my understanding is that within give crypto they they run these uh trials within like an entire village and uh in that village there are some money changers or basically people who can facilitate the transfer of uh crypto into the local currency uh but i'm i i'm not an expert so i can't speak to it anymore than that i think the idea is that it lowers some of the infrastructure costs to do these transfers directly in crypto and of course you know there's a lot of people with a lot of money in crypto who can spend money yes as we are seeing now in the whole nft craze um so there is a question from youtube that uh is probably relevant here to this give crypto discussion um whether whether we're talking about the charity or or just anybody who's giving crypto directly is there a blockchain that seems best set up for cross-border transfers particularly to poorer countries and that is from alexander wanna do you guys have an opinion on that uh i guess yeah i don't know anything about uh there's something that would make that particularly the case uh i would imagine probably just blockchains that are generally better like faster and cheaper would be better for this as well i would say it's satisfaction in the technology of the blockchain as it is a function of um liquidity in the local market yeah i was going to say since bitcoin is the most liquid it would probably need and but well i guess maybe ether is a close second um but both of those chains have you know um a lot of high transaction fees at the moment so probably for bitcoin lightning and then for ether one of the oh i was gonna say one of the layer twos but but that that opens a whole nother can of worms too so yeah i don't know if anybody has another suggestion for something that's kind of like liquid but also less expensive apparently in the philippines if you play maxi affinity you can actually turn smooth love potion directly into philippine pesos i have heard now so that's super interesting um one other question that i wanted to ask you was i mean so this is like slightly parallel maybe to the philanthropic question but crypto has long touted its ability to democratize fine finance and i wondered if there are any ways that you're seeing that crypto is already having the kind of positive impact that philanthropy typically aims for like are there any particular uh crypto projects that you feel are having the kind of real world impact that typically like charities are are trying to accomplish i mean i would raise my hand and say axe infinity is probably the most obvious in that um it's kind of like a giant gift directly for the philippines where essentially it's this giant transfer from speculators to you know poor filipino people who are who are playing the game which i i've heard at least i mean i think it's gone down recently but that you know the average uh filipino who's playing axe infinity is making twice their average wage which i think is is actually quite quite high for a direct transfer program so it's it's it seems it seems really good um but i've heard that those numbers are going down a lot because the inflation for slp has kind of hurt the uh the the economics of later yeah this is not a sustainable this is not just exciting well as long as people are donating it's sustainable there's no values that's being brought to the other player by the presence of like these you know it's just like all farming with crypto so it doesn't really bring value to the other players so at the end of the day i think you know in a transition in a transition period this kind of transfers can happen but then they get out completed away so you know it's like okay this is great for the like filipino players who did this for for for a while but when i hear oh it's a new paradigm like ah no it's really not uh you know there's a lot of them there's a lot of innovations that happen in uh in in crypto from a technology called standpoint uh even new financial uh primitives have been uh invented like uh perpetual contracts for example that's an innovation in the crypto space but it is not like changing economics uh that's a that's a that's a that's a big beef so it's not going to uh magically lead party because people are gonna play uh uh are are gonna farm gold in a uh in a video game and is there a way to kind of keep that from happening where it's sort of you know the benefit just peters out and it only ends up accruing to a small number right at the start you have to look if you know are when they're playing the game are they making the game experience more fun for other people you know it's like when i engage with the game you know do i engage with other characters who for example maybe play by people in different countries in which case you know if they're bringing real value for the other players like making the game experience more enjoyable then sure then maybe you have something sustainable but otherwise you are just talking about a transfer from early adopters to to uh to formulate adopters to early adopters in which case it's it's completely zero-sum and so you know no that's not going to be uh uh stay much if you want something stable you have to bring value in in a sense of like those players are making the game more engaging more fun for other people which which is not what's happening here so actually infinity is just one of like you know a ton of crypto things that are happening in general and and it's kind of like you could sort of say it's new i guess it took off kind of about a year and a half ago but are there any other um crypto projects that you feel are accomplishing the types of things that philanthropy tries to typically accomplish well i'd say one of the things that we see a lot in crypto is the attempt to fund public goods because of course crypto um you know traditionally the way that public goods are funded is through the government because the whole point of calling something a public good is that it's for the public meaning that you know no individual private actor takes on most of the benefit from a public good so it's very hard to have these be provided by just people doing their own thing in the marketplace and of course crypto doesn't have governments it has sort of has daos and foundations which sort of are like pseudo governments and as a result there there has been a lot of experimentation among these dows and foundations and organizations than that to try to solve for the problem of how do we solve public goods now most of these are constrained to the public goods within a particular ecosystem and of course like most of the people who are in the global poor who have the most need for help around the world they're not hanging around on blockchains right now and so we're you know you're not you're not gonna find them on uh you know on bitcoin or on tezos or on you know any of these platforms um and so it's probably the wrong place to look for them right now in the same way you know like you think of the early internet eventually everybody found their way to the internet and found it really valuable like almost you know they're they're what four or five billion people now who are online so tons and tons of people in the world including the global poor use the internet but it took a while for them to get on and i think you you'll probably see the same trajectory for crypto looking to the early adopters for crypto as a place to try to you know engage in in philanthropy especially if you're treating the global poor that's not the only form of philanthropy you're you know it's not it's not the right place to go looking for them web 3 means freedom from big tech and wall street with more controls and better privacy but your crypto wallet is

[Music] all right well so here we are at this moment in time where as we all know uh crypto has changed the fortunes of kind of a new generation of people um you know there's a lot of youngsters out there who suddenly find themselves incredibly wealthy uh from whatever it might be selling nfts or uh or it can be older people who you know got in on uh ethereum or bitcoin in the early days whatever it might be a lot of these people i think are trying to think about how to give back um you guys might remember back in 2017 we had that anonymous bitcoin person who donated 86 million dollars which they called the pineapple fund how should people be thinking people in crypto be thinking about how best to donate their money are there like particular frameworks that you think are useful and obviously there are certain considerations like taxes and stuff that probably come into play here yeah i can respond i guess uh yeah i mean i think it's a really hard question uh and it's something i've spent a lot of time thinking about and still feel very uncertain about and plan to spend a lot more time i mean i think like one sort of question is i guess donating now versus later is a big uh one um where there's kind of the options of doing now or like investing and doing later and that's kind of i think there's like yeah to answer that you have to sort of think about what sort of return on capital you're getting from your investments at the moment and what sort of returns you might expect to be getting from charities uh and you know how how uncertain you are about charity and how much do you think you might change your mind about what the best charities are in the future yeah in terms of actually sort of thinking about places to donate i think like it has to start largely with like thinking about what you value and like you know do i value you know reducing the suffering of people or i don't know empowering people or you know people you know in our country or other countries or animals people in the future uh kind of yeah think about what's most important to you and all that and then i think like there are various kind of organizations and people who have like done a lot of looking into charities uh and trying to like determine their effectiveness i think like if well was like a really good charity evaluator for looking at sort of global health and global poverty interventions i think a lot of like people in effective altruism and like center for effective altruism have kind of like more sort of broad recommendations as well the one thing that i would say which i think maybe is not um just a you know complete recapitulation of caroline's point is that um i i do think that you should have a very strong bias toward giving now as opposed to giving later i think a lot of people have this belief that um okay i'm gonna kind of go bill gates style i'm gonna like make a bunch of money and then you know at some point in the future i'll know that i've made enough money which for a lot of people in crypto is you know it's like there's never enough money but you know i think they imagine when they started their trip like i'll just make a couple million and that'll be enough and then i'll you know i'll be happy so the one one thing that i think probably um all of us have been in the space uh you know i think the three of us in this panel have been very fortunate that we've done very well in crypto and we know a lot of people who've done extremely well in crypto and um the one thing that's really obvious is that there is no special amount of money that's going to make you happy um happiness is just totally orthogonal from how much money you make and when you realize that um you the other thing you realize is that what you do especially with respect to giving also changes who you are it it really does affect over the next five to ten years of your life if you try to go i'll call it bill gates style of okay i'm gonna make as much money as i possibly can and then when i'm you know 55 and you know i need to repair my reputation then i'll go start you know giving it all away and um i think it is it's sort of much better for the person who you become in the process of that for you to give along the way because it i think it's a little bit of a fallacy to think that um even if when you are just kind of young and bright-eyed and kind of at the at the you know early stages of your career um if you believe like yeah yeah when i make all this money i'm gonna go give it away i'm gonna be this awesome person but not right now there's a good chance that by the time you make all that money you're not going to be that awesome person anymore and that's why i think it is actually really important just to kind of um maintain your own uh virtue as a human being to give along the way even if it's not you know crazy you know 50 or some you know huge amount of money but just keep giving along the way and keep thinking actively about how to make your life about something bigger than just yourself the way i would appreciate that i would say don't give out a sense of duty is because there's change he wants to see in the world and you know hopefully it's positive change and think about you know what is the change you want to see in the world and how can you miss enacted with giving and you know what one of the points with me in the earlier panel very quickly you reach a level where your lifestyle is not going to change that much with um with more money and so there's been a positive change i would say in the world which is that a lot of um western people used to buy this um silly positional goods like you know buying a lot of gas and some so forth and in some sense philanthropy has become i mean it started in 19th century but more and more and more it has become a positional good that people spend on and it's more about you know it's about self-actualization it's about saying like okay this is the change i'm gonna make i'm going to eradicate this disease or you know i'm going to make sure that people don't go hungry or you know this is a change i want to make and i would say that's a um i would i would recommend approaching it through this um so this lens rather than a lens of saying like what is my duty what do i have to do i think it's a health i i think you see us here did you but at the end of the day you know it might lead you in the same direction anyway all right so we only have a few minutes left i'm gonna ask one question that actually came through in the suggestions that were pre-submitted and i i think i tweet this to to have my own take but somebody asked how ngos and dows could work together which i thought was interesting but then it had me thinking i wonder if ngos kind of maybe are like the sort of intermediary that crypto was trying to eliminate so you know how would you figure out if an ngo kind of is like part of a bureaucratic problem or if you know they're actually maybe the on-the-ground experts who know better what to do with the money than than a crypto person might so i'm curious you know how you think of that well at the end expensive monopoly i'll go ahead and uh give my my thoughts here is that i think asking the question of like you know are ngos good and do they belong in the future vision of the world where dows are a huge thing it's almost like asking like do companies belong which like ngos are just such a broad category like there's so there's so many different kinds of ngos and some of them are boring intermediaries who just kind of get in the way and others of them are fantastic and they they do the underground on the ground work and they are the sort of last mile which a dow almost by definition cannot be because daos are not physical they're not physically located anywhere or at least so far so i think you know if anything it seems like there's a natural cooperation that can't happen between taos and dao's as a way of uh sort of digital coordination of human beings and of capital whereas ngos and i think at their best are ways to uh sort of tap into local knowledge and know how and build local infrastructure in a way that requires you to be local right like ngos almost by definition are in a certain place uh they're an or non-governmental organization in a certain country not associated with that government and some of them are great and some of them are awful uh same as daos there are some waffle doubts and some great ones i do think you know hopefully we see uh fewer or or leaner organizations involved you know to the point that as he was making uh earlier at the end of the day uh a lot of people know best what they need and uh you know if you give them cash and they know how to use it then sure you might still you know have some sort of organization involved and it might be an ngo on the last mile to distribute it but i would say the amount of managerial overhead or discretion that's that's involved in this in these organizations can be uh a lot smaller than it is today okay so we're going to close out we have one minute so try to think of something quickly off the top of your head but this question came in from youtube from james hartley he asks for people working in the crypto industry looking to move into a more impactful slash altruistic role or company what advice or opportunities or projects would you share so looking for you know like one word to one sentence answers go go work for ftx yeah very great answer yep or come come work for alameda arthur there's two ways you can do and again i'm going to use some of some media terminology here you know you can earn to give so try to get a very high paying job and give a bunch of money and for some people that might be the most effective thing to do but if you directly you know through your work onto an exchange there are millions better things you can do than working crypto you know and i love and i love crypto and i love this industry and everything about it but you know you'll have more you know you'll save more light you you'll have more lives working on you know i don't know better ways of fixing nitrogen to plants uh you know the the impact or or even self-driving cars like the impact is just is it it's just a lot more massive and isis is you know thinking that there's so much bug but like going to work for crypto exchange is not is not it i'm i'm so i'm sorry we all with all respect and love for ftx it's just i i had a feeling arthur was going to go in that direction so i'm not a panelist but i will say i did mention a couple of the groups that are working in this area that give and give crypto there are others um that are more uh like kind of uh focused in one area i featured some of them on my show like um code inspire uh founded by freshda ferro furrow they do coding academies for girls in afghanistan and they accept crypto and teach their students to code solidity and things like that so you can check them out yeah i'm blanking on some of the names of the other ones that have been on my show but um you can actually just maybe scroll through unchainedpodcast.com and kind of try to see what are some of the more on the ground type organizations that are working otherwise this has been a super fun panel um you know it's like a really important topic but i'm glad that we were also able to have a bit of spicy takes on both sides so thank you so much to all of you panelists [Music] you
