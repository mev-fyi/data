powered money today my guest today is Tour de Meister founder and CEO at adamant capital welcome tour Laura your Twitter bio says you're an economist and an investor what do you do in the space yes so I've been mainly trying to understand the space I've been fascinated by it and I understand I try to understand it from an investor's point of view and most specifically value investor like I want to know what the long-term value propositions are in the space and of course early on there was no such a thing as a space there was just Bitcoin so that's been my endeavor I've published several reports over the years articles presentations that I've given and so I'm just trying to help myself and in doing so and by sharing that I'm I'm hopefully also helping other people and for adamant capital are you managing other people's money or is it your own yeah I can't say much about it yet but yeah I mean it is it is a fund and we're focused on Bitcoin like we want to align ourselves with long-term Bitcoin holders can you say how much you have in assets under management we haven't launched yet so no okay and how did you get into this space because before I believe your company was adamant research and that was how I came to know you originally so I guess adamant but all must be a new transition for you why don't you just describe from your history in the whole space sure yeah it goes back to probably like 2005 where I started becoming fascinated with economics I wasn't too excited about the types of economics they were teaching at the university is more interested in methodology and the philosophical side of things so we we ended up founding our own research institutes so I did I translated some books for that and we had organized seminars and I I published my own research in an academic journal about business cycle so to research on on business cycles and let's see and then I just had this tentative ambition to do something in academia but then the actual the real world financial system started rumbling in the state's 2067 and I just became more uneasy and then of course it rolled over Belgium where I lived at the time there's this giant banking crisis and that was to me a catalyst to start writing and researching more about real world events and and and also looking at financial independence and and how to invest those kind of things and and I did a free newsletter at the time there was I don't think there was Twitter or it was very small at the time so I had a free newsletter and then I came in touch with a publisher and by 2011 launched my own subscription based financial newsletter and in preparation for that and also to kind of I just really had this thing where I wanted to I wanted to be resilient and I felt like I wanted to be able to think outside the box so I did a pretty long research trip to Latin America and I learned about Bitcoin and inborn ascites actually and in Argentina were some friends of mine were literally mining Bitcoin in their basement because that was the only way for them to to get it and even back in 2011 they saw it as an alternative investment so that was to me that perfect context to learn about it because not only could they obtain it they could send it to anywhere in the world despite these very harsh capital controls at the time and so during this time you were managing your own research outfit is that what your job was yeah so I was I was authored a newsletter we had a new newsletter every month we had a model portfolio that people could follow and then so I had partnered with a publisher and he would you know promote the newsletter and I would just do all the content and then how did you start becoming an expert in the crypto space yeah so I mean early on I just I really felt like I knew nothing so I had to just dig in deep and and at the time it was a lot of Bitcoin talk looking at the forums and I was lucky to be in touch a bit with be thorough as well who's a Belgian and at the time already was doing some work on core development so I did an interview with him to learn more and I went to the London 2012 Bitcoin conference and then it was just mostly reading and absorbing I was like in terms of interacting I was pretty passive but I I just wrote for my I think before Bitcoin had $30 I had something like 8,000 words of analysis that I did for my readers so yeah I was really I it really struck me as something big and then from 2013 onwards I start doing a lot of conferences and then from summer 2013 I had the sense that my readers weren't coming along greatly like they were still thinking that maybe it was a Ponzi scheme and you know their age profile was also not like mine it was more like people in their 50s maybe older and I think only about 20 25 % actually came along and they actually did buy some Bitcoin which I mean obviously is huge because that means they got in in 2012-2013 but it was also hard to promote the newsletter based on Bitcoin because it was just so small and I wanted to do it full-time so in 20 summer 2013 I found a successor and I just became independent I just start managing my own portfolio and yeah I've been independent since oh okay yeah cuz I think that explains why I don't believe your research reports were paid right they were free yeah I just wanted to like to me it's like research you know that it's really a conversation starter and I've just been looking for you know the right people to partner with and and also just even geographically getting settled to quite a while because I didn't want to keep living in Belgium so yeah that's why I just did the free research so I had noticed that it's been a while since you published any research reports unless it's that somehow my email stopped receiving them what were you doing during that time oh yeah so I have been I have been doing work but the reports and the the pieces that I put together I've been sharing more privately like it's it's more with potential investors and kind of like sharing thoughts that way although I did do a medium post pretty recently I think when Bitcoin was like $8,000 is something we put out a piece saying that we we don't think bitcoin is gonna reach new highs in 2018 but yeah it's it's true like I've been mostly focused on getting the business up and running how do you value in crypto assets that's a great question because people used to you know ask me like Oh what do you think of this what do you think that and I would just kind of like you know I have enough to cook opinion or think about it but lately especially the last year it's been more from an institutional perspective that people ask me like how do you value this asset it took me a while to understand but what they really mean is like you know do you do you have a method methodology do you have some kind of a system that you can apply or some kind of standards and we actually did the exercise and we decided to develop somewhat of a system to to start assessing long-term value potential of of crypto assets and so in that framework we look spell chiliad developers the quality of the developers involved that has the the largest weight in the in the rating we also have a section for code review where we actually look at the repository there's also economically speaking it has to make sense we also don't want a pseudo-scientific you know pseudo technology to be involved like we want the components of the projects to be somewhat established and proven or at least endorsed by developers engineers with a very high pedigree so those are the kinds of things that we look at and so not so much at the community or if there is you know influential people that are backing the project that I don't think reflects much of of long-term value you are known for being a Bitcoin bull maybe even a Bitcoin maximalist yes no yeah yeah Vitalik has called me that yeah it's kind of there's this word in Dutch it's called inclusion um so it's kind of like a name there's an equivalent for it in English I can't think of it right now but it's like it's like a name that people call you in a derogatory way but then you embrace it and you just you just kind of say sure like that's my name and you make it into something positive so I feel that way about this this maximalism if you look at how i think in 2014 vitaly defined it it was very you know it was very like kind of dogmatic and almost religious sounding like thinking that you know bitcoin is the only way and there's never gonna be anything else and but i mean to me i've always been a cryptocurrency maximalist in the sense that I think that not that it should be that way but just that that's how markets work is that one protocol is going to be dominant and and with that I mean like 80% of the market tap or something like that and I've thought that when Bitcoin was you know Bitcoin dominance was 95% I thought it when I was 40 or 35% and today I think we're at like 55 I still think so I think I still think the long term market cap of the coyness is probably gonna be about 80 80 percent of or more off the cryptocurrency space and I do mean you know there might be some other securitized tokens or things that have value but I do mean the the coins that are used or meant to be money like oh okay so you mean among the cryptocurrencies and not among the wider world of crypto assets I mean because like if you start securitizing so if you start tokenizing securities for example well that's a huge market right if the Nasdaq starts doing that somehow and but even then I think that it's actually more likely that those assets will be will be connected to the Bitcoin blockchain like that that they will be in a sidechain or something like that because that offers the best security like I don't know why you would need a separate network but yeah I mean just in my mind cuz I feel I feel pretty agnostic about the let's say the token space when they're talking about how Bitcoin sorry how you know tokens could or blockchain could disrupt maybe like you know Land Registry or you know the the issuance of securities or smart contracts like to me that sounds like maybe video streaming in 1996 like you know it's a great idea I just don't know you know I don't know for 1996 or for 2007 so I don't know if it's way too early or if I'm just not not seeing it yet and I'm gonna be a bit slow to understand that so can you explain for me why it is that you think Bitcoin will account for 85% or some huge majority of this whole market and also can you explain how you can feel so confident in this belief when it's you know pretty early yeah yeah yes so the reason why I think it is because I really see Bitcoin as a protocol that is is used in conjunction with other protocols it's a low-level protocol its function is just provide security and the the idea from the get-go was that it was you know that layers were gonna be built on it and that is how how protocols scale and that is how digital networks scale and you see that also in biology this modular idea that the way a complex and robust system comes into being is by a very simple and robust mechanism that then has a new mechanism added to it and another and another and they all have different functions and so you get these layers on top of each other like how a city grows like it starts off with a defensible position close to the river and then over time it's like there's roads that are built to it and then that becomes the draw and then more and more layers are added to the city that make it appealing to live there so so the idea and especially that it's digital so there's no there's no borders like it's it's even you know there's no barrier to entry if you compare it to you know in in in the internet world or the internet startup world I do think there's more geographical boundaries like there is Google and then China has its own search engine its own e-commerce platforms and that has mostly to do with politics but when you're talking about these peer-to-peer protocols there are no politics so that's why there is only one BitTorrent for example there's only one tcp/ip so that's why I think when it comes to you know storing value because like the more value Bitcoin accrues the SiC more secure the network becomes so that's kind of like this virtuous cycle and then of course there's also the developers that have been building it and that are continuing to build it I just don't see projects that have similar pedigree when it comes to developers and and with pedigree I don't mean like you know noble genes or anything but just like people who have significant achievements in relevant domains like in peer-to-peer protocols in Internet infrastructure in memory compression in cryptography those kind of things so that's you know roughly speaking where I'm coming from yeah it's also like there are a lot of rare metals in the world but there's only one that's used that had has had a monetary function and that's gold so so similarly I think that you know there's there's these properties that Bitcoin has that make it the most secure network today and I think that once that position is there the olymbia effects kicks in over time is it the longer that exists the more likely it is that that the corn will have that function going forward and then you know when you think about applications or things that can be built on top of these block chains all the interesting ones involve a lot of value so that means they have to be anchored in something very secure so that's why I make that link of like well you know why wouldn't it be anchored into Bitcoin as well do you worry about the work on chains that will make multiple block chains interoperable kind of like the cosmos is of the world do you worry that they will kind of make it possible for multiple block chains to become prominent but not for anyone like Bitcoin to become dominant no I mean like I'm really a free market guy so like if people if people make stuff that makes you know things easier for engineers or for end-users it's just that's fantastic and you know if anything if people build bridges between these block chains then the market can only become more efficient because then transition from one to the other is also easier so so it's a more compatibility there is the more the market really has a say and and that means the end user so yeah no it's not worried but what I mean is you don't worry about your investments then maybe not turning out as well as oh yeah I still want to see I still want to see value right and so I like the framework I was talking about earlier like when I apply that to you know the more prominent projects I just I don't see value that's any that's anything close to what Bitcoin offers and so that I just don't you know I see more novelty and and you know more pseudo-scientific assert Asians and things like that okay well yeah let's talk about one of those because I know that you're skeptical of proof of stake but pretty sanguine about proof of work why so yea proof of stake to me is it's a voting system like I think in in essence it's that means it's a political system and I think that history is shown that political systems are not as robust as systems that are based on proof of work like you know there is this theory I don't know if it's true but that you know what was stored under the pyramids I think especially the Sphinx in Egypt that it was actually a sort of a library for a long time and it was there were like precious objects and and knowledge that that civilization wanted to preserve for I mean a bet for eternity and so rather than having a political system to protect it were you know there were guards and then there were all kinds of economic incentive to make sure that the guards were not dishonest and if you did something wrong and you'd be voted out instead they just built a giant structure on top that would be expensive to remove and that would even have value to preserve and that's why for thousands of years you know these objects because they have found things underneath them have been preserved so I think that and and you know of course in in the banking world we have seen some examples of you know fairly decent resilience like the Bank of Amsterdam was a full Reserve gold bank for about 200 years and that was a kind of a political structure but I think that those examples are way more rare in then examples that are aligned with the idea that you you you need to do work to prove that or or to gain access to a certain it's kind of meritocratic idea I think that is more resilient than a vote based system and so you know and when you then go into the nitty-gritty and you look at attack vectors there's always creative solutions possible to say oh well you know this vulnerability we're gonna you know we're gonna punish them in that way if they do this but then you know Paul storts has argued this and I think he's right is that you know the further you take those additional layers of trying to make proof of stake work the more your what you're actually doing is creating AAPIs kated proof of work so so it's still proof of work it's just in the shape of something very bureaucratic rather than just burning electricity and what do you make of hybrid systems like the D card system which has both a proof of work and proof of stake element I'm skeptical like I'm open to it potentially working but like to me to me really what what Bitcoin is is is a mechanism to convert electricity into financial reliability and so if you start injecting protocols with like you know some energy and then some voting and you and then I don't know I struggle to see how that's that's more efficient or better somehow or creates better reliability then than what Bitcoin does especially because you know eventually the the amount of energy that's burnt and Bitcoin is going to be defined by supply and demand like it's just gonna be transaction fees that pay the miners so it'll be it'll be financial institutions that will end up defining how much energy is is use the secure Bitcoin do you worry about how much energy is required to power proof-of-work in terms of the environmental impact not really why not yeah I don't really worry about it because and I mean I'm open to look I don't want to be dogmatic that like oh you know this is the end-all solution I just think that it's kind of the best we got that's kind of where I'm at I'm not like wow it's fantastic that were flaring off so much gas or whatever but but I do think it's important to to look at the type of energy that we're talking about like Bitcoin mining is the most efficient it's the most economically profitable if you do it in areas where you have low competition as an energy consumer so naturally that leads you to very remote areas where the energy is kind of locked in and hard to transport out of it so they like think about like Siberia or Iceland or Washington State you know all those kind of remote areas that's where most of the Bitcoin mining happens or like Mongolia now there is of course an environmental component if you're gonna like burn a lot of fossil fuels to do that but that's you know that concern is there with any industry is that you know it's just it's just a fact of nature that there's different shapes that energy takes but when it comes to you know threatening urban populations I think that is that risk is overblown like people are never gonna mine Bitcoin in New York City they're like it's it's always going to be in a place where there's very low competition I wouldn't say never I'm sure it's happened previously oh yeah if there's an investment frenzy then for a while it becomes profitable to do it even you know in populated areas but but over the long run I think mining profitability is gonna it's gonna be thin margins for miners just because you can compete from anywhere in the world like there's a zero barrier to entry I mean maybe some you know your latency if your internet connection is not very good you have a little bit of a disadvantage but that's not not too much because of the the block times being ten minutes it's it's fairly you know people are mining in very remote areas already so I think that because of that competition that the profitability is gonna go down and then it'll really come to like do you have you know two cents electricity and as soon as you go higher and any you know maybe Saudi Arabia maybe that's where citizens have access to anyway so I'm just saying I think that it's gonna be a remote areas okay we're gonna discuss institutional money bit mean and pick in cash but first I'd like to take a quick break for our fabulous sponsors Sun Exchange is a solar power marketplace for the crypto economy Sun exchange members all over the world are earning crypto

this is not legal advice I was speaking with tortue Meister earlier you mentioned institutional players what types of institutional players do you interact with and how would you describe their current attitude toward crypto and also how it's changed over time for me it's mostly high net worth individuals family offices I do talk to some other people as well but I think it's it's a bit too early for them to to get involved it's mostly to do with the custody of these assets and kind of closely related to that is just a regulatory framework like they're not comfortable that how how things are custody it looks very alien from kind of a traditional traditional financial perspective you know like for example how in exchange they have their own assets and then they have a market that they're making and then they're also storing the assets for their customers all at the same time that kind of freaks out large institutions because they don't know that they don't know that like they're used to a lot more separation of duties in in the traditional world and that kind of like checks and balances if you will so what do you expect in terms of the influence of institutional money going forward like how do you think it'll enter the space I think it's a little overblown right now in the sense that yes we have institutional involvement but they're pretty agnostic like there's a lot of trading firms that have gotten involved and they they're agnostic about the price they're just looking to make money either you know by betting to the upside or betting to the downside but they do add liquidity which is valuable over time but I see just a hesitation still from from the institutions that that are getting involved but then again when it comes to infrastructure that's where really interesting things are happening where technology providers are really trying to find how can we add value like we've done this we've done cyber security for 20 years 30 years how can we add value here in this space or we've built secure hardware for so long like how can we you know come up with her and I think we've seen it in the coal mining now is that more traditional players are coming out with their own chips and are competing with these Bitcoin startups that have kind of proven or I mean sorry mining startups that have proven that there's value and now it's kind of like similar to how Tesla proved that there's a market for electric vehicles and now we're seeing you know Jaguar and all these other companies come up with their own vehicles I think it's similar and that's great for adoption it's just fantastic that you know all this experience is now coming on board and building things that that regulators could be comfortable with and that end consumers might be able to understand a little better than what's been out there so far last year a lot of I guess hubbub was made over the launch of the Bitcoin futures but ultimately those products did not actually lead to a longer-term bull market and if anything obviously we've been in a bit of a prolonged bear market so what effect do you think the opening of backed which is the federally regulated crypto exchange that the internet till console exchange continental exchange Microsoft in Starbucks are going to launch later this year what effect do you think that will have I think is huge I think it's huge it's really important you know it's like institution that's what institutions want like they want this a very established firm to come up with their version or their answer to custody for example or trading or like they want they want like a prime broker like who is a prime broker in the crypto space right now like it's it's unclear right it's kind of like that the ultimate bank that is that is pretty unclear who that is and so like backed could could maybe you know have a role like that and it's also it has to do a lot with relationships as well like people want to work with companies that they already are comfortable with there's a lot of career risk involved like if you're if you're on the Bitcoin team or the crypto team of a big company and you recommend they work with kind of a a scrappy startup that has been around for two years that's a lot of career risk whereas if you recommend them to work with IC e who's been around for decades and they you know and they owned the New York Stock Exchange and now you know that's that's very different so all of that it's and and so of course last year we had the futures but you know they it was retail retail was was setting the price at the end like as when we went above like four five thousand dollars I think all of them the crazy run-ups was mostly retail investors so they didn't you know they didn't really care at honestly I don't think the futures brought it all down it's just that's more coincidental weight and so I'm sorry you thought that the reason the futures didn't have a positive effect is what and and then why is it that the action will be different oh yeah so there's just different dynamics at play like like retail investors are usually late and they usually get burnt and so you know they invested from five six seven thousand dollars up and then of course in all these other assets as well they're now down from the peak eighty five ninety five percent but that doesn't mean that these milestones are not important to have Bitcoin futures to have eventually a Bitcoin ETF to have you know the the tap for ice to have their own crypto exchanged it's huge because that that means high net worth individuals are more comfortable family offices are more comfortable and then endowments start becoming you know more able to also invest it just it's like it unlocks new markets does that make sense like it unlocks money that before could not invest and now they can so I'm sorry back she will have that effect but the futures somehow didn't well I mean if you're a big institution like the wheels turned more slowly and so of course they will have had meetings about this crypto thing but before they're actually ready to invest it could take many months so you know even if the price and also again there's career risk right if an asset is already up five hundred percent in a year and you you were the one driving that decision to pile in and invest you can be the joke of the company a few months later if it crashes right as this career is there is like and also like there's a little more maturity in the institutional space that no nothing goes up forever and and we've already seen several crashes so let's wait it out a bit so yeah you know it just things just take time okay and will that also apply it when Baxter arrives or will it not so I I don't know I to me I think the ETF is much bigger than that because ETF is universally accessible like its retail investors can buy it right away we saw it in gold it was like when when the first gold ETF arrived there was a lot of inflow because finally people could just you know in their Schwab account like click a button and buy gold and then and that that drove awareness and it drove the man I think it'll be similar for a Bitcoin ETF you mentioned mining earlier how would you characterize the current state of the coin mining and also China's influence on the Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin mining in particular I guess yeah well it seems like it seems like mining is it's becoming a bit less centralized with the you know seems like bit Maine is and some trouble in the sense that they haven't been able to come up with a new chip that is since was it the s9 which has been out for almost two years now which is a big problem because other manufacturers are coming out with new chips and as far as I understand the main chip designer has actually left bit me and I started to compete with them so to me this is all part of what I call and other people as well the commoditization of ASIC mining so that these chips become a commodity just like a chip for a smartphone it can be used in any in any phone and so you can just build your own wrapper around it or your your own software stack plug that in there but the chip itself is accessible to a lot of people and of course there's going to be some advantage to owning the you know the blueprints of the chip like I've heard that like Apple they they kind of keep the best chips to themselves and put in their own phones and then maybe sell some others and definitely Samsung does that so you know there's some advantage in and having being vertically integrated as a minor but I do think that a huge factor is going to be energy costs when it comes to mining more than the chips and up to now because we were kind of catching up with with Moore's law right now we were really at the cutting edge for mining chips and so the larger manufacturers are just gonna bring out new chips over time and the difference is going to be more made at the margin where you know if you have a deal with some some kind of oil shake who gives you almost free energy that that'll that'll make more difference so the result is that mining is going to be distributed over the world rather than concentrated in China because China doesn't have great energy efficiency like when it comes out tricity the costs are not that great you've been talking a little bit about bit Maine and I noticed that you have some pretty critical tweets about them or at least even tweeting critical articles about them what do you make of their plans to IPO yeah well so I don't know much more than what I've seen or what I've passed on like I said like this this chip problem that they have like that is very crucial right because if you're if you have ancient technology you get killed in in crypto like you really get killed very fast and and if you have obsolete Hardware it's just a brick like if you have you know Bitcoin mining hardware that is maybe you could ship it for incredibly cheap - maybe Venezuela or something where people can still squeeze a little bit of value out of it but you're gonna lose market share very quickly so that I think is a concern and I think that it's pretty common knowledge that bit Maine has not been very honest in terms of their strategies they've been very like you know scorched earth in trying to gain dominance and I think that has caused a lot of bad blood and people just wanting to compete with them rather than make partnerships or join them because they don't trust them yeah for listeners who missed my episode with David vorak of SIA coin and nebulous and now obelisk you guys should definitely listen to that that was pretty interesting conversation Bitcoin has decided to pursue scaling in the form of layer 2 solutions like light what activity are you seeing there and what effect do you think it is having or will have on the Bitcoin ecosystem yeah I mean lightning it's interesting how it's like a generational transition like that Bitcoin developers that I know core developers especially they're like early 30s more and then the Lightning developers that I see are like significantly younger and that's that's I think it's so cool is that they've discovered this niche where they can almost learn from the beginning as if it's you know we're talking Bitcoin in 2010-2011 and and they can just build stuff right away it's just fantastic to see these I think they call them laps lightning apps pop up here and there and people experiment I think the Lightning capacity is growing at 60 percent per month which i think is pretty incredible it's all very small so of course but but a Bitcoin is also very small in 2010 2011 so I think it'll be I think it's it's gonna be really big and I think that especially Millennials and younger are gonna run with this and and and you know when people said Bitcoin is going to be the the money for the Internet I think lightning enables that the Bitcoin main chain never had that ability but lightning transactions can actually facilitate millions of transactions extremely small transactions machine a machine payments all these things so yeah I mean to me it's it's it's something I didn't expect would happen like back in 2012-13 I just always thought Bitcoin was Bitcoin and it was going to be this kind of store value thing and that smaller smaller payments would happen through intermediaries like coinbase I just I didn't know it would be possible to actually have this decentralized payment network on top of it you are known for being pretty bearish on aetherium which is the second-largest crypto asset by market cap has a ton of traction and has seen a lot of activity in the form of thing like the Dow taking off I SEOs taking off a lot of developer activity around things like crypto kitties you know a ton of other protocols being on top of it that our er c22 incompatible would despite all this activity why are you negative on etherium yeah I've been an ether skeptic since 2014 actually I did a little or I took part in an interview with Joe Lubin and a few other people they were in Switzerland back then and I checked like the video a while ago and I asked my first question was what is going to be the utility of ether like what what are people going to do and there was like whoa it's a platform for experimentation and we don't know yet but I still have that question today like when I look at the etherium gaps I still you know what can you do there that you can't do on Amazon AWS or you know some kind of centralized server so that was one question and the other question I asked was how are you going to scale and the answer was we're looking into sharding solutions which is the idea that you split up the blockchain and you store it and you kind of spread the storage over a large number of nodes and then somehow maintain integrity or something like that and that was back in 2014 and they're still working on you know sharding solutions which I don't think is going to happen so so my skepticism comes from the place where I'm afraid that they tried to cram too much in one layer and they should have gone for a lean solution instead like Bitcoin while you just focus on security for the first layer and then you have applications and interesting stuff in higher layers like faster transactions for example or interesting smart contracts like that's that's a higher level application and and my worry was that if you cram it all in one layer you're gonna compromise you're gonna have like an inferior solution in all respects the only difference is then you can launch faster which is what they did they very fast and and so they captured this market interest for having your own tokens and you know maybe like the interest for decentralized applications in general and people who didn't really know how to code and see which and have this you know access this difficult infrastructure of Bitcoin they just ran with you know what was it again Python and at these at these Java this kinda like similar like easily accessible virtual machine languages that a theory have developed but I think ultimately my my concern still stands is like how is this gonna scale and how are you gonna keep it decentralized and I don't see it still and that's why long term embarrass and don't you worry about the fact that they do have a lot of developers working on it and now for that reason alone despite the technical difficulties that those developers will be highly motivated to figure out those problems and continue working on that platform yeah and I have a medium post about this it's like oh you know I'm not worried about the Bitcoin fork wars but I am losing sleep over a theorem but that's like I think I wrote that two years ago so right now I don't feel that like I want to stay humble in the sense that you know I could be wrong and but right now I don't see that I don't because it's like an analogy that works for me is Yahoo back in the day Yahoo was the blue-chip Internet company they had grown very fast they were indexing the web and all the startups were using them to advertise they were the advertising platform online the problem is that fundamentally they were not scalable they because the their approach was to manually go through the entire internet and make these portal websites and then so the more they were more a media company than technology company and that's that's my worry too is that if the room is more leaning towards PR and media and just when it comes to actual you know Engineering is actually not that strong like I've been trying to find rock star engineers in in a theory I'm really when it comes to core infrastructure and I haven't been able to find them like people who have significant achievements in other areas that they could then apply here I just saw I think they'd be younger similar to the way you described the lightning what developers yes so you could say maybe there's a genius in there and and you know they're just I think a lot of people would say that was Vitalik they've also said that about Vlad and other people involved it's like you know like or they would say like oh Mark Zuckerberg was you know was very young when he started Facebook like that but but my counter-argument would be like yeah but I'm pretty sure that mark was able to attract world-class engineers to be excited about Facebook and then you know they also helped build out the company further and so I'm not seeing world-class developer and when it comes to core infrastructure right I'm not talking about these gaps and stuff maybe there's brilliant people there flock to ether to solve because the people that I've come to respect over the years as you know extremely high pedigree extremely competent they've been critical of the architecture itself of ether and so it's kind of like if you I can't fix that right it's like I would have to just you know come up with a different protocol like I can't fix it is what they say and that's what they're not involved so the problems with ether is blockchain bloat like the blockchain is so bloated and that the nodes or this client software is not optimized but go back to earlier how you were seeing that the really strong developers are in Bitcoin but there aren't any on aetherium you also had written a blog post about how despite the fact that Betamax was the superior technology that VHS beat it out so how do you take a new account you know that and sort of lessons that might be learned from that and applied here yeah well but that I would say so yeah so Betamax I don't know how young our audience is but but it was basically an alternative to a VHS it was also film on a tape and you would have a specific player for it and then you could record and replay videos and Betamax had a shorter that was their main flaw is that it was higher quality but the length of the video was shorter so it's too short to actually record an entire film on it and VHS had the right balance to me I would say that those are higher level those are consumer products that's not the case when you're talking about cryptocurrency like those are core protocols and that's where engineering just matters so much because there's just so much way it's gonna be leaning on that that you know any kind of vulnerability is going to destabilize everything that's built on top of it so it's it's like it's like building a nuclear power plant or you know building a rocket that's gonna put astronauts on the moon it's like it's so critical that you don't get it wrong and so that's that's you know when you're talking about consumer products you can move fast and break things but I don't think that goes for four core protocol yes I would agree with you there you've been critical of Bitcoin cash as well what do you think the prospects are for this coin yeah I mean to me it's always like like the the value one of the Valeo that was also one element that we look at when we value a protocols like was it scalable like is there any credible scaling future and pick on cash the way it started was this heart Fork of Bitcoin that was not including a critical bug fix which is segments like segments mainly is a bug fix that allows for the Lightning Network and so not having that was kind of handicapping themselves and there was a theory that bit main had a way to kind of cheat by using ASIC boosts like kind of using it exploiting a bug actually in in Bitcoin and that they were able to like mine 20% more efficiently than the rest of the world and and and when Sekou it was introduced they lost that edge they couldn't do covert ASIC boost anymore but with Bitcoin cash they they kept that advantage but then at the price of not you know not having a protocol that is scaling we was never proven that they were doing that right no it's it's it's a wasn't never proven that they did that it's hard because it was covert ASIC was like it's I think as far as I know it was proven that it was possible to do ASIC boost in a covert way as long as Seco it was not implemented and so there the question then was why would bit Maine be advocating so hard against ecwid if there is zero economic benefit for them to do that of course there's there's theories that they just didn't like small blocks and they weren't a big blogs that's possible like I I'm I don't claim to have the ultimate say on you know whether they they did or did not do ASIC boost but but but Bitcoin cash like the name is deceiving it's kind of actually probably caused significant financial losses to newbies who thought they were buying Bitcoin but they're buying something else it's not scalable they don't have credible developers and it's it's based it was founded on a Hart fork which now is showing that there is no limit to that right now Bitcoin cache itself is falling apart there's different factions who want different block sizes and so it gets fragmented it's it's a big mess like III honestly I don't see I don't see the value there long term unless some kind of big government would maybe decide to back it but at this point I feel like they've already they're already ruined what was thereby making the blocks so big like it's it's it's kind of a centralized racket right now a couple minutes ago you mentioned good crypto assets plural which other coins do you think are good besides Bitcoin I think that the other value propositions are unproven but you know interesting nonetheless I like when people iterate on the proof-of-work mechanism like I find Bram Cohen's Chia Network interesting because it has a bit of a different attack vector but it's still based in proof-of-work then I'm intrigued by member embo which is gonna come out as grin I believe and that's just because of the pedigree of the developers involved and just remind me that's a privacy coin yeah like member one bowl basically doesn't have this this big blockchain it it's it's a lot more efficient with with handling the integrity of the transactions and it just tries to make sure that as far as I understand it that there's no double spending but then it doesn't bother to store all the transactions going back and so that actually improves privacy that's kind of I know I probably need to study it again but that's you know that's why I decided to give grynn a follow and then in the old coins I mean it's only it's only litecoin and and and even that is gonna be like a limited role I think the idea is just it's been around for a long time and so it's unlikely to just die off so I think there's some value there and then it's very similar to Bitcoin which means that it can be seen as a hedge by investors over time just like how silver is similar to gold and so people kind of have some exposure to both and to some extent it can be a test net for Bitcoin as well like it implemented sigh quite a bit earlier so I think that there's kind of symbiosis there and right now I think litecoin is like at 2% the value of the coin so you know maybe that'll go up a bit a little bit or it you know it'll stay around that so I think that there's and do you think none of these smart contract platforms that are all in this race or that none of them have any promise or will take off well so that's that's where I have a harder time to judge like I I've been mostly my investment career I've been focused on security and or value you and to me a smart contract is a higher level function than store a value it like it but it seems to me and so you know I want to be humble in the sense that I don't know like they might be great protocols but the question I keep asking myself is that if you come up with this great protocol like well couldn't you integrate it in Bitcoin somehow so that you have both like you have your fantastic smart contract idea and at the same time you have the secure backing which is what bitcoin already provides so yeah like III don't understand when people say we are a payments first blockchain or we are a smart contract first blockchain it's like but if you want to grow big like aren't people gonna have to trust that it's extremely secure is that not you know don't you need that premise and that's why I've been so bearish on ether is that I think they they kind of went too fast and and skipped this core part and and now they can't get it back what this store value it's it's not sent it's not decentralized anymore you know they don't really have scaling prospects and so yeah they do have these contracts that can execute but what's that really worth is if if no startup can run their own ether know it anymore yeah I don't know if many people would agree with you about those last three points about it not being decentralized not having scaling options but like if you think about think about the nodes like you know like people are outsourcing running ether nodes because it's it's it's so bloated and it requires so much bandwidth and rebooting and tweaking so oh you're talking about the mining no no just running running nodes yeah even like fast sync apparently is running into trouble now because because the ether blockchain has grown so much faster than Bitcoin because of course the ether doesn't have blocks quote unquote but I mean it shows like a certain level of traction yeah but but but it's kind of like you know that was my that's what I said in 2016 is that if this growth continues is going to hit by 2018 and it has right and then people say oh but just too fast synced yeah but fast sync means that you trust other nodes to have the true version of the ether Network and so you kind of you're just steadily undermining that the ID that you don't have to trust you can verify yourself that ID is pretty and then of course the all the successive hard folks that we've seen I think also have undermined the decentralized nature I'm not talking that MIT the one hard Fork well there's been a lot of hard folks in ether right other than the one over there down what are the other ones yeah like they've done upgrades and like recently they've they've changed the the money supply basically they changed the financial policy and it was kind of like a hawkish move it was selected minish supply of new currency and now they're negotiating with miners to kind of change the block reward if I if I remember right so you know that means that they're confident that the nodes are going to follow their version of ether even though it's a hard fork so I think that already shows that it's it's no longer decentralized like an Bitcoin if you want to do a hard fork you have these you get these wars right it's it's this uproar and rebellion and then a whole bunch of hard forks and Bitcoin - so no really like there's there's like maybe I mean there's Bitcoin cash Bitcoin gold oh yeah yeah of course I mean but by that standard we've had 2,000 hard for example right with all these alt coins are folks of Bitcoin so I mean if you look at DC BTC there's not you know maybe you could argue there was one bug fix that counted as a hard fork I think it was early 2013 or something but that didn't change anything of the policy so by any practical standard Bitcoin has not had hard Forks and I think that's what it gives its values that it's always reverse compatible and forward compatible and that means that it's a stable foundation to to actually build these layers are okay well we could talk about all this stuff forever but we're running out of time so this has been a fabulous discussion where can people learn more about you I would say just google my name the first link is probably my Twitter account and then the second
