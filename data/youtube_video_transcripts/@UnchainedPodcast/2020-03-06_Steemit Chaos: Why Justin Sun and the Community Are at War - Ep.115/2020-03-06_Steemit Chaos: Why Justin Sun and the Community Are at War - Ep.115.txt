and interbank exchange rates if you travel a lot today's guest is brainy Dale senior reporter at coin desk welcome Brady hey thanks for having me so there's been some craziness in steam at land this week when it or over the past couple weeks actually why don't you give a brief overview of the events that happened with steam it and Justin Suns Tron and then we'll dive into the kind of blow-by-blow sure so on Valentine's Day word came out that Justin Sun and Tron had bought steam it which is the company that runs steam at the app which is kind of like the crypto medium sort of with some reddit vibes mixed in and they also do a lot of the development for the steam blockchain but they don't own the steam blockchain so the witnesses sort of the equivalent of miners on Steam freaked out about the fact that Justin Sun now own steam it because steam it did have a giant pile of tokens that it had never exercised to control the blockchain before but they were worried he would and so they did a soft fork to to block those tokens from being able to do anything and that led Justin son to be extremely unhappy and so it looked like there was nothing he could do for a little while but then this past Sunday night or early Monday morning I guess all of a sudden a bunch of new steam witnesses guys so there's 20 steam witnesses who governed the blockchain and sort of have total power on it so it's not very distributed in that way 20 new witnesses were voted in and they were voted in by steam held on a variety of exchanges mostly Hobie finance and and then a little bit from Polonia acts and so suddenly this new group of witnesses were voted in they updated to a new version of the steam software I think the number was twenty two point five and and then that allowed Tron to move the steam at tokens and but then pretty quick but then since then so that was sort of the moment that crypto like really got interested it was you know that sort of the Empire Strikes Back moment and in the last thing that's happened is that the the steam community has reorganized themselves and a bunch and have gotten seven of the original federal grassroots you witnesses voted back in which means that it they can't change the blockchain anymore but it means that Tron can't hard fork in any way they can so they can block a hard fork so they're the two sides are a little bit at stalemate right now well this is this is pretty intense this is definitely I like a blockchain more going on one thing I wanted to ask you about is at the very beginning when you talk to you about how Justin's son had acquired steam it you said that steam it did not own the blockchain so who who then did on the blockchain well no one did you know it's like this is like how blockchains work I mean it's a lot like it's a lot like block ones relationship - yes right like block one created the software but then they just sort of put the software out in the world and a bunch of people came together to launch the EOS Network and and block one continues to do development on on the EOS I owe software but you know the blockchain doesn't have to incorporate it they typically do but they don't have to and you know there's other Yeo's other people can implement es 2s there's a there's a blockchain called Telos which runs a version of the EOS IO software with some tweaks to it and and other people have done the same thing so you know it's it's owned by the world it's owned by the steam holders and so back when Justin Sun did buy steam it there were some other kind of like business plans that were announced around then so what were those plans yeah I mean there's a lot of questions so the sort of thing it's it's super unclear what Tron's real intentions were but you know he started sort of articulating a very tradition for steam it you know the kind of things are sort of used to from Justin Sun you know getting celebrities on there you know giving people rewards for bringing more people in sort of a very you know marketing oriented framework which is kind of what Justin Sun is known for is just sort of getting attention and getting you know high profile people involved in things but what-what alarmed the steam users the thing that most align them is he made some kind of suggestion of a token swap between Tron and steam and so folks sort of read that as an attention to just kind of subsume steam into Tron and folks didn't like that so so that I think that was the big concern you know there's there's folks who have said since then that it's more and more signs that really he just wanted to get his hands on a pile of tokens at a good deal and sell them but but that was the pitch he was making to the steam community and it's also it's worth noting that like a part of the sign that maybe he didn't really intend to develop steam it further is you know once they locked up the tokens I mean the community said like it was a soft fork it was easily reversible they basically were just trying to get time so they could talk to the Tron team and see what their intentions were and sort of expressed their concerns and if everyone think seemed okay they're suppose to be this March 6 meeting then you know they could have reversed it but instead Tron came in and sort of you know dropped the boot on them by like putting in a bunch of you know quote unquote sock puppet witnesses and that made it that made it look a lot more like that the intentions weren't weren't so much to develop steam but maybe just a you know you know do a token dump of some kind but who knows but just to go back the soft work that was to essentially kind of like block the influence of any steam tokens owned by steam it which was now owned by Trump by Justin aside right yeah basically just locked up some wallets that's all it did and so and so it was easy to reverse and they and you know it's interesting one of the things which one of the witnesses who was involved in that told me as a part of why they did it as a soft fork is because they they didn't want to hurt exchange users because you know if if as long as it was a soft fork the exchanges didn't have to do anything people could still tray people could still withdraw their steam and such so it wouldn't be a problem and then it's the exchange it's a few of the exchanges who come around and enabled Justin son to take it back over yeah well let's talk about that because what's interesting about the three exchanges that you named finance and homie are both based in China and Polonia axe is now owned by Tron yeah it's it's owned by a group of investors of which he is one of them so yeah he's definitely influenced there or maybe just sounds it out right who knows it's a little bit hard to say but but yeah he definitely has influence yes they're all ones he's connected to for sure yeah so I feel like this you know III really I'm not a fan of conspiracy theories but for the people who sometimes beat that drum about how and and please please know listeners don't none of you I don't want I don't want you gonna say that I'm spouting conspiracy theories about Bitcoin because I'm not but there are people out there who sometimes will say oh you know all the Bitcoin miners not all but you know the majority are in China but this is like almost like a version of that yeah well the in the story and the story that the changes are saying since this came out is that you know Tron came to them and they argued that this was this was a quote-unquote hack and it was um and that folks were stealing his crypto and it is true that they were locking up his property and there's no question about that and I should say I didn't mention this before but a part of the thing about this pool of steam it tokens is is that this steam it and the steam community kind of had a handshake agreement that steam it wouldn't vote them and wouldn't like you know just govern the chain with them which is very different by the way then the deal block one has with the community they just haven't but the community would kind of like them to I think but anyway I but so the the community was like well we had this sort of deal and now everything's changed with there being new ownership so that's why they locked them up anyway so so son went to them and was just like look folks are stealing my tokens this is a hack and they bought it but it but it seems like the evidence since then is this is not worth the headache it's yielded for them so there's they're trying to spin it as like a they were you know doing the best they could to protect the community but there are also but they they seem to be unwinding their positions pretty quickly the trick is though the hard thing is steam is a very complicated blockchain the way it works is pretty weird and one of the challenges and this is a real thing for the users of those exchanges to think about is once you've once you've on the current the current way the software is written once you have staked tokens to vote it takes 13 weeks to unstick all of them they sort of unstick in chunks so you can get like a seventh of them in like a week or so but it takes 13 weeks to get them all out so like this is a like a lot of tokens are locked up for a long time as non withdrawable because the exchanges did this I I probably have the DAO too much on my brain because of what I'm working on with my book but this does remind me of the DAO - anyway okay so we're gonna have to take a quick break of to hear from the sponsors to make the show possible and after that we will talk about what the implications Asians of this whole battle are why should you get an MCO visa card from crypto comm first it's a beautiful metal card you can top up the card with crypto and spend anywhere visa is accepted you also get up to 5% back on all spending you know they'll pay for your spotify and netflix too you'll love the unlimited airport lounge access and interbank exchange rates if you travel a lot there are so many cool perks loaded in one card download the crypto comm app now crypto don't LA is run by crypto oh geez in New York who understand crypto and FinTech they were already operating in the space back in 2013 in the accept crypto as payment one of the partners Accra Killman is known for drafting a bill submitted to the US Congress in 2014 aimed at exempting on chained Bitcoin transactions from US regulations the other founding partner his brother Daniel Killman became well known in the crypto law space for his work in the mail civil rehabilitation so if you operate a FinTech business or have a dispute with some person or a business involving crypto or you just need legal advice related to crypto info at calment law that's ke l ma n dot law or just go to their website at wwlp.com on back to my conversation with brady Dale so but actually before we talk about the implications of this whole thing let's just talk about I mean the exchanges did seem to walk back what they were doing so yeah yeah talk about what happened there well so it's it's a it's a little bit hard to tell and I'm not as great as I'd like to be it like reading blockchain data but the number of votes that are showing up for you know that the witnesses supporting Tron are dropping pretty fast but they haven't dropped off entirely so it does that is evidence that the exchanges are unwinding their positions but like I said there's this long delay and so they kind of can't for you know they can't do it for a while unless the software changes but it does seem like they are so to their credit they've realized this was more complicated than it seemed at first and so they they're getting out of the business of you know deciding who governs steam so what are you looking at next as you watch this drama unfold I you know I mean honestly I I would like for it to just sort of like wrap up and be over I mean it is interesting yeah I don't know I don't know what I think you know there's there's a there's word that there's been some quiet behind-the-scenes talk of a sort of compromise I have a feeling so though I don't know this but my guess is there is a level on which the steam community if they could get an agreement from Sun to just like cell off his positions but not do it like all at once it's some like a reasonable time frame everybody would be cool I think they were more worried he was gonna take over the chain and change it in some dramatic way that they weren't comfortable with so I have a feeling that's probably what's being worked on but I don't know he put out this blog post this morning that's wild he wrote this blog post this morning saying you know I'm looking for people who or who want to be witnesses first team that meets certain requirements and and one of them is you know he uses a pretty toxic language about like the existing weep witnesses and their you know hostility towards you note noteworthy exchanges so I don't I don't know maybe maybe collaboration isn't possible but he's he's he's showing a lot of anger and frustration I mean I don't like it doesn't feel decentralized to me if you know the a certain number of witnesses have to be pre-approved by Justin son so I don't think it's decentralized either way I don't think there's either way you know I mean like the thing is like look I think a lot of people out there are sort of rallying behind the prior witnesses as more legitimate and that's probably true and you know I'm all for them but the reason I'm interested in this story and the reason I'm covering it is it just it just goes to show how at the end of the day like delegated proof of stake is just not very decentralized either way right I mean the fact that these folks they don't there's only needed 20 they only need to coordinate 17 people honestly 17 entities that were running witnesses to lock up Justin Suns tokens and whatever you think of Justin son that was censorship on the blockchain right like I mean it was and so they locked up his tokens and they did that pretty easily and then Justin sign organizes a bunch of steam to move in a bunch of other witnesses and he's able to unlock them pretty quickly I mean it just shows how howdy POS you know delegated delegated proof of stake is pretty easily manipulated by someone with deep pockets you know on either side of the ledger yeah yeah I was gonna ask you I mean do you feel that a bunch of the other chains that use delegated proof of stake also kind of run that this risk and do you think that any of them are sort of second guessing with the structure of their chains I mean the biggest one is EOS and I've I've covered the hell out of this I think you know already shows that it's kind of where that's out I mean I've written about this a ton you know and there was a great report that came out from by Nance recently in which finance wrote that you know they were it's you can't tell for sure but they were like pretty positive but a bunch of the so-called block producers on there the equivalent of witnesses on steams what they call them block producers but the people validating the chain that a bunch of them like you know are actually the same entity with multiple names and just sort of multiple servers on there so you have you know one organization that's pretending to be four different block producers so I think it's it's already happening on on the other big GPOs chains yeah and in a way I think actually when I you know hear what you're talking about it almost feels like the real problem maybe was the initial distribution because why did steam it have so many tokens in the beginning yeah yeah I don't know I mean the the the same thing is also again true on a OS you know that in there was this big you know they did the giant token sale there was a ton of tokens out there and it was always the case that no matter how many tokens got sold block one was going to have ten percent of the initial pool and so and they still have most of that they're still the biggest token holder on EOS and you know they're they aren't voting them yet but like I said before I think the community sort of would like them to to sort of vote in the best possible block producers but that might that might have changes sort of the sentiment there's is always moving but yeah but even still is even if they even if you launched it pure right it was just like we're gonna launch this GPOs chain nobody's gonna have any tokens at the start you know we'll just figure out our initial group of block producers and everyone will earn it by merit from there all it takes is some very wealthy person to come along and just acquire a bunch of tokens on an exchange and it still will become fairly easy eventually to like dominate that exchange just from having a bunch of money you know because it's just when you limit the number of nodes that control a thing it makes coordination much much easier yeah yeah I still think that if you have to I just I don't know somehow I guess like I feel like it tends to be even more extreme when the creators a lot themselves some percentage of tokens rather than oh for sure yeah unquestionably I mean yeah I'm just saying you'll eventually get there either way but for sure it's vastly easier if it reminds a giant pile yeah and I feel like it's the creator's who do that maybe aren't thinking long term because that does end up creating problems for the change on the line so I almost feel like baking fairness into the chain and some fashion and and it's I I think you know I've had talks with some people like like Charlie Lea's may be a really good example of this where he did not pray mine at all he did not you know take any more like coin than anybody else could have taken from the start you know although he obviously he did have you know mining gear set up from the start but you know he seems to think that any creators who take an initial stake of tokens are doing it unfairly I don't know if I would go that far but I definitely think that those who are more on the greedy side will be sort of shooting themselves in the foot long term I mean in defense of steam and even kind of es really I would I would also contend that like we have a much clearer picture that problem now in 2020 I mean steam is in blocking terms like really old I mean it was one of the first you know it it was one of the first that I ever covered back when I was the observer and it was like I think launched in like 2016 or something so I just don't think I do think on some level and in kind of Ned Scott and Dan lemurs defense they were probably like yeah this might be bad but you know I don't know how bad could it be and like when I first started covering I SEOs when I stand point ask it in 2017 a lot of people were doing it and there was some criticism but folks weren't like that freaked out about it but I think today folks are just like no you pre mines are not a great idea you know I think that's become clear but I don't think we knew is clearly back in back then yeah alright well I guess we'll see how this plays out so that meeting that was supposed to happen on the 6th is not happening anymore doesn't sound like it I put out some questions this morning about that and folks didn't get back to me so I don't know but I will say this this this post from Justin Sun that came out this morning does not sound like he's you know trying to get along yeah I don't know there is something about the way that you described his phrasing on that that made me think it's not gonna go over super well but the message this morning steam is dead from from some like anonymous source out there when with a link to the post so yeah folks aren't folks aren't into it hmm alright well we'll see what happens with this chain well thanks so much for coming on the show thanks done yeah don't forget next up was the news recap stick around for this week in crypto after
