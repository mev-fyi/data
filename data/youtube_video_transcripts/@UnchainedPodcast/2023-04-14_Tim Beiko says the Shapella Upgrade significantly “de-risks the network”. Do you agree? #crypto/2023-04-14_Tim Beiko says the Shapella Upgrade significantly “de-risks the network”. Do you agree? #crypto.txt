I really didn't spend a lot of time thinking about like how many people would draw or like deposit like obviously you know it's known there's like a couple like entities that had to sort of withdraw everything um but I think there's like two things where it feels like it balances out one is just you know withdrawals significantly I think de-risked staking on ethereum um for a few reasons like one one is like you know that they're possible like even though I don't know like the people working on the protocol sort of knew that you know this would probably happen around this time I appreciate the skepticism of maybe others in the community who feel like okay I'm staking this thing and I have no idea when I'm gonna be able to withdrawn so I think you know having it actually be live and working is like a significant the risking factor and I think the thing that it does as well is it it reduces like the the commitment you have to make like before when you were staking on ethereum you sort of had to commit all the way until withdrawals at least
