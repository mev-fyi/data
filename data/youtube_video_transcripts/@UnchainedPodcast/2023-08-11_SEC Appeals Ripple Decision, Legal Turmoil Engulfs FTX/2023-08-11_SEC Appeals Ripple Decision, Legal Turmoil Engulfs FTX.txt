anyone looking for a laugh today something a little on the lighter side should tune in to hear stand-up comedian Jenny Hogan elucidate Elon Musk confirming there will be no cryptocurrency for X formerly known as Twitter that's all for this week looking forward to seeing you next week mint Dogecoin accounts are warning people to be wary of news that Twitter X is launching its own cryptocurrency Elon has said he's never going to launch one so these stories are all fake which should be obvious from the fact that they have about 50 000 likes on x.com actually though Elon didn't say all never launch an X token he said we'll never launch an X token which is really inspiring I didn't realize there were still people working in X honestly I also think the news of no X token itself is promising maybe Elon plans on shutting down the whole site why doesn't Elon want X to have its own cryptocurrency well not to brag but the website formerly known as Twitter actually doesn't need to get into crypto to lose a ton of money Elon is also enmeshed in a multi-million dollar insider trading lawsuit over the time that he changed the Twitter logo to the Dogecoin Shiba Inu dog investors have accused musk of doing it deliberately to drive up the price of Dogecoin 36 000 and then let it crash well here's a real pattern that's exactly what he did with Twitter except for the part work he drove the price up thanks so much for joining us today Unchained is produced by me Laura Shin with up from Kevin Fuchs Matt pilchard Zach Seward Juan iranovic Sam sriram Jenny Hogan
