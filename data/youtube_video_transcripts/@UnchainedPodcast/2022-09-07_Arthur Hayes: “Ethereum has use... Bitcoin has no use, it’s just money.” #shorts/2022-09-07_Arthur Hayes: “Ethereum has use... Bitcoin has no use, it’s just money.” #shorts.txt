i think people in my opinion don't understand what ethereum actually is ethereum is not money because money has no use ethereum has use you use it to use to power the applications on this network bitcoin has no use it's just money just like the dollar has no use it's just money and that's why it's a good form of money because its value cannot be conflated with actual utility of other stuff
