well two of the biggest reasons why I don't think full there's going to be a ton of full withdrawals happening on the network is because if you know validator node operators really needed that liquidity they already could have gotten it to some extent through liquid state derivatives through tokens like steath through tokens like ref and also I think that youth prices nowadays have significantly declined since what we saw a couple of years ago um and so most validator node operators don't have a ton of gains to realize by unstaking their eat entirely I think we're going to see a larger number of node operators actually want to restake and just continue to earn we saw Lido for example have their biggest daily inflows ever just a couple weeks ago which I thought was was really bullish for the sentiment going into Shanghai
