is in the description today's guest is larry cermak director of research at the block welcome larry hey happy to be here this week coinbase dropped its first quarter earnings ahead of its direct listing next wednesday april 14th what were your big takeaways from the q1 results sure i mean there are a few things i think almost everyone expected that the revenue numbers would just you know be much better than they were in the previous quarter but still i think almost everyone was uh shocked uh by the 1.8 billion dollar figure even i expected slightly less i think i was projecting something like 1.45 uh but i think mainly like just just people outside of crypto that don't really know how uh the revenues are tied to volumes and how crazy the q1 has been i think those have been the ones that have been the most kind of shocked about this and i think it opened a lot of eyes for a lot of people and i think that was the intention uh from coinbase to publish this right before they actually list because you know they had the best score ever uh by far and they outperformed the entire last year by like 0.5 billion um so you know that was that was really the biggest takeaway but you know there were a few other ones and another crazy one is is the amount of money that they actually custody on coinbase i mean just you know it's it's i think it's like 230 billion uh and if you look at the total market cap of everything in crypto it's about two trillion right now uh and so you have like ten percent of all the assets uh custody but one company and i think that by itself i mean that's the figure that impressed me the most the most i was just quite shocked by that uh and especially if you compare that to the growth from the previous quarter as well uh you know i think back then it was like like at least half of that um and so that that number has grown significantly and you can just see how you know large coinbase is growing just not from trading fees but also the custody business and i think that was quite impressive and not only that but then you look at the institutional split and you find that now it's 122 billion dollars of institutional money custody on coinbase and that that grew from 45 billion so almost 3x there so i think these sort of really like the biggest takeaways for me and overall i just think like a really really solid growth really great uh results ebitda was really healthy as well and also one last thing i'll add and is that they also grew the number of users significantly so it was 6.1 million monthly transacting users so users that actually ended up making a transaction that month and that's up from i think around 3 million uh in the previous course yeah almost three yeah it's it's absolutely crazy how many people have joined and i think that kind of goes to show that really in q1 we've seen a massive change in the dynamic of the market where q4 it was largely driven by institutions and you know we we saw this from the s1 and coinbase filed as well i think only like 30 or something of volume was coming from from retail customers that has definitely picked up even though coinbase didn't disclose that yet that has definitely picked up significantly you can just see that from the like crazy increase in in the number of transacting users so i think that dynamic shift is interesting where initially it was a you know it was an institutionally driven market and now we have a lot of retail piling in as the price is reaching new highs yeah one other thing that jumped out at me is something that i had discussed with jeff roberts here on the show he's the uh executive editor at de craft who wrote a book on coinbase called kings of crypto and he and i had last when he was last on the show discussed how coinbase's revenue um across his whole history has really relied on transaction revenue um but in in these results coinbase meaningfully increased its non-transaction revenue which you know compared to the s1 that it released in february you know showed i i think for me quite a shift so to your mind how do you think coinbase made that shift it's just like you know we started with tesla and with like a lot of companies joining and a lot of that revenue is coming from institutions so you know that's not necessarily just transaction value but it's also just custody fees and it's just charging these companies more money for for other things as well and they have multiple different business sides but you know even though it decreased slightly it's still incredibly reliant on on the volume i think it was it was still more than 80 but but you know it's definitely healthy to see coinbase grow in this direction i think the biggest worry though for coinbase is that even though the revenue is getting a little bit more diversified it still relies 100 on how the market obviously will perform so i think one risk that maybe traditional investors are not realizing as much is that you know if bitcoin were to go down like 20 or 30 percent it's absolutely clear that that coinbase is also going to go down quite a bit uh because even if if you know 80 percent is transactional and the rest is some other revenue that also relies heavily on the prices they charge you know they charge fees from from the amount of assets they custody on the platform if the if the number decreases it just goes down as well so i think that's that's one thing people should kind of pay attention to after the announcement i saw a lot of people on twitter just go out and say you know coinbase is gonna generate like eight billion dollars this year it's it's one of the fastest growing companies and i would be a little bit cautious with that because a lot of people are just assuming you know this is this is a growth period like everything is just going to keep going up and but as we know these things are quite cyclical and and you know even in march we've already seen a slight decline in volumes uh which is reflecting in in revenues as well so if volumes go down i mean coinbase is going to perform slightly less but i mean nevertheless it's it's still impressive that the numbers that they disclosed uh it's pretty good and i think uh you know one last thing is you know it's impressive to see how much they charge per the volume that they have you look at like all the other exchanges like like binance ftx uh but even like kraken and bitstem and coinbase just gets away with charging so much more and that's because a lot of the users in in this quarter especially have been just retail users that go on the app and they don't care if they pay a couple of bucks per hundred dollars you know they think that the opportunity is larger so they just don't they just oversee the fees but i think we're gonna see uh some compression as well so that would be one of the other risks that i would be watching closely yeah the block also published an analysis and noted quote total revenue to trading volume came in at the lowest quarterly clip in the past two years at 0.54 suggesting take rates which is transaction revenue divided by total trading volume also saw compression a quarterly low so why do you think that is happening yeah i think it's pretty obvious so uh whenever volumes go up significantly like we've seen like you look at like q4 and then q1 we saw massive growth like a three or four x um whenever that happens you need more market makers which is basically just you know institutions market making and and they are charged way lower fees so if you increase the the number of volume uh that you need to market make for and they pay way lower fees than the retail clients um it's quite it's quite logical that that would decrease i was actually in in my model prior to them disclosing it i was expecting it to be even lower uh but i i definitely underestimated the amount of like retail customers that would be coming in i like i i could not imagine that the number of active users would basically double on the platform so so it's quite logical because we just have more more market makers more larger value clients uh and those clients char their charge way lower fees and coinbase makes so much more from the retail clients that they make from the institutional clients and so why do you think that did happen you know what you weren't expecting that retail did increase so much what was the cause of that i just wasn't expecting it that much i think it happened because of all the things that happened in q1 we saw tesla uh make a massive investment which which i think drove a lot of people you know there's so many people that basically praise elon musk for everything that he does and i think that was one of the things that just sparked this and and then we just are starting to see other institutions get interested in crypto it's just becoming more acceptable for like really notable macro investors and really notable people overall to be positive about bitcoin and we've never seen that before and i think that that kind of you know made the flip for a lot of people i think before so many people still had had the nightmares from what happened in 2017 when you know bitcoin went to 20k a lot of people bought at that time and you know then it dropped to like 3k in in a couple of years and i think when you start seeing people like elon musk but even just like institutional investors they're now saying you know this might be a good idea this might be a good hedge it just flips a switch like basically after bitcoin crash all the new sites were saying you know bitcoin was a ponzi scheme like how could you have been so dumb to do that and now all of a sudden you're seeing bitcoin outperform and you're seeing all these investors allocate a significant amount of money on a long mandate so they're not investing to flip it they're investing with long-term mindsets and i think that just for people like it just clicks right you're like okay maybe i wasn't as stupid before maybe i was just early and i think you know we're also getting closer to just like complete mania we're seeing like 2017 coins pump as well and some like crazy stuff going on we're seeing d5 valuations just absolutely crazy like like uniswap is trading at like one-third of what coinbase will be trading at uh so i think it's a combination of things uh but it still surprised me how many people actually join and i think probably not going to slow down anytime soon in a moment we're going to discuss coinbase's competition and what we expect to see when coinbase does get listed but first a quick word for the sponsors who make this show possible with over 10 million users crypto.com is the easiest place to buy and sell over 90 cryptocurrencies grow your crypto with

description back to my conversation with larry cermak so as we know coinbase is now competing against a number of other companies that have entered this space how would you compare coinbase's numbers to those of square or paypal or robinhood or any other company that is also offering similar things to coinbase you're totally right we're seeing a massive pickup in just consumer apps uh supporting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies you know we now have robin hood we have square we have paypal and and then revolut in europe what i'll say though is is that even though their numbers are pretty impressive uh it's like it's important to realize that like a lot of the volume that they have especially if it's for a lot of uh volume it almost always ends up routing to these large liquidy hops which which is basically coinbase and binance so you know when you look at liquidity analysis of all the exchanges it's almost always coinbase binance and bitfinex those three almost always stand out and so a lot of it ends up routing to uh to coinbase regardless so i don't think it's necessarily competing however i think and i already mentioned this briefly before i think that this will have effect on fees because when you have a lot more competitors a lot more retail friendly apps uh which ultimately coinbase is it's the go-to app for for a lot of retail people it's just going to cost a lot of fee compression because you're going to have just much lower fees across the board so i think that's going to be the most the largest effect but but i mean regardless i mean going business is going to be fine for several years in the future mainly because it just has established itself and when you establish yourself as the liquidity hub and as the go-to place for you know large volumes of trading it is going to be very hard to get away from that and one thing i'll add to that is like the perfect example is just institutional investors getting exposure to bitcoin we saw tesla use coinbase we saw microstrategy use coinbase and when you establish yourself as the you know the company the country party that can provide uh this much liquidity for these really large companies it's very hard to go go away from that so in my mind like when they're going to be companies in the future that want to get similar exposure to bitcoin like tesla and microstrategy why wouldn't you go through coinbase uh maybe you go through natick as well but i think those two companies right now just have too much of an edge and what about competition from the other end such as d5 or dexa's like uniswap do you see those posing any sort of threat to coinbase even if only in the long term i think in some sense they do especially for the long tail assets so you look at you know you know we call them well basically altcoins i don't want to say i don't want to say the word but a lot of these you know will go to to to uniswap just because sometimes it's easier uh but i mean right now you look at the ethereum and a lot of the fees especially when when there's some sort of an event on ethereum you know you're paying like 50 to 60 bucks and you look at like people that are joining my friends they're investing like thousand two thousand sometimes five thousand dollars they're not going to want to spend 20 30 bucks for trade and even coinbase actually is cheap compared to something like uniswap so i think you know unisop will continue to grow it has found a really nice product market fit uh and it's going to take away some of it but i think obviously coinbase is really strong at regulatory compliance and and fiat on-ramps and and that's really hard to disrupt because they already have relationships it's it's literally just taking money from the bank and converting them into into bitcoin and crypto and that's just uniswap can't do that and the centros exchanges can't do that many people have questioned why coinbase had so little bitcoin on its balance sheet what's your theory honestly that's really hard to tell i think it's still a lot i mean you know it's still in in terms of sorry tens of billions it's it's a lot but i think like related to everything else yeah it is slightly lower than i would expect but i just i just wouldn't look too much into it i mean a lot of people are always trying to say you know coinbase is like unfriendly to bitcoin and i think in some ways they probably have been in in the past but i wouldn't look too much into it i think it's it's just like what the composition is right now and i think you know coinbase has been taking steps to be more supportive of bitcoin uh supporting bitcoin projects and bitcoin developers so i think i wouldn't look too much into it all right so based on this earnings this quarterly report what would you still want to know what did coinbase not reveal that you'd be interested to see i would just love to know more about their customers uh like the customer makeup of basically anyone who trades on coinbase i would like to see you know it would just be nice to see like where do people actually behind like is it is it you know younger people is it is it older people i think that that would be interesting for me personally and then it would just be interesting like how are they going to deal with with feast compressing down the line like what's what's their strategy to to mitigate against that i think those those are the two main things that i'll be wanting to focus on uh and i think there's going to be a lot more like institutional interest coming in and a lot of institutional buyers so obviously that i'm also interested in that and i think coinbase has already been facilitating some of these without them being announced yet uh but but i think you know those are the main things i think they've done a good job just just telling us how their business functions what their intentions are one thing i didn't mention that is that they they uh are expecting that their expenses are going to pick up significantly this year so i would be interested in like what exactly are they uh thinking about spending their money for um i think a lot of them will go for like hiring marketing but i would be interested in like what companies would like to target for acquisitions i think after coinbase lists it's going to be very easy to to imagine coinbase is going aggressively after companies that they haven't acquired yet because it's just hard for them to build it internally and it's just much easier they're going to have a massive amount of money all of a sudden you know i think they're going to be aggressive with acquisitions and and so i'll be interested in like what companies they'll target and do you have any kind of areas in mind of like products or services that you think would kind of round out their offering i think they will get more aggressive in d5 and wanting to uh just be more intra operative of uh you know the applications that work in d5 so i i'm expecting um more aggressive plays into those areas and also just institutional suite i think they still have long ways to go there but but generally you know i really don't know uh i would be biased to say that they also need a good research arm you know it's going to be a ton of things that they still are not providing and i think you know it's just going to be interesting i really have no idea but i think they'll be aggressive so what do you expect to happen at the time of the direct listing next week that's a good question uh i think like right now there's just so much interest and there's going to be a lot of hype this uh you know i know tv network's already booked up with uh you know having the hosts uh and everything is gonna be revolving around coinbase going public uh bitcoin has been the story of this year in a lot of mainstream media and i think coinbase is just going to solidify that so i'm expecting a massive hype i'm expecting that a lot of retail customers will invest in coinbase um and i think the valuations might get a little bit crazy honestly i think it's going to be great for the ecosystem i think what's what's interesting i don't know i i think it's going to be above 100 and i think it can go way higher than that but i really you know i have no idea you made a 100 billion valuation or or what are you saying okay i i i think it's going to list around that and then probably go a little bit higher but honestly i have no idea what i'll say though is that i think uh you know it's important to think about the people that are all the sudden going to get a lot of liquidity out of their early investments and what they will do with their money right and my intuition would be that a lot of that will be reinvested in crypto like we've spoken to some people that have had shares since like really early on and almost all of them are thinking about ways to to put them back into the ecosystem some of them in d5 but i would assume a lot of them in bitcoin ethereum and just like support other projects and i think that's going to be quite quite common where we see a lot of these really early investors or early employees just start investing and i think that's going to be great um but also it's just probably going to result in some even crazy evaluations that we have seen so far which is crazy to think about and out of curio curiosity did any of them say that they plan to invest in nfts or did they focus on d5 and other cryptos most of them i i've only spoken to a couple that that told me this so not a great sample size but most of them just set early projects and and then some some the more liquid cryptocurrencies i'm actually seeing a lot less interest in nfts recently despite like all the mainstream interests uh i think some of it like even according to the data that we have in the dashboard is dying off slightly it might go back again uh but i think people are realizing that it's maybe not the best idea to put a lot of money into illiquid assets because when the music stops playing it's it's very hard to actually realize any of those profits so so you know we'll see but i'm not expecting too much of investments there i think you know what could be interesting is like some infrastructure place for nfts like openc or some other platforms uh but i i don't think nfts are going to be that interesting honestly okay and by the way for those of uh the audience listening on audio larry did air quotes around profits when he talked about nfts um okay last question how do you think the crypto markets will play out the rest of this year and how do you think that will affect coinbase and its stock yeah that's that's a really good question i i normally try not to answer like any predictions or anything like that but i think overall what's different about this market is that it's being invested in by long long term investors and a lot of the companies that are starting to get uh exposure and starting to invest on their balance sheet a lot of the institutional investors they're investing with long mandates usually at least three years most of the time it's more and so i think the dynamic is very different i'm not expecting to see like 90 drops like we've seen before i think there are going to be some corrections uh but but overall i think the market is right now really healthy and i think you know we're gonna keep seeing interest from institutional customers pop up and that has been really the feel of this run uh if that dries up for some reason that could be a problem but i'm not expecting it to and i i know you know we've spoken to coinbase before it was like a month ago or something and they mentioned they have like four or five s p 500 companies uh almost lined up to to get uh some bitcoin on their balance sheet so i think a lot of these announcements will happen over the next like two or three months and i think overall i'm not worried about the market yet great all right well this has been such a fun conversation thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed yeah it was a pleasure to be here and uh happy to come on again and to talk about anything else i love your podcast great don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break meet inter-pop a super team redefining the future of nfts and fandom from comics and trading card

visit hello interpop dot io to learn more [Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap before we begin a note on last week's news recap regarding outlier ventures i reported the web3 accelerator had raised a funding round of 350 million dollars only to find out that recent podcast guest jamie burke was playing a well executed april fools prank all right first headline crypto industry leaders forage alliance to champion digital currencies the crypto council for innovation a group consisting of fidelity coinbase square and paradigm launched on tuesday to lobby governments and institutions on crypto related policy the cci will provide extensive informational resources aiming to educate crypto participants policymakers and governmental bodies on the benefits of using cryptocurrencies gus culdabella chief policy officer at paradigm and one of the cci organizers suggests the cci's work quote will require sharing insights and analysis about crypto while correcting the misperceptions that inevitably accompany a transformative new technology the cci's inception comes in the same week that in a letter to shareholders jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon who infamously declared bitcoin a fraud in 2017 included the quote regulatory status of cryptocurrencies as an emerging issue in the us that the u.s must deal with if it is to bounce back from the economic fallout from covet 19. regulations regarding crypto remain rather complicated at the moment for example the sec claims authority over most ethereum-based tokens while the cftc oversees bitcoin adjacent assets like futures and options contracts next headline grayscale state's intention to launch an etf greescale the world's largest digital asset manager is quote 100 committed to converting gbdc into an etf according to a medium post published by the company the grayscale bitcoin trust was the first publicly traded bitcoin fund launched in the united states and helped grayscale become the first and only company to convert a bitcoin fund into an sec reporting company grayscale first applied for a bitcoin etf in 2016 but withdrew the filing due to an immature regulatory environment surrounding digital assets the investment company has not submitted another etf filing declaring only that the regulatory environment will drive the timing of its next application shareholders of gptc will see their fees go down when the fund is converted to an etf meanwhile alternative asset manager nydig secured another 100 million dollars in funding just one month after announcing a 200 million round the additional capital comes from star insurance and liberty mutual they joined the previous round of investors including stone ridge holdings morgan stanley new york life mass mutual and soros management fund next headline nft market correction doesn't slow down the nft craze the nft market seems to have corrected a bit the average price of an nft dropped from its february peak of four thousand dollars to one thousand five hundred dollars at the start of april with trade volume mimicking the mountainous rise and fall of average nft prices peaking at 80 000 weekly trades before settling at roughly 45 000 in early april however before you go out and sell all your nfts the current average price of 1500 represents a 10x increase in the average cost of an nft from six months ago and nft weekly trade volume has more than doubled compared to q4 of 2020. as if despite the bubble popping narrative the nft headlines were just as wacky as usual if not more so a few of the more interesting stories include tom brady and peyton manning are now fighting for nft supremacy brady the seven time super bowl champion is launching an nft platform called autograph seeking to extend the idea of an autograph into the digital world manning along with his brother eli is set to launch the manning legacy collection made up of eight unique art pieces through maker's place on april 16th forbes my former employer dropped an nft of its recent winklevi profile on nifty gateway the cover depicting cameron and tyler winklevoss smiling behind the title a new billionaire every day sold for and thirty three thousand three

blockchain happy couple by the way that's the ethereum blockchain the happy couple exchanged nfts in addition to the traditional swap of rings cementing their marriage on ethereum for all time as if brian armstrong the ceo of coinbase doesn't have enough going on right now he is collaborating with dj davi to produce electronic music a skill he picked up during covet last year the songs will be released as nfts and if you want a deeper understanding of how nfts work or what they may become i highly recommend this nft canon by a16c a carefully curated collection of articles and resources for the nft curious next headline ripple wins lawsuit for access to internal sec communications on crypto in december the sec announced a lawsuit against ripple labs claiming that xrp was a security and that the company had raised more than 1.3 billion dollars in unregistered offerings on tuesday ripple labs won a discovery ruling that will require the sec to hand over internal communications on how it determines whether a cryptocurrency is a security the sec does not consider bitcoin and ether to be securities but has not issued any formal guidance explaining how it arrived at those conclusions ripple likely hopes the sec mentions xrp as a virtual currency similar to btc and eth which would help its case to be treated as a non-security barring a blatant mention of xrp in the same vein as bitcoin and ethereum the ruling could still offer the general public its first in-depth look at how the sec regulates crypto ripple labs its token xrp is up nearly 20 since the report broke next headline vc-backed stablecoin protocol fey is off to a shaky start faye and an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the dollar recently concluded its genesis event in total the protocol minted 1.3 billion of its fey tokens as a stable coin fey got off to a shaky start trading between five cents and ten cents off the targeted one dollar mark for the first few days before tanking to under 80 cents on thursday the situation emphasizes the difficulties in creating an algorithmic stablecoin the protocol aimed to create a stablecoin that would purchase assets outright with its token rather than holding them as collateral like a tether fey is created with a trade instead of debt however a vulnerability in its incentive mechanism made it prohibitively expensive for users to sell in the days following the genesis event to enforce its peg faye had established a uniswap burn penalty that penalizes traders for transacting with fey under its one dollar peg and a relay of fae tokens on uniswep that burns underpegged tokens thereby increasing demand back to one dollar however eventually the penalty became so high that at times the burns would exceed 100 percent of a trades value effectively making the token worthless when attempting to sell it on uniswap additionally the team was alerted to a bug via its bug bounty program and so it had to suspend the minting rewards that come with buying fey leaving only the sell disincentives faye currently has a market cap of 1.6 billion dollars next headline messaging app signal to integrate cryptocurrency payment feature signal an encrypted messaging app is rolling out payments using the cryptocurrency mobile coin unlike whatsapp and imessage which allow payments to be sent via bank accounts signal is looking to provide a way to send money that nobody outside the sender or recipient can track while zcash and monero are the most popular cryptocurrencies with that sort of privacy capability signal chose mobile coins for its user experience minimal storage requirements and quick transaction time in a blog post announcing the news signal clarified that it would not have access to user balances transaction history or funds while many in the crypto community expressed excitement there were also a few dissenting voices matt corrallo a developer at square crypto tweeted there is no technical justification for signal requiring its own blockchain in order to get the payment throughput they want there is no reason at all for requiring the token issuance to go entirely to the small number of founders except to maximize profits there is zero reason even to require their own token at all when this could absolutely have been built using existing cryptocurrency systems pegged to traditional fiat currencies which would offer significantly better ux and avoid the massive value fluctuation risk that signal is now hoisting onto its user base next headline china's digital currency head start the wall street journal wrote an in-depth analysis of china's digital yuan calling it quote a first for a major economy the digital yuan launched through a mobile app that has since been downloaded over 100 000 times the government issued digital money money can be used to track people spending in real time speed relief to disaster victims or flag criminal behavior the article also notes quote the money itself is programmable beijing has tested expiration dates to encourage users to spend it quickly for times when the economy needs a jump start however the wall street journal adds that the digital yuan may also be used to tighten president xi jinping's authoritarian rule as a tracking tool making it possible to collect fines as soon as an infraction is committed the article also points out that the digital yuan could undermine the supremacy of the dollar saying quote it would provide options for people in poor countries to transfer money internationally even limited international usage could soften the bite of u.s sanctions which increasingly are used against chinese companies or individuals josh lipsky a former international monetary fund staffer now at the atlanta council think tank said quote anything that threatens the dollar is a national security issue this threatens a dollar over the long term the wall street journal notes that a chinese marketing campaign depicts a man in an american flag shirt being knocked out by an animated digital yuan conversely paypal co-founder peter thiel wondered if bitcoin should be considered a chinese financial weapon against the united states his comments especially coming from someone who considers himself a bitcoiner brought out vociferous opposition from crypto twitter as nick carter of island castleventures tweeted so there's two nations one of them has a free floating currency and permits the free flow of capital the other has a managed currency and maintains strict capital controls which nation is bitcoin more hostile to all right time for
