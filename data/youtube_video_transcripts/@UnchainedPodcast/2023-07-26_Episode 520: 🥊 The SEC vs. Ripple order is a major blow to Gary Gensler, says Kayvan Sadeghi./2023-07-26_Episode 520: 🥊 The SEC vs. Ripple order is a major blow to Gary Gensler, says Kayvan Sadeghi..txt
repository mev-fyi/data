I think this makes the theory for the coinbase lawsuit very difficult the theory there really was based on some sort of version of the embodiment Theory the tokens you know embody the scariest transactions and that is really what was squarely rejected here so yeah I think that you know there will be some effort to to sort of recast some of the allegations but I think this is a sort of a direct hit on the theory that was being espoused by the SEC there yeah I I totally agree I mean honestly I think the big winner of of this decision is coinbase I think even more so than Ripple uh coinbase I I will note immediately a few hours after the decision came out decided to re-list xrp and I think that says everything I think that the industry is viewing this decision as just as we've been saying as rejecting the sec's theory that the assets themselves are securities
