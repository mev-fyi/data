not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to chopping block every couple weeks we get together and give the industry Insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so a quick intros first we got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got tarun the gigabyte and Grand provide sorry I was about to say Robert's intro I just miss him so much but we've got we've got a wonderful guest here today uh we've got Kyle samani the Scion of Solana and then you've got myself I'm gonna see the head hat man at dragonfly um we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice so you chopping block that XYZ for disclosures by the way is Kyle our first repeat guest I think actually yeah he has a great honor of being our first repeat guest I I am honored this is my second time on the show I think last time we all were in Austin for uh consensus last year wow the world has changed so much basically uniformly worse I remember at that time actually I saw I saw that episode in preparation for this and we were talking about how bad things have gone this is like summer last year well this is I think right after Luna so that's right yeah we were like wow this is pretty bad yeah 60 60 billion dollar asset turned to zero and 48 Hours you know but it's like don't you think that things are gonna get better and you were like I actually think that it's gonna get a lot better and all these guys talk about how macro is going to be shed it's like they don't know what they're talking about I'm an optimist well it's a good it's a good uh it's a good characteristic it's been kind of a crazy week so we're all here in for East Denver and um most of us just got in the conference is just kicking off now but we've heard that there are a shitload of people here so 25 000. I've heard 25 000 I've heard a bunch of numbers I don't know what if anything is verified yet because like the main event is starting tomorrow and so I think a lot of people are coming in tonight yeah tonight and then tomorrow as well for Friday in the main event um if you've got you've got you guys haven't done anything yet but I know I yeah I was here since Monday I was at uh the axillar conference with you and then there's a bunch of zero knowledge uh conferences the interesting thing about going to these conferences that gets so big is that the side events become their own sort of mini conferences and like there are people who only came for the side events who like came Monday through Thursday and like are leaving before the main conference so that makes sense I mean the main event now is more like consensus where it's it's sort of more non-developers than developers it's so big now you just kind of almost don't want to go to the main thing thing and just like hang out and all the side stuff I think yeah the U.S ethereum conferences I personally don't like that much because they're they're not really that technical or developer focused there's a lot more like I would call it pseudo ESG propaganda like because there's like tons of the like regenerative like Finance type of stuff like there's tons of talks I love those pictures if you go look at the talks there's tons of stuff like that and like way less like how do we use their English personally there's an event called shelling point that Bitcoin is putting on and half of the talks I was like I don't I don't actually know what this talk is about but it's so it's just like very I mean not to cheat on anyone I don't I don't actually know what what they're talking about there but it's very uh difficult to understand it's just like different than like the technical ethereum conferences like Devcon or Dev connect which are are really focused on like actual new stuff they're adding to the network completely completely well okay so one of the big things that was in advance of East Denver was this big announcement by coinbase that they are launching a new L2 called base and so we don't have a ton of details right now but basically the high level of base is that it's built on the optimism stack so it's an optimistic roll up uh they are not going to have a token so don't go out trying to buy a base token apparently there was there was database a token called base um but uh they've already got a bunch of Partnerships and you know a bunch of plans for a big rollout but right now we don't have I think it's pretty scant on details but there wasn't interesting point around the um the monetization is that in the initial blog post they claimed that there was going to be 20 of the fees that the um the protocol or the I guess the coordinator uh a cruise are going to go toward optimism and then they removed that and just made a I think it's like just a generic some percentage some percentage some percentage unspecified the real question is like which department at coinbase uh authorized writing 20 and which one authorizes the removal like the finance department at the end and like the the recruiting department at the beginning very very interesting interesting but so right now I mean a lot of people are excited about this I don't know how to feel about it to be honest because I think coinbase so far they have a very mixed record of launching these things and you you have to assume that there's some half-heartedness in coinbase for doing this right like they're doing it they're not going to tokenize it they are kind of um they're they're doing the full court press it reminds me a lot of what happened with The coinbase nft Exchange which is there's a lot of Sound and Fury and then it's kind of like okay well let's see the follow through how are you guys feeling about bass I think um it really I feel similarly like coinbase gives me big clown cars stuck in a gold line Gold Mine Vibe you know um in that there is that a safe Mark Zuckerberg who's the Zuck described Twitter Twitter um this is a while ago but there are pockets of talent coinbase of like crypto people who get crypto stuff and execute well and you see those shine through in some of their products like coinbase wallet is amazing that PC stuff is super cool um the tokenized coinbase stuff is sticky stuff super cool bass scene super cool and well executed but it's kind of in the minority right like most people are you know coming from Big Tech fintech like they just don't really get crypto and therefore like the product output is not uh you know really impressive or like you know getting getting any real traction yeah it's a difficult time too because Gensler is on the war path I mean I guess not having a token makes it yeah not under his jurisdiction but still well I think uh you know I saw a very maybe somewhat Politically Incorrect tweet about um bass which was uh it's binance smart chain for white people and uh and it it's wow and so so to get some context binance smart chain is a chain actually very similar to coinbase in the sense of it you know have a smaller set of validators you can't just like join and validate the chain um and it uh it's sort of where a lot of retail users in China and Asia go to first have their first experience with actually using a wallet uh and it's it's very popular it's like the most popular blockchain actually by transaction volume um but the interesting thing is I guess the US doesn't really have that experience and so people are saying unlike coinbase right because usually they don't like yeah exchange tokens and exchange chains are very common thing right 1B has 4B chain OK X is okay whatever whatever chain um this is this is just like a Trope that since binance smart chain almost every single exchange launched its own blockchain and obviously none of them are nearly as successful as minus Merchant but coinbase always felt very aloof from like the standard kind of global exchange Playbook um and even in doing this right like they are kind of showing they're better because there's no token and in almost all these cases there's a token and the token is the native token of that blockchain and then you know there's this whole kind of like well it's got utility because using a layer one is not just like an exchange token anymore well I think the interesting thing is the the app chain on ethereum thesis so like you know if you go back the last few years Cosmos was always the place where people were like people will build special purpose blockchains for particular applications and arguably we've seen the ethereum Roll-Ups like optimism which base is using or arbitrine with Nova start to build these like sdks actually I got yelled at from one of the optimism people for calling in SDK I'm supposed to call it the uh stack OBC thank you um for building your special purpose blockchain so one interesting fact about this is coinbase may be the first of the um you know in the last bear Market there are a lot of like private blockchain whatever stuff and I kind of think the this time it's the private roll-up uh which will be the kind of like Industrial narrative I I mean the thing you always have to wonder whenever a existing business launches a new a new business line is like okay like what's their motivation how are they going to make money let's use the NIT exchange as you alluded to like well clearly they were gonna make money on transaction fees which map to their existing model turns out nfts in particular trade much better non-custodiality than custodially for for some uh reducing critical reasons there um the question I went with base is like your Finance launch BSC like largely because they could put a token in it and like they was doing a bunch of the token and they could kind of feed it into into the Empire this doesn't really have a token and so monetization is less clear um not that there there can't be some monetization lines and the obvious ones are like you know you can have swaps on there and you could take a cut you could have borrow 11 stuff and like you could have basically coinbase be an affiliate type thing like feeding these protocols and take a cut of that stuff if that's what they're doing and I don't know if that's what they're doing but that's kind of the most sensible thing um what's interesting about it is potentially a clever way to get around regular sort of stuff where the cleaning base can slowly try and move its revenue from C5 to D5 without actually taking on the risk of running a defy thing that's kind of my current operating Theory uh it's loose like I'm I'm not I'm not saying this is a great Theory the sequencer generates fees too yeah and so the sequencer fees I think are actually so for op and arbitrary they're in the 20 to 50 million a year range and you have to imagine that baseball that's gas fees okay yeah people are paying for this is profit though but there's an Arbitrage right like you aren't paying that same amount to actually set up uh they're actually they're taking it yeah there's actually a really good dude they're just taking it to their inks and paying all their employees with it I don't know where it's going I don't know where is there there's a wallet what people are paying the sequencer and what they are paying to settle the proofs on chain that's surprising no no there is clearly a business model for the sequencers there is there is but like I would assume that they'd be subsidizing it right now if the fees are that much in excess of the data cost on L1 then presumably this means people are bidding up that blocks pay for arbs and whatever else right yeah I mean it's hard to say where that volume is coming from right it's like okay are people trying to do optimism quests do they really want some op punks whatever I don't know what the answer is going to be for for base I have talked to a few teams that actually are building on base and they're excited about it and their main argument is that they're trying to Target um mass-market retail people and the coinbase connectivity with base is really appealing to them whereas super easy on and off ramp bridging usdc is it is it Defy is it gaming like who are you talking to is Building on Base some consumer-y kind of stuff social stuff some D5 kind of stuff um I haven't talked to many nft uh people building on it but have you ever moved to base or is it people know I mean it's still on testnet I mean I mean are people saying like I was going to build a polygon but now I'm going to build on base or is this like you know Blank Slate mix of both um some are this is home base okay home base um deployments Which is less commitment because it's EDM so part of I mean I've heard frequently is like oh my God it's going to be like better tied in the coinbase and like therefore we're bringing more users that that seems to be a prevailing Meme here the thing that I wonder is like mechanically what makes that true like I'm not a super active coinbase wallet user but like you go on there now and it's like you have arbitrary of optimism like there's already there and I presumably they're not going to remove those options although that would be very interesting strategic play if they remove those options let's let's assuming hands move right let's assume for now they're not gonna do that um so like and like most of these things are going to be evm copies from these other places onto base so like why is the experience better like you know and so that's the thing I wonder is like there's nothing fundamental about the base Tech stack here's the other thing about bass right so remember in the early days of binance smart chain there was a lot of drama around binance playing policemen but basically Finance right like basically shut off the bridge for people who are doing rug pulls people are doing hacks stuff like that right um and finance can do that because effectively you know there was like sort of semi-centralized you know I don't know what you want to call it now but it was much more centralized back then than it is today um for bass right like right now we don't have any kind of decentralized technology for sequencers right sequencer is just some guy running a server and that server is presumably gonna be run by coinbase right yeah so coinbase there isn't I I can't imagine a legal Theory under which their compliance team would not consider themselves liable for criminal activity taking place on base that's trying to cash out so I have to imagine that the chain is going to have to be police in some way in the way that early binus smart chain was and that might be the thing that gets them to say like hey let's maybe spin this out let's maybe like find some way to get this thing arm's length from coinbase itself I mean arguably right all the Roll-Ups do want to get to decentralized sequencer and have how long is that going to take right I mean obviously you have fraud proofs how long is does it take for the SEC to understand I don't think that's the question I mean the question is like what will coinbase's lawyers approve given you have you know billions of dollars of equity value here and I think that's a very different question yeah like if there was if there was five guys in a garage it's like hey it's whatever you take the risk but like this is a real business with real shareholders and stuff coinbase keeps confusing me on the on the regulatory front I mean part of it is the listings that they that they choose right it's like okay this is how do you mean protocol you've never used some of those some of those um and then you know with like the the um steak teeth product um you know they're using Med boost and so they're basically selling off reordering rights to people and you know sending that profit and profiting it from it and so it's like okay that's kind of suspicious I didn't really think they would actually do something like that so I don't know where they sort of draw the line because I agree with you like or you know it does seem like they would be liable sort of for policing the chain I mean even if they are not that would imply it must be kyc'd I mean just like they're just the money the money transmitter stuff I mean that's like no no I mean there'd be money transmitters because they're running there too yeah I mean yeah technically technically if they never submit the Frog proof never they never accept the problem yeah yeah exactly like there is it's very weird weird logic thing to go into the separation of sequencing for normal transactions versus fraud proofs to bail yourself out while those two effectively separated and optimistic roll up I I didn't think about that as I made the comment originally but like you kind of assume they're naturally bundled yeah I I mean okay this is all a bit of theory craft we'll have to see what happens when it actually comes out but my guess is that when this thing comes out here's the problem right like if you're mad at binance because you got rug pulled on minus marching like the most you can do is like yell on Twitter right whereas if you're mad at coinbase because you've got yeah you can sue them yeah and they are just gonna get inundated with lawsuits if you start to see just like Ponzi schemes and rug pulls and all sorts of stuff and my guess is that's going to be the activation energy that gets them to try to spin this thing out like I don't think they'll kill it but I do think that they were going to try to make it arm's length and say look we take no liability and the cleanest way to do they just have to be a separate so do you think because the op token exists you know if they needed a token incentivization for say multi-sequencer that they would just use op or do you think they would actually try to eventually have base I'm sorry I would guess it's based on success right like if base is really working well then I can imagine oh like optimism itself like the optimism Collective is that what it's called the governance group basically deciding like hey base is no longer it's not viable for bass to be subsidized by coinbase so we need to step in and kind of create the economics that makes this thing long-term viable um as long as we have that coinbase distribution engine it's worth doing right like this might even supersede optimism itself but what does this coinbase distribution engine if that's my point I made a couple minutes ago it's like you Fiat all ramps the same like you have a list of network to choose from they're all evm like these redeploy the contract like what's different here what's the difference by this margin right like they find all these different ways to partner with them and to co-market and to push thing people onto the chain but like you know buyers they also they also like early confirm your transactions they do all sorts of stuff to make the ux yeah yeah BSC from the binance interface oh they have like hosted wallets which are basically the same as them custodying it but like they they there is all this ux stuff that I would definitely not underweight okay you don't yeah you don't have to stretch the imagination that far to think of how they can sort of add preferential treatment for it right even like usdc like isn't on arbitrum and like there's you know some sort of things they can give this preference for or like have this sort of early confirmation kind of stuff push it more in like coinbase wallet so I can see that um okay all right well so um moving away from coinbase there was some more news this week about the uh the late exchange FTX so um we learned recently that nashad who was one of the what was he VP events yeah VP of engine FTX uh he just got charged and he pleaded guilty um he pleaded guilty of six counts including wire fraud uh Commodities and securities fraud money laundering unlawful political donations there was one interesting tidbit so at this point basically the entire Inner Circle of Sam has pleaded guilty to something or other and um the the interesting thing that we saw in the SC I think it was the SEC complaint against um against Assad was that um so there's a lot of stuff of like oh you should have known the thing was fraudulent and that element of blah blah we kind of know the story but the one really interesting element was that apparently in 2021 FTX had a revenue goal of hitting a billion dollars and they were supposedly 50 million short of that Revenue goal and so Sam instructed nashad to transfer money from Alameda to FTX and book it as revenue and so they sort of back ported some accounting instructions and kind of fed that to their auditor to make them think that they had hit this Revenue number of a billion dollars or whatever it was um which to me is actually a very surprisingly like kind of Smoking Gun yeah they knew it all along like there wasn't just like a a moment of of uh desperation it was like okay this was like very willful from even 2021 before any of the but to be fair that does seem just like very vanilla accounting crowd relative to some of the others that just sounds like a normal accounting fraud case that you would do which is kind of it's kind of hardening to be like oh yeah anybody can understand what they did it's not a complicated well yeah because the other one is like the the trapdoor thing for for borrowing is like a way more complicated this is just like hey we just sent 50 million bucks that's right yeah yeah it's nice to have a simple story about accounting fraud every once in a while in Christmas obviously you were in the Outer Circle of FTX uh what's your take seeing all the charges that are now being brought to FTX and everything we're learning about how the inner circle of FTX was operating uh yes multi-coin was an investor in both FTX us and ftx.com um I can't say a lot uh I don't really know any more than you always get information in the Press same as everyone else uh it's just sad and frustrating I mean mostly like at this point it's pretty clear like it was a fraudulent scheme when exactly the fraud started unclear it seems to be the beginning or close to the beginning but I I'm not sure I have definitive proof to make that that claim but certainly stuff like this makes it seem like it was earlier rather than later um like I just want people to get their money back and be made as whole as possible oh yeah actually we well galwa who I guess we didn't mention them no we didn't so yeah um he was also on the show Kevin Kevin Joe uh he was uh Infamous actually we brought him on right after Tara collapse because he was one of the few people who was kind of thing he was actively short he was actually short hair and he was sort of calling out the the impending failure of Tara um he had you know he was an active Trader I think Market neutral strategy and he had something like half of his fund on FTX uh and so he recently ended up liquidating his fund um very unfortunate to see because he was well regarded as being a very early and active fund manager in crypto um so you know it's it's been it's been a really rough year for a lot of fun managers uh because of course everybody assumed that FTX was above board regardless of whatever misgivings you might have had about them or strategy or Solana or whatever um a lot of good people got hit from what happened with FDX yeah it's really sad I know a few other fans I won't name them because I'm not sure they're publicly said yeah and I'll see other funds that unfortunately have gotten hit bad too I think I mean there's obviously been like a lot of Articles written about you know changing you know due diligence practices and um investment practices at VCS in FTX and on FTX and everyone's sort of reevaluating themselves I guess like at multi-client how do you guys think about what's next I guess in terms of investing in C5 investing in early stage companies like how are you guys are thinking about um lessons yeah we have changed a lot of our operational processes around collateral Management on exchanges um to tighten that up just so that if anything does happen again in the future we'll hopefully have less less collateral there in terms of underwriting It's Tricky I mean we've obviously gone back and re-looked off our own underwriting stuff and as best we can tell everything we were shown as of what we when I said in I think August of 21. so uh maybe July of 21 something like that and as best we can tell everything we looked at was accurate as at the time but again like who knows what we're going to find out still still in the future um the most interesting thing we actually were very concerned about was the Alameda relationship obviously um and actually they were very forthcoming in the data room they presented this without even asking uh alameda's percentage of volume over time uh and for the first like 15 16 months it was a flat line at 49 because they were basically one half of every trade was Alameda and then starting around like I don't know mid 2020 or something that started to decrease very very gently and by you know mid to late 2021 uh it was like seven percent or six percent or something like that and we were like okay how do we vet this and we concluded the best way to vet it was to call all the other market makers ask them hey what what percentage of volume do you believe you represents so we called like seven market makers they gave us what their rough estimations were and we were like okay this actually matches up against against the chart in Alameda is the show going and that that to us was like one of the best indications of okay this everything we're looking at makes sense that was the thing to look at I don't think at that time Alameda had large loans or FTX in fact it may not have had any loans or FTX at that time um but that mainly obviously came up came up later but that was the big thing we looked at and so you know Affiliated party transactions it's it I mean you never want it it's never good we passed an ftt seed round because of the affiliation like explicitly back in April 2019 uh and so it's just it's weird how these things come about but like you know some things like you can do all the duty you want and then if business practices change after the fact like what what do you do yeah yeah I think um since the class of FTX like diligent standards across the industry have gone up and just the expectations among entrepreneurs what to expect when receiving investment have changed so you know before FDX I mean especially before the summer when you know when three arrows collapse and the market really started taking a turn um it was very common that Iran would just be like hey this is my data room which is like a deck and then like you know kind of chicken scratch balance sheet and there's like yeah in or out you know you got two days and I've already got a term sheet and I've got 20 other term sheets lined up and now it's a very very different environment and um thankfully that means one rounds are slower they're more meticulous they're more thoughtful and it also means that entrepreneurs understand hey there's a diligence process that needs to take place especially when you're writing a meaningful check especially post seed right so I mean there's actually I remember right after FTX uh Sequoia which wrote like I think they wrote like 300 million in FTX uh they had this uh there was there was this article that they quoted them saying that we are going to start demanding audits for our seed Investments and I was like okay that is a little bit you want that won't that just like burn through their runways yeah his Runway no no no the company no no I think the Sequoia would pay for it there's no way they would demand that a seed Stage Company the the article was quite ambiguous about that that was why I was like I was like I didn't know who's actually paying in that I I don't know cash is not the problem it's the entrepreneur's time I mean and yeah five ten person companies like the CEO in the CEOs none of them know how to go through a big four audit yeah so we have to depreciate the laptop every second yeah so I think there there was you know especially after FDX there was this sort of moment of overreaction um and obviously Sequoia took a big hit from your reputationally this was like you know one of their biggest kind of face losing moments was was the collapse of FTX well the other thing is growth and growth Investments like have also collapsed partially I mean FTX is more like the cherry on top but there was already this kind of like Tech growth stage investment SAS investment stuff like that had already like really decayed through 2022 and like I think FTX was kind of like the pin of like there's no growth investing right now basically yeah other than sort of like vulture um kind of activist type of stuff so it's interesting to see that I mean I'm actually more curious what the vulture and activists landscape in crypto look like because I actually feel like it's going to be really growing this year and there's going to be all sorts of interesting weird M A transactions that you know one would never have thought would have existed six months ago how do you do have M A with tokens there was a few attempts of this so there was a Ferrari there was a couple of others I don't even recall as far as I can tell none of them have really worked oh there's new Cipher keep I believe is another one uh that one is easier though because they what they did was they because they were both separate chains they just merged their node clients and then uh merge the validation I think it's much well no no it's much easier than the merging two dowels because the two Dows have to like to vote on the like economic substance changes which are like much more contentious versus versus like the no software upgrades actually more like you just pick up you pick a conversion price and then you accept one chain I wrote a blog post in 20 there was a meme about like crypto M A in 2017 I remember as we as we as this is right as we started multi-coin and I was like dude with that without drag along rights like I don't know how you do Evan a and like I haven't read that post in four years but like I I think they're actually I got most of it right like it seems very difficult for token teams now for non-token teams it definitely was going to be some M A but like for token teams that I'm I'm skeptical I think the teams give up and go home they what appears to be is as long as you don't do it what appears to be the the norm is that as long as you don't act in bad faith but like hey the thing's not working and you give up and go home then you can go home and then you launch a new thing and like things seem to generally be okay I'm not saying that's not legal advice or financial advice that's been my observation uh crypto well the interesting thing is actually in the galwa case um this sort of like third tier four-tier Investment Bank btig was apparently the one that's like handling the claims and so I think there's actually this interesting thing of like you know investment banks that are not like too close to the FED like they're kind of like the fifth tier not very good and uh you know they seem to be really really active in some of the C5 stuff right now and so that's where I think I'm not necessarily saying protocol M A is going to happen but it does feel like you know there's gonna be a lot I think there's still a lot of blood left to bleed for some of the companies that are not viable anymore because to be honest people raised so much money last year and in 2021 as well so I think for a lot of these companies that their revenues have collapsed but they still have enough Runway to keep going for like six months maybe 12 months I mean the craziest version of this is paxos right because most of their revenue came from busd right so now it's that's gone it's not no no it's not gone it's not gone they can't they can't mint more but they don't have to force redeem everything I'm not sure nydfs but they only made money on create redeem fees right um but it's still a big pile of money but what do you do if you're taxes like half of what paxos was actually doing earlier was doing stable coins for like the PayPal revolute whatever right like yeah they've all gone right and so it's interesting that they actually have like this huge amount of cash but like it's very unclear what to do and I guarantee you there will be some activism over that I mean look busd was like 90 of their revenue and with that collapsing I mean they've indicated so we still don't have any indication of what the lawsuit is that the SEC has filed against paxos for busd the the leak is that it's a security and that's why they're suing that we don't actually know um but once we see that case I mean the axis is already set in the press that they're gonna fight which no surprise it's like the whole business so of course they're gonna fight um but the the nydfs did not say shutdown uh busd they just said stop minting it until you fix this other stuff which I guess like I don't know what the other stuff is because all of the claims about binance funny accounting was like a year ago or something um so this is all retroactive that people are finding that hey this thing was I'm back to certain points but maybe it's like there's certain protections we want you to put into place or like certain you know well I I just could imagine that there's activist investors who are like paxos should actually just return their capital from their stream and then go out of business we still make good Revenue though just with like the float for sure for sure but I this looks like one of these like classic uh uh kind of like in public market active activist investment type of place where like there's no growth in the company but they have a ton of assets on the balance sheet and investors try to go break it up or get it to to sell and that and to me they seem to be the most interesting like game theory for these like PE people I know I know it's a lot of fun topics but I I for some reason I like for you apparently I had like I had a dream about it the other day you had a dream about paxis I thought you dream about DK or maybe yeah you know sometimes you gotta you gotta schedule okay okay so you don't you don't dream in math papers you dream in like PE takeovers got it okay interesting everyone's the real the real tarun I see but I'm just saying like things like that yeah I'm really expecting to see some some crazy okay well let's let's go back to your bread and butter let's talk about Solana so um a Mainstay on the show we love doing shows around it's a lot of downtime we actually did not plan this but it just so happened that salon down this line had a 20 hour outage they claim that they still do not know the root cause of the of the outage but it was around the time of a protocol upgrade um and it totally wrote a blog post saying that they were going to have some renewed engineering practices around upgrades and and you know better testing and having some kind of a red team to uh you know investigate the stability of protocol upgrades and stuff like that um but there was just a lot of people kind of shouting and being mad that Solana was down um Kyle you're obviously the closest to Solana what's your take on the latest bout of Solana downtime uh uh it's definitely frustrating I mean things were seemed to have been going very well and just like it feels like an unforced error it was probably due to the 114 upgrade uh so I I think that's the primary source of frustration is it felt like an unforced error um you know Solana Labs since since the beginning it's been like very clear like  fast move as quickly as possible and like ship an MVP that like I mean what they shipped in March 2020 was like barely functional at all and like they've known there's just been huge amounts of memory leaks and like consistency stuff and consensus I mean they've known like they've had a huge laundry list of stuff to work through and it seems like they basically worked their way through that that core list um and so like you know put out a blog post I think a day or two ago saying hey like we've worked through our laundry list like we believe the core system is stable for the from this point forward we need to like re-prioritize engineering efforts around stability as opposed to speed um I don't know if that that claim is valid or not I will tell um but but you know like it seems like to have been a a a a moment in time to shift how you think about restart values in the ecosystem um that I clearly were one thing before and I think these I think this was kind of like the demarcation point for those values changing um so hopefully that's a sign of of the thing system maturing and things getting better but obviously TBD with any weird technical stuff you never know so what's your what's your read on the vibe in solanaland because you know after FTX there was kind of this profit disillusion man price collapsed and then it rebounded really dramatically in January and now it's sitting at like 23 24 so it's sitting actually at a higher than it was when FTX collapsed um what's what's your sense of like the community the spirit like how's it feeling internally um I I I was never really worried that like in the wake of the FX collapse the things would fall apart I know a lot of people were like fighting pretty hard and pretty concerned I was never worried about that um today I think there's a really galvanizing moment FTX for for the community and so those people continue to build and operate um I think this is mostly just like uh I think that actually primary impact of this recent outage is less on the community more on Solana labs around engineering and release processes um and I and it's always made some public amendments change I think those will continue to evolve so I'm fairly optimistic there um in terms of like everything else I think nothing else has really changed in the last 48 hours um if you were wanting to build some sort of high performance decks thing like relative to a week ago I don't think that the environment of your options of where to build has really changed in a meaningful way and so I think those people will do what they're doing and for most people building apps I think that they're their their values and what they're looking for in a chain like the systems are different evm versus Solana is different enough that like I don't think the calculus is really changing for for most people so I actually I I would actually disagree a little bit there's so there's a lot of sort of Solana devs like long time Selena devs I think that this incident fragmented and you could see the sentiment shift where there were certain developers who were really like you know we need to you know because the sauna Foundation had a little bit of a gaff and said the following statement which then got uh caused the Schism which is like Solana PRI uh prioritizes safety over liveness when ethereum prioritizes liveness over safety which is sort of an untrue statement uh but you could see a lot of developers galvanized by this statement you can definitely see the people who are working on the dexes like the the um like Phoenix and open book and stuff they took and and like Judo who's doing Mev stuff they took a lot of the brunt of having to to restart things and on the app layer uh and you could definitely see they were quite angry compared to say like the nft side of Solana which is like we didn't really care which would I thought that was interesting there's clearly this developer Schism at least sent in sentiment of reaction to this I mean if you're if you're just measuring by developer wait there's a lot more developers on the D5 side than on the nft side but there are a lot more users on the nft side than on the D5 side right so I could see that on Solana I can imagine that like a lot of developers are pissed but a lot of the activity on Solana driving day to day is more nfts gaming which are just less Dev heavy than the D5 stuff yeah I I just would say like I the it definitely seems different than the prior outages where there was a lot more Unison of like hey we're just gonna fix it and like rah-rah tomorrow's a new day this time seemed like very you know qualitatively different distinct I mean there was there was some pretty objective sloppiness in the rollout right so from one one from 13 to 14 there was like I think 300 PRS or something whereas all the prior ones that was Max like 25 PR's no so so like it was an order of magnitude just more changes in terms of just like the files being changed or whatever um and so and so I think that that's a and I think that was just like unforced air like they should have just staged that in in smaller increments um and then B you know like the days leading up to to the upgrade Anatoly was like everyone please upgrade everyone please upgrade and a couple people were like I don't know about an upgrade and like obviously with hindsight like you look like an idiot so um I think there's a lot of those fact patterns there but like this was definitely an unforced error I think I think that's like the the the core of the problems uh or the core of the frustration the stuff that happened a year ago was just like hey the system had bugs in it and like the bugs got exposed and it fell over um this file is just like clearly an unforced error and that's frustrating so what are you excited about in Solana land for the next like you know let's say uh 12 months yeah uh I'll type on touch on two things one I'll touch on this Hive mapper which I've been following on Twitter I've been tweeting a lot about recently um hivemapper is a new business model for Gathering data to build a map um so the idea is you know Google has the Google Street View cars that drive around you've probably seen those those things are about half a million dollars uh and Google has I don't know 500 of them a thousand I don't know how many they have it but it's obviously some fixed number um the idea with Hive mappers put a dash cam in in your dashboard of your car and you drive around then as you drive around you can collect images and upload them and build a map that way um there are high vampers started shipping their dash cams to Consumers right around November 1st it was right around break point was when they they did it so it's been four months three months since they launched and there's about 10 000 total contributors who have contributed to the Hive mapper app they are as if I checked a day or two ago they're doing 30 000 unique kilometers per day um which for a sense of scale there's about 60 million Road kilometers in the world so 30 000 in one day is five basis points of the entire world which like is shockingly High um given this thing is three months old um so like that that thing I feel like is taking off and working um and so I'm super excited about Hive mapper all that stuff's on chain the honey tokens the nfts representing each hexagon or whatever how they do the mapping that stuff's all flying around that chain and it's pretty exciting um the other one I'll highlight is helium which is migrating to Solana on March 27th um helium today there's two two major parts to it there's the iot network which is is now kind of ramping up demand that thing's growing 30-ish percent month over month although from a low base uh and then their 5D stuff which today basically there's no demand uh but I think we'll turn on uh shortly with helium mobile um I'm just like excited about this vision of like telecoms are one of those hated companies in the world their capital structure is terrible their NPS scores are terrible um it'll take a long time for helium to be competitive in terms of coverage with the Telecom that's not even a question but like it's one of the biggest Visions in the world and they seem to have sparked the like in those same way you have the crazy Libertarians and photographers get into Bitcoin in the early days like I think there's a sufficient mass of people who like buy into this vision of like let's take a swing at telecoms and see if we can architect the network in a different way and I think that critical mass is pretty large um and so I'm optimistic we can get there mobile can be the first kind of Flagship on the demand side to get us there so those are the two things that I'm excited about they have nothing to do with speculation they're fairly removed from the rest of crypto markets which is as positives and negatives to it but like those two things in my mind are fairly uh acyclical demand drivers yes they're both very tied to real world activity and also both yes uh you know two applications that really take advantage of the scale of Solana and the and the you know the price point yeah exactly right I mean Hive mapper today about roughly 10 000 people per day are hitting the chain in various ways and with helium it should be a few hundred thousand per day on the day of the migration and both of those numbers could easily 10x respectively by the end of the year that's great okay well there's one last story I want to get to which is a bit more crypto native um so there was a there was a hullabaloo about um so there's an application called Oasis which uh spun out of maker Dao a little a little while back and they have uh they have a wallet that you can use like interact with defy and do like recursive borrowing or whatever they used to be a DEX they used to be a desk back in the day and then they sort of became this broader you know kind of tool chain um so if you recall it's a rewinding way back if you recall last year Wormhole the bridge got hacked uh for 350 million dollars I believe and the Wormhole attacker uh so you know jump kind of made whole hole kind of filled back in the the hole that was missing but there was a long investigation try to figure out okay where do the hack funds go it turned out about um 150 million of the funds were in a in Oasis um contract is the headline number all of ether had fallen into the hands of a single contract uh owned by Oasis and so jump you know sort of looking into the code of how this thing worked and they realized that like hey um there's some kind of you know admin function and it turns out if you craft a message and just so you know such a perfect way uh with the help of the admin key you can actually basically like hot fix a way to take the money out of the contract but you have to get the collaboration from the admin key and so jump approached uh or a subsidiary of jump whatever approached uh Oasis and they were like hey we found this thing I don't know we found this thing we know this is the guy uh can you do this and jump and then Oasis was like oh we tried it we can confirm that it works but we're not willing to do this can you get a court order to make us do it right and so they went to a high court in England and the high court was like yeah make them do it and then they made him do it and then Oasis based basically conspired with jump to you know contort to hack the hackers to hack to hack back uh and take the money out and then Oasis was like we now that we've found this exploit we're going to patch it to make sure that this can't happen again um so very very interesting reverse hack that has caused a lot a lot of conversations obviously it's great that some of the money's gotten back and obviously jump you know it's I'm glad that they're being hole in the hackers being uh losing some money but very very interesting precedent of collaborating with an admin key to force somebody to hack their own contract to amend some kind of violation what are you guys thoughts on the situation the only thing I have to say is I've never seen a Chris black tweet with as much uh as much in terms of like interaction and knowledge the number of people right Chris black is a uh online defy console control I think you would I think you'd appreciate that yeah yeah well he he already dislikes the show apparently based on some some tweets I think he dislikes the show I think he has a complicated relationship with the show um it is I mean this is always kind of the meme right like defies and decentralized because there's a multi-sig that controls you know governance upgrades blah blah blah and obviously some teams have on-chain you know token voting and stuff like that but I feel like you very very very rarely see a multi-stick without a time lock which is how most of these other protocols do it right so okay sure it's a multi-sig that controls governance but there's a 48 hour delay when new upgrades uh get deployed so if you don't like it you know you can move your funds out yeah exactly this didn't have a time lock um apparently and so they just made the change and like then it was live and so uh kind of ridiculous about this and uh I like the way he framed it um there's been a fun Theory long-standing meme in crypto of code is Law and it turns out uh law is Law and code law and I've come I've come to that sounds like a good bumper sticker it's a hard one to play but you know when someone honks at you one evening is one eighth right that's yeah yeah yeah Wow's law okay well I guess I guess that's a good a note is any dented on Law's law I feel like we learned something any big plans this week at Denver anything you're excited about um I think there's a interesting thing where you know in the same way that um currently the AI anyone who just appends dot AI to their name Will suddenly get a 100 million dollar seed round a little bit like you know Solana projects in 2021 uh there's a tiny version of that in ZK land where there's a lot of people who are like a lot of them who are like I'm just adding ZK zero knowledge proofs or or MPC and like trying to like bolster their evaluation so I'm more interested in seeing all of the marketing shifts for me personally that's like people who are doing something else and all of a sudden that like they had sort of like this uh change I I haven't seen too many AI things yet thankfully but yeah I've seen a number of them I think the hype cycle du jour is either ZK or Ai and uh especially you know some kind of llm generative something something and kind of trying to force crypto and token into that somehow yeah I'm seeing a lot I I really want to just like take some of these pitches and then put them into chat gbt and be like make an analogous pitch and see how close it is have you all seen any things that pitch themselves as AI things that are other than like tapping the latent uh GPU resources that like that you think crypto Maps into them well and that crypto is not just being forced into them for the sake of it I think the only thing I haven't really looked too deeply in this and I think it's probably is like people are pitching I just made this is what you're alluding to basically doing like decentralized training um so it's like training does not work yeah as a disclosure that is I think the only AI investment that I have uh is is a decentralized training thing I think the more interesting thing about it is a lot of them are adapting fraud proofs from layer twos where you challenge the uh and this goes back to like the old true bit ideas yeah yeah but like people have actually are basically taking the layer two code for doing that stuff and actually using it to generate proofs so that like if I'm running a GPU how do I know you're not just giving me random numbers I'm actually giving you real trained weights and they have this like challenge systems for that so that stuff I actually think is going to be kind of interesting it may not end up being useful for decentralized training but the idea that fraud proofs can be used for other things is is like something cool to say it is interesting I mean okay I think we should do a show on crypto AI at some point I think that's probably a good idea because there's so much being talked about right now and I feel like this is a fruitful area for conversation I know that we have to go because taruna is a speaking engagement so he's always either early or sorry he's not always either late or he has to leave early so in the in the spirit of true and I guess let's wrap up um thank you everybody another episode of The Chopping blog we'll be back next week thanks for being repeat cast great thanks for being here great to be here guys thanks for having me thanks for having me all right see everyone bye everyone [Music]
