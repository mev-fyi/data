them at info at Killman law today's guest is Elizabeth Stark co-founder and CEO of lightning labs welcome Elizabeth hey Larr it's great to be here this week you announced a 10 million dollar series a funding round led by craft ventures congratulations thank you it's been quite a week yes I know because you emailed me very late last night I was like she must've had a long day so at the same time you also announced the beta launch of lightning loop which is your first paid products why don't we talk about that first what is lightning loop yeah sure so lightning loop is a product that we at lightning labs developed to make it more efficient to send and receive Bitcoin on the Lightning Network and the nature of lightning is such that you have amazing speed amazing scalability and very low fees but there is a requirement of liquidity and what that means is if you want to receive funds on lightning you need what we call inbound liquidity to do so and then this is more obvious to the average individual but if you want to send funds you need you know funds on the side that you're going to sends you need the ability to say have money in your account and so what lightning loop does is it helps people reallocate their funds in the network so for example if a lot of people have sent me funds on lining already and I no longer have that inbound capacity or liquidity as we call it I then can no longer keep receiving those funds so lighting loop can actually help people buy moving their funds from Lightning back to the Bitcoin blockchain in a noncustodial manner so they could keep receiving and then similarly if you want to send funds on lightning you can actually refill your channel think of it as refilling an account using lightning loop by swapping funds from the Bitcoin blockchain on to lightning so an analogy I sometimes use Luke in as we call it when you refill your channel is kind of like refilling a prepaid debit card or an account loop out is a little bit harder because we don't usually have that concept but if you had a cash register full of cash and you actually did take the cash out and then you can continue to receive money in that register that's how that works so we're lighting Luca builders product we already had it in alpha I had quite a lot of startups involved some great folks like Fuld have been users of it and it's helping their businesses it's helping them more effectively send or receive funds and lightning and we've gotten a lot of good feedback so far and we announced a beta with increased limits for people to be able to move their funds in and out of lightning from the Bitcoin blockchain and it would have the limits been and what are they now so lightning Network generally today has a limit of around 1,500 US dollars per channel so channels are kind of like accounts on the network people open multiple channels between two participants there's also a transaction limit which is point zero four to BTC so it's about 300 350 dollars depending upon the price of Bitcoin if the de loop originally was capped previously at half that's about 150 USD no it's up to around 300 350 and though that will stay in place while the caps are present on the Lightning Network more broadly but there's something called wumbo kind of like jumbo with a W that is horizon spongebob and cream hope co-founder is not a spongebob I just missed the whole spongebob thing but he's really into it and that is about larger channel sizes on lightning so today we saw these limits in place we chose to do so for safety and security reasons but with wumbo they will be opted in larger channel sizes so the good news is somebody won't unintentionally opening massive channel and not realize what they're doing but if they choose to do so they'll be able to and put more capital into lightning in these channels so with one bow and the broader network will also increase loop capacities as well and soos as you mentioned you know the limits so far have been pretty small but you did talk about some of the companies that we're building on them so what are the typical applications that companies are using lightning for now yeah so we've seen this the whole host of startups emerge which has been really incredible less than two years ago at lightning labs you released the beta version of our LNG implementation of the Lightning Network their numerous implementations there's a sea lightning from block stream there's a Claire from us Inc so we built ours we release his beta and since then we've seen a whole new crop of startups emerged I didn't even exist prior to this and many of them are focused on lightning first so there are a few categories of these one that I know our head of operations Desiree Dickerson loves is the rise of the lightning gaming startup so quite a few video game companies have emerged there's zbd Donner lab Satoshi's games where they're integrating lightning payments into their video games so I think that's a really cool use case and we've seen a lightning payment startups where you can buy things with lightning so we have fold it refilled open node is helping people it's a payment processor there's BTC Pei where merchants can integrate a Bitcoin and lightning and run their own software in order to do so so there's the ability to then pay with lightning and there's lightning pizza which is a cool project from Fuld where you can order piece of lightning and in some cases with Fuld I believe you get shots back as well then we have the earning with lightning companies there's a great one called stack I mean look who doesn't want more Bitcoin I won't work a coin right so people think of lightning as people spending Bitcoin but there's actually huge potential for people earning Bitcoin as well so stock is a really great start up just on the founder last night where people can complete these small tasks if you know Amazon Mechanical Turk and then they earn Satoshi's on lightning because think about it this way if you wanted to pay people around the world in a variety of different countries to do small value tasks and you wanted to do it with you know in the Fiat system good luck you know that's just not going to be possible so stock is a great way to complete tasks do micro work and earn on with lightning and then their companies like Tippin and a variety of products where you can actually tip people and again earn you know people can actually make money with lightning I know we see the rise of a lightning financial startup and they're quite a few of these as well River Financial for example and Disclosure personally and my personal capacity I'm an advisor they are they've integrated LNG lightning where you can deposit and withdraw and you can buy bitcoin with dollars and withdraw drugs and lightning or you can deposit and then sell for USD we have assured which is building a lightning native API we have spark spark which is doing trading we have zap which is doing an OTC you can transact between USD and lightning save a host of those and they have the wallets and there's some great ones like breeze moon zap is also working in a wallet there's blue wallet wallet of Satoshi so there's really been just this huge ecosystem that has emerged in less than two years and this past fall we co organized a lightning conference we had 500 developers enthusiast community members in Berlin people came from all around the world you know every continent and it was incredible to see that in person and to really see it be tangible and to enter this world of lightning where everyone was buying there was a lady beer tap lady cocktail bar you could buy ice cream hot chocolate all sorts of interesting things with lightning you could play video games as lightning there was a lightning scooter there was a Tesla coil where when you paint it it actually sparked like yesterday and I actually live finance live stream are a head of operations that I said the chickens are poor yo feed communities you know they're real business is being built on this but they're also these crazy use cases you're like wait if I if I thought a few years ago that the tech we're building was gonna help us few chickens it happened right I'm actually oh man it was it Chris Dixon or was it Fred Wilson one of them said something like you know the technologies that will be big some days start off looking like games and like fun to people like a toy yeah yeah and a couple other things I just wanted to refer back to for people who don't know which I suspect is just a small percentage of my listeners but just in case when Elizabeth's talked about earning SATs back that's Satoshi's and a Satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin which is eight decimal places today one Satoshi is about nine thousands of a cent and it's interesting because in the lighting community we've actually moved to the sets the nominations and there's a whole name around stacking sets and I like I like the earnings that's one two maybe we need more alliteration there with the community in the Lightning world actually operates in satoshis which i think is really interesting and different and you're like well I got ten thousand Satoshi shoes and you're like oh wait it's actually just you know yeah but I do think that like there is something about thinking about money in new ways or something there's just it's like a new behavior and like something new like I remember when you and I met in person and you showed me a shoe I forget the name of it but the the clock or the clocks are the know yeah exactly so it's this little um I don't know what you call that it's like a mechanic a sign and it like will flip these letters but you basically like pay with lightning and then you can tell it what sign you want to put up there so I of course I said like something like you have to listen to Unchained but anyway so for people who didn't know that and then the other thing I wanted to mention or ask you about actually was you know you talked about how lightning loop is enabling payment processing but obviously you know we've had payment processors in Bitcoin before how is lately lightning loop different from the previous Bitcoin payment processors totally one quick correction 1,000 Ounces ten cents I just did the math man yeah so lightning loop is not an end user interface so companies that are facilitating payments will use loop that makes sense so full a company that you know is enabling people to purchase with lightning at major retailers order lightning pizza I believe they operate gift cards where then you can get discounts and you also get SATs back so fold is going to be the user of our product so it's more allow that the customers are the startups and then the end users will interact with sold so although it's not a perfect analogy by any means but you know stripe is a company where you know if fold was using credit cards they would interact with stripe and then fold would work with stripe and fold the burka the end user so straightens out of every technology because we don't charge per transaction on the network the network is an open protocol anyone can build on top of it but we're building tools and loop is the first of several that will make it more efficient and easier and by improving that efficiency the goal is we work with these startups and we empower them to build their businesses so does that make sense so we're not building an end-user product where BTC pay is another great example of if you're a merchant and you want to integrate Bitcoin of lightning you can run BTC pay and we're not building that merchant front end although merchants might actually be interested in loop via something like BTC pay as well right right and and but one key piece also is that they don't actually take custody when they do it so it enables the yes and is non-custodial and that's a really important point as a business lightning labs you know we don't want to hold other people's money we think that the technology opens up this new world where you know never before have you been able to have financial products where you don't have custody you know in the pre Bitcoin world you know a bank had to have your funds or if you were trading securities a broker had to hold your securities there was not this concept of non-custodial financial products but these new technologies enable that so we as a company are focused on that you know I don't want to build a bank I don't wanna hold other people's money I know there are a lot of regulatory questions around money so we are just building the technical infrastructure to make it possible to people for people to do things with their phones alright so in a moment we're gonna discuss more about lightning loop as well as lightning labs is series a but first a quick word from the sponsor who make this show possible crypto at law is run by crypto oh geez in New York who understand crypto and FinTech they were already operating in the space back in 2013 in the accept crypto as payment one of the partners a Creek Hellman is known for drafting and Bill submitted to the US Congress in 2014 aimed at exempting on chained Bitcoin transactions from US regulations the other founding partner his brother Daniel Coleman became well known in the crypto law space for his work in the mount Cox civil rehabilitation so if you operate a FinTech business or have a dispute with some person or a business involving crypto or you just need legal advice related to crypto info at

Stark of lightning labs so as you mentioned you know your lightning laps will not be charging per transaction but how will lightning labs make money from loop so dope is already in production and people are already using it and we're already taking fees on this so there's a percentage fee which can vary in terms of the amount that you transact in Luke so for example you don't always need Luke when you're transacting but let's say you're a company and then you've gotten a lot of in down payments and now you need additional liquidity or you know ability to receive inbound payments then you would do a loop as we call it and that would give you the liquidity and capacity to receive funds so we take a percentage on that transaction if that makes sense so broadly speaking there's a volume that will occur Malou product and then we take a small Fiona and going back to your ten million dollar raise which we sort of glossed over at the beginning what do you plan to do with that money yeah totally first of all I just want to say this you don't often hear this you know from founders or maybe they say it publicly but they don't actually mean it but our our investors have been amazing and I'm really grateful to be working with them and they're all fans of lightning just yesterday we were with our new board member who was wearing his whole oknot t-shirt right you know it's like you know and exactly yeah primary so we brought together an amazing group of people that really care deeply about this ecosystem and a lot of them are also funding the onward startups or building or lightning but as a company I don't see this fund raised in and of itself as an accomplishment to me as it means to an end and the end is really building out the technology building the developer ecosystem building the startups and our focus as a company as well I want to build for real users I want to enable real use cases I want to solve real problems and I do think at a higher level some part of the community broadly in crypto currency has a lost touch with that and I'm trying to really bring this to you know solving real problems with real users and making these things easier to use so for the funding the the main goal is really to continue building out the technology to build out the business most of the money will likely go to hiring you know we as a start-up are not spending huge amounts of money we have ICO is out there with hundreds of millions of dollars and we've shipped in many cases I think way more than that in on a couple million so the goal is really to build out the technology and hire some great people I don't want to I don't believe in you know hiring a hundred people at once you know well hire high-impact individuals that can really make a difference I was once actually chatting with somebody who was a big name in the financial world and explaining lightning and you know Bitcoin today is a hundred seventy billion dollar economy and they said to me oh how many people do you have 500 and I said at that time eleven scale at which we can build things I think is is different from what you see in a lot of the traditional financial world cuz you know individual developers and team members can have a huge impact yeah by the way even the lightning protocol itself today amongst the implementations you know the that are out there from may not I think less than 10 full-time protocol developers which is wild of course we're laning labs are working on some other products as you know but in terms of the core protocol there really aren't very many people out there yeah well I mean this is something I think about a lot because they do feel like the technology can replace a lot of the people at these huge financial services firms which ya never know so we have both great people from the tech side of things and then we brought in a lot of the people from the financial world that are getting really interested excited about lightning so we had a lot of that New York's financial representation because they understand the potential of Bitcoin to be this internet money and both as a global store of value but a global transaction platform in a global trading platform so and we also had people with the the broader perspective internationally so the goal was to bring together people from a variety of different areas of expertise yeah well that's I was gonna ask you about this because some of your investors were like really traditional financial people you know there were Howard Morgan of Renaissance Technologies ARCA group and first round capital there was John Pfeffer formerly of private equity firm KKR so I was curious to know like what is it like making a pitch to an investor from traditional finance like do they tend to have different questions or do they tend to have a different perspective on the potential and the technology or do you find that they you know more and more just have a typical kind of crypto mindset yeah we also have our o Stephens the CEO of Stone Ridge or just I believe it's 16 billion asset manager David D Heller who was a global head of securities at Goldman Sachs so hey these people believe in Bitcoin right so in my experience if somebody's super skeptical you know converting them can take a while but when people understand the potential here and for the John's effort by the way has done amazing work in funding the Bitcoin developer ecosystem and has written great research around it so you know we're converting people that thought you know their coin was a joke right we're working with people that see this potential but you know Howard Morgan has a great computer science background I had some great technical discussions where I was explaining lightening routing and the variety the technologies were building you just got it because he was like oh I work on similar things in the and the eighties so interesting cool so from our standpoint these are people that understand that you know there's a massive future for Bitcoin and they see the potential of lightning and I think we're seeing more and more of that in the traditional financial world and I love the forward-thinking visions that are coming along with it and I mean earlier you know you talked about how you do plan to hire and stuff for your with your new round of investment but I was also wondering like what are some of the problem areas that you feel need to be solved with this technology that you'd like to work on definitely so one of the big areas for Bitcoin more broadly and that's also president lighting is Bitcoin is not terribly easy to use today right you have this like complicated address either bc1 or starting with a 3 or starting with the one people don't typically think it's easy to use no lightning has been you know unmade net with variant a variety betas for less than two years right 22 months or so so we know that it's not there yet but to me getting toward a world in which lightning is really usable in some cases users might not even know they're using I think that's quite a possibility moving forward say fast forward five years from now I think it's key and you know ideally users are just transacting either via QR codes or you know there can be NFC type technologies in apps where it's seamless and it's super simple things even like backups for non-custodial wallets can get challenging so one of the big challenges I see and something I'm really passionate about is how can we design this technology so that the end users can interact with it more effectively and we're seeing a lot of great well it's out there that have been working on this as well and trying to make lightning more usable and so for lightning labs I want us we just had we did these things called round tables we had one for companies integrating L&D and then one for the walls building upon O&D and we want to know you know what their needs are in terms of the infrastructure in the protocol so I see this new crop of wallets that has emerged as a way to make this technology more usable and bring it to about a wider variety of people and for example I just we can have a go videoconference in to Venezuela I've never been there I would love to go one day to a maid up there and they were discussing lightening and it was kind of a surprise appearance and it was really cool and they actually created their own lightning torch internally at the Meetup and people were spending the funds around so to me if we can get to a point where this technology is more usable and more accessible you know I believe it'll happen but it just takes time and and we need to progress the infrastructure we need to build better usable interfaces I think Jeff Muller's Ed's app has done an incredible job with that you know there quite a few well it's out there where people are really thinking about making the technology more usable yeah yeah I watched his video last week of this new strike app and I was like oh like this you know it's like similar to what you were saying or like you could use the technology and not know it exactly it was very seamless yeah and intelligently to use as well email right so there's an underlying protocol called SMTP that powers the email that people are using but people don't know they're using SMTP they just know they're sending and receiving messages so similarly I can see a day in the future where people are sending and receiving lightning and they don't even fully realize that lightning is underlying it but it's powering a lot of what they're doing on the Internet in terms of sending or receiving money and there have also been some applications that have emerged that are lightening chat applications where people actually sending messages on the network and that has become a little bit controversial it's funny how they're like developer controversial things in the community because some people think it's spam but right now the way that it's constructing the protocol it doesn't you don't have to guarantee a payment but that's actually going to change but Yoast Nigar on the lightning labs team has in his personal capacity built an app called what's at that is a wave to send and receive on the command line and then people have been building you eyes the company stack has built Sphinx which is a lightning chat app so people are sending tiny fractions of a penny in order to send a receive messages so the idea that lightning in and of itself can be a broader the lair is emerging where there are variety of different applications where you can send small value payments along with them so that's been something interesting to see evolve as well Oh interesting I haven't heard of that yeah that's that's what I like to you know keep my eye on that's all it's sort of the fun little things going on all right well congratulations again on your raise and thank you for coming on unconfirmed thanks for having me don't

last two years there's a nice profile in Forbes by my former colleague Jeff Coughlin of multi coin capitals Kyle samani and Tushar Jain both of whom have been on my podcasts Kyle kicks things off with this first quote two years from now Z cash is worth zero and later Union Square Ventures fred wilson chimes in that kyle quote can be a little controversial and aggressive it talks about how they bet 15% of their portfolio on B&B token and saw an Eightfold return but that one of their investments äôs was a bust the only line equivalents profile is where Jeff says quote Jane and some money are also pound the table Bitcoin bulls the last few times I talked to Kyle perhaps every time I've talked to Kyle he was not what I would describe as a Bitcoin bull but perhaps since I last spoke to him others on his team have pulled him to their side either way this is a great profile on two of the more unabashed and outspoken investors in this face and last comment you have to check out the article if only because Kyle and Josh are are wearing matching Navy Blazers with crisp white button-down and they definitely get a 10 on style for the photoshoot last fun bits so this this second fun bits is a hilarious meme that I saw in crypto Twitter and it's about the upcoming Bitcoin having or happening as some of you call it which by the way is that because you don't know have that happening is not a word or because that you're trying to be funny like flipping I don't know anyway I'm gonna be a horrible tease and say that because this is one of those memes where you just have to see it you're gonna have to just click through like a look in the show notes and then click through and just look at it because I tried writing this up for audio and describing it all for you but it just doesn't work it like loses all the funniness so let me just say that I'm sure for those of you who do click through that at least the compulsive bitcoin watcher price watchers will get a chuckle out of this
