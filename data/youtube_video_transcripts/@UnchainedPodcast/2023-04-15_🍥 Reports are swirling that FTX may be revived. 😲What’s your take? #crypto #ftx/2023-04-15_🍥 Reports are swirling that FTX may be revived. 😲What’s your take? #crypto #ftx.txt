what are you guys thoughts about FTX coming back so I I think the plan's a terrible plan frankly and I'm not a creditor but I'm going to speak with like a creditor hat on you know if I were a creditor I would not want them spending any money and or time trying to actually reboot the exchange that could go towards returning money to their creditors and the reason being is that the exchange most likely will not be an independently profitable exchange and there's only two possible outcomes it's profitable and it generates assets for the creditors or it's unprofitable and it just further erodes the assets of the creditors and for so many different reasons I don't think that FTX has any innate advantage in its reboot over all of the other exchanges in the world and will be a profitable exchange and so
