I don't think it's the role of government to protect people from themselves to ban uh Investments That might be sensible Investments even if the government or a particular official doesn't like them I think we do too much of that already for instance the way we limit all kinds of investment opportunities and things like private equity and hedge funds and Venture Capital only to wealthy individuals because the assumption is if you're not wealthy you're not sophisticated you don't understand this and so you're going to be forbidden that's terrible idea in my view and and I don't want to impose that in the crypto space
