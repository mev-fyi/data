spencer noon no offenses i've never met him in person but you know he's a variant fund and he and tweeted something like oh uh you know when artists songs are streamed they shouldn't make any money because the song is effectively an advertisement for their work and i was like you know i was like do you do you know any musicians because like musicians they are much more likely to say like i should earn so much more for my streams um they're uh more likely to complain about the fact that like they kind of have to tour to make enough money you know it's like the actual work they do doesn't make enough so they have to do this additional thing on top to actually make the money and so he you know i just was like and i was surprised because you know jesse walden is part of varian fund and i was a little bit like i feel like jesse definitely knows musicians so you guys should have talked to some to like understand what their world is like from a business perspective and then i was surprised like kyle simani backed spencer and noon up and i was like i just tweeted back at them i was like you guys must not know any
