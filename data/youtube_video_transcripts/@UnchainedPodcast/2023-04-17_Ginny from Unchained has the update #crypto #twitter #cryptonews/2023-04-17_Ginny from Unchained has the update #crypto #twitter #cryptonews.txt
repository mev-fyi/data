Twitter is partnering with etoro to bring crypto trading to the app this is shocking I had no idea that Twitter did not already allow crypto trading why is there so much spam etoro is a social trading platform for Mom and Pop Traders so if I had to guess I'd say the crypto Traders on the app are mostly on the pop side Twitter has also launched a hashtag feature where if you type a dollar sign before a stock symbol you'll get the stock price although I just tried this with Twitter's own stock and got an error which is probably a bug apparently the hashtag symbol has been used 420 million times which seems kind of suspicious 420 really why is Elon Musk a parody of himself Bitcoin is one of the most searched terms but I imagine we won't get the exact number until it hits 69 million this follows the news of PBS and NPR quitting Twitter over being labeled government-funded media which does seem harsh I once interned at NPR and I can assure you they're funded by basically no one must be somewhat relaxing to be in Elon shoes right now though like you can't make Twitter worse
