crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto earn up to 8.5 per year on your bitcoin download the crypto.com app now today's guest is jesse liu a partner at skadden and the former u.s attorney for the district of columbia welcome jesse thank you so much laura it's such a pleasure to be here as the u.s attorney general in dc you created a threat finance unit focused on financial cyber crimes that threaten national security there you headed up the team that prosecute what some believe is the most is the greatest number of cryptocurrency crimes worldwide welcome to video dark scandals helix uh some involving north korea's lazarus group hamas al qaeda and isis how did you come to establish the threat finance unit and prosecute all these crimes involving cryptocurrency well i think it was a terrific confluence of events and i was very lucky to have some incredibly talented colleagues at the u.s attorney's office before i was the u.s attorney for the district of columbia i was a deputy general counsel at the department of the treasury and there my portfolio focused on law enforcement national security and international issues so i did a lot of work with ofac and fincen and when i went over to the us attorney's office i was already thinking about ways that the u.s attorney's office could work with the treasury department in particular as well as with other government agencies to pursue financial crimes and there was already a group of ausas at the u.s attorney's office who were doing that and so we worked together both within the office to increase the number of cases that were bringing in this very important and cutting edge area and also working with the department of the treasury and with other parts of the u.s government to bring more cases and this of course as you know incredibly interesting cutting edge area so it was very exciting for us last week attorney general william barr announced the publication by the department of justice of a cryptocurrency enforcement framework what is in the framework and how will it be used does it change anything about the way law enforcement has been going after crimes involving cryptocurrency well um i don't know that it changes anything but it is very significant in another way in a number of ways so first of all the cryptocurrency enforcement framework is um a 70 plus page document issued by doj specifically by the attorney general's cyber digital task force a week ago today on october 8th and it is a self-described comprehensive overview of the emerging threats and enforcement challenges associated with the increasing prevalence and use of cryptocurrency it details the important relationships that the department of justice has built with regulatory and enforcement partners both within the u.s government and around the world and then outlines the department's response strategies um and for uh my purposes um i personally find the last part uh where the framework talks about how the department has responded uh to cryptocurrency the most interesting and so in general what are the main takeaways in terms of the significance of the attorney general publishing this document well first of all i think just the fact that the attorney general and department of justice has published this document is itself significant um it shows that crypto is something that doj is focusing on and also perhaps even more important that doj wants the world to know that crypto is something that it's focused on i pull a couple of key takeaways from the framework um first of all uh doj seems to be still somewhat skeptical of crypto um so in the first part of the framework uh there's a section on legitimate uses of crypto which runs about a few paragraphs and then there's a section uh that is titled illegitimate uses which runs to more than 11 pages and if you look closely at the legitimate uses section um it's careful not to come out and actually say that there are any legitimate uses at all it uses language like and here i'm quoting laura cryptocurrency advocates maintain that a decentralized distributed and secure cryptocurrency holds great promise for legitimate use proponents of cryptocurrency contend that by eliminating the need for financial intermediaries to validate and facilitate transactions cryptocurrency has the potential to minimize transaction costs and to reduce corruption and fraud some advocates also claim that cryptocurrency may in the future facilitate micro payments others believe that the privacy associated with cryptocurrency through raising significant challenges for law enforcement though raising significant challenges for law enforcement can have valid and beneficial uses so reading between the lines i think uh you can detect a certain amount of skepticism about crypto uh even uh though it's not uh nearly as new as it was at one time so when it comes to the doj what are the main crimes that they're looking at when it comes to cryptocurrency well the first part of the report or the framework actually lays out um three categories of crime so one is the use of crypto as payment or facilitation for illicit activities so for example um taking crypto as payment for illegal drugs or illegal weapons or child pornography or using crypto um to engage in terrorist financing that's category one according to the framework the second category according to the framework is using crypto to engage in money laundering or hide assets from tax authorities um and the third is crimes against the crypto marketplace itself like hacking exchanges um and there's a section of the framework that goes through all of the laws that doj can use to counter this kind of activity and they're more or less what you would expect the fraud statutes the money laundering statutes um the terrorist financing statutes and the like and what aspects of the framework do you think crypto entrepreneurs and startups and projects should be aware of or you know what aspects do you think that they're not focusing enough on well so again as i said before to me the most interesting part of the framework is part three which is titled ongoing challenges and future strategies and i think this is where you can glean the answer to the question where is doj going with all of this and what i found interesting is that in this part of the framework doj identifies what it calls business models and activities that may facilitate criminal activity and then it has a list of those um it includes cryptocurrency exchanges p2p exchangers crypto atms uh virtual currency casinos anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies which i think is worth talking about in a little bit more detail and of course mixers tumblers uh and chain hopping um there are some definite clues in this document to where doj may focus its attention next um and i think one area for the crypto industry um and those who are interested in the space to focus is thinking about the business models that doj has essentially identified as those that it is particularly skeptical of so i think that's going to be really an area to watch one of the big recent cryptocurrency cases that involved doj was the indictment of four executives at cryptocurrency derivatives exchange bipmax and that indictment became public on the same day that the cftc announced its own charges against bitmex for allegedly illegally operating uh a crypto derivatives exchange and also anti-money laundering violations and then that shortly thereafter the framework came out so are these actions an indication that the crypto industry should expect that there are more enforcement actions in which doj acts in concert with other agencies to bring criminal charges yes i think definitely the answer is yes and there are further clues or perhaps even more than clues almost explicit statements to that effect in the framework so the framework talks about it has a specific section that talks about doj's partners and it starts by talking about um the other us government agencies that doj is working with on these issues and they're more or less the ones that you would expect um fencing ofac the sec the cftc the occ um and there's also a lot of discussion about partnering with international organizations like the fatif okay yeah i think we're gonna have to dive a little bit more into what that means and why that's happening but first let's take a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets

jesse liu so speaking about the partnerships that the doj is pursuing in order to prosecute some of these cases i noticed in the framework that it says quote the department also has robust authority to prosecute virtual asset service providers and other entities and individuals that violate u.s law even when they are not located in the united states so how can it claim this authority to go after entities not in its jurisdiction and you know not not only count the can they claim the authority but how can they also go after them just from a practical perspective sure well first of all um i think it sometimes surprises people but doj is extremely aggressive about asserting its jurisdiction even with respect to conduct that occurs abroad and so outside the crypto context there are any number of cases where doj has asserted jurisdiction because there was one email that went through a u.s server because there was one wire that went through a u.s bank that there were transactions that were conducted in u.s dollars so um the long arm of u.s law is just that um and doj is really uh quite assertive about exercising jurisdiction and there's a lot of statements in the framework about that which i think makes it very clear that doj is prepared to exercise really near global jurisdiction um in the crypto space for example um with respect to crypto exchanges uh the framework says all entities including foreign located exchanges that do business wholly are in a substantial part within the united states such as by servicing us customers such as by servicing u.s customers so this could be a situation where um the uh people who the the exchange is located overseas uh the servers are located overseas the people who run it are located overseas but um it's it serves u.s customers and according to doj those exchanges have to register with vinson um and have an asian to the united states for bank secrecy act reporting filing sars and the like and for accepting service and process and i actually think bit max is a pretty good example uh of this because um you know there was the it was a little i think unclear as to exactly where bit mix uh had a physical presence um to the extent that it had a physical presence um it was registered in the seychelles with offices in places like hong kong and new york city there are people who ran it who were in the u.s i believe that it was said it could not be used by u.s persons but the government apparently didn't think that that was enough that it really wanted uh wants these exchanges to take active steps to ensure that u.s persons don't actually use them well yeah it's interesting um how they they claim jurisdiction but um you know apparently it it is possible and they've done it in the past one other thing that a lot of people in crypto have been chatting about recently is the global standards regarding anti-money laundering and um counter-terrorist financing by the fataf uh and the financial action task force and different countries are implementing those global standards differently there was a recent episode i did about these fad f rules and in switzerland they're apparently making people identify their self hosted wallets and i wondered how you thought the fat off regulations would affect enforcement here in the us well the the u.s is is a leader within vat of and is a big booster within badaf and i think um one uh trend that we're seeing i think is going to be within the us that um the regulators and the enforcers are going to be demanding uh more from a crypto industry with respect to aml um bsa cft standards um but of course there are differences across countries um i think the us has been pushing quite hard for everyone to apply the same kind of aml bsa cft standards that the u.s does here um so it'll be interesting to see how that plays out one of the points that the framework makes um is you know it sounds a little bit of a note of frustration about how the standards are different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and how that can sometimes enable uh illicit activity um yeah one other thing that i wanted to ask is about what you mentioned earlier this interest in privacy perverse preserving technologies in the crypto space clearly the doj took a side eye i would say to such technology so i wondered what your what your take was on what their approach would be when it comes to privacy and crypto well i think that um the framework is a signal that the doj is deeply skeptical of privacy slash anonymity in crypto the framework actually calls out um uh by name monero dash and z cash and it goes on to say it is a very blunt statement the department considers the use of anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies to be a high risk activity that is indicative of possible criminal conduct which to me is a pretty blunt statement and then there's a bit of a warning to the industry they say companies that choose to offer aec products should consider the increased risk of money laundering and financing of criminal activity and should evaluate whether it's possible to adopt appropriate aml cft measures to address those risks so taking those two statements together um i think that's a clear signal that doj is going to be watching anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies pretty closely um and that doj has some doubt about whether it's possible for that business model uh to comply with um aml uh cft you know bsa requirements um and so that's an area where i think um all the signs at least from the framework are indicative that there will be um you know some some real scrutiny in that area um the other area that i noticed where the framework um takes a little bit of a dim view about privacy is that there is the framework devotes a whole page to the eu's general data protection regulation the gdpr uh which is a privacy law that's been used by uh some crypto exchanges to try to withhold data that u.s criminal investigators try to get through grand jury subpoenas and the framework makes very clear that doj disagrees with the basis for those objections and that it will continue to engage with those exchanges to ensure compliance with lawful requests and even quote will pursue motions to compel as needed so that's a pretty clear indication i think that to the extent that exchanges are citing the eu privacy law as a reason not to provide information to doj that they may be facing a court fight interesting yeah well one other thing that i was thinking about when it comes to this is the fact that i think the big financial institutions are really interested in privacy um because they'll want that for their transactions and so i just wondered when you have um you know such a such a big and important industry that has an interest in that how that will play out against what apparently is doj's desire to not have um you know privacy enhanced coins used very much and kind of in that mix one other thing i noted about the framework is that even as the report expressed concern about these privacy enhanced coins it also admitted that many of them uh have viewing keys that any that are you know make it possible for um for exchanges or other businesses using privacy enhanced coins to um comply with anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations so i wondered if you thought that might would play a role and in general how it will play out with you know like i said traditional financial institutions just interested in privacy yeah i mean i think there's going to be a constant push-pull you know in this area um because doj um and this plays out in lots of other areas too um it certainly played out for example uh with respect to the doj being able to get uh access to the contents of cell phones that were password protected you know completely outside the crypto space but it is a constant um kind of tension between the doj attempting to get information pursuant uh to legal process and um the interests of uh from the privacy interests that are involved so um and i know that there's been quite a bit of commentary i think in in response um to um the framework um but is part of a conversation that's been going on for a long time about well you know here is this um model of a decentralized ledger um that has uh privacy benefits it has anonymity benefits and you know what is the government doing and what uh to what extent um do all of those uh privacy ideals you know survive in the face of you know increased government's group name so one last piece i wanted to ask about is you know cryptocurrency obviously is global in nature and the framework even calls out how this global nature quote poses significant investigative challenges for u.s law enforcement agencies and for department prosecutors and i just wondered from your experience our foreign countries generally willing to assist the us in cases involving cryptocurrency or do you think that we'll find that a lot of these people who engage in crimes involving cryptocurrency will be able to play regulatory arbitrage well i think it depends on the jurisdiction quite honestly so in our experience my office did the welcome to video case which is one of the cases that's highlighted in the framework it was um a child pornography case and we had just fantastic fantastic uh international cooperation from jurisdictions all around the world i think that there are other jurisdictions that perhaps are less cooperative with u.s investigators and so it kind of it really depends and i think that one of the things that doj is really trying to do is um spread the implementation of the fat f recommendation around the world in an effort to try to get more cooperation in this area and the framework explicitly recognizes that because crypto is global and it's cross-border that there's only so much that one country can do and that in order to address the risks that doj sees there needs to be international cooperation all right well this has been such a great and interesting conversation thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you so much laura was a great pleasure don't forget
