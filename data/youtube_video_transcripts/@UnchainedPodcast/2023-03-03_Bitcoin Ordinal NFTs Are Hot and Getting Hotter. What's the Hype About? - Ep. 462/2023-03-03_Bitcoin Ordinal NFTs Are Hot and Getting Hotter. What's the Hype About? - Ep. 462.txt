data from public view yes that includes Dex trading visit railgun.org or use the railway app at railway.xyz today's guest is manipali co-creator of stacks welcome beneath great to be here nice to have you back so the last couple months nfts and Bitcoin AKA Bitcoin ordinals have really taken off and they're consuming large amounts of block space um for instance up to 70 at times there's been more than a quarter million created and they've been the source of 1.4 million dollars in fees on the Bitcoin blockchain they've even stirred some controversy but first before we dive into all that let's make sure everybody listening just is on the same page what are ordinals and how do they work yeah so I think um nfds on on bitcoin are not something new um actually NFD started on the Bitcoin and blockchain with the counterparty back in 2015 era or so the the more popular uh series that came out at that time was the rare Pepes I think people might be more familiar with the rare Pepes than counterparty the protocol through which it was they were minted and so I think in many ways um what we have seen is that since the launch of ethereum like really when the team started taking off in 2017 and then other chains that came around a lot of the activity around D5 or nfds sort of like shifted to ethereum and and other chains and I think Bitcoin because it's sort of like very simple at the base layer uh and it's optimized for just being money we haven't seen a lot of these use cases on the Bitcoin blockchain that doesn't mean they're not possible Right like they're entirely possible and ordinals are sort of like revived the interest in in Bitcoin entity so I sort of look at them as uh in a way kind of like counter party 2.0 right like there has been a big gap in the middle uh and uh ordinal Theory itself is very very fascinating uh what it sort of says is that usually we think of Bitcoin and also the smallest unit of Bitcoin called the Satoshi as fungible right so you it doesn't matter like which Bitcoin you have or which so those you you have so the ordinal Theory gives a new lens to how you look at the blockchain data and you can actually sort these satoshi's in a sequence and the idea is that some of them might be more rare than others like for example uh what if a Satoshi that came out right after a hovering block right halving happens only every four years so it might have a special meaning to somebody and it is different from other support you so once you can start sequencing or uh are sort of like separating satoshi's from each other that's one part of the ordinal Theory and the second part is that you can use them so now you know you you are saying like hey this is Satoshi is unique I can use that to inscribe something on the blockchain and the inscribing is basically putting some data on the chain and you own that data through the ownership of Officer Toshi and that's how people basically the the first obvious thing people try describing are the the usual nfts the monkey pictures the other funds of that that you all love out there and seeing that on the Bitcoin blockchain is sort of like uh has revived the the interest in building on Bitcoin in a major way yeah um one thing that fascinated me was that in order to create these um essentially the protocol puts a serial number on every Satoshi which um it's just a kind of a remarkable and and a really fascinating idea um so can you just talk a little bit about that and how that works because um obviously I think people have a certain conception of how nft should work from ethereum but on bitcoin it's very different yes so I think digging a little bit deeper into how the Bitcoin blockchain Works versus versus ethereum they're very different models Bitcoin uses this utxo model where uh effectively how you prove to somebody that you have Bitcoin is that there's a sequence of transactions where you receive these unspent outputs and so there's a log of like exactly what uh utxo was going from one address to the other right in in ethereum it's an account based model right so your account basically gets credited so there's no tracking of actual uh Unique Eat happening uh in as a as a log in the in the in the chain right so this is these are different models and people would argue that in many ways the account model is more efficient like it's easier to program but uh with smart contracts and so on but the utxo model has like this unique feature that you can actually track like even individual satoshi's all the way back to their Genesis and think I really like the analogy you use that it's like putting a sequence number if you look at even back notes they do have a sequence number on it even though people think of of you know dollars as fungible I don't I don't care about a particular five dollar bill but there might be certain bills that have uh some meaning to you maybe the the first ever thirty dollar bill you got at your internship and you still have it saved or framed in in your house I think a similar thing is happening with uh with with ordinal theory that it's giving these sequence numbers the serial numbers to to satoshi's and and you can come up with your own serial numbers if you want right like this ordinal theory is like one view or one lens on it but because I think it's like uh it's like social consensus enough people start following this particular version of looking at the serial numbers then that becomes the dominant format and right now like give just given the interest level and amount of like Builders kind of like coming in and building all sorts of services and wallet support for ordinals it seems like you know this is the one that that might actually take off yeah and uh just for listeners who don't know utxo it's unspent transaction output and one other thing that I found fascinating is that these nfts in a way sort of like work the way that a lot of people who don't know the technicals of nfts think they should work meaning that the actual um quote-unquote underlying image or um you know whatever the the nft is based on is actually placed on the Bitcoin blockchain where it's uh in ethereum there's like an external pointer to the location elsewhere and that can cause a whole host of issues so how is it that the Bitcoin blockchain is able to host all this data yes and I think that's a that's actually a big difference and a huge selling point for a lot of artists right like like imagine that your your people and you're creating something really unique and on bitcoin you could literally store the image on the Bitcoin blockchain and now it's it's almost like indestructible right like you you know that as long as Bitcoin is around this thing is is going to be around and I think that's very powerful like that thing instantly clicks with a lot of people that bitcoin's block space is precious it's very durable as soon as you put something out there it's probably the most indestructible media on the planet in a way right and and I think that that is attracting a lot of people to this and I this this is this is a big difference in terms of like technically how this works so Bitcoin has basically had two you know upgrades in the last five plus years Bitcoin usually have like a very careful slow approach to doing any upgrades the first one was segwit and the most recent one is Taproot and they're both sort of sort of like aimed at making more efficient use of the Bitcoin block space right so it's think of them as like they compress the transaction data a lot and they make more efficient use of of the blockchain tap would have some other aspects as well like it makes certain you can write a little bit more advanced scripts it's nowhere closed captioning not available I love it um one thing also though that anybody who's interested in buying these should know is that because of what you mentioned about how um you know Bitcoin has this different model it's not this account model you have to be very careful about how you store your Bitcoin ordinals because explain what could happen if you're not yes so uh the way to think about this is Satoshi is the smallest unit of a Bitcoin but it's actually very very small right like there are 100 million satoshi's in a Bitcoin and usually uh what wallets do is that when you're forming a transaction they would just combine satoshi's from various uh utxos and some of them might be used to pay minor fees some of them might go to a change address or so on like wallets don't really care which sort of social you're using but now let's say you have a valuable NFD that is owned by a single Satoshi you want to be careful that that one is not the the one that the wallet just sends as mining fee for a transaction right so these wallets were not really designed with this use case in mind but there are already new wallets so two examples one is exports and the other is the hero wallet their their web wallets experts has a mobile app as well and they are actually explicitly designed for art nodes and they make sure more that you are not going to spend that precious Satoshi that had the nft on it and they they treat it uh like like you would expect it to be treated great so in a moment we're going to talk about some of the reaction to all this activity on bitcoin but first a quick word from the sponsors to make this show possible ever wanted to use D5 without being tracked railgun is the leading D5 privacy Solution on ethereum it's available on BSC arbitrim and polygon 2. Shield your funds and use them privately in your favorite D5 apps while railgun's cutting edge zero knowledge system encrypts your data from public view all without leaving your preferred chain yes that includes Dex trading coming soon are Integrations with leading yields lending and perp trading platforms on multiple chains defy and privacy together at last visit railgun.org or use the railway app at railway.xyz to find out more back to my conversation with miniv so interestingly at first when all this activity around ordinals started happening some Bitcoin maximalists were criticizing it saying that you know miners should censor the crap referring to ordinals um some people even called ordinals an attack on bitcoin why do you think that some parts of the Bitcoin Community saw ordinals that way yeah so that is not surprising to me at all right like if basically the way I I look at the Bitcoin culture is that when I started in 2013 till around 2016 or so I think the culture was actually much more open they were more intellectually curious people around there were more Builders around there were experiments happening I was building protocols directly on bitcoin L1 back in the day and that's where counterparty started you know nft started on bitcoin even early icos happened using colored coins this is all like pre-etherium stuff and and I think 2017 is a very remarkable year in the history of our industry a couple of things happened one was the Civil War internally with Bitcoin the block size Wars and over there the argument was that hey block size is very very precious only use it for money keep the block size small because it's good for decentralization which I actually agree with right like you should keep keep the block size small and a lot of the builders sort of like went to ethereum not only because it was easier to program there it had a full execution environment a full programming language but also the culture like it Embraces experimentation it sort of like encourages it and so on so for the last four or five years the shift in Bitcoin Community has been that a lot of actually non-technical people very few of them are technical they're mostly like you know Twitter influencers or podcasters who don't really understand technology that well don't really even use Bitcoin their voices became more magnified in the Bitcoin community and they're usually sort of like naysayers right like they're they're saying all of these use cases uh don't make any sense money is only a use case so by default I think their reaction to anything new is sort of like rejected and and I think Bitcoin has still there is a smaller camp but it's growing a lot and that's the camp of Bitcoin Builders uh and they're very different they actually use Bitcoin and they're treated as an open source project and a technology not a religion right and they and those folks are always kind of like you know much more Forward Thinking excited about any experimentation and use and and so on so I think one really interesting thing that's happening is that the the sort of like the Maximus religious Camp obviously came out and was was opposed to this use but if you look at the arguments that sort of like don't make sense because over here ordinals are resulting in higher fee markets which is good for Bitcoin mining it's actually really good for long-term security of Bitcoin one of the biggest criticisms is you know in the next 10 to 15 years when the coinbase rewards the newly minted Bitcoin it goes down a lot what's going to happen to the Bitcoin security and this is the first real data point where we have seen a sustainable sort of a use case that is actually giving more Revenue to minors and if this takes off or they're better trading markets that start taking off other use cases that start taking off then you have a more clear shot at sustaining the type of fee Market that let's say ethereum has which can be enough to sustain the security budget of Bitcoin in some ways like our nodes are not just interesting from a technology perspective but even from Bitcoin culture perspective the spotlight has actually shifted to the builders Community like their their Twitter spaces are getting a larger audience right like they they're having more of a say in the Bitcoin community and I think I think that's a very very healthy healthy change generally in Bitcoin yeah and I would say that this is also almost like the next development after over the last maybe like eight or nine months there's started to be a lot of pushback against the Maxis and I've covered this on the show I think twice um once with Eric wall and Udi wartheimer once with Udi and Lynn Alton and then also um there was a a discussion about Bitcoin security between Eric wall and Justin uh bonds so people should check those out because it's definitely been a developing story for quite a while and I feel like for a while the Maxis were very dominant and people were unwilling to speak out against them and then after a while suddenly growing numbers of people were willing to speak out against them and now suddenly um again we're seeing like you said more creativity and sort of more yeah kind of tech oriented people coming back to bitcoin yeah I think there are two two quick things about that right so one I completely agree that I think there's uh more people are speaking out and they're strength in numbers right so as soon as there is uh an alternate community that has a voice and that has more influence more people feel comfortable so the silent sort of like majority that was sort of like letting these people do their thing uh now now they have now they have a place uh that they can sort of like belong to and be like yeah no I'm actually agree with your views versus so I think that that alternate camp that I'm calling Bitcoin Builders or Bitcoin rationales whatever name you want to give them it's it's actually actually growing and I think the second really important point is that uh Bitcoin is very hard to change and whenever somebody comes like for example one of the Bitcoin code of Jeremy Rubin who was working on some new features for uh for for Bitcoin L1 and over there if there's strong opposition it's actually a problem because then it looks like there's in there isn't enough support for this proposal to go through right ordinals are different they're using something that's already live right so even if people are making noise it makes actually no difference because this this thing is already live on the Chain right it's already part of consensus and there's no way they can revert that change so I think the Dynamics were actually very different this time around if if this was just a proposal and a lot of Maxis were making noise and trying to push back I do think that they would have had some influence on it but this was just a completely different thing where Taproot was already live and they just couldn't do it anyway yeah and I should add actually that the Creator is somebody named Casey rodimore and he even tweeted make Bitcoin fun again in all camps so um you know it just goes to show like we were saying it's kind of drawing more of the tech type people the price of stacks has jumped in the last couple weeks and obviously that's your project and it appears to be due to this interest in ordinals so can you explain how it is that Stacks could be affected by ordinals yeah so I think a quick quick kind of like clarification their Stacks is a very decentralized ecosystem uh so it's a Bitcoin layer uh started in 2017 I'm I'm a co-creator of it uh the the main Advent live in early 2021 but we've been extremely careful about both from you know how the token offering was conducted it was the first ever SEC qualified offering and then the flip side of that is that we have been extremely careful about decentralization so it's a little bit like the original company that was doing the r d was dismantled and people went off and did kind of like their own thing so this this thing has a has a life of its own like I I usually don't pay that much attention to the markets but I have a theory about you know why the project might be getting more attention and I think it's basically if you look at a Bitcoin layer that is bringing more you know smart contracts full execution environments it was attracting a bunch of like intellectually curious people who wanted to build around Bitcoin and experimental things but the Bitcoin L1 chain actually doesn't have it doesn't have that much usage at all right uh blocks were empty so the the it was a little bit like this was a nice to have like hey here's a Bitcoin there some people think of it as an L2 although they're technical you know definitions that I don't want to get into right now so it was it was a little bit like okay it's nice to have like you know if I want to experiment with Bitcoin I can play with a Bitcoin Bitcoin player but suddenly if the Bitcoin block space is getting full and a transaction fees are going up and there's no path to scalability suddenly the l2s or side chains become much more relevant they certainly become more like a medicine to a pain point that people have versus just a nice to have thing that developers are sort of like playing around and that's that's sort of like my view my theory on why people would be more interested uh in it right now and then if even if you look at ethereum the L2 Market is pretty mature there right like 40 50 billion dollar depending on how you measure it 25 billion might be public already the rest might be private and on the Bitcoin side it's basically nothing much right like Stacks is one of the very few projects that is uh building a Bitcoin layer and I think people can sort of see that if ethereum is going to scale in layers like we all know it's going to be Roll-Ups or fraud proofs like most of the user activity is actually going to happen in l2s so the same can be applied to bitcoin as well that Bitcoin has 500 billion dollars in capital mostly just sitting there so it's a little bit of a more of a blue ocean in my view where there aren't a lot of layers there's a lot of capital that's just sitting passively I think ordinals uh the the one thing that ordinals have done is that they've given people a real data point that look there can be user interest in developer interests and investor interest directly in building out Bitcoin and I think that data point was very very important for people to feel confident that okay I want to spend my time and effort uh building in the Bitcoin ecosystem and one other sign that people are definitely going to be very interested in all of this is that eucalabs is now going to be launching a new nft collection on ordinals called 12-fold any reaction to kind of the biggest nft company uh choosing to experiment with ordinals no it's great and I I don't think they'll be the only ones right I think uh D Gods from uh one of the top projects from Solana and they already already came to ordinals yoga Labs made the announcement I think they're maybe uh went live already and and I think others are coming right like it's to me it's a no-brainer because uh just given the limited uh space on bitcoin and the property that whatever you publish there is indestructible there's literally the nfts on chain and other other chains don't have that other chains also don't carry that premium that the Bitcoin blockchain does like everybody knows that you know Bitcoin has the highest chance of survival like they will be here 20 years from now or 30 years so now so if you're putting your nft right there you think it's precious uh that makes a lot of sense and so my my theory is that we might see a world where a lot of the high value or quote-unquote luxury nfts might actually end up on bitcoin and then the long tail uh might be another chains might be on bitcoin layers right so these layers can work very seamlessly with Bitcoin you can even do trading between these two and we're seeing some of that already right so there's a Marketplace called gamma it was operating on the stacks layer and they very quickly integrated or not but for a user it's a very seamless switch that okay right now I'm looking at a Bitcoin L1 nft now I'm looking at a Bitcoin there nft and I understand that you know maybe at the layer the gas fees are lower there can be larger mints like ten thousand twenty thousand mints but on the L1 uh it's more limited maybe things are more pricey because just because the The Limited uh block space on bitcoin yeah I agree for kind of the cool factor I think the the nfcs on bitcoin will be very valuable all right well this has been such a fascinating discussion there's probably like so much more we could have gone into but um we'll have to save that for another time manip thank you so much it was great to have you back

in to this week's news recap silvergate misses 10K 2022 report on Wednesday cryptocurrency friendly Bank silvergate announced it would delay the filing of its annual report it said that it is reviewing its Financial controls and viability following the collapse of FTX silvergate confirmed that it sold additional debt Securities in January and February and that losses related to its Securities portfolio among other factors could impair its ability to operate as a going concern the fact that silvergate has been so intertwined with crypto companies has raised concerns among the crypto Community Adam Cochran partner at cinepain ventures tweeted silvergates death spiral is going to be rough for crypto the bank's shares fell by over 50 percent following the news reaching all-time lows of 6.91 in addition JP Morgan downgraded silvergate's rating from neutral to underweight and removed its 14 per share Target only hours after the company disclosed they were not filing its 10K form coinbase announced that it had stopped using silvergate to handle dollar payments for its prime customers setting in quote abundance of caution Instead The Exchange has shifted to Signature Bank coinbase said that it has had only minimal exposure to silvergate while the exchange did not disclose the reason behind the switch it may have been driven by a desire to avoid any potential Fallout if silvergate goes under following coinbase's move many other companies including Circle paxos crypto.com which disclosure is a sponsor of Unchained bitstamp sibo digital markets and Gemini also decided to stop doing business with silvergate ftx's former director of engineering faces fraud charges former FTX director of engineering nishad Singh was charged with fraud by both the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission and the commodity Futures Trading commission after entering a guilty plea in federal court the charges allege that Singh conspired to defraud ftx's investors and users the cftc claimed that Singh created features in ftx's code that allowed Alameda research to gain an unfair advantage on the exchange including an unlimited line of credit and exemption from the exchange's Auto Liquidation function Singh also allegedly moved alameda's 8 billion dollars in liabilities to a fake customer account on ftx's systems effectively hiding alameda's negative balance the sec's complaint adds that Singh falsely characterized 50 million dollars transferred from another entity as Revenue sing allegedly withdrew hundreds of millions of dollars for personal use from FTX despite knowing about the co-mingled funds between Alameda and FTX in light of his charges Singh has decided to collaborate with prosecutors investigating former CEO Sam bankman freed in related news svf's lawyers asked for more time to negotiate his bail terms and find a technical expert to educate the court on his use of a VPN coinbase to suspend trading of busd coinbase has decided to Halt trading of binance USD or busd due to the stablecoin not meeting the exchanges listing standards the suspension is set to take effect from March 13th while users will still be able to withdraw the USD trading will be suspended across all coinbase platforms including coinbase Prime and coinbase Pro the move comes after the New York State Department of Financial Services ordered paxos to stop minting busd and the SEC launched an investigation into paxos over the stablecoin offering it also comes months after binance decided to delist usdc a stablecoin operated by coinbase in a Consortium with circle while other exchanges like Kraken are being scrutinized Brian Armstrong CEO of coinbase stated that the interests of his exchange align with those of the SEC and that the company has maintained a positive relationship with the agency including meetings with its chair Gary Gensler that's quite a turnaround from September 2021 when Armstrong called the agency's actions quote really sketchy this week coinbase also revealed poll results showing that 20 of Americans own crypto and that 80 of Americans quote think the Global Financial system unfairly favors powerful interests Finance denies allegations from Forbes Forbes reported that binance moved 1.8 billion dollars in collateral backing its customers stable coins to other undisclosed uses without informing them a significant majority of these customer funds 1.1 billion dollars was reportedly transferred to Cumberland the crypto trading arm of Don Wilson's drw other recipients allegedly included Alameda research Amber group and Tron founder Justin Sun according to blockchain data the disbursement consisted entirely of usdc binance deny the report arguing that the transfers were related to internal wallet management and not a misuse of customer collateral Finance Chief strategy officer Patrick Hillman told Forbes that there was no co-mingling of user assets The Wall Street Journal reports that three U.S senators Elizabeth Warren Chris Van Hollen and Roger Marshall sent a bipartisan letter to binance CEO Ching Pang Xiao asking for details on the crypto exchanges money laundering controls the Senators accused Finance of being quote a hotbed of illegal Financial activity and requested information on the company's balance sheets internal procedures and any communication about alleged efforts by Zhao to limit compliance the letter also claimed that Bonanza and its Affiliates have quote purposefully evaded Regulators moved assets to criminals and sanctions evaders and hidden basic financial information from its customers and the public SEC issues subpoenas for Robin Hood in its latest SEC filing popular trading platform Robin Hood revealed that it was subpoenaed by the agency regarding its supported cryptocurrencies custody of crypto assets and platform operations Robin Hood is worried that if the regulator fails to properly classify cryptocurrencies it could be subject to fines and other enforcement actions the subpoenas come as U.S Regulators continue to scrutinize the crypto industry particularly with work guard to its compliance with Securities laws the SEC which in recent weeks has been quite active is reportedly increasing its focus on cracking down on crypto firms by expanding its digital assets enforcement team dcg loses more than one billion dollars digital currency group incurred a loss of 1.1 billion dollars in the past year as a result of declining crypto values and the reorganization of its lending platform Genesis in Q4 of 2022 dcg generated 143 million

downgraded to a previous version of the network and coordinated a synchronized chain restart but the first attempt was abandoned after the second attempted restart Solana was back online around 8 30 PM eastern time on Saturday sauna has experienced a series of outages in the past while critics argue that the platform's frequent disruptions reflect a lack of stability and robustness Advocates defend the blockchain's fast-moving development strategy Voyager and binance us get one step closer to a deal according to bankruptcy Administration company strato 97 of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager digital's account holder claims customers approved its proposed restructuring plan for binance us to acquire the firm's assets for 1.02 billion dollars the deal between the companies has been previously questioned by the SEC and the cfdc with the SEC wanting to stop it because the Voyager token may be an unregistered security to which U.S bankruptcy court judge Michael Wiles said it was quote kind of a weird objection he said the SEC was asking Voyager to prove a negative with little guidance from the regulator on how to do so quote I get the feeling that the subjection has been made as a kind of cover so you can say later that we'll see we raised these issues he said Voyager has also agreed to set aside 445 million dollars after being sued by Alameda research for loan repayment with both parties agreeing to participate in non-binding mediation to resolve remaining disputes furthermore crypto analytics firm Arkham intelligence noted that Voyager transferred 154.4 million dollars worth of usdc from coinbase to its Voyager 1 ethereum wallet and that it appears to have been selling off assets at a rate of 100 million dollars per week blockchain wallet tracker look on chain also revealed that Voyager has transferred assets to coinbase almost daily since February 14th with nearly 100 million dollars worth of usdc received by Voyager from coinbase between February

recovery of crypto in the event of lost private Keys through the activation of account abstraction implemented through a secure smart contract called entry point formerly known as ERC 4337 time for fun biz the FDX drama is certainly the gift that keeps on giving this week Jenny Hogan Unchained social media manager gives us her take on nashawn's cooperation with prosecutors charges against FTX are literally like Netflix there is so much content I cannot keep up this week nishad Singh an FTX founder and former director of engineering pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors investigating SBI honestly so inspiring to me when men agree to cooperate like I once had a boyfriend who once did dishes one time staying pleaded guilty to Securities fraud Commodities fraud wire fraud okay honestly maybe it would be faster if I listed the types of fraud he didn't commit he's also charged with participating in an effort to artificially inflate ftx's Revenue artificial inflation you guys got the wrong AI but you're very close Singh's lawyers have said that nashad is deeply sorry for his role in this and has accepted responsibility for his actions okay I had no idea that all it took for men to apologize was to hire a very expensive lawyer seeing wants people to know that he wasn't always a bad guy he was once a Facebook engineer who was very involved in the effective altruist movement but I guess maybe before that he wasn't a bad guy thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Bitcoin ordinals medivh and stacks check out the show notes for
