not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to a special episode of The Chopping Block every couple weeks we get together and give the industry Insider perspective on the crypto topics of the day today is a very special day uh it's a little bit of a harrowing day and so we wanted to get together given all the drama that's been going on in the crypto industry and share our perspective on what's Happening so let me first start with intros uh first here we have Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes uh then we've got Laura who's the CEO of the show joining us today is special guest we've got Nick Carter the illustrious reformed Bitcoin Maxi and uh and then there's myself I received the head height man a dragonfly so um most of us well not all of us but most of us here are early stage investors in crypto I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice okay so why why are we here today has been a pretty crazy day actually the last few days have been very harrowing day for the entire industry uh and it all started between two of the central characters in The crypto drama who are CZ the founder of binance and Sam Beckman freed the founder of FTX so uh Sam and CZ have a very complicated relationship and so I'm gonna start for the very very beginning and kind of give the exposition for what happened so Sam and CZ they have been competitors for a long time uh Sam of course got to start as a Trader and originally he was the founder of a trading firm called elevator research then they went on to build FTX which is now one of the largest exchanges in the world or was until very recently now elevator research and FTX have always had somewhat of a confusing relationship it was known for a long time that Alameda research traded a great deal on FTX in the early days as the exchange became more institutional their relationship became a little bit more um opaque became people didn't really know exactly what the relationship was between Alameda and FTX but the claim from FTX was always that Alameda the trading firm is not you know directly associated with FTX we're totally distinct we might have common ownership but we don't really work together in a direct way that was a story it's generally considered to be a bit suspect to have a trading firm and a and an exchange to have a close relationship because of course that means the trading firm has some kind of unfair Advantage when trading in The Exchange now what does this have to do with CZ and binance finance of course the largest Exchange in the world binance was an early investor into FTX so they had a early partnership they uh invested at a very early stage and eventually FTX bought out binance from their initial stake for a total of two billion dollars and part of that 2 billion was in cash and part of it was in ftt which is the native token of FTX now what is ftt it's another central part of the story so FDT is an exchange token kind of like BNB kind of like okay B the way that ftt works and uh Tom please correct me if I'm wrong here so the way of ftt works is that FTX Burns a portion of their revenue to buy back some of the FDT and then destroy it every uh week or something like that I think it's weekly and in addition to that if you own a lot of ftt and you stake it you get trading discounts uh if you're trading at uh FTX do I have that right Tom yeah that's right okay so so this is ftt so what what triggered all of this was that um if you recall over the last week actually in the last episode we talked about an episode where Sam begman freed uh was was weighing in on his thoughts on regulation and dccpa which is a new proposed bill that was going to end up regulating quite a bit of crypto as well as D5 and many people became very upset with Sam after that and they believed that Sam was selling out a lot of the rest of the crypto Industries particularly around D5 but also other exchanges and there was a big debate between him and Eric Voorhees that we covered on our last show now Sam public sentiment to get Sam really turned after that and it seems like CZ uh similar to many of the other people who are upset with Sam uh CZ was one of the central people who believed that hey I think Sam is is behaving as a bad actor and so CZ published a tweet a few days ago where he said that he was going to be liquidating his ftt ownership so remember each portion of their buyout was in FDT so binance was a huge pile of ftt and they decide finally that they're going to sell it and the reasoning they provide for why they're going to sell it is one uh risk management so the the leaked financials about Alameda research scared a lot of people because of course Alameda held a huge amount of illiquid assets on their balance sheet of the roughly six billion dollars of equity that was on their balance sheet that was of I believe end of last year a huge portion of that was extremely liquid and the huge portion of it was ftt itself and so binance announced as part of their Exit Plan they are going to be selling their FDT on the open market and there's this line that he posted which I think is a very telling line he says liquidating or ftt said CZ is just post-exit risk management learning from Luna we gave support before but we won't pretend to make love after divorce we are not against anyone but we won't support people who Lobby against other industry players behind their backs so this was a direct dagger at the heart of FTX now Alameda research which again unclear the relationship between FTX other than the common ownership elevator research owns a huge portion of all the ftt in existence and elevator is quite uh has a very very large uh outstanding Low Book so there are a lot of loans that Alameda is holding and presumably a lot of that ftt is collateral so Alameda then announces on Twitter that we will buy all of your ftt at 22 uh so ftt immediately after CZ analysis FDT starts to decline Alameda announces they're going to buy all this ftt at 22 binance refuses Finance says look I'd rather do this on the open market why not do all this out in the open binance then proceeds to move all of their FDT to binance and starts to sell this starts to crash the ftt market ftt starts dumping and dumping and dumping and by last night which uh last night was was Monday night um ftt goes below 22.22 he was holding there very strong under this belief that the FTX slash Alameda was going to backstop the market after that the floor fell out and all of a sudden massive massive massive outflows from FTX all of a sudden everyone starts getting scared that FTX is going to be insolvent that Alameda isn't solvent that there's going to be another three arrows like liquidation spiral as a result of lenders no longer being able to liquidate the [ __ ] collateral that Alameda has alimeter to be clear is one of the largest market making firms in crypto they're a massive massive player they have huge amounts of loans from other parties and if we see another a repeat of what happened with three arrows everyone knows that it's going to be Carnage in the markets so Sam Baker Street goes onto Twitter he announces FTX is fine there's no need reason to withdraw everything is okay at the same time that he's doing that yesterday meaning Monday Sam goes to Wall Street and he starts trying to get a an Emergency liquidity injection into FTS now to be clear up till now this has all been about Alameda this has all been about Alameda and ftt ftt is supposed to be a discount token but all of a sudden everyone learns that FTX is trying to raise money and we see that withdrawals start getting um slowed down and suddenly withdrawal eventually as of this morning stop completely from FTX now to be I also want to specify this is FTX International this is not FTX us which is the US regular energy FDX us is fine and there's no real reason to believe that FTX us is not fine so all of a sudden people are thinking wait wait wait wait wait this Market making firm which is supposed to be disconnected is losing money and as a result FTX needs to raise money that doesn't make sense FTX was trying to raise a billion dollars uh around midday yesterday and by the end of the evening FTX is trying to now raise five to six billion dollars and there are no bits nobody wants to invest what we've what we've heard is that there was maybe about half a billion dollars of interest that they were able to round up but as the number kept going up by the end of the day originally they were trying to raise at a 10 billion valuation by last night it completely falls apart pretty soon there is mass fear that element is insolvent and that somehow FTX is also insolvent and that the connection between Alameda and FTX was not as originally explained Sam claimed on Twitter that FTX customer funds are not being lent out they're not being played around with everything is there at the exchange but on-chain sleuthing reveals that this is not the case there's too much money going around there's too much there's too much handwringing it looks like something is wrong at FTX and fairly soon there is a mass Exodus ftt starts to absolutely collapse until this morning CZ announces that binance is going to be acquiring FTX now they are not acquiring the US entity they're not requiring element of research and also this is a non-binding Loi meaning a letter of intent so that means that they still haven't done due diligence and this deal might still fall apart the market rebounds a little bit and then continues to fall and now we are basically in the mode of mass contagion everybody is afraid that if Alameda defaults are we going to see another three arrows is FTX completely dead are people going to lose their money is this going to lead to a wave of pain for the industry and for the future of how crypto is going to be seen by regulators and by lawmakers so that's the high level of where we are at today I think I covered as much as I could let me stop there and just get first high level responses how you guys are feeling about what happened today Nick why don't you start well I think the most dramatic day maybe since this summer but maybe even since sort of March 2020. this feels a little bit like the Layman to this Summer's bear Stearns I think this is actually possibly worse dare I say I mean FTX and uh in the FTX Alameda FTX us Empire if that really is dissolving that just leaves a lot of holes in a lot of balance sheets throughout the industry and the lenders that are already seriously impaired in distressed and might be kind of the last Hammer to fall taking them down I think then you you question what What Becomes of Genesis What Becomes of dcg what becomes a lot of the the firms that are very sort of Sam Affiliated I mean ftt going to almost zero in the space of 24 hours is truly remarkable and even more shocking almost than Luna going to zero just because it it seemed to be backed by real corporate revenues you know with and and actual earnings and not to mention the enormous consolidation here which is a crazy crazy event to happen now finance will be a total Behemoth assuming the deal goes through from I see this is yeah as you said one of the most harrowing experiences I've ever seen in the crypto space yeah I would agree about just kind of almost like from an Optics perspective you know a lot of people were calling out Terra Luna before and it is true that in recent weeks I mean my DMs were filling out with people talking about FTX and and Alameda and I did you know ask SPF in my last interview with him about that relationship but at that time there was nowhere near as many connections as have been made in recent weeks but the thing is that you know up until recent weeks Sam really you know was like the face of kind of regulated crypto in DC he was you know the one who was advocating as we saw in the debate with Eric Voorhees you know a way of operating with Regulators that is very friendly to them and something that you know they could probably get in line with and I think what's fascinating is that at least you know based on what we're seeing on chain it kind of looks like you know FTX and Alameda were operating in a way that is definitely beyond what any regulator would you know sanction and so it's just so funny that he advocates for that type of Regulation but he himself doesn't practice those practices and that's what took him down so there's some crazy irony there and especially that CZ of all people who is the poster child for you know regulatory Arbitrage is the one who like called his bluff on that and took and took down FTS so the whole I mean just like you know for me as a Storyteller I'm like like I don't even have to do anything here like and when I go to write this it's just like all written for me so yeah just definitely uh to my experience you know um I actually think this is the number one biggest news day in crypto ever in the history of crypto yeah I mean I agree and you people comp it to like Terra Luna or three iOS but again I think like a lot of people refuse to get into Tara just because the mechanics weren't sound a lot of lenders refuse to lend to three arrows um because they didn't pass diligence but Sam was like supposed to be you know sort of The Golden Child uh networking in DC uh this you know MIT wonderkid and then like this sort of falling apart I I do find it also funny that like this quindis article really seemed to attribute the thing that kicked off this sort of crisis of confidence that came out about a week ago that's what started to cause the stable coin withdrawals from FTX that's what started to cause this entire sort of cascade um and but even that was like not a very I guess well sort of diligent article it was from June and it was kind of unclear what the liabilities were supposed to be um and so when I read that article I didn't think immediately oh FTX is insolvent it was okay this doesn't look like a super healthy balance sheet I don't really know who's lending but it wasn't as if like oh this thing is is toast it's a zero immediately but it's almost sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy of as more and more people lose crisis or lose confidence more people lose confidence and you end up with the current situation Nation I think I think that's right the question is like okay what did we learn today the first thing we learned is you never crossed CZ so that's the first one I think that's one thing that you want to take with you uh for a long time now because you cross CZ and you're not going to live to tell the tale the second thing is that I think we Now understand um a lot of how FTX worked which is that so so first I want to say that a lot of what we're talking about in the show especially that's not already out in public is is going to be speculation right now we don't know a lot it's a very live situation and a lot of news is flying by and a lot of things are not confirmed yet so very few people know the truth of what is actually going on here but um what I've heard and again this is totally speculation so I don't know whether it's true what I've heard is that yesterday when there was this emergency financing going on for FTX basically people realized as Sam was asking for more and more money that the diligence materials he was sharing were [ __ ] it's very likely that you know when when the FTX round happened last year there was absolutely no way that if the investors knew that customer funds were basically all being lent out to Alameda that this would have been invested in by all of these institutional investors so the the speculation that I'm hearing is that what happened is likely going to be criminal because they misrepresented a huge amount of things both their customers and to investors there's really no plausible way that FTX not Alameda but FTX would not be able to process withdrawals because the value of FDT went down it doesn't make sense well right there shouldn't be a relationship yeah I mean exactly and this so I I was so shocked about the whole thing because I thought okay maybe I'll mate is in trouble but that shouldn't actually reflect there shouldn't be a contagion over to FTX the only explanation I have is that CZ somehow got wind of the fact that maybe customer deposits were being lent out and decided to launch this attack I would love to know what they knew such that they could feel empowered to launch that attack they must have done some on-chained sleuthing or something to determine that uh FTX was not just holding those balances in full Reserve yeah and my point about um how the exact behaviors that Regulators will not sanction is what took Sam down you know when I mentioned like you know on-chain evidence what I meant was it was so I saw multiple tweets about this you know a bunch of people had been trying to look for ftx's cold storage and that is a major red flag if you cannot find anything that looks like that and then when people were also saying there's so much money that Alameda is sending to FTX like if they're truly as separate as they're supposed to be then like that should not be needed in this kind of scenario you know you're right like if it's full full reserves then just as people are what's wrong they just get the coins they have so you know I I like obviously nothing is like 100 at this moment but you know it's a major red flag that people haven't been able to identify those wallets so yeah I I agree the chain doesn't lie as we've seen time and time again and it's a big red flag to be going on Twitter and public and saying we're completely solvent and then and on chain we see that you're pulling you know a few million dollars from random yield Farms like you don't go you know scrounging through your couch for change if you're if you're totally good for it and so um I agree I mean I think like if you can't produce preserves if you can't produce those those cold law addresses it doesn't really breed a lot of confidence which which to me is also crazy that how did this last round get done without doing basic enough diligence to understand where the assets and I mean these are some of the largest most sophisticated invest investors in the world it was like a billion dollars that they raised it was a billion dollars nobody verified where the funds were which is absolutely insane um but it it the the other element of this which is I think um also worrying of course is is the Alameda side so FTX okay FTX is in trouble um Alameda I've heard they're not they didn't make margin calls and people can't get in touch with them which probably means that elementa is going under um we don't know for certain but that's that's a it's a good prediction at this point to make especially given that FDT has gotten rocked it's down over 75 uh just in the last 24 hours now originally you might think like okay why did CZ do this yeah if you think that cdcz was the one who shot the gun um why did he do this there may have been in his mind an expectation that okay if I if I hurt FTX it's a chance to take out a competitor and I can consolidate I don't think he realized how bad it would be if something like this would happen like the reality is that the entire crypto industry is down more than 12 today uh Bitcoin ether everything is down massively and there's there's a lot of fear about if good things get worse if we see real contagion kick off and if we see an impairment in the lenders as much as what happened with three arrows and so I don't think I don't think CZ fully understood the consequences of what would happen if he were to try to take down FTX it's always been a bit of an Open Secret among exchange owners that FTX was never very profitable it was kind of weird that they were so big and they were spending so much on marketing and they were they were they were so aggressive and they were so loud um but of all the big exchanges FTX was probably the least profitable except besides coinbase maybe the only exception which is somehow losing money almost every other exchange made money especially they did derivatives right derivatives are incredibly profitable but FDX was the least profitable of all the big exchanges and it was always very confusing to other exchange founders what is going on at FTX like why are they raising so much money why are they becoming so successful when we can tell they're not making that much money and I think we now have a clear idea of what the answer is is that FTX was a way or sorry potentially the suspicion is that FTX was ultimately a way to fund Alameda research where they made the real money and now is when we saw the whole thing unwind that kind of maps I'm still in shock about that and I almost don't believe it because they position themselves as the pro-regulatory exchange and they're trying to come into the light in the US and you know from from offshore and so it Beggars belief that they would do that I would never never have expected that I was completely taken by surprise but that does track in terms of the past dependence to this whole thing because Alameda was first you know Alameda came first and then FTX was created and so if you see it as a vehicle to get more deposits and and allow Alameda to obtain more leverage it kind of makes sense but it's still shocking that they wouldn't adhere to the basic basic principle of running a crypto exchange which is maintain a full Reserve So speaking of which soon after this whole debacle was playing out CZ announced that binance was going to start doing proof of reserves and Nick this is something you've been you've been very vocal about can you explain very briefly what proof of reserves is and why it matters here yeah and there's also misconceptions about this people think proof of Reserve is just one side of the balance sheet that's not true okay proof of Reserve actually does refer to both the liabilities and the assets okay so it doesn't uh when people talk about proof Reserve they are talking about a procedure in which you call it a proof of solvency even although of course maybe that might be overreaching because that's always hard to assess but proof of Reserve is like a term of art which refers to a procedure whereby you compare the assets that you have to user liabilities on a platform and it has been done since 2014 in the wake of gox actually there's an interesting story there with CZ I think did one at okay coin back in the day when he was CTO at okay coin and now his is announcing it at binance but so basically the what you do is you do a trivial proof of assets held on chain that's the easy part then you do you sum up all the liabilities and you kind of attest to the user liabilities on the platform optionally then you give depositors the ability to verify that they're included in that liability set typically done through Merkel type proof and and it's not that complicated this code out there to do it bitmax did it recently Kraken did it recently so it is technically doable although challenging if you include margin and other types of accounts and obviously as you add blockchains it becomes more more difficult to do but basically it's a way to prove that you assets and liabilities match and now we're seeing renewed enthusiasm around it binance of course the most important firm in the industry has announced they'll do it frankly I think that's gonna be extremely challenging for them because they have such a tangle of assets I actually it's going to take a joke that's going to take all five of the big four accounting firms to figure it out for them because it's just very hard uh but yeah I'm very encouraged that's happening I just wish it was happening under more auspicious circumstances it is part of the ethos of crypto really which is uh don't trust verify and crypto the whole point of crypto is that it should make this stuff easy now okay look there's complexities you're doing derivatives you have different blockchains you've got all these like kind of weird esoteric assets that you're Trading um but at the end of the day I I completely agree with you that this this should be in principle doable and I think one one of the big lessons from this is that nobody in this industry is unassailable right we thought we learned that a little bit with three arrows but clearly we didn't we didn't we didn't learn that and I and I want to meet a culpa because on the last show we were saying that we thought this whole thing was overblown and you know there was enough not that it was overblown but we didn't there wasn't enough there in that coindust report to actually know what the balance sheet of Alameda looked like I had no idea that this was coming and until yesterday I mean I wasn't tweeting about this but I thought Alameda and FTX would be fine and talking to the lenders the lenders who had loans out of telemeda as of yesterday they thought that element would be fine it was very quick and sudden that people realized that this thing was over and I think it was really the the fact of what was happening at FTX that made all of this very quickly come to a close if there was actually a line between FTX and Alameda I actually think that things would have been okay but it turns out that there was this whole underground tunnel that nobody else knew about and that was never disclosed by FTX now again this is all speculation we don't know until we know what happens in the end but one of the core questions now is one is CZ actually going to bot FTX so he announced that this morning and I think this morning the moment that he announced it Marky markets jumped up and it seemed like there was going to be a broad recovery and then soon in the hours after uh the market dumped again it went even lower than what it was before the announcement um what do you guys think about the likelihood it's very clear when CeCe tweeted this that it's like look we are not committed to buying FTX we are in due diligence we've given them an Loi but we may we have reserve the right to walk away from the deal what do you guys think happens from here with respect to CZ buying FTX I I would say for the 60 probability the deal closes uh totally arbitrary number but I mean I think they're going to find skeletons in the closet they may have been aware of them already which is why they launched the attack and felt empowered to do that but the prize is enormous I mean FTX is maybe not by user count but still by breadth of product and just the quantity of things they've built over there and The Innovation and dynamism Rivals only binance I would say in terms of the offshore exchanges so ultimately it's a massive opportunity for them to just consolidate and grow their reach and control of the industry and get access to this additional user base so I think it's in their interest to do it it may be at a complete fire sale price I'm also very curious to see where that gets consummated yeah I also wonder if like SBF is you know using this tentative deal as a way to find other funding to remain independent in the background um I don't think anybody else okay so you think that's it was possible this morning yeah I think it was possible this morning but after this afternoon I think I think FTX has got only one potential acquirer okay the fact that they were trying to raise five to six billion tells you that there's nobody in this industry who can pay up other than binance wow right does binance even have the could they buy for cash or would it have to be for finance equity I mean to be clear I'm talking about the hole in the balance sheet I'm not talking about the Enterprise Value I think the Enterprise value for FTX is negative I I don't think anybody will pay for this it's insane how closely this mirror is the block by situation I just can't believe that it's the same thing but now it's happened to them and for a bigger more reputable company like what what I've heard again I don't know if this is correct but what I've heard is that the deal the shape of the deal is that basically they take over the liabilities no payment for Enterprise Value and a kind of handshake that they'll take care of the team afterwards meaning that basically it's a fire sale they are taking over the liabilities and they're going to make customers whole now why would you do this if you're saying the answer is that nobody else wants to buy this from you and it's going to be much worse for you if FTX goes down in flames then if there's a smooth exit and to be to be clear I think a lot of what binance buys is not even the customer list or whatever FDX at this point has a terrible terrible name given everything that's happened over the last 48 hours and what's going to come out inevitably over the upcoming months I think it's more that he's buying lots of Goodwill he's buying lots of Goodwill with us Regulators people will remember this if he steps in and saves retail investors and saves face for everybody who trusted Sam I think it's going to it's going to buy him a lot of Goodwill in the industry the same reason why Sam bought block fight um comes down even in moments like this I do think you're right he's trying to like benefit the greatest number of people at this point basically in a bad situation Yeah just they don't happen to be uh crypto depositors um I think like I agree I mean this this kind of feels like block fire reducts where it's it's not about it's almost like this is this sort of macro story around smoothing out the industry creating sort of this like quieting effect making people whole I mean honestly like you know what is a few billion to finance to CZ like you know this thing prints money um and so I think for them to basically acquire this I I think the the downside here is just the concentration in the industry you know binance becomes massive compared to all the other players especially players that have shut down in the past year um or just be really fallen off um and you know what does it mean when 80 of you know crypto volume goes through one single entity which is you know not that inconceivable in the future I was just gonna ask how um you know obviously binance's regulatory uh situation is not clear but I did wonder at this point I don't know U.S Regulators might get in in some way just because I mean I don't know it's offshore but I'm sure they have plenty of U.S customers well no no no no no no because okay so Alex has a US arm right FTX has a US arm FTX us is unimpaired FTX us is still processing no I know I'm not talking about FTX U.S or binance us I'm just saying I well my question is just when you have even if it's offshore such such a such concentration uh in the industry like would they find some way to get involved I don't know you you might know better than that I mean U.S Regulators have no jurisdiction over what's happening to non-us customers right both FTX and binance wasn't that what people thought about bitmex yeah but Max bid mix was was uh bitmax out in trouble for serving us customers right like they they had like a very weak IP block they were knowingly taking on us customers and that was the jurisdiction that was how they established restriction over bitmex for binance I mean there have been other claims like that for binance but not since binance us has existed as far as I know my suspicion of what happens is that so binance did not claim that they're acquiring FTX us my guess they want nothing to do with fgx us right they don't want to touch it because that would tribute that would trigger cypheus uh which is like basically you know if you have foreign investors investing into US company there's all sorts of regulatory reviews they don't want to touch any of that and FTX us there's no way ftxus was doing any of the funny business that FTX International was doing right but it's much smaller I see Laura's point a little bit is that if these were U.S firms the FTC would be looking at it for antitrust um and obviously that's probably not the case here but you know in a if this was If This Were a U.S transaction there would certainly be eyebrows raised about the concentration in the industry and maybe there's no entity that actually has that actual regulatory Aegis but I think it should cause concerns actually that basically the two largest effectively offshore exchanges are now one uh to be clear FTX was not the second largest software Exchange fgf is probably number four okay but still still very material and uh you know in terms of influence maybe over some of these networks you know where they had a close relationship with them that's only going to be increased now that's definitely true uh that being said I think in these situations if there were I mean there is no Global regulator who like who does that uh like what the FTC might do for the us but this is one of those situations where I think everyone is going to look the other way because the consequences of holding this back are so disastrous for everyone that it's like look we'll figure it out later for now yes please let's minimize the damage to markets the thing about FTX as well that's important to understand is that although FTX did a lot of volume most of ftx's volume was institutional it was not retail that was what FDX had a reputation that most of the trading development on FTX was institutional which is why where where most people really wanted to trade if you're a market maker or a Trader you want to trade on binance finance is much more retail than FTX does coinbase is much more retail than FTX does and so because so many users of FTX were institutions I think that also makes FTX going down extra bad or bad in a different kind of way I should say no it's not it's not worse than having retail lose money retail losing money is very very bad having institutions lose money hurts you in a very different kind of way which is that I think it's much more likely that if FTX goes down that there's going to be a lot more regulatory heat on crypto there's going to be a lot of Institutions that pull back from crypto and think that crypto is not fundable I mean what do you guys think are the knock-on effects of such a massive and such a well-publicized exchange going down like this especially if they're not saved by binance I think there's a bigger question around crypto Venture if you can have Sequoia and Paradigm and tamasa and tiger and like all the big names you know piling money into this thing which is supposed to be you know sort of this you know a stamped you know approved investment and have it be a massive write down how do LP sort of think about crypto Venture as a whole um and that component of the industry yeah and I actually want to Echo next points at the beginning about contagion because if FTX and Alameda really are just like you know um the same two-headed creature basically then you know it's going to be very similar to what we saw before and yeah there could you know be knock-on effects to other players like genesis and dcg which you know those are similar they're they're just like those kinds of names that that have a certain level of quality associated with them a certain level of trust and if those have you know repercussions from this and it's just it's bad for the industry yeah the the crypto lending space this might be the last shoe to drop I mean Genesis was already deeply deeply in trouble and God only knows how they'll react to this I believe they did still have loans outstanding uh there's they're not the only lender Alameda after the the dust had cleared was still one of the big Borrowers um and so if they go down it's another credit crisis that's upon us and it's not like it's also should really handle it like for the um the the uncollateralized loans and D5 a huge portion of all of them were out to Alameda so I think that was true on true fi I think it was true on um Maple if I'm not mistaken uh and I think these all of these lending pools are likely to be in trouble if elementa is genuinely insolvent the other thing we haven't talked about is just the political wins in the US I mean uh Sam was really meant to be the white knight in terms of professing a open regulatory stance you know being the Emissary from the crypto industry and uh you know preaching moderation preaching engagement with Washington you have to imagine the bill they were working on the DC CPA is probably dead in committee at this point um I think there's a huge loss of reputation I don't see why Washington would engage after this it's also the midterms today and Sam you know obviously was a heavy Democratic uh donor it doesn't seem to be the way things are going in the election I I do wonder what the consequences I will be I think a lot of the Democrats that were engaging happily with FTX and with Sam now just take a step back from the industry and and think to themselves yeah this crypto thing was a wildcat it's sort of crazy industry and and you know let's not engage carefully like you know why why bother if this is the way that things actually are I was looking at um well I mean yeah there's there's a lot going on today U.S midterms I think Tom shared a tweet earlier that uh today is a very bad day for Sam because not only did he lose FTX but also it looks like there's gonna be a red wave there's a there's a market on polymarket a very a very illiquid Market that asks uh will FTX become insolvent by end of year right now it's trading at 40 yes which is um which is which is basically a prediction of whether finance will buy them out I I hope that they will and I think uh Nick it seems like the market agrees with you that there's a 60 chance that this deal goes through but the the scale of losses on FTX is balance sheet must have increased dramatically today and so what might have been five to six billion last night could be much more than that today and uh I don't think I don't think binance would buy FTX for 20 billion I think they might pay five maybe they would pay 10 but they would not pay 20. so it really depends on what the damage looks like after today and we just don't know but if binance is a buy it then I think FTX is probably toast the other the other question so one thing that we've seen across the board especially yesterday was everything that Alameda owns or FTX owns has been dumping aggressively and at the center of that Empire of course was Solana so Sam and Alameda and FTX were known as being very large holders of Solana as well as very large advocates for Solana and with the with basically Alameda having to sell almost everything they have in order to meet margin calls um there's been Mass selling of all Solana tokens and everything in the Solana ecosystem and so it kind of poses a real question just very recently we had breakpoint in Lisbon pose a real question of one how viable is Solana as a layer one without the support of Sam and of the FTX Empire uh do we think that this is going to be a long-term impairment of Solana or estelan already achieved that escape velocity such that okay it started with Sam and their Associates as you know being the initial launch pad for this blockchain but does it have a life of its own just yesterday we saw uh we saw um polygon flip Solana for the first time pushing Solana out of the top 10 tokens by market cap what are you guys views on on Solana and what happens from here I actually think Solana has exit velocity here I think uh I see enough traction that ecosystem enough organic enthusiasm enough developer activity startups infrastructure Etc I would say I subjectively from my view I consider them maybe second most active smart contract ecosystem so I actually do think they can survive this obviously a big loss of confidence in the sort of primary sort of underwriter and Patron of that ecosystems out down for the count but yeah from our perspective I think they actually will stick around and you know so the course on a bet remains unchanged it's kind of a bet on the sort of Monolithic blockchain the composability uh the you know benefits to a defy setup that you get with sort of like the larger throughput and the higher frequency and things like that so yeah from my stance I actually see them surviving I agree I don't like I didn't get the sense FTX reality were like a big part of break point of anything like jump was a bigger part with uh fire dancer which like their fpga client that's supposed to be way faster so it's like it's not like it really hinges on them anymore I also want to Circle back to the lending bit so I was actually just looking through like Maple and trufai and again a testament to the ability of to be able to being able to do things on chain uh Maple actually doesn't have any loans outstanding to Alameda at this moment um I think trufi has like 12 mil um so not actually that that bad that's good to hear and then yeah that's a that's a beautiful demonstration of why the defy hybrid approach to lending is better you know when would you been able to do that for the centralized lenders that's fair if you if you had some money into one of these centralized lenders right now you'd have no idea what your exposure was telemeda whereas um using using these on-chain ones you can see the entire loanbook and so it does it does speak to the transparency the value of transparency and if anything that seems like that was at the core of what went wrong here was that nobody knew what was happening behind the scenes at FTX except the people who were in charge and the good news is like we have these crises they're not fatal and then we have reform so I'm not saying the crypto lending Market is fully reformed but we're seeing green shoots we're seeing much more enthusiasm for the hybrid under collateralized lenders not just those two names it's a whole bunch um and then hopefully in the centralized exchange space I think this will finally be the Catalyst actually other exchanges reach out to me as I'm like the proof of Reserve guy for some reason um and tell me yeah hey we're doing proof of Reserve how do we like get on your website because I have a Tracker I'm like well you just tell me and I'll put you on the website uh as if there's some sort of admittance fee or something but so I'm actually seeing many more exchanges now take proof of Reserve seriously I think I think it'll be written into legislation actually I think a smart policy maker writes that into law says yeah you guys have the tools to do this do it you have to do it you haven't done a good job of doing it on your own and it that converges C5 and D Phi a little bit right you think about what D5 lending is it's all proof of reserved up you know a fully proof preserved so you know let's convert the two yeah that's what I was thinking earlier when we were talking about how CZ promised that he was going to do proof of reserves or Finance because I was like oh how ironic it would be if CZ of all people is the one who's kind of showing Regulators the benefits of blockchains and um you know this kind of like open source you know transparent blockchain basically um I I just was like you know because normally The Regulators they want to like just have all these intermediaries who are checking everything blah blah blah you know the whole bit um so it would just be hugely ironic if this person out of all people is the one who kind of shows them how to do it it's easy to do some real Art of War stuff right now like this has been an absolute master class over the last 24 hours so true it is an irony though that we get these crises because of the lack of transparency the the confidence crisis with FTX element it was because nobody knew it was a black box right and we weren't getting a lot of communication in theory all this stuff can be rendered transparent we're using blockchains that's the main critique of blockchains frankly is that they're too transparent let's take advantage of that I remember when uh when Sam was on uh odd lots and he was talking about uh the magic of putting money in a box and it turns out that that was what he was doing all along was uh allegedly allegedly uh that we were putting money in the box that he was taking money out of the box and fading it on chain so the idea of uh you know if you recall you know when we were talking about Celsius we talked about how you know we called Celsius the lender sort of as a euphemism right Celsius was really a hedge fund because you were putting money into Celsius and you're basically giving debt to a head fund you're not even the equity toront right you're giving debt to a hedge fund hedge fund goes and does crazy stuff on chain if it doesn't work out you take the loss if it does work out you get a coupon right it turns out that's what fgx was too now again I say turns out allegedly we don't know um but it seems like that was the exact ultimately the exact same thing is that you had your money in a hedge fund you had your money in Alameda and you were getting nothing actually for it you weren't even getting a coupon you were getting nothing which is a much worse deal than even the people in Celsius at least some people in Celsius got their coupon and could get out I guess where I want to end this is I feel like there's two audiences that um we should speak to the first is you know people in crypto who maybe are new to the space and are just like what the hell is going on I I come here you guys tell me this big story about how great crypto is how transparent everything is you guys are Reinventing the financial system and then all I get is three arrows I get Tara and now I get this um explain yourselves otherwise I'm out what would you say to somebody who who tells you that I was actually thinking about this today um you know behind all the craziness there are people building normal functioning businesses that are boring that their normal exchanges like coinbase there are normal investment funds that you operate completely solvently and normally but they're just boring and so I don't know what it is that like causes these sort of incidents to continue recurring if it's like the type of people or the technology or the market but there's no inherent reason why you know people have to play these games there's tons of businesses out there that don't do these things and are totally fine but maybe it just becomes too attractive to you know chase after these opportunities to you know sort of behave less than ethically but it's it's not um inherent in the technology in my mind it's it's maybe something else I'm reminded of a line from uh for all his flaws you know still a great writer and it seemed to Labs Fooled by Randomness and um I think his first book when he was still sort of hungry and good and uh he says in any Market regime the best performing kind of Traders or entities are the ones that are sort of most overfitted they've they've most carefully fit their strategy to that particular Market regime when it turns to the most exposed so the best performing entities in a given Market circumstance if things change they're kind of the most exposed so you can't expect that it's with some exceptions of course you have funds that do extremely well for decades at a time you can't expect that the guys that did the best recently are necessarily going to do the best when things change and you know I think Sam was sort of like the same Empire was the preeminent success story of the market over the last couple years and I think that is the problem is they became you know somehow accustomed to that market regime and and took on you know additional risk and they became enamored with their own success and and felt that they were invulnerable and I often think about that maybe it's a form of cope um but uh you know I do think about the fact that if someone you know appears to be sort of like the killer success story of crypto then you should really you know consider what happens if market conditions change dramatically which they did Laura what would you say I don't I don't I don't view my role as like trying to convince people that you know crypto is good or whatever I probably you know I agree with Tom that obviously the the crypto industry is vast there's kind of good players and then shade or shady and unsavory characters uh like in most things in life not gonna lie I still find some of the idealistic parts of crypto like very appealing and I actually feel that some of those areas have shined in different ways throughout this whole period starting you know since back in the spring um so you know maybe pointing out some of those things but you know overall I think most people probably would agree that everything that happened here will be a net benefit for crypto in the long term and um that kind of the earlier we get like certain people that are kind of not acting above board out of the space like you know the better it's going to be for everyone obviously there's going to be a lot of pain during this period of turmoil right now but you know ultimately like it won't be for the good and so you know maybe you could just say to somebody sort of like stick around while we like weed out all the all the shenanigans um you know something like that but one other thing that I was going to say um was just about oh oh I had a funny thought about like a very ironic thing you know coinbase was so upset about um the wells notice that the SEC threatened based on it wanting to do with lend product and now I'm like oh like maybe they're like oh maybe it's a good thing we didn't do that so um that's just like an ironic uh kind of little code edge this whole thing yeah one thing I'll say quickly is that you know a lot of people got upset with Sam because he was advocating for sort of like a C5 first approach to crypto regulation right with D5 I don't want to misrepresent what he said but D5 apparently sort of more of an afterthought the tools to move on from this kind of Crisis whether it's the credit crisis in the summer maybe another credit crisis now the centralized exchange crisis those tools are simply just reacquainting ourselves with the sort of underlying core values of crypto right focusing more on D5 more on transparency more on the you know actual like transparency that we get from using crypto assets right on trustlessness right on not trusting you know large centralized providers so we have the toolkit laid out in front of us so if anything I think there should be a reminder yeah you know these big centralized institutions are not inviable you know there is an alternative way and that's just the crypto way I will absolutely Echo that you're in the Bitcoin white paper Satoshi says I have laid out a way to transact without trusted intermediaries that was what Bitcoin was originally all about and time and time again we learn what happens when we re-centralize power into trusted intermediaries or institutions and we build Cults of personalities around people instead of understanding the incentives the mechanisms and ultimately the code that's what crypto is about that's what it's been about from the very beginning and so to me what all of these you know this is the old historian crypto it happened without Cox it happened with uh three arrows it has it keeps happening right this idea that you need to stop trusting people and you need to start trusting the system the system that we are trying to build here um again and again the story of all the stuff is that it's not Bitcoin that breaks it's not ethereum that breaks it's not defy that breaks not compound or you know swap or any of these things that break it's the it's the institutions that we build around people and individuals who have incentives that drive them in a wayward direction from the incentives of their users or their customers and at the end of the day to me it's a reaffirmation that we should be finding ways to use this technology as you pointed out Nick Carter with uh sorry Carter as you pointed out Nick with with proof of reserves and being able to lean further into the power that this technology gives us that isn't available in the regular Financial world right to me that's so much of what the take home is that this whole debacle uh crypto was built to give us the tools so that this kind of thing doesn't need to happen and my hope is that um we learn from this and we do learn a little bit every single time right we do push the Vanguard forward every single time in terms of the transparency the real time the analysts who are looking on chain and figuring out where is this Capital going where is that Capital going there's so much more clarity on how this story happened in real time remember remember how long it took for mount gox for people to realize the money wasn't there compared to today all this stuff happened in a single day and so we are making progress but I think there's still clearly further to go in understanding what the promise of this technology actually is and how to harvest that in a world where obviously we do need to have some connective tissue with the traditional Financial world that's a lot of what FTX story was about was that we are going to be the Gateway from the old Financial world to the new Financial World um we do need that but we need to Leverage The Power of crypto and the transparency that it brings to do that in a way that that ultimately works in the long run right but so I I agree with you that that is one possible and very um you know valid conclusion um however I do see a risk for Regulators to have a different conclusion which is it's obviously the whole issue around like why why people were upset with Sam over the dccpa thing is how to do with D5 obviously that's not you know this doesn't involve D5 however in general what what that you know sort of debate was about was like getting Regulators involved in an area where people were crypto people felt like hands off this is not an area where we need Regulators we have you know on-chain transparency blah blah blah right and also I think people are very protective of developers and actually the tornado cash thing today sort of shows that the government is amenable to that idea of kind of you know exempting developers from some of the stuff but I do see how some of what happened in the last 24 hours could actually lead Regulators to you know this other conclusion of like oh we need to be more involved we need to make crypto we need to make sure that these crypto institutions if there are exchanges whatever act more like Banks and you know they're so I don't know so I I'm I'm not saying that what you're saying is wrong I actually feel like that's a perfectly reasonable lesson to take away from this but I could see someone with a very different background reaching a completely different conclusion so I wouldn't say necessarily that like the end of the story is like don't trust in uh intermediaries because a lot of regulators their solution for things is to use intermediaries so that's that's totally that's totally fair and I want to make clear and this is this is maybe an extension of the point that you're making like if you look at the all the U.S exchanges are very highly regulated right FTX International was based in the Bahamas and apparently bahaman Regulators somehow this just I don't know snuck by them or whatever it is that FTX was doing we still don't know the details uh was okay in the Bahamas or maybe they hit it from the Bahamas we don't know but the U.S cannot regulate everything in the world right like ultimately no matter how restrictive you make us regulations coinbase is not doing this stuff FTX us not doing the stuff it's the businesses that end up getting pushed overseas that find themselves in these weird weird pockets of potential alleged malfeasance and so I think it's it's not it's it's not you can't rely on Regulators because if you rely on Regulators the the companies are going to pick up their headquarters and leave they're going to go from Malta to here to there to Dubai to whatever blah blah that's what they do um the moment that a regulator gets tough people pick up and they go somewhere else yeah but then the weird twist is everybody's always criticizing U.S Regulators but then it's like oh well because they're they're so strict like this kind of [ __ ] here so I'm I'm sorry yeah to be clear I think U.S regulations would make something like this impossible it was clearly they did because fdxus didn't do any of this stuff right and so it's not just about protecting it I don't think there's something you can look to Regulators for it's something that we have to look to the industry for we have to look for people ourselves in the industry demanding different things of the services and products that we use right if people say that exchanges need to do proof of reserves where I won't deposit my money there they will do it period doesn't matter where they are it doesn't matter if they're in Dubai or if they're in Timbuktu it doesn't make a difference they'll do it if that's what the industry demands that's the point that I'm making that's a great Point yeah I agree with that so I guess the but the point you made Laura is is a very good one once again Regulators are watching Regulators are like and lawmakers are like what the hell is this circus you guys told me that this guy was so great and he's he's he's uh you know this boy Genius uh gives away all as well which like adds you know I know he's got the funny shoelaces he's got the crazy hair he sleeps in a bean bag you guys are telling me this guy's second coming and and now look where where I am last thing and then we can wrap what would you say here to lawmakers or regulators that they're still decent operators in the industry that are actually interested in safeguarding client assets and running real businesses and you don't have to look far to find them but you know don't be dazzled by you know the Sam Baker and Freeds of the world coming in with a huge budget slinging money around Washington like there's other people to engage with in the space and there's other firms that actually do want to play by the rules and protect their clients and things like that I think some of the blame is a small very small portion of the blame is due to the folks that got sucked into the Mystique of Sam and the cult of personality they built as is the case a lot of these other collapses we've seen and um you know it's the crypto regulatory story is clearly not going to be written by him uh it's going to be written by the people that are left after the rebels uh settled yeah I think you know the flip side of good regulation is strangulation and a chilling effect and not letting entrepreneurs start and build businesses and I think in my mind you know we've had the technology to sort of get those to both worlds of a transparent you know investor consumer friendly business but that also allows people to experiment and try new things and serve their their Niche and I think of it a little bit almost sort of like um and then encrypted messages where we don't need a central you know authority to go through and make sure that people's messages aren't being read we should have the technology to sort of enable that by default um and I'd like to see the industry move more towards that of allowing us to sort of be compliant with what we want from these products by default um and not sort of uh relying on a government or a central authority to enforce those I don't know if I want to give a message to Regulators necessarily I I don't want to like speak for the industry but what I will say is that you know I sort of now see this kind of little vacuum where the industry had certain players that it relied on to put a good face forward and Sam definitely was preeminent among them and you know when you look at some of the other exchange owners you know Brian Armstrong is just who Brian Armstrong is he's I don't think he's gonna like step up to the play and unfortunately you know it's just not in his character um coinbase you know really like from from literally its first days try to be that you know good actor work the percolators and yet Brian is just not the person who can be a face they have this huge compliance department they have a lot of people that you know go to Washington and interact with Regulators but they don't necessarily have a good face and because of their frustrations with Regulators now they're often in this antagonistic role the Winklevoss twins you know the similar situation you know obviously they try to put forward a good face and then now after the cftc actually against me you saw I think some of the Twins were like kind of trash talking this or they I remember they wrote some tweets where it was just such a different tenor from their previously kind of more obsequious tone I don't know Jesse Powell um he's more like you know I'll support coin Center to do the advocacy work I don't see him necessarily you know doing that and I could keep going through the list but I think you get the point and so it just makes me wonder like okay so now what's gonna happen you've got kind of like the Katie Hawn paradigm-ish people behind the scenes like is that what's gonna I just don't know um but it's just something that I've been wondering because a lot of the narrative around like getting dccpa done or any kind of crypto legislation done actually a lot like a lot of what I kept hearing was like you know oh you know we can all credit Sam bankman freed for you know putting a lot of FaceTime in DC to try to get legislation done that you know obviously went down the [ __ ] uh in the last 24 hours so that's why I'm wondering like okay so now what's next it'll be interesting to watch I I've heard that the two most influential people on the hill within the crypto industry were Sam and then Katie Han it's I think probably Katie's gonna have to carry a lot of this on her shoulders now yeah and in a way I think she's a better person to do it than Sam because she spent how long in government I don't remember like what 15 years or I don't even know so in that regard like you know because Sam is like what like 20 something I don't know how it is but yeah yeah he's kind of fresh out of college uh you know Katie and I are like sort of the same age so we like I think understand when you have relationships for a long time or you just have a certain like level of knowledge and depth of knowledge of working in an industry for a very long time like it just it's very helpful so um Katie Helen if you're watching you know um we think that the crypto industry relies on you at this point yeah godspeed please save us I would say a circle and Jeremy Lair also a big difference they'll have an opportunity to kind of reframe reset the narrative here yeah 100 yeah so what I what I would say and then we can we can wrap up is that um I remember one line that Robert said on the show uh after the three arrows collapse was that one of one of the lessons of that episode was that the problems in crypto keep arising when we do things Wall Street style instead of crypto Style and I think that was kind of the central theme of all the big failures that we saw this year was that when you see more centralization when you see more trust in individuals that's when you get these uh really unfortunate failures that surprise everybody sometimes things fail but when things fail it shouldn't be a surprise that's that's kind of the the rule of how orderly markets function at the end of the day I would say you know what Sam was advocating for was for Less regulation on exchanges and more regulation in D5 and it actually seems like the lesson should be the opposite that there's probably there probably should be more regulation on exchanges and less regulation on D5 in large part because defy was totally fine nothing in defy you know rugged anybody nothing in D5 stole people's money nothing in defy uh tricked anyone into doing something they didn't intend to do now of course there are scams and there's you know all sorts of problems with with uh hacks and things like that the industry yeah and those are things that the industry gets better at and it's figuring out its way to to get past because users demand it but the story of centralized exchanges kind of you know it's the same story since the beginning of time and I think the if there's one takeaway from this it's that there definitely needs to be regulation in crypto but I think the shape of that regulation depends a lot on how you see why this happened and how it should affect how users um interact with this industry going forward and the promise that this industry actually holds for a better version of a financial system so yeah well that being said we've gone a bit long it's been a long day I'm very exhausted I assume that you guys are too I haven't gotten a lot of sleep lately but we'll we'll be back next week uh hopefully things will be a little bit more calm by then um thanks so much Nick for jumping on on short notice yeah my pleasure this is great yeah and anybody wants to do proof of reserves you know uh you know who to hit up uh he will list you for free if you do yeah I saw Nick carter.info slash proof reserves I think it's a list of everyone that's done it if you want to get on the illustrious list just sell me a piano but you put you on there beautiful I love it we will put that link in the show notes all right awesome all right signing off stay safe everybody bye everyone [Music]
