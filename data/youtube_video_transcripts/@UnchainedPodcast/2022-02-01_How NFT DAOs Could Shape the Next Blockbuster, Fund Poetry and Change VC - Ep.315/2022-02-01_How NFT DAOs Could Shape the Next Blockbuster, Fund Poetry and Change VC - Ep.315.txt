hi all as you know my book the cryptopians comes out february 22nd i wanted to share a blurb that michael casey chief content officer at coindesk and co-author of the age of cryptocurrency wrote about it michael said laura shins compelling blow by blow account of the remarkable birth and growth of ethereum shows that its spectacular wealth generation was not without struggle by shins telling the story of ethereum is a grand human drama its lesson is that for all the talk of decentralized code-based virtual machines a successful crypto project's biggest challenge is that it must survive its user community's internecine conflicts and rise above the egos of its brilliant but humanly flawed founders if that intrigues you then pre-order the cryptopians idealism greed lies and the making of

today's guest is trevor mcfadries ceo of dapper collectives and founder of friends with benefits welcome trevor hi thank you for having me thanks for being here so you used to be a dj and you also created the famous cgi influencer little michaela tell us about your background and what you were doing before you got into crypto nft slash daos i typically say in these kind of like tech interviews that you know that i have an atypical background but i feel like folks in crypto come from all walks of life uh so maybe mine is more typical than atypical but um yeah i i grew up in the midwest i grew up in in davenport iowa and moved to los angeles when i was 16. and while i was in la you know i was playing in bands and i was doing some kind of like web dev stuff building mom and pop shop websites and um you know real long story short went to university to play football quit and stumbled into music um i was in a rap group called swayze that ended up putting out a top 10 album in 2008 which was totally surreal you know i never had a passport before at 23. he was getting to go to europe to play music and in parallel i was building software tools for myself and for other friends and artists who needed things so i've kind of always looked at this intersection of music and technology really media and technology culture industries and technology more broadly and um you know i toured the solar arts the dj after that band produced music a bunch of pop acts played music festivals did all the things that the folks who were kind of doing full-time do and got a phone call from some books of spotify saying hey we need someone that can translate between a bunch of swedish engineers and the music industry and took a job at spotify in uh i think 2011 which seems surreal now and um got to see what it's like to be a part of a massive war and to ship a really incredible product and from there went on to start brad which created little michaela in kind of a modern disney or marble with some virtual celebrities and more recently um you know sorry for the benefits about a year and a half ago and yeah let's explore that bread period a little bit uh what was bread and what was the goal with lil michaela yeah so so um still very much exists though the goal was really to try to create a celebrity and really scalable narrative um yeah those started with this idea that media can be transformative that in my lifetime i had seen more change from you know television programs that have grabbed and kind of created these dominant narratives versus public policy so television programs like will and grace that are largely responsible for gay marriage in the u.s or even like jefferson's or other programs to help shape the way americans understand african americans and so the dream was to say hey in an era with more global issues than ever whether it be economic or climate or pandemic if we could create celebrity and narratives that scale like software that can touch billions perhaps we could kind of nudge the whole world into being more empathetic or more tolerant or more effective at creating the change that we want to realize and do you feel that you achieved that goal with little michaela like what was the impact yeah i mean i still feel like we're in the first inning um thus far we've had a ton of impact i mean 10 million plus fans across socials mckayla's release songs that have been like top of viral charts on spotify globally uh and so across all mediums we're still images to video and audio we've had a ton of impact again like we're just getting started um the bet was really kind of on this emergent folks are calling now the metaverse what i called kind of like spatial computing era this is like next shift in computing and we always saw virtual goods and virtual economies as being a big part of that and so in parallel i i spent a lot of time in in crypto and web3 and you know we were pretty quick to embrace the nft thing and really see decentralized governance and virtual economies as being a big part of enabling that next disney or that next marvel and so we're just getting started we've got a long way ahead of us and decentralizing brad and turning into endow is next so yeah you know as you just mentioned so dapper labs acquired bread and um launched dapper collectives from that so why did you decide to sell bread to dapper and then what is the vision for dapper collectives yeah certainly hey i've been a fan of rohamps for a very long time i often joke that when we were fundraising we'd be like walking into these very serious silicon valley board rooms and pitching like fake people on the internet and i'd always feel kind of guilty but then i'd watch a guy walk out a room who's like pitching selling pictures of cats on the internet and and so we were kind of always the weirdos in these very serious board rooms asking for large sums of money i always felt like he was quite brave yeah i thought that the thing that rohan recognized quite quickly was that most of our world is non-fungible and i thought that was a really unique insight and to double down into work through the bear and to ship a product that onboarded lots of people into crypto and web3 was really really compelling that said you know the acquisition came really from us raising around we were racing around that was going to be a little more crypto focused because we're decentralizing the company and in talking about partners that we wanted to work with we fell in love with flow we wanted to build it on flow they had bigger ambitions than just a you know a single dow on flow i think they and rohan the rest of team understand how impactful this stuff can be and how dows will be at the center of all the stuff going forward and so to have you know really incredible resources people that are really aligned culturally like um i always kind of joke that our our team is a bunch of like soft-spoken really nice brainy people to meet like even nicer canadian versions of us um was really compelling and so all in all i think it allows us to do what we want to do and to build these primitives that other folks can use and really kind of like help shape this future that we all want to see come to pass and so that was why this came together and so what is the vision for dapper collectives like what are you trying to achieve yeah so um you know we're going to be mainstreaming doubts as kind of vague as that sounds the dream is to build the primitives that others can use to recognize and capture the value that they create and and that sounds intentionally vague as well because i think it's really really big the opportunity folks in my world creative people kind of joke about how people selling jpegs for 70 million dollars but i think if you were to start from first principles and say what what is really valuable with life of ours i don't know that you'd start with like equities and bonds you probably start with like art and music and media and food these things give our lives meaning and there's been a lot of obviously rent-seeking middlemen like platforms in the middle of that creative process who've captured a lot of that value and so we think dows can enable you know media companies like our own to recognize and realize that value and to make sure it flows to the edges of the network it also allows us to like bring you know our our fans and our peers really into the fold traditionally they've been siloed there have been disney on one side and then star wars fans on the other and every now and then disney's calling star wars fans to figure out what the weather and tatooine would be like because they have more knowledge than the folks internally at disney and we think you know kind of blowing up those silos and bringing people under one roof and aligning you know aligning incentives so that people can work together could be really really meaningful and and hopefully solve a lot of the pain that's especially felt in media orgs but really in any collective or any organization and so that's why we're thinking about collectives people coming together trying to realize important things and using you know consensus and uh you know web three and the permits that we create to to organize and realize them and so interest in your vision of whatever this future is of all these different taos all these different collectives what will they be doing like what is kind of the variety of different types of dows that you see oh gosh they're endless i mean some of you can probably talk about foreign benefits is kind of an easy answer for that question but i think the really compelling stuff for for people that are especially in our industry in media is you know we have a generation of kind of web to media orgs that are probably quite frustrated i think if you're an employee at vice or at refinery29 you've probably seen some stock options um depreciate tremendously if you're an investor you're probably quite frustrated and if you're an operator you're probably quite frustrated i think that's because there clearly is demand for this media in this content and i don't know there are effective business models one of the things that i've always you know the attention that i've always lived with it's this idea that information wants to be free you know the people and ideas should be able to spread virally and touch people and change the world but at the same time the people that are creating those ideas should be able to make a living and feed themselves and so i think nfts is a primitive solve for that thing you know that they allow people they love ideas they offer media to be both individually ownable and universally accessible and so with that at the center of this potential business uh model can we start to create primitives that incentivize people to you know create those assets participate in creation those assets and then see an outcome that rewards them but also has like funds flow to a treasury that can allow this thing to exist and to continue to expand and so yeah you know in short uh incentivizing people to create media assets and then making sure if they participate in that creation they get a piece of the upside of the sale that media asset as an nft and then fund flow into a treasury that allows us to or any other org to build better tooling and do things better faster cheaper whatever they see fit yeah you are definitely preaching to the choir as a creator and as a journalist whose career started with the internet like i worked at newsweek.com that was my first job and then thewall streetjournal.com and then the new york times.com and i think roughly a decade after i started at newsweek.com newsweek was sold for a dollar so you know to go from yeah this kind of because also the year i started working there was the year that newsweek had been leading this story with monica lewinsky and president bill clinton and so it was kind of like a very cool place to be working then and then just to see that brand kind of collapse um and not because the work wasn't good but just because of how somehow this fallacy that information wants to be free was what the media companies um glommed onto and they were wrong uh you can charge money and people will pay for things that they want so um you know when uh dapper labs acquired bread and they announced separate collectives deprelab ceo roham cara ghostly who you've been mentioning here told decrypt quote the space of dao's is probably the most interesting space to us after nfts and very complementary to the work we're doing both with big brands as well as our own ip so how do you see nfts and daos co-existing or converging or otherwise complementing each other yeah so they're probably really simple obvious ways right like investor dows um you know flamingo dao's other examples people have come together to collect and share on the upside of the nfts that they built or they've created or pardoned me that they've been that they've bought and brought into their dao but beyond that um like i mentioned before i think there are examples where nfts as at the center of a business model that a dao uh is organized around is it is a really important primitive that i think is yet to be unleashed in the world and so we're really thinking about that i often talk about how powerful it is that um you know the d5 folks might be familiar with like a y urn where if you're creating a new strategy for a vault you can participate in the upside of that vault um you know there is a world where you know a dow is putting up bounties for coverage of a certain topic and people are executing against the conversation topic whether it be in video or written form whatever it is and then publishing that you know as an nft and folks are collecting that because it's an important work you know at fwb we sold matthew wells metaverse essay for half a million dollars which is is nuts right like it's it's it's an essay that lives for free on the internet but i think there is obviously a collectible nature to all these things with history people time magazines other important um assets i think you're going to see them get fragmented um i often think of someone like yourself or even like eric weinstein is coming up with neologisms all the time if you could own the first uh clip of a podcast as a catchy phrase as we're all gonna make it or you know something that's become uh a battle cry is that important and collectible i think so and so i think there's a ton of opportunity around taking media and all the things that we're creating on the internet because all of us are creators and allowing people to collect bits of them are parts of them and then as you extend that you know all the things that we're creating and sharing online make us storytellers and so i i think a lot about what we do at broad as kind of being this this kind of uh uber storyteller or uber creator and if we can solve for ourselves there's lots of things that we can kind of hand down to the individual creator or smaller creator to help enable and kind of improve their lives and just on a technical level for the work that dapper collectives is doing will that all be on the flow blockchain or are these products that you'll be building for any chain or how will that work on the back end these are all going to be on flow another reason i'm really excited about adapter is that we are very excited about flow obviously dieter who's spearheading it is is the person that invented the nft and so i think to be with visionary folks who could see the future and help us think about how blockchains can be built such as you know scalable and mainstreamable was a really big part of the decision right so now let's talk about friends with benefits to tell people what that dow is yeah wow it's it's it's so ambitious now it's probably hard to contain in a couple sentences but uh benefits is an ethereum based dao we often talk about a virtual city some people describe it as like a virtual social club um where we've been to some tokens and if you have 75 of them you're allowed to participate in a private discord in our governance and then attend uh live events around the world beyond that the software products and other things that are being developed but the nuts and bolts of it are if you own tokens you get to be a part of this private club or community and participate in shaping its trajectory so at times in the past the entry fee to the highest level of 75 fwb uh was more than ten thousand dollars right now it's like slightly under four thousand what do you say to people who criticize friends with benefits as just being an expensive or exclusive online social club or even chat group i usually say fork it like that to me is is the beauty of web3 is that all these things exist so that people can kind of build their reality that said i can understand how it can be a contentious thing and one of the things that our community has done is create fellowship programs and other programs that make sure that like underrepresented people in the space are part of our community and so my opinions haven't always been in alignment with the community and i think that's the beauty of the dao in my day-to-day life i'm a dictator in in fwb i am just another mere citizen of this virtual city who thinks that you know creating robust sensible boundaries are one of the most important parts to defining a community and i think what what the community has said is we agree-ish like we want there to be boundaries that make us a space where people can have conversations they might be able to have in other places who are in a space where people are challenged and their ideas are elevated but we also want to be a space where anyone who could improve this space can exist and so that's why things like fellowships come to pass that's why we see a lot of people in the community like you know buying uh mmts on zora in fwb so those artists can join other things like that so in short i understand that the concerns i think that the beauty of web 3 is you can fork this stuff and build whatever kind of better thing you want to build and so when you look at the applications for the fellowships what kinds of qualities are you prioritizing that's a great question i mean i wish i could answer it accurately we have a fellowships committee one of the things that's cool about you know fwb is these different subcommittees there are local city groups there's a membership committee that's betting anyone who applies to join and there's a fellowships committee that's actually um you know headed up by a few folks one of them being pat locke who's a very influential artist a dj and producer and those folks are looking for lots of things i think most importantly they're trying to create a community that reflects the real world i think there are you know definitely folks who got a head start but you know women people of color other folks who might not make up the fwb community yet that we can identify and bring in and bring it up to speed we absolutely and at the moment how many members are at that highest tier that's a good question it's constantly evolving usually around 2 000 that are in fwb and hang out i probably shouldn't fire up discord and look now [Laughter] yeah definitely don't want to cause us any technical issues so since fwb votes are one token one vote they can be dominated by whales do you think that model should be changed or are you happy with that model or you know what do you think of that fact yeah and so some some votes are one token one vote other other votes are uh you know one token one account one vote i'm interested in all of these little petri dishes of governance trying lots of different things that's one of the things i'm most excited about in web 3 is we kind of get to speed run yeah wall street and yeah the global art market but like more importantly governance um i've seen some cool things around you know one account one vote that does open you up to civil attacks and some other things and one of the things that we've kind of innovated on that i'm quite proud of is this proof of raper concept where we people that come to our live events they're token gated so if you come out and dance you effectively validated that you're you're a real person and so there's a world where we're throwing enough events we effectively have this like civil proof proof of raver list that we can then have vote on things and so there are lots of trade-offs and i think trying to build novel solutions like throwing fun parties people want to come to where you can kind of validate humanity with honey versus uh with vinegar or another kind of creepier ways that maybe being funded out there people may have talked about on twitter a whole bunch um we can solve some of these things and build better governance models because it's all jump ball right now it's all to be defined and i do know that at the start i think you had somewhere in the ballpark of 10 of all the fwb tokens what what percentage do you have now that's a good question um providing liquidity means il for days and so i don't know i think probably somewhere in the ballpark of five percent um again it fluctuates and is that something that people just you know seem okay with because you are the creator or do you see kind of you know more i guess initiatives to try to democratize things even further i would love for the tokens to be as democratic as possible i think um thus far what we've tried to express to the community i think what they've expressed back is that like we're gonna iterate quickly and change things that don't feel right and so we do these things called seasons so every season we basically come up with a theme and we say hey in the previous quarter previous three months these things went well and these things went poorly and dressings went poorly we're gonna do x and double down when things went well we're gonna do x and so i think one of the things that we've had a lot of success with is not trying to set you know really fixed ways to understand how this thing will look we want to be able to change we want to be able to tweak things we want to be able to build like the most sustainable resilient fwb we can even if it gets started it's kind of a weekend haha project and so what are some of those things that went well and then what are some of the things that you guys have been trying to improve upon yeah i think live events have gone really well you know candidly we've been able to bring in a bunch of really special people alex jang is the mayor of fwb um and he really oversees the day-to-day and he was very bullish on live events i think my crypto history and scars the past have led me to be wary of things that are off chain but there was a clear demand people had built really meaningful relationships in discords and on telegrams and on twitter and they wanted to hang out in person and hug each other and so throwing events that were i think that looked and felt different than a lot of crypto events and you know bringing people together spaces has been incredibly bullish for our community people want to be a part of those things beyond that i would say the fellowships program has been incredibly well received people have really enjoyed that we've tried other things even things as simple as like uh discord channels in in the era of clubhouse when there were lots of really hyped clubhouse like say elon musk in a clubhouse channel or whatever it was we would create these these discord channels people would kind of like chat about it happening in real time and okay fine not that compelling and so we shut it down and forget about it but um you know beyond that every day is an experiment right now some of the people the community are making uh an herba mate drink an fwb branded drink um there's an fwb festival coming to pass so the community takes this thing wherever they want to take it and i have seen that currently uh fwb has a 53 million dollar market cap so i'm assuming that's sort of like what your treasury is um maybe i'm wrong about that that to me i think is is the token price time the amount of tokens that exist so a million tokens times 53 bucks it's probably how coin gecko is getting that and so what what then is the treasury for the dow i need to go look as far as usd terms but uh we did a um i think you may have seen the the community voted on a this was the proper a treasury diversification where andrews norwich pays capital legion others um you know kindred came in and purchased fwb tokens that were locked up in exchange for usdc and so in that treasury you'll find ethereum actually some whale which could be a cool thing to discuss as well is is different at dao's doing treasury diversifications i think to kind of hedge against outperformance of either or kind of larger communities at home and so in our treasury you'll have some whale some ethereum some usdc and maybe some some airdrop coins and wait just describe the whale in more detail yeah so for folks that aren't um aware of whale but early on our journey there weren't a ton of like community tokens and it was largely ourselves and and a whale which was started by uh i believe a pseudonymous character named whale shark who wanted to create this token that um could have a say or participate in all this nft collecting and so whale shark had a ton of really important stuff and we were really excited about the ways they were exploring their community and they actually doing things that were pretty different than what we had done and so um actually cooper truly on our team and whale shark had known each other and they talked about hey maybe we should float to the communities of doing kind of a token swap and so you know we can hold x amount of whale you call x1 fwb and you know that way as this thing plays out we kind of have this this incentive to go support each other and help each other ah okay it's it's interesting um one other aspect of all this that i find fascinating is uh the vcs that you mentioned that now are participating in reason as you mentioned legion a variant fund so what is the purpose of having venture capital involved in this basically like a social club dao you're asking like a very good question and i think one of the questions that the community asked over and over and over again it's like yeah they want to be involved why and so one of the things that was very intriguing for me was traditionally in my life i've had to walk into like a boardroom full of you know 13 you know scary impressive people and pitch them as to why they should give me money and i think for the first time in my life what we had i think the parts of my life we had vcs pitching the community so we had a discord meeting where investors like brian watson from spark chris dixon and steve jang you know tina from pace and others came in and basically made their case and um i don't want to speak on behalf of them but i think some of the things the community really recognized and really resonated with was you know these weren't trading funds that we're gonna like buy tokens and dump on us they're interested in holding these things for you know four to seven years minimum they've got quite a bit of uh expertise in building organizations they know how to navigate some of the things that might come up whether it's hiring a regulatory or xyz and more than anything else i think the community vibed with them which is maybe i don't know how you would build a taxonomy of vibes but like steve steve jang especially had really interesting like good snacks like one of the community asked us what snacks do you guys like throughout the day and so steve his snacks resonated and the community was like we like this guy he gets it we want to give him more um and so look these are some of the novelties and like the interesting things that come up with direct democracy is um you know people having a say and sometimes snacks where to vote wait like you mean like actual physical snacks that he's munching on throughout the day yeah so it's a discord so it can be kind of posty right and people are like okay what do you want to do you guys seem shady i don't know if i should trust you and they dissuaded a lot of those things i think made really compelling cases for how they add value and by the end it was like all right so you guys are saying the right things but as a real litmus test like what do you do on the weekends and you know what what do you what do you enjoy for snacks and you know i i think some people could have said like seeing as that i'm on the carnivore diet and trying to run a 100 mile marathon i only eat you know x y and z but no these are fwb kids and so an appreciation for like japanese kawaii snacks or other rare snacks made them think that these folks were real heads and so yeah having having a good snack game can get you exposure to a dao in this wild wild world we're being afraid i love it i find this hilarious so as you mentioned alexander zhang is dubbed the mayor of fwb and he said actually in an interview that he used to hate crypto and the people in it and i guess he obviously feels very differently about fwb so who are the people that are involved in fwb obviously besides the vcs that we mentioned like just in general kind of the everyday person that's in it like are they people who are normal crypto people are they non-crypto people who just heard about this or like what's the mix yeah i think one of the things that fwb has kind of been known for is having quite a different makeup i would imagine for most of fwb if you were to say you know what's a zero knowledge proof they'd be like i don't really know and i don't know if they're interested i think you know what really spoke to them uh was this world where you could create value for people that are putting it into the ether and so as a result a lot of them are artists a lot of them are musicians a lot of them are folks that have kind of lived adjacent to technology and maybe not in it full-time um and then there is a good cross-section of like pure technologists i think one exposure to people they wouldn't find at like a you know a traditional crypto conference some of the most vibrant channels in fwb are like the parenting and skin care channels um and so you know the the the selfies and fits channels like as much as nft general chat goes off people are as interested in figuring out how to be better parents and there's something about the signal-to-noise ratio in a group of people that all have ownership in a thing that really kind of increases the signal and reduces the noise and so there's all kinds of little magic this stuff has cooked up that i can't put my finger on and definitely can't take credit for but i think one of them really is a high signal to noise ratio in all of these little subsets and little mini burrows inside of our virtual city huh yeah i guess the way you're talking it sort of makes me think of like how people have their crypto sorry their twitter lists and if you could just kind of like have that one contained list as its own you know chat group that then has its own channels i guess yeah that's sort of what it's like anyway all right so what i was looking for like a group chat like if you had hugged most of those people in that twitter list and there was kind of some um there were some kind of like real interactions that kind of tied you all together and made you want to go above and beyond responding to how to help a child that's teething that that's how i would describe it okay yeah yeah because yeah it starts offline but yeah you're right then or online but then it goes offline which i find very interesting and fun all right so in a moment we're going to talk about some of the questions around fwb uh but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show

that fwb could be a security because just like based on the definition of a security is applied to crypto tokens if it's an investment contract with the expectation of profits dependent on the efforts of an identifiable party then wouldn't that the value of this token fwb be determined by the group members of fwb uh it's a good question and probably one i would leave up to the lawyers but you know in our understanding in our talking with lawyers so really what we're but we're you know offering is a ticket right and so a ticket into the club and you know oftentimes tickets have like secondary speculative value but they all kind of have this utility of coming into the club and so i'm definitely not a lawyer and this is not legal advice or financial advice or whatever other disclaimer i'm supposed to give but i've talked to some and that's how they describe it and so then when fwb is like trying to figure out what it's going to do or not do are there any particular activities that the group either tries to discourage or stay away from in order to not cross any of those lines yeah certainly i mean it's a very common thought like hey we should start a fund from fwb and we're you know pretty quick to be like hey that probably feels like a regulatory no-no i i don't think that we want to be in the business of that and so we don't do that i think what we try to do is like throw events and some of those events happen on discord and some of them have been irl but um you know having those tickets in the form of tokens allows you to participate in those things and so fpb did recently publish a post on its plans for 2022 and one of the more interesting aspects was you mentioned you're going to have an fwb directory can you describe that and also the technology that will enable that yeah and really i should have like mike bodge and dexter and others when the product team speak to that uh more accurately because i'll probably flub it here but at the core of it is like we have a lot of interesting folks um you know uh throughout the years anyone from virgil abloh to holly herndon uh you know is participating in conversation i think the idea that you could more accurately find these folks engage with them and figure out things to collaborate on it's always been compelling it's quite tricky with the kind of limited service area you have inside of discord and building discord bots but beyond that i think you know reputation on chain is important and people are thinking a lot about that and so we have an opportunity to kind of create a membership directory that says hey here are the things that i've expressed that i'm great at and here are things that i participated in here are things that um you know my on-chain activity says i have like the only expertise in and then allow folks to connect dots and try to do cool stuff together i think that's actually one of the cool things one of the cool things to me is you know stuff like sound uh that xyz the music entity platform largely born out of fwb people hanging out and meeting in there and saying hey we should build stuff and so it'd be amazing if you could facilitate more of those interactions and create more teams and partnerships to go build cool stuff yeah something that i thought was so cool is that the identity badges are non-transferable nfts and they'll just dynamically evolved based on the activity is that like an automated thing or is it must be automated if it's based on your activity yeah and i imagine part of it will be automated maybe some manual stuff as well um candidly badge and decks have been kind of chipping away at that and i haven't been nearly as involved as i should be in that product stuff but um i can do a little follow up with you and send you some notes i imagine a lot of it will be automatic as a sign-on chain and there's probably pretty simple ways to structure those things yeah i i just i think it was really cool so you know we've been talking about kind of like issues of exclusivity inclusivity and obviously recently in the news there were tweets by one of your co-founders cooper turley uh these were nine-year-old tweets and so he was probably about 16 at the time he made the tweets but they did express racist and homophobic sentiments and fwb ended up announcing that it was removing him for a minimum of two seasons i did notice there were a lot of critical comments on the twitter announcement calling the thread sanctimonious criticizing fgb for punishing him for actions from almost 10 years ago or saying things like the these punishments abounded to cancel culture what's your response you know i you know never want to speak on behalf of fwb but i think you know what i was really proud of is that fwb had plans in place for any of these kind of things the code of conduct that was built by uh members that could participate in the community made a decision and that was that now as far as me personally um you know i can't really speak to the you know how the comments be interpreted as being homophobic but as far as the racist stuff people i think are the things people really are upset with were him using the n-word you know saying in tweets and as a black person i know cooper extremely well i've known him for years and there's not a racist bone in his body you know stupid white kid say n words because he likes listening to rap music in my opinion absolutely yes and i think what i wanted to see happen was someone who made some big mistakes pay their debts and then get reintegrated into a community that can contribute to to make it better for a lot of those marginalized groups and i think that's why any of us or a lot of us do this stuff is we see an opportunity to help people that could use that help and cooper while he can write some like silly tweets um you know as people people said all these kind of fortune cookie tweets where he's talking about how taos are going to change the world and maybe hyperbolic the young person who i think really believes a lot of those things and so what i'd love to see is cooper pay his debts get back and get involved and contribute and help people and i think that's the path that he's on and i'm proud of fwb for setting the tone and creating a playbook that hopefully others can use and improve to make sure that we all feel safe and that we all feel heard and we all want to participate inside of this thing that we're all co-co-creating yeah and i the homophobic part came from i think a coindesk article but they didn't actually show those tweets so maybe that was misinformation or something um but i think it was correct he was using you know an f word a slur that you know i didn't want to speak on it because you know i'm not queer i don't persuade that community and i don't want to interpret how it would have been felt by others who are but uh as far as the racism stuff goes i can speak to that okay so kind of on the same note i did say that back when you were with brad doing lil michaela new york magazine reported that brad only accepted venture capital from firms with a woman or person of color in a position to write them a check the magazine also said that you and your then co-founder sarah de cou said that you hoped that the impact you would have was similar to the impact of well yeah you mentioned this earlier will and grace um and i obviously i'm very well aware uh as a woman uh myself and as a woman of color that the crypto and nft space have been criticized as not being very diverse so what do you think can and should be done about that i mean to me the best thing to be done is onboarding and kind of hand holding as many people as you possibly can into the space i think the demographics are such that if you go out and you bring in the best people the most talented people you can find uh you know you're going to be identifying people of color and women because they're really freaking talented and so one of the things that often people talk about is like how difficult um user interfaces are for a lot of these things and i think you know that can be kind of paternalistic in that the idea that people can't pick these things up if they're you know kind of shown how to do it to me is incorrect and i think it actually facilitates really nice each one teach one dynamic so what i often do is you know just sit down with people and show them how to get onboard into web3 here's how to install metamask here's how to install phantom you know here's how to like figure out what this crazy flow blockchain is what we're building how to buy a top shot and i do a lot of that stuff um i think that's the kind of tactical on the ground stuff but beyond that i think some of the stuff that we've done you know at dapper and fwb by creating products that are that are you know maybe more compelling to folks outside of traditional finance or technology whether it's buying nba highlights or coming to parties is a great way to pull people into this pipeline and get them involved yeah that's true yeah because it's it's just like more integrated into kind of their normal activity whereas i feel like some of the more financial stuff it like just feels a little bit overwhelming for kind of an average person certainly intimidating so you have such an interesting background i mean we we only you know glossed over at the beginning but because you have so much experience in the music space and with you know friends of yours who kind of started out as you know just an everyday person who then became household names as musicians i wanted to ask you you know what your thoughts were about this passion economy or creator economy and before we actually get into this question can you just define those terms as you see them oh man um so i largely attributed to legion who's defined this kind of like passion and creator economy and as i understand it when it was originally defined it really was designed to represent creators who are now trying to build businesses around their output in ways that the kind of more mainstream platforms wouldn't have enabled instagrams tick tocks youtubes of the world um i'll just talk stuff like patreon only fans sub stack and i kind of see them as like web 2.5 there's like these interstitials where it was clear that consumers and fans wanted to buy things directly from creators they liked and there weren't very effective tools for doing so um i think what we've seen with web3 is the evolution of that where it's like yeah i want to buy something from this creator that i love but i also want to have you know ownership of that object i like to be able to have a say in you know what this person is doing and i think that's what people are expanding on now it's become such a compelling experience that you've seen communities whether it's you know it's board apes or fwb or whale sharks whatever it is really really pay attention and then you'll move quite quickly and so what problems do you think that this technology will solve for creators and kind of what are some of the more creative things that you uh expect to see them do that wasn't possible with web 2 or even 2.5 yeah i mean i would say the really exciting things i'm pumped on are like creators being able to buy a home or start a family things things that should not be crazy um just get back to square one be able to make a living uh it's it's a sad reality that a lot of our favorite creators are really skating by and are really on this treadmill where they have to crank out enough output to stay top of mind so they can capture attention and platforms can still attend to get that intention and they can get a small cut what i'm looking forward to is people creating interesting economies i often joke that when i was first playing in vans like hardcore bands um you know we had to decide between a drummer who was 16 and like not very good at playing the drums and jordan who was 14 and really good at playing the drums but none of us could drive and the 16 year old could drive and so we had to make a decision and there were trade-offs and we we brought him into the band and we were able to like play other places i often think that like you know creators down the road are going to see someone like blau someone who has a traditional finance background you can think really uniquely about the economies he can build around his own you know dj and his music and think man as part of our band as part of our team you know maybe we need public relations but maybe more importantly we need like a community manager with like tokenomics shops who can help us think about how we can take our output and build economies against it such that we can not only survive but thrive and so i think you're going to see the makeup of creative organizations and bands and creators change as people recognize there's a lot of value to be captured here if they have the tools and the know-how to realize it and what are some of the things that you feel that technology could do someday for creators that are not yet possible that you know you hope would be developed i guess in the next year or two yeah i think in the next year or two you're definitely going to see like narratives that are not only you know a precipitory but you know potentially shaped by fandoms um so you can imagine a world where a spiderman comic is being unveiled panel by panel and choose your own adventure style way governance token is deciding the outcome of this narrative um i also think allowing communities to participate inside of your media something i'm pretty excited about so oftentimes there are youtubers that are finding editors and i think there's ways to engage the community participate in the edit of what they're doing and as that you know asset performs well having them participate in sharing some of that value and upside uh and then the really simple stuff i think there's opportunities for nfts to create markets for creative works that otherwise might not have had markets so um my friend david rudnick talks a lot about poetry and i couldn't agree more you know i think we live in a world where like the the value that poets create is really not reflected in their quality of life or the way they live and so i think the idea that i could participate in kind of collecting poet poetry or different written text and you know i could potentially uh you know speculate the time horizon this 30 to 100 years versus you know the really kind of short windows we have now an attention economy where we don't know if vine will be here tomorrow or if or flicker will be here tomorrow i think really changes the game and so the major themes for me are creating economies around markets and markets for things that otherwise wouldn't have had them like poetry or contemporary dance choreography or whatever you'd like and then the flip side of that is allowing capital to think with longer time horizons because we have decentralized networks that are going to exist for far longer than flickr or any of the other kind of like graveyards of digital media companies and so for the poetry and you mentioned music and also the choreographed dance moves like what does that look like obviously the nfts that have taken off so far really tend to be visual you know either art or video so what do what what do nfts look like when it's applied to something different like poetry or dance yeah i mean i think it's going to take a market maker to come out and and signify that these things have value but you know the pose you wanted to meet is is pretty straight ahead they're platforms like zora that allow you to mint text and then um you know collect and trade that text if someone is able to create a work um you know and have that work gain a ton of cultural significance and that work has some provenance on chain i imagine people are going to want to collect that and i think you know the kind of really obvious ways i imagine the kind of point of entry will be you know kind of mean neologisms whether it's stuff like we're all going to make it or you know you got rugged or things that feel more crypto native than expanding out into you know whatever 2023's equivalent of bling bling is right like these these these slang terms that like capture and kind of like rise from cultural zeitgeist into becoming mainstream and if you can kind of collect that and own that i imagine it would inspire others to come up with other phrases or ideas collectible as far as contemporary dance i mean it's clear that like dance trends on tiktaka are really important if you're someone who's able to shape that if you're someone who's working out a ballet who's doing really impressive works i'd like to hope that in the near future people recognize how important that stuff is and they want to put it inside of their wallet because it will become a status symbol of a different kind and they can play status games that maybe have a a more historical bent than an astronaut floating through space or whatever like is trending now on openc and you know obviously you did work at spotify so what do you kind of see happening when you look at something like sound xyz which you mentioned before you know it like an nft version of music gaining popularity against the current models for consuming music i i love folks at spotify and i love dan and i think like what i'm excited about in music and mts is just another outlet for creativity i think you've seen certain artists really thrive the kind of billy eylishes of the world who have made music that's kind of genreless that can live across playlists that is built for kind of a a certain type of listening experience i think in tick-tock you've seen the same um these mediums allow for certain artists to thrive and what's great for me is i often you know while at spotify we talk about how myself as an artist i always knew that i had fans that would spend you know maybe one or two that spent ten thousand dollars on a release and i'm sure plenty that would spend nothing on it but by you know charging the same fee for all of them there are probably some inefficiencies there right and so i think what you're seeing is more experimentation it's going to allow for artists to find different ways to capture as much of the value they can in the work they're creating and so out of all the different kind of nfts at the moment what are your favorites or which ones are you watching uh i mean i'm a huge fan of the folks at catalog i think they're doing really great stuff and they have a really great curatorial ear as far as music entities go sound i'm i'm very inspired by as well and i guess you know disclaimer investor in both um primarily because we're all talking about how to solve this music pain point especially in real time um there's a marketplace on the solana forum function i'm really pumped on i kind of see it as like an etsy you know a kind of more indie space for artists to create work that otherwise might feel out of place contextually and like an open sea or a swarm of pfp projects or something like that um you know and beyond that like huge fans of the coordinate team i think thinking about different models for compensating people is a really fun design space we're all working in different ways i don't know that getting a check every two weeks is the standardized is like the way it needs to look um so anyone who's thinking about that stuff people who are saying hey here are norms that were created in the industrial era i think we're doing things differently now maybe we could approach this piece differently as well so it's really wide open and that's like that's the joy and and maybe kind of the pain of web3 is just trying to keep up and all these novel ideas and trying to make sense of what's real and what's graft so obviously after this last fall seeing the constitution dow just kind of come up out of nowhere catch on very quickly i think a lot of people are expecting to see a lot more interesting and crazy initiatives out of daos this coming year what are your thoughts on where you think dao's could go this year yeah i think you know i'm i'm intrigued heading into some midterm elections in the states how people will think about using dows to potentially shape public sentiment or have influence in the outcomes of political elections um you know i've been impressed watching coin center and seemingly unknown lobbyists in dc uh uh raise awareness about crypto and web3 and i think as folks recognize that there's a couple trillion dollars that have flowed into this new influential group of young people primarily they might want to kind of bend their their will towards those folks uh and so i think you know there's a lot of discontent and you know latent discontent in this country that could be mobilized by engaging with with the web through community and so that's one thing i'm excited about for dallas is you know governance informing macro governance um especially around things like climate that i'm quite passionate about beyond that i do think the the the kind of not so novel ability to raise dollars quite quickly for causes whether it be buying a constitution or other things isn't going away anytime soon and so i think you'll see more attempts to raise dollars to do really novel things i'm hoping it lends itself more towards like open sourcing dialysis versus like i don't know buying rare video games but that's the kind of stuff that i'm really excited about for dallas is like governance thinking about new future of work stuff and then if you're going to like pool a bunch of dollars can you use them effectively to create real world impact huh well like yeah when you talk about the dialysis thing i mean i guess that would assume some kind of specialized knowledge or or working with people who have that specialized knowledge so is it just more like a fundraising effort to then connect to the right people or like what would something like that look like i think that's you know one of the major challenges right like but when we get in the kind of bio these are all hypothetical um and far outside my pay grade i think we've joked about on twitter like you know buying the rights to um you know medications and open sourcing them um through dao's but there are all kinds of challenges in in that and bringing it to practice in real life but i think pooling capital it is it you know it seems quite silly to folks in crypto because ethereum flies around mozart's fly around for zombie jpegs every day but being able to pull that capital is often one of the most difficult parts of realizing any of these kind of more outlandish uh moonshot ideas and so if you can kind of drum up support and you have these giant coordination mechanisms like twitter or something with a with a layer of capital on top of them you can do more than just you know show up and like flash dance and like a flash mob and like early 2000s you actually can like put that capital together and like try to change something systemically and so that's that is directionally what i'm thinking about it would be identifying talent hiring them and realizing things it could be as simple as saying hey that's a really rare illness and you know the medication cost ten thousand dollars a pill and we could probably buy it fifty million dollars and maybe only helps 100 people a year but change their lives so you know i you know that's the kind of stuff that's far outside of of my pay grade but i think the ability to pull capital is meaningful and novel and i think it feels um you know it doesn't feel quite that novel to us we've been in web for a long time but folks outside of it it's a big deal and finally for social tokens which i think are very relevant creators what are you kind of looking forward to this coming year like where do you think those are going yeah i mean there are seemingly lots of platforms and protocols that are that are you know taking on i think with what a lot of folks always talk about which is like you know the stock market for rappers or whatever it is there is there is you know some substitution demand for speculating around talent or kind of having allowing folks to participate in markets they understand you know probably better than like a goldman sachs executive um i do think that nfts have an opportunity to kind of like step on into the community tokens for looking turf and maybe shape what that looks like as well you kind of see some of that with the pfp projects where if you hold an nft you need to participate inside of discords and other kind of like governance in a different way and where i'm kind of most intrigued is is seeing how people can extend some of these certain benefits on chain versus kind of the easy stuff you know irl i think it's great to say if you hold this up and you come backstage forever but i like to see people kind of extend and maybe challenge themselves such that like hey if i live in the right regulatory environment can i allow you guys to participate in the creation of this tour and the upside of the ticket sales um but that's all you know pipe for me stuff we'll see if that comes to pass all right well this has been such a fascinating conversation where can people learn more about you and your work oh man i'm generally just kind of like trolling and posting on the internet but if you want to participate in some of that it's w-h-a-t-d-o-t cb what dot c-d on on most of them and then um yeah if you want to email me you can just do trevor.mcfedris at dapperlabs.com perfect all right well thank you so much
