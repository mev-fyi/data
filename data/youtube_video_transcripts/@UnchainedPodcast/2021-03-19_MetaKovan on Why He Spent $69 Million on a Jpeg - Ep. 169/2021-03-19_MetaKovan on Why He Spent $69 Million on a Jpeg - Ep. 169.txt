founder and financier of metapurse welcome medicoven thank you laura thank you for having me so you purchased a collection of 5 000 pieces of digital art that anyone can easily see online for 69 million dollars why did you do that um i get this a lot these days definitely so uh actually this this has been um this trend of of nfts is is something that's very new but you know nft itself is not and uh i've been like in nft since 2017 uh we've been focused on you know understanding and and seeing what what what these nfts mean in the larger context and so we develop various thesis around you know like how how we look at this and what what is this going to do to the world and so we've been doing several purchases over now two three years right and we've been into our collectibles uh virtual land uh art from various artists and so by by december last year what really caught my uh attention was the fact that you know like art uh coming into crypto and and creating this cultural movement is causing a new set of people to come into the space right like artists need not be technical they they you it's almost like you take your skill in in 2014-15 maybe you should have your tech skill or your computer skill and then that's how you mine for ethereum right like our bitcoin and now if you are skilled in some other way you're good in say adobe illustrator or something you get your chance to mine your ethereum right like that's that's that's something of how i see it so and it's very nice because we are we are allowing so many new people to enter and what happened was we had a greater thesis on understanding what these nfts mean and how these artists will become more valuable in the future so people was one of them who we thought is going to be the artist of our generation he has all the parameters um which which make him one of the most precious artists and it's a bet right like i'm not saying we paid the right amount or we know exactly what we were doing right but what i'm trying to say is it's it's a it's a bet on the fact that people is going to be the artist of our generation and so can you fill out that thesis around nfts and this virtual world a little bit more and also explain why it is that people you felt really fit all this pre these parameters that you're looking for sure so nfts are if you take um art digital art and and that's backed by an nft i would say it's 10x better than the physical physical counterpart again physical counterpart have history right like i'm not i'm not taking that away from them but think about something that's done today right like what i'm saying is you like if you if you take it for cost a lot of people compare like oh yeah like mona lisa is worth so much yeah it is worth so much but it's not the paint that's worth so much right like it's it's a skill uh it's it's it's the story it's the it's the painter itself it's there are a lot of other parameters that that is not just what tools or you know the paint the cost of the pain that went into something so there is a lot of you know subjective value here so that same subjective value can carry to the digital realm i don't think that's going to you know that's going to be the question the the harder question is is is is this not replicable right like can we not copy paste etc but in the case of people the beauty is that there is a story right like he's he's a he's an artist a digital artist who has been very um i would say i want to use the word honorable because that's where we're going in terms of artists and nfts because that's how you if you are an artist and you want to make sure you you are relevant in into the future i think you need to be a honorable person right like you need to be understand scarcity you need to understand your collectors you need to make sure that you're not you're not here to like grab some people like cash from people so what people did was he has worked over 5 000 years every day right like he worked on the day he was getting married he worked on a day he had a child right 5000 days yeah 5 000 days yeah sorry if i said something else 5000 days every day and and that's very inspiring to me and if you look at the whole this christie's piece the first picture is so amateurish it's it's something i can draw right like a 10 year old can draw and the and and the latest latest one is something that's so complex and and if you take the whole thing together it's an inspiration to tell people uh to tell the world that the only thing that's unhackable is time and if you put in your put in effort every day you would be successful and just out of curiosity how would this be different if there was an artist who worked on one piece of art for 13 years and then presented it like and even by that i mean it doesn't have to be a visual art it could be like a book or a movie or you know whatever and um do you do you understand what i'm saying like like in a way it's almost like um similar to when you go to a museum and you see that the artist has done a bunch of sketches before they did the final painting like in a way it's almost like these are i don't i don't even know how to describe them but um i don't want to call them exercises but what you can do in a day versus what you can do in a year that's quite a different thing right so i just wonder how would you value a piece of art like that i i would um if speaking to people and understanding his um ideology and and his kind of work what inspired me really is is like he sets a bar very low bar for every day right like each day what he wants to put out there is not a ma like it's not his master work it's yeah you have to put out something and and that's very inspiring to me it's like going to the gym every day right like we all say we want to but we never do right like we we have to show up and that's all it matters if you if we think about it so yeah like someone working over 13 years is still very awesome to create one piece of art but what is the proof of work that they worked every day on it right maybe they skipped the weekend we don't know right and what's beautiful about people is he put out all of these pieces over time right like and we are from the we are from the crypto industry and we understand proof of work that way and so there is some evidence right on the internet which says this people actually did what he's saying he did so that's very important too and well so then i also do want to ask though you know and i mean i know that i kind of asked this before but since people can still see these online and they don't need to have spent 69 million dollars to do so so what do you think that you actually bought with that money yeah so that's the thesis of nfts itself so when i was saying nfts are you know 10x better than the physical counterpart one of the things which i which i really like about nfts is the fact that you know it's composable you we should understand that it's very similar to another like like d5 protocols are awesome because they're composable right and in the same way nft is just on the ethereum blockchain if you think about it now we can do hundreds of things about about them like for example a physical art is maybe owned by one person or or say three four people like i don't know if three four people will want to own uh physical and it's it's like it's it has that feeling of of being owned by one person and kept in one location right so what happens is it's we we recognize a few historical physical art which through how relevant they are like mona lisa most of the world's population has not seen modern lisa in person but they recognize it right like how how did that happen that's because of a picture and most people it most people don't believe that they own it right like it does not destroy the value of the physical piece itself just because i have a copy of monoliths on my in my computer or it's pasted all over the internet right in the same way what the nft does is that it gives that it packs the whole story into it the if if it's if it's this piece it packs the fact that people worked on it for 13 years it packs the fact that people actually minted this on this time and it packs the fact that we actually bought it at this time and all of this goes to the nftn and the blockchain right and and all this prominence and everything which which was historically the auction house's major uh job and and what they used to take the maximum cost for it's all gone because they are all very simply recorded and now using that because we can pull them into various composable stuff uh maybe there could be fractionalization that that can just be done right like we you can take a um nft and then divide them into say 100 million uh tokens and then sell them right like i like i'm not planning to do that with with this particular piece at least yet but that's a that's an option i have right and that's that that was never that's not a easy option if it's a physical art right we have to make sure in in the physical world that becomes a security if you think about it because you have to trust the person to store it properly right and in in the case of nfts it's on chain it'd be on the smart contract the only risk is the smart contract getting hacked but that's always going to be there but you know like you don't have to trust the issuer of the token that the nft is actually backing the token right right so we're going to dive a little bit more into what gives these nfts value and and how people are creating value from them but first a quick word for the sponsors who make this show possible with over 10 million users crypto.com is the easiest place to buy and sell over 90 cryptocurrencies grow your crypto

description back to my conversation with meta coven so um i also just wanted to flesh out a little bit more of what your vision of the meta verse will look like in the future and even just describe metaverse and and then you know describe what you expect that will look like so metaphors is not very different from what uh crypto like people in crypto we've been experiencing something of this global uh community for a while now right like we like i i feel like uh the ethereum conferences itself is a very inspiring one where it never happens in one place it never happens in one country and and that's very inspiring because if you are part of the ethereum community what you know is that if you attend all dev cons probably you you also get to go around the world right and probably with the money you made with ethereum yeah so that's very interesting right like as a as a experience and being part of the community now what i feel about metaverse is that we're just um like that that word might feel like very futuristic and and a little bit more very confusing but think about like there is there is this 3d metaverse also which is being created like in the virtual worlds and and that's where we are building museums etc but there is this 2d world also like this card for example is where you know there are new communities that that's not purely technical so with the crypto and the uh defy up to the defy uh you know like the the growth i think we had a lot of technical people move into crypto but right now we have other kinds of people artists uh singers uh you know performance uh artists like different kinds of people uh with different talent they are all moving in and and forming their own communities right and that's very interesting if you if you think about what it implies and that means that we are creating this online community allowing the creation of online communities of like-minded people and then this will translate into physical things law so instead of you know going to the boring i don't know like i'm just kidding but you know going to the boring technical devcons maybe at some point there'll be more entertaining ones right like that all was created online right so i feel like the metaverse is is just going to complement what's happening in the physical world and i i don't imagine too much of a dystopian world where we just start living in metaverse like a ready player one at least yet and i don't want to live in that world either yeah exactly i don't know in a sense that i like the metaphors but you know you get to use only two of two or three of your senses and and that's not very cool right like so the physical world still times the metaverse definitely at least we're not there yet so i guess meta versus is just a way for you to meet like-minded people and get them on to the physical world and so for you you go by a pseudonymous name and for the for the people who are watching the video they'll see that you're using an avatar and not showing your face why why not just be open about your identity um actually um um th this this is a very deep question also i i'm it's not like um people who work with me or people in the community a lot of them actually know me right like because end of the day if i go to a conference we're going to meet each other in person right so a lot of a lot of us who meet each other are like okay yeah like this is this is who we are in real real life and this is what i did before i became metacoman and i'm also quite comfortable and probably with all this media attention um it's it's harder to keep this you know under wraps because there is always some kind of leakage right like so it gets out but the fact is that this specific character over time creates this very interesting connection for me with the community you know the real person in me feels very differently than this character now where metacon how he's received and and the other guy who how he's received right like i could be the same guy inside but i'm very different to people and and if i if i come on another podcast and be the other guy i don't know i don't know if you would ask the same questions also right like it'll be a very different podcast and and i i told this to someone maybe the real guy would not have bought the 69 million dollar pick but mata cohen did right and and that's very important because you know he's already living in the metaphors and i feel like right now i'm operating that character right in the future it could be someone else or a team who could operate it too this is becoming such a an interesting conversation one thing i've heard is in another interview you said that you came to crypto with nothing and so i was curious to hear how did you make so much money in crypto like what was it that you did in such a short period of time and then what made you feel comfortable spending so much of it on something that other people many other people don't even think has value yeah this is the this is the question for the real guy right because meta code came in rich and he's just feeling the other guy's money now now the thing is that when i started in crypto um 2013 um i i yeah i had no money and and and this community was so open right now maybe we feel after especially after the ico thing there is a lot of you know like um like suspect right like people we are we are thinking about other people and and thinking what's their intention right but but back in 2013 people are like yeah come on come on because there is no one uh building anything on on bitcoin right so i started back then when it was people were you know like wanting to create that community very welcoming and and that's what got me started i i started on forums you know like like i i used to you know create some kind of service so that you know i can i can make a little bit of money and and that grew with the industry and and and my life also slowly grew and and i became part of um the larger uh bitcoin community and with when ethereum came up i was lucky enough to have the knowledge that there's going to be a crowd sale and and why that crowd sale was important and i got to invest in that right so a little bit of the money it's not a lot meaning in the larger context but that was my starting point where i i invested a little bit of money into ethereum that taught me that you know this was a huge opportunity where it's like investing in a startup right be a lot of people who are who who think about ethereum's growth as as something that's very unnatural but ubers hoover was 100 billion dollars square is 100 billion dollars right like it's just that it allowed a lot of people to make money and not not like 5 10 people that that's that's that's good right and i think i carried the same attitude in terms of investments into the other uh trends so i always understood trends i i worked on crypto every day and and i understood trends and and i saw uh new projects for what they are researched and and i i and i did take my ethereum and and start you know snowballing them into into the other important uh protocols polkadot uh you are up to flow uh till now so it's been it's been a continuous process for me so that's my uh like that takes 33 of my time right like i i read and i talk to people and make sure i'm up to date because it's very hard to do that too so that's that's one of the thing that's one of the guys behind it right but you know what i like and the other question you asked of how what gave me you know the the strength to spend this money right that's a very different question because for a guy who had no money in 2013 you know like what gives him the strength because i could have i could be doing hundred other things i don't know i don't know if i i'd be doing 100 other things actually the money that came to me came from crypto and i feel like it's it's great that i'm able to do that do the same thing you know change someone's life in in a very inspiring way and and that inspiration could you know touch millions of people now right like it's in the mainstream it's it's going to bring a lot of artists into nfts and they're going to make their first thousand dollars first five thousand dollars just like i did in 2013 and we'd be there too like we are not just buying people's we're buying every artist and we're spending we spent around you know like we spent a lot of money not just on the big names the stars but we are using stars for the headlines and we've been supporting you know all new artists that are interesting and they understand what this system is and and um they're from different parts of the world you know this is their first leg up and that's what i enjoy and when you say we are you talking about metapurse yeah yeah and just quickly like a yes or no did you have any background in art before you started doing this i i didn't have any background in finance economics art before i started crypto everything crypto teaches us everything wow okay so can you briefly describe your vision for metaperson also tell us about the b20 token we're running out of time but i obviously want to be sure to touch on these things sure sure so um like metapus itself i i start again i i just started it out on my own right like it i met okay so i started collecting nfts on my own and it was just an hobby i didn't think too much about it but then when i uh when when two badour who's who's the steward of metabolisu who actually is the art collector in in our team uh he he i i saw him very interested in in all these things and he he built his own name he's a good writer and and he he had his own social network with the artists i was like yeah this is very interesting i like i'm i'm deploying capital why don't you do that right like and and we we thought okay let's let's have a um let's have a name for this and that became metapos right so i consolidated all my nfts into it and we we we instead of slowing down we really uh pushed the gas and and we've been doing this uh like since i think july uh last year and it's been going very well right so what what now happens with metaphors is that we we collect various artists that's that's on one side but with once in a while i also try to think about the thesis of metaverse and see how i can push it forward so one of them where when people's second drop came out when he had 20 pieces right and we were thinking the first the first uh prop went for sixty six thousand dollars and i was thinking okay it'll be very interesting if we could buy all the pieces right like and we could we could create a museum out of it and so that it'll be interesting because it will it will attract that kind of attention and and curiosity from a lot of people so we tried doing that it was hard the story is in multiple other podcasts but you know it it created this uh like news uh cycle where you know it was it was true buddhist conviction uh in in me which also made it happen but we bought the 20 pieces built the museum and and what we did was we took the land the museum designs the art the the soundscape in the museum all together and put it in a smart contract bundle them together and then created tokens 10 million tokens and then sold a lil like around 40 of it right so the whole experience was very interesting because it didn't involve any accountants right like if i did it in the real world i imagine it's very similar to creating a mall right like i would have spent 30 of the funds on just that but this was very interesting and and we didn't like because it was an experiment we didn't even price it like you know 10x or something which um like uh we we price it at 30 premium so that you know we can cover our cost but that's it and uh like to to to to make like to be transparent i've not sold any of my b20 tokens that i kept and that's been a question that's going around also so it's it's not like i i sold my b20 in order to purchase this people it's it's all new money right right we we're going to hold on to the b20s for a while okay yeah because obviously i'm sure you saw the criticism that the christie sale brought a brought positive press to people and nfts and then that boosted um your stake and be in the b20 token so um okay well this obviously it i mean this is just such a fascinating conversation because i really feel like in a way what you're talking about is so new that a lot of people can't grasp it and yet at the same time i'm not quite sure if the reason is because it's not going to go anywhere so so i think we're i think we're going to have to have you on in the future and we will see what happens between now and then okay i really like i'm a fan of your podcast and i really like how you're very frank right like you're to the point so yeah i would ever enjoy being in the podcast again great yeah well this was super fun thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed yeah thank you thank you don't forget next up is the weekly news recap [Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline crypto exchanges race to go public
