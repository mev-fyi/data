engineering attack that saw four of sky mavis run validators and a third party validator run by axidao compromised the news comes just a few months after the wormhole bridge announced a similar reimbursement funding round from jump crypto following a 300 million exploit in the aftermath ronan bridge will be upgrading its security which previously relied on only five out of nine validator confirmations for a transaction to go through according to a sky mavis blog post the new validator group will be upped to 21 validators in the next three months split amongst various stakeholders rather than just sky mavis ronin bridge which was shut down in the aftermath of last week's hack will go live after a round of upgrades and audits that could take weeks meanwhile binance will be supporting each withdrawals and deposits from ronin interestingly the 56 000 each drained from axidao will not be fully reimbursed by binance or sky mavis's balance sheet instead sky mavis explained the 56 000 each compromised from the axidak treasury will remain under collateralized as sky mavis works with law enforcement to recover the funds if the funds are not fully recovered within two years

security and efficiency for the chain fun fact the launch of tarot was on april 5th aka satoshi's birthday the same day that roosevelt ordered u.s citizens to return gold worth more than 100 for fiat

revealing the critical bug the sec approved a new bitcoin etf but the u.s securities and exchange commission approved a new bitcoin futures etf from nazi arca and to cream on wednesday as reported by coindesk bloomberg senior etf analyst eric baltunis called it a good sign regarding the approval of a spot bitcoin etf because previous bitcoin futures etfs were approved under the investment company act of 1940 while the nazi arca and tukrim atf is the first bitcoin futures etf to gain approval from the sec under the securities act of 1933. this is a market change according to an early january thread from bloomberg's james seifert the approval of an etf under the 1933 act would hinder some of the sec's arguments against spot bitcoin etfs due to cme futures not being of significant size subject to manipulation etc interestingly seafort notes that the pricing methodology for futures and spot bitcoin etfs will be the same meaning the features that sec has approved are based on the pricing from exchanges that they say are subject to manipulation in related sec crypto news sec chair gary gensler called for further sec oversight on stable coins in a speech on april 4th the three
