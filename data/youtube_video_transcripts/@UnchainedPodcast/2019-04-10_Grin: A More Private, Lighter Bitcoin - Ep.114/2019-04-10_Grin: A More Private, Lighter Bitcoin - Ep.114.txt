cryptocurrency anti money laundering regulations go global are you ready avoid stiff penalties are blacklisting by deploying effective anti money laundering tools for exchanges and crypto businesses the same tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy my guests today are Daniel Lindbergh and Michael kortner 14 members of grin welcome Daniel and Michael hi Laura hi how are you Daniel why don't we start with you tell the story of nimble wimple the technology that spawned grin for listeners who don't know the tale like bitcoins origin story it has a mystery at its core that makes the technology even more intriguing sure so remember Wimble is a privacy enhancing and scalable protocol for a blockchain it's his name comes from the tongue time curse in Harry Potter that prevents afflicted from spilling secrets it was a it was originally proposed in 2016 by a pseudonymous person called Tom Elvis Jerris or which is the French equivalent of Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter series and it was shared as a text file on the Bitcoin Wizards IRC room through tor link the link to the paper was dropped there and then this person disappeared and we haven't heard from them again and Michael why don't you tell how that led to the development of grin sure well I mean I never said that paper was dropped and then a few months later in around say as I read December of 2016 someone again appeared on the same channel by the name of big noticed Peverill who was another character in the Harry Potter series who was I think he stole the invisibility cloak from death I think that's the reference there and he said he was had put together a new implementation of the mid-level protocol and it was called grin and he had the source kind of uploaded and ready to go and then the project kind of kind of took off from there well whoever would have thought well I'm sure JK Rowling never would have thought that her creation would be used in this manner but I do think the names and the technology do go well together so why don't you guys describe what grin is or is trying to be okay sure well I mean grins grins main goal is to be is to be better money and it's what it is is it's it also builds itself kind of on our homepage as a lightweight implementation of the member limbic protocol so in even though I mean I mean grid is an entire block chain in itself an end on top of just the core kind of bimbo protocol there are all sorts of decisions and things that have to go into the building a working blockchain but it aims to be very very very kind of light and as kind of non non prescriptive as possible style it deals with those two as to what it is basically so so one of the big important points of the middle window protocol is that it allows you to verify transactions being valid without having to store the entire history of the blockchain unlike previous method methods and protocols of blockchain it builds on previous research a lot of it's made by Gregory Maxwell in confidential transactions one way aggregated signatures coin join and a new thing called cut through and it basically allows you to store much less data on the chain and in general much less information so in member Wimble there are no amounts you don't need to have addresses stored on the chain and instead what you keep on chain is a very minimal which is basically a set of inputs and a set of outputs that are cryptographically blind that you could say and don't really mean a lot to anyone aside from the people who are actually involved in the transaction this allows for much easier sinking faster sinking and less size of the blockchain itself as well which is why you're getting these scalable properties yeah when I was learning about this there was something really sort of mind-blowing it's just like if you really understand the coin then yeah you're like oh this is kind of a better way to do it you know just with that level of efficiency you're kind of the lightweightness of of the blockchain it just it just feels like this was built by somebody who deeply understands Bitcoin and kind of what the problems are with it so what about the technology captured your imagination why out of all the different crypto projects did you decide to work on this one heywho I first came across the project was a few months after after it had been put out there and I was kind of the the technology isn't kind of go into and a blockchain development in cryptography applied cryptography rather it's it's kind of a lot of stuff that really kind of that I'm like doing this kind of from a technical perspective kind of I enjoy coding order I enjoyed working on it and obviously crypto currencies are interesting and I was kind of looking around for one of them to join but I couldn't I didn't really see anything out there that was kind of my thought would be worth joining at the time not that because the projects themselves are worth drawing and joining or because but rather because maybe they're too far along and there's not much I can add to it like I couldn't see myself adding anything to Bitcoin itself at this stage other projects out there may be kind of you know a clone of Bitcoin with a change here and there but nothing really substantial but when I came across you know grin and member wendel it was kind of clear to me that this is something really really new and something that really had a lot of potential so that's that's kind of why I decided to to join it and start getting involved in it and on my end I've been following the crypto space since well ever about Bitcoin live in 2011 this that bought first Bitcoin in 2013 but what always on that was always on the sidelines and kind of monitoring and paying attention reading catching up on projects made it through 2017 and all the craziness there and there weren't really any projects that were appealing or speaking to me instead it was kind of happy being on the sidelines and then about a year ago I found out about this project and about member Wimble and I basically fell down the rabbit hole and just couldn't start stop researching it and I found this you know there were some presentations about the member women protocol and that led me to grin and I started lurking and reading up on on the project itself and seeing these developers and development community that was very open was very focused on building and had no intentions of you know making money from it or profiteering from it and were purely in it for the technology and early 2018 that felt borderline crazy and also like a complete breath of fresh air that was really appealing to me and really encouraged me to get involved in the project and at the same time as well I was doing some research for my day job back then about Bitcoin transactions and the regulatory requirements around that and accepting and receiving Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals it was pretty much at the same time it had like a profound impact on why I chose to go into - grin was that you would you would see these guidances from regulators telling companies that in order for you to accept payments from from customers you need to go through you need to have the deposits as they come in go through it analysis tool so like a third party can I see analysis - like like some of the well-known actors in the space and and based on the score you can then choose to accept the deposit or otherwise you have to refund it and return it back from where it came from and this was just mind-blowing for me because essentially what this means is that you establish some kind of it's almost like a credit score but it's about a score of how good your money is and that made me think a lot about fungibility and and why it's very important to have fungibility on the base the layer of the protocol in order for companies to be able to transact in a way that doesn't create a huge amount of friction yeah in a way it's like of course I you know obviously we do know that when there are crimes that happen with money then often the people who transact with each other are potentially both engaging on something illicit and yet on the other hand you could also be the recipient of funds that were involved in an illicit transaction and have no idea so but I actually I wanted to go back and ask you to expand a little bit more in the philosophy of grin when you were talking about how it was a breath of fresh air and stuff like that because I do agree that there is something pretty different and striking really about grins approach and I yeah I want to kind of pull out more of what differentiates great in from some of the other recent projects sure so so grimmons maintenance was launched on january 15 this year and before that had been in development for about two and a half years and from the get-go it's been done as a completely open source project driven by the community funded by the community as well any any development funding received as has been based on donations there's been no IC o---- is no pre mine there's no death tax there's no anything essentially that allocates funds through the protocol layer to the development team instead it's it was fairly launched meaning that anybody who wanted could mine it it's a proof-of-work mined coin and it's open for anybody to use and there is no incentives or no no special circumstances that benefit early early adopters or early contributors more than anybody yeah we're gonna talk more about that because I think I do see how it's inspiring and yet I also think it has led to some hurdles I guess I would say that you guys have faced but what another thing I wanted to expound upon a little bit was the comparison of grin to Bitcoin and you know we talked about kind of some of the similarities and also some of the differences but one thing also that's kind of different is that they seem to have different goals Bitcoin is now being thought of as a store of value while green is aiming to become a medium of exchange why did the project decide upon that goal okay well I think I'm out of this refers back to our our mission schedule no meat well we start comparing create a member win but we have to be a little bit mindful of sorry but when comparing grid and Bitcoin we need to be a little bit mindful that you know Bitcoin was launched ten years ago and was a completely new technology at the time so so some of its original kind of its original purposes may not have been what it turned out to be so I mean the paper itself stated that Bitcoin was supposed to be digital cash since it became clear that the emissions are the the very limited admission schedule that you know led to these to a good amount of deflation the the story since been changed to say no one now it's a now it's the store of value in our case and grinby very much would like you know as every Bitcoin was originally meant to do we would like current to be used as a medium for exchange as opposed to a store of value which is why we've decided on a kind of a very simple admission schedule as in one one Grint per second 60 grams per block basically forever instead of having a very limited schedule so this is something I wanted to ask about because so obviously the the emission schedules seem different on the surface because Bitcoin has the 21 million bitcoins which incentivizes people to get a piece early like you know a Bitcoin or a fraction of a Bitcoin and hold on to that and that would then drive up the value of all the bitcoins so grins approach is different because there is no cap but there's this consistent inflation in perpetuity of one grin per second but the thing is that they have the same outcome like overtime grins emission rate will have the same effect of the block reward having's in Bitcoin and what I mean by that is in Bitcoin the inflation was high in the early years there were 50 new bitcoins every 10 minutes and that's when the circulating supply was low then it dropped to 25 and then it's about 12.5 soon it'll be six point two five and then even though in green there are no having's the emission rate by staying constant starts out as a high percentage of circulating supply and then eventually just becomes a smaller respondent percentage over decades which basically results in it eventually being somewhat negligible so in that sense that's how I'm confused like how can grin go after this medium of exchange goal and try to get people to use it and and I even saw on your documentation that you believe that this monetary policy will discourage hoarding but I don't understand how that will happen if the effect of the monetary policies seems to me at least to be the same maybe there's just something I don't understand no no I think you're right and I think that's a fair point I mean it's not so much that you know there's a halving or there's a limited number it's simply the inflation rate is predictable and so we know how many greens are enough in circulation now we can point to 30 years from outside we know how many they're going to be in that so that that's really what we think the important thing is here as far as it you know you're right the the inflation rate approaches zero basically so you get to a point where you might as well not be mixing any more grids because you know there's basically you know no appreciable inflation going on after a while but what to be honest and honest on this going to kind of go around saying that the the choices that grant is making in this regard are very conservative and you know this is absolutely as far as I know the first major coin to do this as in to not to have a halving and not to have a limited emission schedule so I don't think we could have gone out there and you know and said you know created an inflation schedule I mean kind of at this point in cryptocurrency development even what we're doing that was a very very bad approach over here you hear all sorts about it everywhere we go so yeah I was about to say it's great of you the you pointed out Laura and it really is a conservative approach and personally I would have loved to have you know more inflation but because these were the kind of questions I was asking myself as well when I got involved but the amount of I think like the comments the commentary on the sidelines and from from people can approaching the project I think the narrative has a big role to play here and with what when greens emission schedule is quote-unquote unlimited it has a lot of effect on people's minds and how they approach the coin we've seen that just in the comments I'm not sure that's gonna last an it's gonna maintain itself but it's very much I think has this effect of thinking that all right Green is not gonna be worth much more everybody's kind of saying oh it's doomed you know that the value is gonna go down so much which is great in my opinion if you try to build electronic cash like functionality because then people are not gonna think twice about spending it which is really what's important in order to drive adoption and I would have loved to see like overtime you know much more aggressive inflation but I think as Michael was pointing that this was already a very radical step apparently in the space and I think at least we're going in the right direction and in to be fair also to to point out I don't think it would have been possible to have this if it wasn't for the success of Bitcoin right in a way we're standing on the on the shoulders of Bitcoin having proven the concept of of a cryptocurrency to some degree and and I don't think it would have been possible with with unlimited emission back in 2009 but because of Bitcoin we can now take it one step further and say alright this is an unlimited emission it's still very conservative well one other thing that I was wondering though is if you so essentially you know as I pointed out the inflation rate the the way or the emission you know at least yeah you can push this narrative that it's gonna be different from Bitcoin but you know like I said in effect it it is pretty much the same but the other thing is so with grin unlike with Bitcoin well no actually in this regard I guess they're sort of similar because somebody needs a Bitcoin address but but anyway so to send somebody grin you know they have to agree to accept it but like who's gonna want to accept a new currency if the narrative is that it's going to quickly depreciate so in that regard like how do you plan you know if you if your goal is to get medium of exchange then how are you gonna do that and is there some plan to get stores to accept grin or like how you know how are you gonna yeah make this medium of exchange goal happen sure I think I think it's very early there isn't in the project life cycle at this stage where it is only a few months old so this is something that is gonna have to take some time to grow and mature as the echo system evolves there are right now I would say the kind of the main use use cases are buying grins and putting them in a wallet right or your mind grins and you have a mining pool and your cash up from the mining pool and either to an exchange or you put it back into your wallet I think that those use cases are gonna be dominating for a while now over time though because there are there are more greens minted every every day every second there's a new green put out in circulation there's going to be a lot of users holding a lot of Grimm and some businesses are gonna find that attractive in terms of speaking to like an audience where they can sell products to specifically catering to us because the accept grid that's one one way of starting to get some early adoption another another way that will happen over time once it's a big enough user base or even the other way around it could also be is is for businesses and individuals who have needs to transact privately right and this will drive adoption and it doesn't in my opinion it doesn't matter much whether there's a depreciating pressure on the green assets themselves if you're able to transact with them and then easily cash in or out to another currency like Bitcoin for example yeah so I guess we'll see because obviously Bitcoin has the most traction out of any coin and so maybe so that could simply be the main selling point is you know in order to use this for transaction is transactions is that it's like Bitcoin but private yeah so just just pointing out that you can say it's like Bitcoin like private but I mean we do have some you know technologies coming out like for instance the ability to do as atomic SWAT swaps with Bitcoin which we have so there is also the use case of using and a member women are using story that the grin blockchain as kind of a way to further privatize Bitcoin transactions as in some of those a transaction in Bitcoin then dozen atomic swap with Trin and then a swap back and then there's you know a greater level of privacy there huh yeah so let's actually talk more about the privacy feature features of grin what are the different ways that the protocol enables privacy okay sure would there's a few there's a few different things first off amounts on the blockchain are completely obfuscated transaction structure by the time it gets to the blockchain is is obfuscated or compressed basically when I look at you can I mean you can try this now if you look at the current blockchain Explorer and you look at the data that's in the in each block there's basically there's nothing there identifying it basically looks like random data and that's down to kind of the the the mathematical trickery that happens with nimble Wimble so instead of you know having one transaction you know one signature per output you can have everything kind of put together amalgamated into kind of one one very compact block so to speak and why don't you talk also a little bit about like coin join confidential transactions that dandelion protocol some of the other features yeah sure so I mean the genuine dandelion protocol itself I mean that's that's not specific to men but women in particular that's something that's kind of on top and that's that's what and that does is it's meant to to hide the transaction graph so if I'm say you know a three-letter agency and I have I'm able to monitor you know a good portion of the network I can see you know where transactions went terrific transaction was suddenly broadcast while its peers I should be like couldn't potentially get a good idea of you know what machine that transaction came from so dandy-lion attempts to to obfuscate that a bit so instead of you know when a node receives a transaction it doesn't broadcast to all its peers but it will send it off to another node which will send it off to another node at random and that's called the stem phase which is why it's called dandelion so one one node to another node to another node and that randomly at some point one of the nodes will say right and a lot of the fluff phase where all of the you know that particular node will broadcast a transaction to all its known peers so by doing that you've kind of you've walked you skated the path if you get a transaction you're a node if you get a transaction it's not necessarily obvious where it came from and that's what dandy-lion is is supposed to do other features coin joint is kind of built into it that there's not like you know the coin joint in bitcoins is a bit different but we kind of use use the term a little bit just kind of more for clarity of explanation what happens is because in a member wendel transaction it's not about finding individual outputs it's kind of a it's about putting all of the inputs and outputs in a single transaction together and making sure they sum to zero right so when you if you can do that you have a notion of something else it's called con through which we talked about before we kind of touched on a bit earlier so if all your inputs and outputs in a transaction equal zero well surely you can start cutting out some of these outputs kind of an either side of the equation so I could potentially do do a transaction that involves you know certain inputs and then without any confirmation do another one and another one and I can cut out you know the transactions that happens in the middle and that's that's the notion of cut through and again that that goes towards adding some some privacy and that's like if I send you a payment and let's say it's for ten grin and then part of the inputs that were used I'll show you how so how would this work so okay so let's say that I sent you ten grin and then you turn around and you send ten grin to Daniel then essentially what will happen is the cut through will make it look like I just sent ten to daniel directly is that right yeah it won't cut off the middle ones as you as you say and again when you say look like it is there's nothing that appears in the chain that identifies you or ties you at your particular address so it just gives you an extra layer of kind of obfuscation yeah and we should say that there are no addresses even and the only thing that are on the chain or are these outputs and inputs some link ability is possible to do there you know because you know what one one output in one transaction is then being used as an input enough in a future transaction but it makes it much harder to build up a valid transaction graph and especially like monitoring the network if you're if you're in an analysis firm but it's not perfect and we have still a long long way to go and and we're kind of constantly looking to make improvements and don't feel like we're finished in terms of obfuscating data and making the chain more private really cat-and-mouse type of thing yeah and I think you know already we're like we're well on our way given what we're doing already has described and the fact that it's enabled by default for everybody on on the chain right so a little big a big part of privacy is hiding in crowds and amongst your peers and because this is enabled by default on the protocol anybody is that using grynn is essentially making it harder for for for privacy to be leaked we're gonna talk more about this concept of having no addresses in grin in a moment but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors face it regulations can stall or kill a fast-moving crypto business new F aft and EU crypto currency AML laws are coming soon you could be hit with stiff fines or blacklisted no matter where your servers are in the world prepare now deploy the same powerful cipher trace tools used by regulators protect your assets streamline your compliance programs and keep your exchange or crypto business out of the regulators crosshairs learn how effective anti money laundering tools help keep your crypto business safe and trusted learn more at siphysicians.org to somebody if I don't have an address or addresses that I call my own ok so you might throw it there are no addresses and grin what all you have basically is is a wallet which is essentially you know appointed here a system for generating private keys that give you permission to spend outputs that are on the chain so in order to build a transaction there's there's an interactive element in the protocol as in I have to send some data over to the person I'm transacting with who has to do something to it and then send it back and then post it to the chain so it's only from a cryptographic standpoint it's it's known as an interactive protocol as in two parties have two transactions or interact with each other rather in order to create the transaction and the key kind of part of that that means that this has to happen through some communications channel but it could be any communications channel that the sender and the receiver chooses to use it could be a private chat it could be you know written message it could be any form of communication that allows the sender to interact with the receiver once and then the receiver to send information back to the sender and that's it and then not that can be finalized in broadcasted EJ yeah this was another thing that I thought was so interesting like there's something about this architecture that reminds me a little bit of email in the sense that the protocol makes the transaction possible but then there are many ways you could execute it so like with email you know you could use your own email server or you could use Gmail and so for grynn what are the different ways in which people can execute current transactions okay well just just a little bit of technical explanation the absolute simplest way to send someone a transaction in the core just kind of on the nimble window protocol itself is you send them you know a transaction or partial transaction and this would contain some private keys that are needed in order to spend the output and the other person's important person puts that together with theirs and creates a transaction so that's the simplest way to do it but that's obviously involves the sender revealing private keys which causes also some other problems so we don't do that so in been grynn itself we don't we have something on top without forming a transaction at stage and it's been used Schnoor signatures and it requires one back and forth so from let's say this the sender to the receiver and back in order to you know for either party to build efficient or signature so we can we can put together kind of the final signature without any one party having to reveal the keys to anybody else so the shortlist so you know from a practical standpoint what comes out of that is the shortest way to former transactions from sender to receiver and back to sender and already kind of within that the core software that we have there's a few ways of doing that so obviously the kind of most maybe intuitive way of doing this would be via HTTP so somebody runs a listener on their wallet and that's listening for for senders to send money to the wallet directly so that's an HTTP listener the sender will send an AC fee requests and then the response will contain the rest of the info to create the signature and then the sender can create the final transaction and post that to the chain we also have a they're doing that by email so you can send the file to somebody so you in your wallet you generate your send file you send that to the recipient and you know at their leisure they receive it imported so to speak into the wallet and send the result back to the sender to finalize it and put it onto the chain and again you know the the actual number of ways you can do this from a technology standpoint are you know infinite we have there's an experimental key base adapter so you know key base users can send send to you know other key base users on the system so yeah I mean we're probably talking more about later with what we're doing to facilitate these kinds of transactions because our approach is like I said we're just trying to be non-prescriptive so instead of saying you know providing one way of doing these met these the the transaction we want to kind of provide the tools to enable the community to come up with you know the best or most appropriate ways to perform this transaction and isn't there a way to do it with paper as well you could if you could write everything down on a piece of paper and send it to somebody and they can type it all back in but yeah absolutely you can meet somewhat the dark alley and a water paper and say you know here's your grids and and my you know part of a part of the team that I'm involved with we've also developed a system called green box which allows you to it's essentially like an inbox for for your grids it's funny that you that you use the email analogy before Laura so everybody gets an address but the address is not it's not stored on chain or anything it's derived from your your private seed and then you can exchange messages through the through a relay of servers that are federated just like email and all these messages are into and encrypted so that only the sender and the receiver can actually be privy to the information of the slates but but it's essentially an example of how we envisage layer 2 solutions to deliver different solutions of the problem of exchanging message information and building these transactions on the core protocol layer saying alright this is the one way to best do this I said you know it's encouraged that many different approaches are experimented with and kind of the one the one that works best is gonna be the one that gets a lot of usage and then one other thing that I was just thinking about was with Bitcoin a lot of people have said that you could do kind of like um fund raising for disaster recovery and and stuff like that you know people could publicize their Bitcoin address and people can just push that out but is that like earlier Michael when you were talking about how you could use HTTP that's always just listening is that a way that that kind of crowdfunding could happen as well using grin yeah absolutely as a matter of fact we do have an example of that going for our for our own fundraising efforts I believe there's a there's an HTTP address that can then enable can consent turns to with their wallets and then for this round trip communication that needs to occur to make a transaction happen obviously we know that ransomware has been a huge trend with Bitcoin where you know they hijack your computer or whatever and demand you pay them in Bitcoin does the set up of grin make that any either easier or harder or I'm not sure how that would affect that trend um that's a good question that's not really something I've thought about now that I mean the people who use bitcoin is ransomware ever you know or not as a certainly the cleverest people in the world because using Bitcoin is a massive trail behind it as to where you are nor the minute I'd say the minute someone tries to actually spend up there to be people all over them so yeah I'm not really sure I'm in a sense you know if they if I say here's plain HTTP listener I mean they could be doing this through tor as well so yeah you couldn't if it could be quite difficult to track them as well so yeah it's interesting it's not pretty something I've thought about too much okay I guess if they take control of your computer and then yeah initiate the transaction and you want to get the computer back you would need to completed but then maybe it's actually worse because then since it's private the ransomware people will well like grin better than Bitcoin actually yeah I also didn't know the answer to that when I asked it but just thinking it through right now I mean there are many there are many use cases for private transactions that are maybe negative but there is also many positive use cases for private transactions and a need for private transactions in general and it seems like example that you raised if we established that ransomware is possible today and it's widely used and it works well with Bitcoin I don't think it makes a big difference to the to the spread of ransomware with the technology like great maybe they switched to it maybe not but this seems like they've been able to to do their carry out their business regardless today quite well yeah and I know it's so early in the life of grin but do you have any sense yet of whether criminals are interested in this form of money because for people who've listened to my previous episodes with fluffy pony of monaro and Zuko of Z cash I did ask them a little bit about how they felt about the fact that their cryptocurrencies did make crimes easier I don't know I mean I mean it's kind of like with the defendant the you know criminals use cash as well and I'm not sure you know what the Fed thinks about that I'm sure that it's much more you know focused on kind of the wider economy then specific individual use cases for for for how cash is being used I like to think of green as is quite agnostic in that sense and the protocol itself is not opinionated about use cases it shouldn't be just like cash doesn't really care how it's being used it's just functional and then there might be some individuals or organizations that are using cash in a way that breaks the law and I definitely think governments and regulators should care about that but it's not up to to the transaction method itself to do that yeah so let's also now I kind of apply this same thinking to the just you know the general uses for the technology so we've been talking about how you know this protocol or or grin requires this like round-trip communication to make a transaction happen and in the Bitcoin world or in the crypto world in general a lot of people have talked about how legacy systems are pull technology meaning you know you have to handover your information and then the store or whatever that once the payment from you has to contact your bank and request that that money and that pull technology is sort of prone to fraud and then people have been talking about how bitcoin is a push technology where you control the money and like cash you decide when the money gets sent out from your address and that of course then puts the burden on users to not lose their private keys so in this case we're minimal is like different how would you how do you think it will affect behaviour around money and what kinds of financial problems do you think could happen or you know sort of like the push/pull thing or do you think that it sort of resolves all kinds of issues with that I think it actually improves a bit on the model with Bitcoin from a practical perspective of accepting payments from users again kind of thinking on in the context from like a from like a business one of the problems or challenges I should say with accepting Bitcoin is that users are proud to do a lot of errors and mistakes and by having this interactive protocol where it basically in order for you to receive a grant transaction you have to actively get involved in order to process it which means that it's not possible for somebody to just send money to you to an address of yours in the blind like HTTP address or something you actually have to actively respond and send information back to the sender which means that it's very easy to reject transactions which allows transaction flows to be more robust in a way so you don't have this issue of some user sending address to an address they shouldn't be doing and now you have to figure out what happened and return the funds back to them or if some unauthorized person is sending your cash which might sound a bit strange but you know a lot of businesses actually are very careful about making sure that they only receive payments that they're supposed to do to receive otherwise their their bookkeeping doesn't help with grin it becomes easier to do so because you can basically run checks and validate and indeed you're supposed to receive this payment and otherwise rejected all right so let's talk a little bit more about some of the other features of grin so grin does not have something called scripting which Bitcoin has so what are some examples of things you can do with scripts in Bitcoin but not in grin but then I you know Michael I think also did mention now you guys still have features like atomic swaps and I think there are a few others so what are some of the other features that you were still able to retain anyway right so I mean it's atomic clock is one example there's there's something that's been kicking around in the windmill circles with the notion of script district and what that means is it means kind of cryptographic tricks that you can do to enable kind of script like functionality without actually having to go through you know without if you have them doing through the script so one example of that I mean and again this is all kind of theoretical stuff that we kind of happen a list for research a lot of it stuff like lightning we think we'd be able to enable that at some point after some research I'm using kind of scripted script tricks there's the atomic swaps that we mentioned there's um you know time law relative time lock transactions vaults which you know or kind of user level security so like like meaning if I want to do a transaction for a large amount or something then there's a delay built-in so that people can't rob me yeah absolutely yeah and if someone tries to then the you know there's a case where nobody gets the money so this lit there's there's less incentive for people to even try in the first place and so what our script lists scripts so first of all let's can you describe what scripting is and then what script let scripts are I think in terms of saying what script the scripts are it's not as if there's a you know it's a script the script is a particular anything it's more of a more of a trick that's done to enable something you could do with the script so for instance that you know at a kind of mathematical level that it would be some trickery about you know adding one to something or using the number one in kind of creative ways so you couldn't point to you know a set of things and say these are scripted scripts it's very much about you know tricks to enable to enable scripting like behavior and scripting is a way of making Bitcoin programmable yeah it's basically smarts and some very basic smart contract functionality yeah then in Bitcoin like I mean I don't think it's used all that extensively of the kind of the standard exchange script stuff like you see aetherium you know the biggest use case per aetherium system is to have you know smart contract enablement or the ability to develop smart contracts unfortunately that doesn't fit in with the middle with a protocol because it's such a kind of compact form of a blockchain that there's no room for it anywhere yeah and so in the the connect of the notion and concept of scripting scripts is attributed to Andrew poultra who was doing the windows research early on and it just basically allows you to implement some simple smart contract functionality that is trained in a way and you don't need to base it it's you don't only check signatures or present and correct and it's derived through using snore signatures and what are snore signatures a snore signature is is basically it's a multi multi user signature so I I can sign something or so I can create a signature for something and someone else can create a signature for the same thing and we can combine two signatures you have you can basically add them together it's got kind of one signature that's taken from although kind of partial signatures involved so it's it's how we do the basic transaction and in grading at the moment is instead of everyone reviewing private keys I just sign a part signature with my private keys and the other person signs part of their partial signature with their private keys and then when you put that all together and you can you can add the public keys and then the public keys will be able to verify the signature somebody the added private keys equals the the added public keys and it all works as if it was just one person created the signature and if you do scripted scripts you're basically or adapter signatures as they call them you're basically in a way hacking this by putting some you know these signatures the private information could be could be random but you could also make you know putting some deliberate information that then can be used in your kind of chain smart contract in air quotes let's talk about your launch what were some of the different features of your launch and why did you choose those features okay so I think the the notion of like a fair launch in the sense that there wasn't any pre mine or dev tax or any kind of design around incent incentivizing or rewarding development team I think that was taken quite early in the project I think a lot of it has to do with just keeping things simple and straightforward and also making things fair and transparent and it wasn't it's just you know in a way I think you know the more I've kind of been involved in the project the more I think about it it's it's what really makes sense if if you're looking at the big picture and thinking about what the end goal is if the end goal is to you know get funded and have a little small development team working on a project you probably would do it in a different way but if you're trying to build almost something that could be a public good and you want to see like big picture or long game thinking and one an able a like a healthy and thriving ecosystem surrounding your project you need to allow equal access to getting involved and make it as easy as possible and because there's no incentives for me to kind of I'm not getting rewarded if more people are joining the project a lot then relatively I guess I'm a relatively early user but if somebody chooses to get involved in in green today they have the same conditions as I I do and it makes it very easy to contribute because you're not feeling that when you're contributing that somebody else is profiting as a result of that and it also allows us as a group and as a community to be very open and honest about about the project itself we're not necessarily selling anything because we have nothing to sell we have no upside from it either and and I think that that is great in the sense that it keeps us very honest and it allows also a community to build around the project well so then how do you feel about the fact that in the end the early miners were these like special-purpose investment vehicles devoted to mining grin and they were funded by I guess people were saying 100 million dollars in VC money sure I mean that may be the case I haven't seen done hundred million dollars attributed to it the what I was speaking to some groups and individuals it seems like a lot of the investment vehicles didn't participate in mining immediately I don't know if they're doing it now there's a lot of mining happening in China but generally speaking equal opportunity doesn't equal that doesn't mean equal outcome you know if there were we welcome everybody to to use Grimm to mine Grimm and to participate in the project now if there were groups that felt that the project was really exciting and they really wanted to mine grain and they wanted to devote a lot of resources into doing that and they're free to do that and I guess that's just good in general we're an open project and and again we don't really think about these things too much I don't really see it as an issue necessarily and how did notions of fairness play and your decision to have those two different consensus algorithms with one of them becoming more dominant over time right so so it's just some background first and before I going to answer that greenies proof-of-work mind as we said and there are two proofs of work they're all from the same family of proof of works called the cuckoo cycle family which was created by John Trump which is also part of the core team of Grimm and we have we launched with two different algorithms two variations of that of the cuckoo cycle family the first one is specifically tuned for ASIC manufacturing and make it making it as easy as possible to develop Asics for it and Asics are like specialized chips that can be built specifically to mind grin exactly it's specifically to do anything but then you could have ones that are great exactly so gpgpu is the type of ASIC but it's a very generalized type of Asics but you can also make a specialized ASIC that only does one thing really really well and efficiently for example mining this cuca to basic tuned algorithm so that's one of the proof works the second proof of work is ASIC resistant meaning that it's designed to be more GPU friendly and incentivize GPU mining rather than something to develop a 6-4 and when we launched the reward for the ASIC tombed proof of work was 10% and the reward for the ASIC resistant preferred work was 90% meaning that 90% on average of all rewards would go to the miners who are mining the GPU friendly proof of work and this overtime the balance here between 10% and 90% changes linearly up until the second what once grin has a 2 year anniversary it will switch to being completely 100% on the ASIC tuned proof so what we're saying is that we bootstrapped the network giving a heavier weight towards the GPU friendly algorithm and then over time there will only be rewards after two years for the AC tuned algorithm and the logic for that is that essentially that there was when when gran was in development we noticed that there was have a lot of attention being put to put to the project and they were already we heard rumors of Asics being manufactured and so on and we were worried about the the civilization of the network and a way to bootstrap the network was basically to to devise this dual proof of work system which is only temporary in a way to increase the decentralisation and also not incentivize one or two big ASIC manufacturers with a lot of resources to kind of jump the queue and have an ASIC mine already from day one and take control of all the hash power on the network but instead to have a gradual increase of this ASIC friendly proof of work and as a result build a healthy hopefully hopefully healthy ASIC ecosystem where you have many different ASIC manufacturers competing and offering products to the market and let's also go back to some of the comments you guys made earlier about how grin does not have a dev tax meaning that part of the block reward does not go to the developers and so for instance especially like I know you Michael who you know you go by the name yeast plume you were trying to raise funds for to pay for you know your time on developing grid from the community and I saw that at first at least the campaign was not going very well you weren't even trying to raise like a huge sum of money and I think it was like what was it fifty five pounds per year or it sorry fifty five thousand pounds a year no because it was a period the rates actually the word we're using I was about nine thousand euro so Tesla around 10,000 USD would planet be our standard but with what we standardized online with you know a month of developers time yeah yeah and I mean that was includes includes taxes we have to pay my time so it's like a the salary payment basically would be good yeah and at first I think you were only raised like roughly a fifth or something and then pig noted sorry I keep going no no you're right about that but then that was that was also the fourth time the fourth campaign as well so I mean the I I've been working full-time on written since about to February of last year and since then I've done for funding campaigns and all of which were successful some of them and I mean the first one was in the height of the the Bitcoin bubble so everyone was feeling wealthy I and I mean that campaign was funded in about in about two days the next one took a bit longer the next one's a bit longer the last one which was done just around launch it's it's stalled a little bit but also there weren't there are a lot of companies out there who would like to support grid over the long term as in you know put you know a mining pool might decide to give a donation of their proceeds into the grim general Development Fund I think a lot of that was kind of being set up as well at the same time so up until now I mean the community has been absolutely great I mean - very supportive and have you know have allowed me to be able to work on this full-time oh but actually because that one at fundraising attempt at least did not go very well I know that Ignotus wrote a post expressing his or their disappointment with the lack of funding for for your work and they also talked about greed in the crypto community but I just wonder you know another looked at another way it could also be seen as a problem of incentives and I like do you feel like if you were to do it again would you try to raise funds a different way that kind of harnesses incentives more okay I mean I don't think trying to - I don't think raising money is inherently evil or structuring yourself in such a way that that you know the injecting capital into your project however you want to do it is not necessarily about as a matter of fact as you can see you know it's challenging to do things the way we're doing it but I mean this wouldn't necessarily be true for all projects and you know ever work on ever but in this case with rain I mean it's the first implementation of nimble Wimble and we think if you know if the product is run in such a way that it's it's obviously to benefit a small group of people even if it's just you know for you know supposedly just to pay developers and nothing else it still kind of diminishes from the the notion of grid belonging to everybody if there's a death tax and developers are only paid out of the dev tax there's much less incentive for other developers to come along and join you know and make you know contributions as you would to an open-source project because you know they're all getting paid out of it I'm not why would I do this so it's it's it's challenging it's not the only answer but it is I mean it's the one that you're in its kind of path the greenest chosen and you know we intend to stick to it yeah I mean I've been I've been kind of called a fanatic or incredibly naive when I when I say it but you know the way I've been thinking about it I don't really see another way of doing it that makes sense essentially I think this is it's hard we're not we're very frugal which I also think is a good thing and you know raising money in a different way while you solve the funding problem perhaps you also open up the door for a bunch of other problems as Michael was saying you know other developers might be less incentivized to join if they're not getting paid how do you allocate funds how how do you handle all this administration of you know it's one thing we have some administration now for the modest funds that we receive in donation but it becomes a complete different game if you're having hundreds of thousands or millions even of dollars that you supposed to administer and do it in the right way and how do you ensure that funds get allocated to the right place that they're used efficiently and then all of this ultimately is actually benefiting your long-term goal it's it's not obvious and I don't think actually it's been proven in the space that having more money yields to better results I haven't actually seen a single example of that at this stage yeah this is one of those things where when you look at it one way you know you can see kind of one side and look at another way you see the other side I definitely maybe because you know we've seen that socialism maybe hasn't worked out super well in a lot of places and maybe it's because you know growing up here in the US you kind of see like okay here's how capitalism works and you sort of think okay it works well but at the same time you can live in a capitalist society and sort of kind of be into minimalism and be like well I don't want to buy a ton of things all the time because that's not a very satisfying way to live so yeah I just I look at it and I kind of go back and forth you know I do there is something it's like I was I don't want to talk I don't want to mention who this person was but I was talking with somebody about Z cash and about the the developer rewards that that they have and you know that person kind of had a view that was like negative on the creator's earning money from it and I was a little bit confused at first I just thought well they created it they should be rewarded but you know I know what you're talking about if you're trying to build something that's for the community it's just that like I said when I see also that then you struggle a little bit to raise funds for the development it just makes me wonder well I could it have been done better but anyway as for your points I actually wanted to expound on that a little bit more you decided not to do a foundation for the governance of grin why not and how do you guys plan to govern grin right and so so one of the early contributions I did was to have a look at foundations in disarray research around that and see what the use cases for foundations are and how they apply to grid in the context and what we should have won or not and as I was going through it I couldn't really find any compelling arguments to why you would need a foundation especially if you're trying to be decentralized I think the main point maybe was to protect the trademark to have like a an entity that registered the trademark it protects it but we really didn't see any point in trying to enforce that even and otherwise I don't really see the use case for it as an official I'm doing these air quotes again but like as an official foundation it becomes this centralizing entity which now needs administration and organization and in a bureaucracy for it and and then this centralized foundation is going to be making decisions since you know even if you only support or fund the project etc you're effectively you're doing you're taking these decisions and it creates structure where I'm not sure it actually adds any benefit in the research however we did conclude that you know foundations are great in the sense that if other people wanted to put together a foundation let's say you have a passionate individual that really wants to further in development and say hey I'm gonna put together a great foundation now I'm gonna create the structure and I'm gonna give it a grant and hand out money to development projects that are targeting great that's great we encourage you to encourage many foundations to be founded on these principles however there won't be an official Foundation and rather instead and how like win-wins governance has evolved has instead been from from having just ignores estimate the main founder in individual roots group entity a bunch of robots nobody really knows who leaked notices or art but now also having that technocratic council that essentially was created for the main that the main purpose was to manage the multi-sig key winner funds donations are being kept so essentially the moment you start accepting donations and funds you create a layer of hierarchy I think it's in a way inevitable you can't really do it in a different way outside if you start like going into you know governance research like distributed autonomous organizations and so on I think it's very much unproven it's very difficult we want to stay focused on really you know working on grin and not try to over complicate things so so instead there's this subset of individuals nine nine people Michael and I are part of them that are part of kind of initially was part of managing the keys but the general way of how governance decisions are being made today is in a very transparent fashion where we have bi-weekly meetings so every other week there's a development related meeting and the other week there is a governance focused meeting and anybody is free to add points to the agenda and these will be discussed in the meeting which is a car happening a marketer chat everybody's free to join in and the points are discussed and that and decisions are being made out in the open in a transparent fashion and the philosophy I think in general is to just keep things minimal minimal and transparent and open as far as we can and for as long as we can and if there's no reason to change it we wouldn't want to do that all right so let's close out with one last question since launch which was not that long ago what are some of the things you guys have been working on and what can we expect from grin going forward sure well as I've talked to a little bit earlier what we're trying to do is is support the community in building tools on top of grin so from him from my my perspective anyhow I'm doing a lot of work on the the wallet software itself but rather than trying to create you know the nicest GUI both there is I'm spending all of my time focused on putting out your an API or a set of tools for other developers to pick up and build you know they're they're fancy gooey wallets on top of so um in one sense it's very much you know support the community and you know let them come up with with solutions to some of the problems we've talked about an experiment and see what happens from there on top of that I mean we have some of the additions to the core protocol that we've talked about and I kind of described this is very kind of careful and considered introduction of new technologies into grin because while we have a long list of things that we think we know how to do we can't guarantee you know when we're gonna kind of have all the all the research worked out in order to be able to enable them so what we kind of slowly and measurably adding features to the core great protocol as we go one of the things I'm very much excited about is the recent work by notice to see explore the potential of ITP integration onto grain and support a more anonymous peer to peer network yeah yeah I think you guys have a very very very interesting project so we will have to check back in to see what happens I will thank you both so much for joining us today where can people learn more about you and grin thank you Laura if you want
