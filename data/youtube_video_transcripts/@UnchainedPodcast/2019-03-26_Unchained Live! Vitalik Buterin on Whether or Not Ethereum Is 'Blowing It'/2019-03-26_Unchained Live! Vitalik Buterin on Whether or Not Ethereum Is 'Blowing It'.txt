ladies and gentlemen welcome to the first unchained live sponsored by quan stamp thank you for joining us and now please welcome to the stage host of unchained laura shin [Music] hi everyone i'm so excited to have you all here at the first unchained live your no hype resource for all things crypto is on stage at pulitzer hall columbia graduate school of journalism for those who don't know unchained is my weekly hour-long podcast that covers all things crypto and in a few months it will be three years old when i started this podcast i never ever imagined that it would become something big enough where i could hold an event like this so i really really appreciate you all for listening to the show and for coming tonight it's also really meaningful to me to be doing this event here at columbia journalism school because i came here for grad school 11 years ago and at that time kind of like my podcast i never imagined i would someday be doing an event in this very building and hilariously until tonight my main memory of this particular floor in the building is that on the night of graduation my friends and i all had a dance party in the room at the other side of the hall so um now i'm making new memories in this space anyway our guest for today is one of crypto's biggest stars one of its biggest leaders who himself started in this piece as a journalist please give a warm welcome to vitalik buterin the creator of ethereum [Applause] welcome vitalik thank you good to be here thanks for coming out to new york for this i really appreciate it so i'm going to jump right into questions normally in journalism if you're an editor they say you should give your comments to writers in what's called a nice sandwich and you can apply that concept to to interviews but unfortunately i'd have to dispense with the nice parts in the beginning because i really want to get to the meat of the conversation we have a very limited time so my first question is kind of like a question that's actually for you and for the audience and actually what we're going to do to tee up the questions we're going to play a video and this video i think you've probably seen it and some some may have seen it but for those who haven't it's a video of fred wilson at union square ventures in conversation with tushar jane of multi-coin capital the multi-coin capital summit and i think fred's view here is representative of a lot of people's that it's not just his opinion but you can see he has kind of a lot of emotion about where ethereum is right now so for the audience my question for you is you'll watch the video and then we're gonna go to this website called slido which is sli.do some of you may have actually pre-submitted questions there earlier and you'll enter the code unchained where you can answer this poll and the question is you know do you agree with what fred wilson is saying here which is uh is ethereum losing its lead so again that's slido sli.do and you'll enter the code unchained to answer the poll so let's uh play this video and just for context at the beginning he's talking about strong executive leadership and we do that a lot for our companies ethereum needs that right we know that vitalik is not ceo vitalik is an evangelist he's a brilliant computer scientist but like ethereum should be more like a company right like they like you look at what eos is doing and you look what ethereum is doing it's like you know if ethereum was doing what eos was doing they'd be crushing it but they're not and they don't have enough money um uh they don't have enough developers they don't you know they're not their their go to market strategy is non-existent like they're not behaving like a company and if if the of all of us who own ethereum go to vitalik and say you know look this thing you got going in switzerland it's not working fire these  who don't know what the hell they're doing and put somebody great in there who can help you build this thing into a monster like that's what we would do i don't know how to do that like you can't like there's no mechanism to do that that's that's painful just sitting there holding the asset just watching them whittle it up the valuable way and you're like god damn it you know i know what to do here you know just look at it every great company has done this just do that and they don't do it and it's hard to get them to listen right because like first of all who do you have to convince right in this case like maybe it's metallic but there's a whole decentralized group of developers et cetera that need to be convinced and like this is exactly kind of the question that we're trying to think of is well if they think that whole group thinks that they're killing it then they then they got their head up their ass okay they're not killing it they're blowing it they have the lead and they're blowing it and it's just like it's so obvious what to do when they're not doing it so okay uh if you are in the audience and uh on the live stream go to sli dot d-o and uh you know vote on for this poll but we're not going to show the results because what i want is i want vitalik to uh give us your response to what he's saying in this video yeah i mean i guess first of all like if bitcoin was run like a business would it have succeeded and i feel like we kind of intuitively know the answer so like it's definitely a structure that works for some things but like blockchains and cryptocurrency and all those uh all of those things that come with that package are just fundamentally kind of so much more and kind of so different from a traditional company or or a software product so i'm really not at all sure that like that kind of of model is anywhere close to the right model um so in terms of like what our model is right like we've definitely had these discussions inside of the foundation and there's definitely been people from time to time that just said yeah we need to go in with guns blaze and then fire those bastards and then you know get the 40 people in and like stick them in the middle of some you'll be in silicon valley and get them to pay ten thousand dollars a month of rent get them to work for 16 hours every day rah rah six months and like we got ethereum 3.0 man and like no i mean the uh like i would say rather that in bitcoin succeeded in large part because it adopted a model that's very very very different from that and we've been adopting a model that's very different from that though i mean at the same time like one of the things that we did is for the our 2.0 strategy right we have this approach where you know the foundation is not the thing in the middle that's building everything the foundation is you know it is being a hub for voice for things that need a hub like for example writing out a hub and spell writing out the spec and specifying it bringing it to completion but then the work on making 2.0 implementations is kind of distributed among you know prismatic labs and lighthouse and consensus and these other companies and you know these other companies internally can be kind of structured in very different ways and they you know some of them could be could be even based in one place some in another place they might have different kinds of people in them and really if even a couple of them succeed then you know if you're at least the softer implementations of ethereum 2.0 exist and it's developed and from a scaling point of view you know like how some of our community members and public have said even if ethereum 2.0 is never developed there's ethereum one point x there's zk roll up there's channels there's plasma and yeah but and so you were you're kind of taking issue with his framing of you know yeah like i guess the point i'm trying to make is that they're like there is a kind of focused and deep approach to doing things and there is a broad approach to doing things and we definitely are explicitly taking the broad approach to doing things and i'd argue it's like a very good one for things like bitcoin and ethereum but so just because you know we've got this poll going to i'm just curious do you feel like ethereum is losing its lead or or no is that just and it's definitely one lost and lost some weed to some extent and i think that's just because like if you first it's kind of inevitable and unavoidable because ethereum like really was the first general purpose smart contract thing to try to do anything and and uh bitcoin for example was the first cryptocurrency and originally as far as cryptocurrencies go it had 100 market share then went to 95 and then and now it's around 51 and like as industries mature and markets grow over time there's more projects and more projects like try to do different things and that's you know people learn over time that there's like more different models that you could try and there's different projects that are trying different models and that's part of the that part's an inevitable part of the process simply because the space is so new yeah because the space is so new and because the space is just becoming less new over time all right so let's just quickly look at the results i'm just curious to know so okay so actually people mostly strongly disagree that their name is losing okay so good that's good because um you from some of the uh behavior i'm seeing on twitter i wondered about that um although honestly to be fair this is probably an audience that's very friendly to you um so one other one other thing that i wanted to ask though about this kind of competition aspect is like ethereum has always been kind of very unicorns and rainbows when it came to other blockchains like you had zcash and eternity and perhaps even other blockchain teams at defcon 4. um but you know at the same time we're seeing this new movement i guess really in ethereum where uh recently ethereum core developer offeree showdown tweeted polka dot delivers what serenity ought to be changed my mind and he was attacked on social media and actually driven out of ethereum i've had other people express anxiety uh to me about polkadot presumably because it could make ethereum one of like many para chains and you know instead of ethereum being a launch pad there's also worries about substrate i mean there's all kinds of things going on so right now you know here we are you're trying to build this thing that it's not going to be done for a couple years meanwhile polkadot and some of these other potentially competitive blockchains are either launching soon or have recently launched so do you worry that like your roadmap is too long compared to where they are in their development and i would say first of all that like pretty much every project is like generally optimistic about what about what they say they're going to do so like for example even you know the big like bitcoin side chains remember back in 2014 like three months after the initial announcements when the bitcoin side chains were the thing that was going to kill ethereum right it was like the first of the uh you know it was like the first of the ethereum killers and like people were saying yeah ethereum doesn't need to exist anymore and then now what do we have well there's like what one side chain which is basically like a permission consortium chain between exchanges so it's um like things definitely like all of these things are harder than they seem and even after launch like things are harder than they seem and like a lot of the problems that we see that uh and are also problems that all these other projects are going to see so so you're not worried about like polka dot or so like i'm definitely not worried about them kind of you know replacing ethereum or any of those kind of more more extreme versions like basically because like i do think that like building like ethereum isn't just like a technical thing there's also an ecosystem to build out there's tools other than a blockchain there's a community to build there's all these things that do really take a significant amount of time um and but why do you think this like strain of ethereum maximalism is emerging like literally on my way over here i saw that taylor monahan had a tweet about it earlier today too like why you know why is it happening and what do you think of it um yeah it definitely is like in general i think i forget where i made those comments but it might have been in some conversation with tyler cohen or somewhere else i made this comment that people are at their most evil not out of greed but out of fear and that was um and it is probably true that no there's a new wave of like people making noises about how they'll uh like basically kill ethereum and there's like that does lead to like people who uh being afraid and beyond people kind of taking taking that not too well i mean that definitely isn't something that like i definitely really want to wish and hope that the ethereum community can kind of find a way to interact with these other crypto projects that are uh that are emerging that's uh not have cryptomat or not ethereum maximalistic not maximalist in general in the kind of horrible ways and connotations that that word has though i mean at the same time there's also this kind of other opposite current where people are i think there's some people that are worried that because we have this kind of anti-maximalist culture that basically is the reason why like in the ethereum space like people just immediately call uh but basically call other community members out for being maximalist as opposed which isn't something that normal that happens at all in many other crypto communities and like basically there's there's this kind of counter current where there's other people who basically believe that the anti-maximalists are kind of being played for jumps like they're playing cooperate when other people are playing defects in the prisoner's dilemma and like that might be true sometimes might not be true sometimes but it's something that we need to kind of probably carefully consider consider and evaluate on a case-by-case basis but so what is your take on competition like would you be upset if there was another uh you know competing blockchain that took the lead like how would you personally feel about that i'm curious it depends which blockchain like like i think like i mean like you know like i'm not afraid to like on projects i think are terrible right so if tron overtakes ethereum then first of all continue to believe it to build on ethereum because i believe that you know the world and humanity needs to have a decentralized platform and second i will have lost a certain amount of hope for humanity but not all not not not nearly all so if it's some more i mean if it's some like very common reasonable and very competent technical platform then and ultimately like i hope to find ways to have enough positive sum and collateral collaborative relationships with these projects as much as possible and and i've like i feel like the ethereum community has shown that it's capable of doing that like for example it's had a very positive relationship with the zcash pretty much since the beginning um it's uh in e relations or even warming with ethereum classic recently and even i don't know if you've seen the recent peace bridge projects there's um i mean even in bitcoin cash like 10 tends to be fairly friendly especially now that it's uh basically a kind of um exercise that's big demon within um right yes um you see i'm not afraid to criticize um the um yeah so i guess like the ideal outcome for me definitely is like i've said anti-maximalist things in general like when when the maximalists were just bitcoin maximalists and i really do believe i do believe in my heart that like i wants to see an environment where you know different approaches defend to things can thrive and prosper and kind of ethereum can win and other projects that that do interesting things can win too and if we can find that way i think that that really would be best but like if that can't and if they if that can't happen and ethereum like is like ends up just being much less much less relevant because people switch from it to other technologies i definitely like much rather it be some like some competent technical chain than like one of these scam projects all right so one other thing i wanted to ask about this video was um back when this was circulating on twitter um somebody tagged you in some tweet related to it and um preston van loon of prismatic labs which is creating a starting client for ethereum 2.0 tweeted or he responded to it saying that he and others on his team were struggling to deliver because they still had to work these full-time jobs and for those of you who missed it vishal wrote back yolo and sent him uh sent prismatic a thousand eth and then that was uh what enabled them to quit their full-time jobs or at least uh preston and he runs prismatic full-time now but you know so i saw this happen but also we've got these ethereum core developers that have been telling me you know they're working on some of the most essential aspects of ethereum but they're underfunded uh sometimes their salaries are at like maybe 60 percent of what they would be if they were working at a startup as a developer um and even with a startup they'd also get equity and meanwhile they watched the ethereum foundation give you know like four million dollars to starkware which is a competing blockchain so starkware is not a competing blockchain oh okay no it's just it's a company that's just building zk stark technology oh okay but but is that still like something that you would give a higher priority to compared to some of the core ethereum teams because for them they feel like whoa where you know how are these funding priorities being set i think those are definitely very reasonable questions to ask i think it's also important to recognize this sort of in the context of the history of the foundation and its kind of funding capacity is in some of the inefficiencies in its funding capacities so like for example you know we had back during the sale we had 18 million dollars and that 18 million dollars quickly turned into nine because we weren't able to turn it into a cash quickly enough and just because of a kind of quite spendy a culture that some people in the foundation had early on the nine kind of whittled down to one fairly quickly but then fortunately you know the ethereum launched the foundation had its ether and that made it adopt this kind of very careful and cautious attitude toward uh funding like pretty much funding anything and so our expenditures were pretty low but then the ether price just suddenly shot up by a factor of literally more than a thousand and like our norms definitely kind of didn't adjust kind of as quickly as the realities did and then there was another correction and at the start of last year and we announced this big grant program and the goal of that was to basically it's kind of like a triage projects to just identify the biggest categories of things that were not getting funded that just needed to start getting funded so some of the earliest stuff included the l4c channel stuff that included some of the um eth2 client teams it included some plasma projects and included some other things that included these big academic grants and and those things really did did need to be funded and now more recently of course there's this uh you know the in the price went down by a factor of 10 again and in in part because like we didn't um end up kind of getting out and getting out of hand and like actually adjusting or spending up by a factor of a thousand like we you know have not had to do any rounds of layoffs we hadn't mean we haven't had to kind of do any of those things so some of this is like kind of yeah organization like it sounds like i saw you tweeting about how people could be paid via smart contracts in a very flexible way we maybe that's something you guys should look at yeah i mean there's definitely a kind of internal experimentation happening like the like part of the benefit of this sort of ethereum core foundation structure that's not a corporation that we've developed over time is that there's a lot of kind of little projects and little experiments happening inside of them so like i i think like afsa's team like some like some of them have been getting paid and die and then there's people getting paid with these like with these channel mechanisms there's uh you know then there's grants there's salaries there's like all of these you know different scales of things there's trials like what we call hack internships and and a bunch of other things but just you know to go back like you know in general i feel like from what i've learned from some interviews is that there are people working on this who feel like hey how are these priorities being set and so it sounds to me like there's probably room for improvement at least from their perspective there definitely is though i think uh i mean like i don't know whoever said that i don't like i don't know their spec their specific situation but it's also important to remember that like especially like during the periods where you're adjusting downwards like the uh if if nobody's complaining that means you're overpaying basically and that's yes yes well okay so let's so let's keep talking actually about this first specific topic because there's been a new development where um as you probably know there's this new decentralized autonomous organization called molotow for those of you who missed it my episode that came out on tuesday was great about this like super interesting but essentially molok dao is a dao vote where members will be voted in and upon acceptance they receive these shares that give them the ability to vote on different proposals that will help further ethereum 2.0 development what's your take on molok dao it's definitely an interesting experiment um and it's first of all like i'm really glad to see people in the community and of taking charge and just making these independent pushes to kind of promote the push ethereum and the ethereum ecosystem forward in the different ways that they think they think makes sense like i think that's valuable both because we have the benefit of these different philosophies getting tried uh we it also means that you know if the ethereum foundation does have like institutional constraints a lot of the time like these a lot of these other organizations or dao's or whatever don't have them or they have different constraints and so they can kind of fill in some of our gaps so i think all of those things are good um the one big kind of challenge that i see is that like ultimately these kind of non-profit dows are still like just basically a way of organizing charity spending and yeah like they can provide some improv some improvements but you know ultimately this kind of public goods problem that basically people are throwing money into things that benefit way more people than just themselves and so they're like unless they're really really altruistic they're gonna put in kind of far too little money to actually basically far far less money than kind of would be would be optimal if ever if if everyone sort of had ever kind of had everyone's interests in mind then like basically like the dow by itself doesn't just magically make these like public reds problems and tragedies of the comments go away and so the there's definitely and i'm very grateful to all the people that have contributed to moloch tao but at the same time it the molecule by itself is still in and i don't expect it to you know balloon into like these like eo-sized like pools of money they can go and do like the the kinds of things that uh people that that want us to have you know like eosize the spending wouldn't want us to do yeah yeah no i think that's true because like the actual dial was something where people were expecting a return but this is like again uh it's gonna have that free rider problem where you know other people in the community will be like okay they want to put their money in to fund ease 2.0 development fine um but one other thing i want to ask about was there's this other idea floating around which is inflation funding for development and you know z cash doesn't where 20 of the block reward goes to fund such a development what do you think of that idea yeah and i did read the um eip i think was it 1867 like some like number in that range that was released today it's interesting that people are starting to discuss it i mean i think probably two of the big challenges to that i mean one of them is kind of just political which is the community i think hasn't fully decided like how it feels about of governance making like subjective economic decisions on that level of subjectiveness and like so for example the bitcoin community would definitely be hard against this sort of thing like they'd even be hard against redirecting parts of the existing block reward even if even if it keeps the cap to uh things like this because you know they would say oh it's centralization it's taxes and like these things are evil and all that now on the other hand you have projects that take the opposite extreme and well basically i'd use just use on-chain governance to like push it push out inflation uh rewards to projects and i've written articles about like how this can easily like this is just fundamentally not incentive compatible it can lead to plutocracy it can lead to cartels and i think it might even be possible to make a almost a mathematical theorem that basically says something like in an anonymous system it's impossible to create a system that funds public goods without creating a system that rewards cartels and the reason is that there's just no way for an anonymous system to distinguish between 10 million dollars of coins split between 10 000 people that are struggling to overcome free rider problems versus 10 million dollars that are split between 10 000 accounts that are all owned by the same cartel that's just one guy trying to funnel more money to themselves and that's you know we in the case of um eos for example you know we saw these scandals about oh you got these delegates and then they're voting for each for for each other and then they're voting in exchange for payments and all of these things that kind of technically break voting systems if you analyze the economics and like i do worry about that kind of capture if we make a system that's kind of formalized in the in the wrong way now in the middle east it's like gamifiable yeah i mean in the middle there's like z cash but then z cash's interest is interesting it's in definitely like big big props to them for just doing that and being proud of that and saying like yeah you know we got a we got a 20 death tax you know what's up man and then i am very proud of them for doing for for doing that so you know great job zuko but on the other hand like they clearly haven't solved the problem of like where to allocate the money because right now they just basically just have this centralized allocation pool that no goes to the z cash company it goes to these individuals and these other individuals and they have hard forks and then these hard forks they can decide to reallocate the pool but then what process do they use to decide and so it is like it's definitely very far from kind of the ideals that a lot of people see a cryptocurrencies having and i mean like that's not just definitely very far from saying zcash is bad or anything like sen it's still a big it's still an improvement over no funding but you know centralized funding is still it would be really nice if there was some decentralized process for achieving the same thing now in terms of decentralized processes and i'm a big fan of you know glenn wiles league like clr quadratic finance mechanism yeah and can you describe that for people um by the way that was a great episode you guys should listen to that yeah so basically the idea here is that it's a kind it's a kind of like spin on one of glenn's earlier ideas which is quadratic voting which is a method for voting which base takes into account the the strengths of of people's preferences and like under certain conditions you can prove that like basically if a wins a quadratic vote over b then a is like on balance like like basically a makes people people altogether happier than b would and the way that liberal radical radical subsidies work is that you have this mechanism where anyone can like put in a pool put in some money toward projects and then for each project there's a set of people that pull that put money into it and then the way it works mathematically is that you take each person's contribution and you take the square root of each person's contribution then you add all of those square roots up and you take the square and you take the square of that sum and then the difference the square of the sum of the square roots is bigger than just a regular sum and like pretty much always if there's more than one contributor so you have some like central funding source like basically cover the difference the way that it works kind of more philosophically like you know you might ask well why square roots y squares y sums is that you can think of it as a mechanism that like basic through the amount of money that each person contributes kind of measures like basically how much they care about about the project and in a certain mathematical sense and then the mechanism itself imagines if there existed a kind of virtual agent that cared as much as all of the all of the contributors that care put together then if how much and that virtual agent was the one that had them that had a lot of money to contribute then how much money would they contribute and that amount is going to be is always going to be more than the amount that people contribute in isolation because this kind of virtual agent that cares as much as all the contributors put together is sort of one agent and doesn't kind of have free writer problems with itself so it's like it's really cool math but the general principle is that it's this way like if you have a pool of money that is kind of designated toward funding kind of public goods as a category then it allows you to choose like which public goods to fund and how much in a way that is kind of credibly neutral like credibly and if not biased towards specific towards specific organizations and would you think about using that to experiment with you know inflation funding yeah and so we are you uh bitcoin is you is uh using it right now and i think it started in the first round in my opinion went really well and it started the second round recently the main impediment i see to just pumping ethereum inflation directly into into a clr is that clr does um depend on some notion of identity um so basically the reason is once again like how do you distinguish between ten thousand people that are suffering from like a free rider problem versus ten thousand sock puppets over the same uh the same like rich guy right and like fake accounts are really easy to get like if you have a phone right now if you go to buy axe b-uyaccs.com you can just like buy like piles of gmail and reddit accounts like just go ahead and look and try like he gets like this is something you've tried no content no like the points like basic like it's important to kind of not being naive about this because you know we're like there are in like regardless of what any of us know there's know we're trying to do there's entire industries of people who expends their entire their lives like as a as a full-time job like figuring out how to grab up these accounts and automate them and then if they rely on cell phones and they have those cell phone racks and they hook them up and like they simulate like clicking buttons and like i mean this is like you know there's pr firms that do this this is like basically there's crypto teams that do this crypto people there's yeah yeah yeah i mean i'm well like did hacking team in do any of that i mean i have no idea i don't know i don't know but uh i mean so yeah basically the point uh the point is that like if you don't have an identity system that's robust then eventually you're gonna have like a guy with uh 10 000 stock puppet accounts taking over this kind of system and using it to drain money and so this does depend on a robust identity system and it also depends on collusion resistance which is the term i use for mechanisms where you don't have the ability to prove how you participated to anyone else and the reason why that's important is because if you don't have that property then you can like really easily bribe people to participate in some way with smart contracts like you can you know like if you imagine for a for votes like it's these like the idea of buying votes is probably familiar to people but this applies to like any kind of mechanism right even like with a clr for example right like if if i throw in ten dollars then i get you know ten dollars square square root three point 3.16 whatever and then square again up to 10 but then if you were to throw in one dollar then three on my ten dollars get square root of 3.16 add to yours 4.16 and then the result would be somewhere between 17 and 18. and so then like your one dollar adds seven point like somewhere between over seven dollars to the total pie and so that would mean is that if you could prove how you voted and that was malicious then i would bribe you three dollars just to throw one dollar into the pot you would earn two dollars and i would still earn more than a five dollar profit so like these attacks exist and there are like worldwide industries that are dedicated to exploiting them so we need to be careful all right yeah so all this if if you ever end up implementing it sounds like it's going to be way down the line because i know there's other things on your to-do list that are higher up um so let's move on um one other thing so we were talking about molly dow uh one other thing that came out of this interview i did with amin who uh founded molly's amin soleimani by the way for those of you who don't know him um he believes that the ethereum community should put a greater emphasis on the price of ether because of its role in securing the network especially under proof of stake and did you see that delphi digital report yes yeah that was super interesting if you guys missed it incredible report but basically they talked about how the upgrade to serenity would rely too much on fees and that kind of put the security of the network at risk and they showed how like a number of scenarios it really wouldn't be very profitable for validators so um do you think the price of ether is important and how much you think about that while you're designing the protocol and working on things like fees block rewards sticking inflation etc yeah i mean i'm gonna be like really really candid because that's the right thing i think like a lot of the at least some of the earlier um kind of rhetoric of like especially veering on the more extreme side of like the price not mattering at all um came i mean in part it was kind of counter signaling to like distinguish ourselves from other crypto projects that just care about that just like do like pumping and lamborghini way way too much but another thing is that it's uh it was about kind of minimizing um legal risk by basically say you know basically trying to kind of make the project seem like seem more distant from like something that would be covered by financial regulation and wow i think um more recently it's like i think at this point um you know it's like people and regulators know what cryptocurrencies are and um they know that it's um good you know they have a price state yeah and there's a there's a cryptocurrency these prices go up and down and there's these networks and these networks you know you can build applications on them and these applications provide a lot of value to people and they um like even like if people try to claim the price doesn't matter at all like they're they're totally gonna see through that right so it's um like i definitely doesn't matter to you i think it definitely means i can i can tell you why like what things are clearly important about like why the the price being higher rather rather than lower for example is good right so one of them is obviously security so if the price is zero the network can't be secure and that's true and proof of work or proof of stake um another reason is obviously that there's a lot of projects um who in the ecosystem that hold cryptocurrency and they um either like and if the price is higher then they'll have more money to do things to do the things that they want to do right and like these are things that are just like obvious and you can like it's just obvious from looking from looking on the internet that the crypto projects hold a lot of their money out of their money in cryptocurrency and they'll be better funded if prices go up but from a network point of view also i know security is just and is just an important uh kind of thing like basically if prices drop to zero then there's no waste there's no way that security can happen so i think like in terms of kind of descriptively explaining like why people do care and it's a it's obviously a combination of those things and then there's people that hold cryptocurrency and they want prices to uh go out uh to go up yeah sometimes i think that's what the maximalistic yeah definitely and but i think like those are i mean like especially the kind of security are a concern is definitely just a totally legitimate technical argument and there are members of the ethereum community that just say that you know ether is a cryptocurrency and they want and we want it to be more of a cryptocurrency and that's something that like the ethereum foundation you know i guess i think it's become clear kind of doesn't even have you know doesn't have a monopoly on ethereum messaging or even a hegemony on ethereum messaging at this point and that's a pro that's i mean that's the end of direction that you know people like molokai and other groups are going to promote then like even there's not much that we can do to stop them even and so so i actually i wouldn't do another poll so if you guys want to check out your phones and also for you on the live stream go to again to slide to eo and i just want to ask you this question do you think ethereum developers are focusing enough on the ether price and uh we'll just look at the results right away because i'm just kind of curious to know what the community feels about that hmm oh okay so we've got a lot of don't cares that's interesting so there is more there's a little bit more yes oh there are some people who just are like i don't know but don't cares that's interesting yeah onion don't care no no okay well there you have it so that's all these pretty so interesting and yeah it is really interesting i think it's um i mean like engineering for you for you know i think also like if it depends on like how you kind of ask the question because there's a difference between like one the thing that i am absolutely opposed to is like for just engineering for pumps for the sake of pumps right because that's just a short-term strategy that's fundamentally dishonest the um thing that i'm definitely in favor of is like not doing stupid things that would lead to the price going to zero so one example of that would be just like having an issuance of like 100 million ether every year right that would like regardless of what other consequences that has that would clearly you know drop the price to zero and that would queer would just be terrible um so i wanna i wanna actually ask you about something somewhat similar because obviously we've gone through this recent bubble this isomania i've heard you express relief that that's over but i'm just curious to know like how do you feel about the fact that a large part of ethereum's success came from the fact that it was used as this launch pad for the ico craze and that's definitely a challenge uh true to some extent um it's i mean to some extent though like icos or something that just was is going to happen on some platform regardless of what platform it ultimately was and you know before ethereum there was mastercoin and other things happen uh and other things happening on bitcoin then before ethereum launched um there was made safe and there were all these other projects that were launching and they were using like kind of bitcoin based second layers so i feel like that boom would have happened regard regardless of what platform it ultimately would have happened on um and that like it's definitely a kind of complex situation that's had a lot of costs and and benefits to it i mean one of the big benefits is just a lot of interesting projects getting funded and you know there's a lot of big ethereum projects that had token sales there was a lot of uh projects uh that did not have token sales but that had tokens that launched in other ways so maker being one example and the fact that they have money for development is i think like if you're just a good and useful thing but then what about the fact that there were that whole other that hold up that whole other space yeah i mean that's like that's definitely one of the biggest costs that there are these projects that were just scamming there were projects that were like marketing just way over the top and excessively there were projects that would uh run up beside me and like take us just take a selfie run away and then claim that you know oh i took a selfie like found founder of um an engine q coin took a selfie with metallic voodoo and please buy our ico right an advisor i even was listed as an advisor yeah there's a bunch of stuff that i'm like apparently an advisor for and there's also in even you know my 10 000 instagram accounts they're all scams um they're yeah and and those are definitely like very unfortunate things and if there was a magic once that could have like shut them all them all down that probably would have been better but you know magic wands don't exist speaking of things that shut things down so i wanted to ask you that over the past year the sec has said in various ways that either in its current form is not a security yeah however from the way they phrase their remarks it seems that they likely would consider the ethereum crowd sale as violating securities laws are you worried about an enforcement action against you or the other founders it's something and so far we haven't seen anything uh anything suggesting it is anything like that happening um i mean we definitely have like our lawyers and legal teams and they're definitely watching the situation closely but so far we haven't seen any reason to be worried for ourselves and is that something you stress about at all um i would say no i mean probably mainly lessening several errors in legal teams at this point all right so um i wanted to to just go back to what you were saying about glenn weil um you know here you have created this 15 million ecosystem but uh from somebody who you know is trying to cover what you're doing i definitely know you have your hands in a lot more things than actually just ethereum um and when i recently interviewed glenn he actually said that um you're his closest collaborator so what are you doing with him and how does it relate to your work with ethereum yeah and in terms of what i've done with him um i've i sent him a a review of radical markets i wrote a review of radical markets that's still like sitting there in the big long 5000 word thing on vitalik.ca i am and worked with him on the liberal radicalism paper i uh reviewed some of his recent posts on you know why i'm not a capitalist why i'm not a statist and like of all of those other things um in terms of kind of concrete items those are probably the biggest but i guess more generally and like i'll actually be touching on this topic a lot in two days because i'm going to radical exchange right after this um but it's um i view the kind of cypherpunk tradition and the radical exchange tradition that glenn weil has created so quickly as being and if two definitely different movements but that's that are still kind of ultimately going after fairly similar goals and the way that i would describe those goals are as being this attempt to kind of synthesize of valuing you know like things like freedom and openness and kind of systems where no and if everyone is on an is on an equal footing and there's no special privilege with an understanding of the value of community and in the um and as far as kind of understanding the value of value of community goes like that's definitely not a kind of universal in the cryptocurrency space by any means right but that's like there's definitely things that kind of ethereum space has kind of cultivated that are almost a reaction to things that other that other people and uh and other cryptocurrency communities have said you know if there's people that literally go around and saying things like oh you know there is no like insert coin name here community there's just a bunch of people that happen to use the same coin and that's what matters and like i consider those kind of ideas totally crazy and that's something that so like i feel like you know there's the kind of cypherpunk tradition especially and if 10 to 20 years ago started out as something kind of very individualistic but then as it started moving into money and moving into crypt moving into cryptocurrency and moving into these other blockchain applications it's um started to realize that like for example even on a technical level like money is a much more kind of inherently social thing than for example like ends to end encrypted messaging and so you know that's and because of that you just you know it's unavoidably have to deal with proof of work proof of stake soft forks uasfs hard forks governance reddit censorship interfering with governance and like this entire mess of messy human issues and coming up with ways of kind of dealing with that mitigating the one and minimizing the worst of it like trying to benefit from the best of it is a kind of journey that we the part of the kind of cyberpunk community that kind of made its way into in both ethereum and other communities as well like including zcash and including and all these other projects probably in you know even though i disagree with their approach including like the the projects doing on chain governance and so forth as well and then on the radical exchange side you know you have people that are like basically you know see things like brexit and trump and all of that and that are basically kind of dissatisfied with like pretty much every kind of major major political trend because they all kind of miss different parts of the picture and are trying to kind of come up with a new approach that like satisfies the kind of ideals of what a lot of people wanted and like out of uh capitalism for example and even out of socialism but does them but does both like both in a way that and at least as they perceive a voice avoids the pitfalls of both of the earlier approaches and so like there's definitely a lot of kind of common strands in terms of people's goals but there's common strain there's kind of differences in terms of people's approaches there's differences in opinions so like for example glenn you know he has this line where he dislikes blockchains because they formalize property without formal formalizing um individuality and that's um um in our space and we have um andreas antonopoulos writing this uh article a couple of years ago where he literally says like against identity and reputation systems so that's one example of like a one of the biggest probably watches between those two but no there's in if they're not literally the same community there's always going to be wedges and it's interesting to try to kind of navigate these two different approaches and see what they can learn from each other so one other thing that i wanted because i mean this is like when i look at what you're doing with glenn it sort of feels like you're kind of branching out just from ethereum to you know trying to do things in the wider world and when i look at sort of where things are going in the wider world and how that intersects with cryptocurrency i feel like i'm reading a lot these days about this fear about the future of work you know automation robots ai and there's now these proposals around things like universal basic income and you know here we work in the space where we have like digital money and ways to dispense of it so so or to disperse it so how do you think blockchains will affect the future of work for good and for bad yeah and i think um i mean first of all if we want a coming up with better solutions to this whole like identity reputation and kind of more generally formal like formalizing community is definitely something that we need to have more work on if we wants to have more high-impact blockchain applications in these areas because like without that you know you can't distinguish like 10 000 regular people from one rich guy with 10 million dollars and that's just going to limit you in this so many different ways so but if you can solve that problem then potentially and you could make a lot of progress so and i think in the shorter term like the main value of these systems isn't so much in kind of formalizing like specific new mechanisms that like entire large portions of uh society will be you know like building on instead of uh instead of corporations or governments or whatever i think like in the near term the thing that's more viable is basically blockchains as a way of making it just easier easier for more people around the world to kind of connect into the global economy and also easier for different you know existing projects to kind of interface and interconnect with each other more so one of the end of pitches that i talk about is the idea that and you can see the people starting to explore this very concretely in the gaming industry this idea that you have like a bunch of small companies that and there's like there's a big incumbent and then there's some small companies and the small companies by themselves have a hard time but then if they can create some kind of kind of common market or interoperability between them so in the case of gaming moving out or trading assets between games in the case of something like financial systems there'll be this different project and the different wallets or different providers or whatever being able to talk to each other and by doing that they can like basically share network effects and kind of stand up against larger monopolists without you know themselves kind of coalescing into a monopolist and i think that's a path that's also in a very socially valuable but then in the longer term like as more things happen on blockchains and as maybe things we have more data more data sources we have more kind of formalization of things like reputation and identity in community than some of these kind of grander and more idealistic visions can also kind of start seeing uh start to see the light and we can really use watchings as a platform for just experimenting in like very different ways of people organizing with each other so i think like those are definitely all kind of good consequences um in terms of consequences that i'm worried about um i mean near term just the whole like i you know the dark side of the ico mania basically and kind of you know more gently and in a more generalized sense also like scams hacks thefts like all of that side is definitely it's definitely an issue that i think we definitely we could be doing doing more to try to kind of fight um mitigate and fight off um i was listening to um this other podcast i think it was software engineering daily um query she did a like an essay where he just read it and it was amazing but it was funny because um he was saying that he feels like in the crypto space we're sort of learning all the lessons that the traditional financial system already learned and that's why they have all those regulations in place and so it's just funny but actually that is another question i want to ask you about and i think this will be our last question actually before we do some q a um we've seen this fascinating d5 trend that's been taking off in ethereum i'm a little bit obsessed with it like for those of you who didn't notice i you know did xerox and dharma and dydax and compound and maker dao i'm super super interested in all this stuff um but some of the the ideas that are being put into place have the echoes of the financial moves that led us into the 2008 financial crisis so what's your take on that i don't know if you saw like maybe one to two weeks ago on twitter but there was this one project that was promising like 5x leverage with crypto based derivatives and iok went on there and criticized them and like eventually i thought they had like some pretty reasonable in the answers to my critiques but i think even still like it's important to do things like that and kind of set the expectation that like we're not here to build things that break um and i think i mean having the dao happen like so early in the history definitely had some positive effects because it's definitely kind of did create like unnecessary sense um a sense of kind of fear and caution though and now it's been almost three years and like it's i mean that's definitely not something that's going to last forever so yeah yeah i'm like i'm definitely watching the kind of the the whole defy space with kind of with interest and fascination and you know i've been like very supportive of a uniswap for example all the way through hide and stand up last week that was a great episode yeah i've been i mean you know things things like maker um it's just a project that's useful and that's so refreshing and great um you know things and auger and so forth but you know on the other hand something will break eventually um actually i mean there's two kinds of breaking right so like one kind of breaking is the kind of breaking the financial systems breaking that people are more familiar with which is oh you have these derivatives and then you know because people underestimate the fat tails suddenly things all go in one direction at the same time then some things break and then other and go bankrupt then other things that dependent on those things non-breaking also break and you have these cascades and suddenly like a whole bunch of systems just fly wildly out of people's expectations the other kind of things breaking that i'm also worried about is uh smart contract code risk so for example this was another case of actually myself criticizing our own community on twitter which i and by the way i i do think ethereums should criticize other aetherians both on twitter and other platforms like it's definitely healthy to you know have the kind of antidotes to the extremes of booster culture and all that but basically where i am someone was trying to say something like oh you know why don't why doesn't pretty much everyone like take their money out of their bank accounts and put it into like a die earning interest on compounds because that pays better rates like why why would you not just get a free three percent and i'm like excuse me free like you really believe that contract has um are you really that that confident that that contract has less than a three percent chance of you um a year of having a bug in it and i mean i honestly don't know how to measure the chances those contracts have bugs in them but i there is definitely like i think more people far too many people that round those risks down to zero yeah well i was gonna ask you about that because you know more than two percent of all ether is locked up in maker dow in these collateralized depositions and or debt positions and i just worry or i just wonder do you worry that that could pose a systemic risk to ethereum like if there's a bug or also there's this regulatory risk because the sec has been making noise that perhaps stable coins like maker dow could run afoul of regulation yeah and from a kind of contract um security point of view um there's definitely kind of reasons to be to be more optimistic this time around like basically because maker down does seem to be doing things much more slowly and methodically than say like the dow did and you know it's and it's it's taken them a really a long time to build everything out and launch and like you know like some people have quibbles with their variable naming styles but otherwise like it's still like on and on balance it seems and it does seem like they're doing things doing things well but at the same time you know the risk is non-zero and it it could happen and ultimately if you're doing a system that's interesting the risk of things breaking is always going to be non-zero the on the legal side and ultimately a big part of that just as a question to a question for the maker dow team but going beyond that like if a very large class of things that people want to do on ethereum like get ruled to be like basically legally impossible then that's definitely going to be a very significant significant loss to ethereum though and ultimately i think it's also important to note that ethereum's value is definitely not limited to one sector like even if this financial stuff doesn't happen they're still ens they're still like and i made that tweet storm a few months ago on non-financial applications of the ethereum blockchain where i talked about um things like certificates and the key revocation and identity and all these other things and i think all of those things are valuable too um and like it's the this like the system is definitely going to be kind of keep on evolving and keep on being used by someone like no matter what happens but there's definitely things that we can do to minimize the risk that people get hurt in the meantime and i definitely you know strongly support like everyone in the community taking it on as a common responsibility to do some of those things yeah well i think that's a perfect place to end it's sort of like just sort of where we are in the system right now so we're going to actually queue up our first video question that was pre-submitted by listeners and this is a super fun one this comes from ben from la if those of you who listen to my 100th episode where listeners contributed this guy wrote and recited a whole poem and it was like a few minutes and it was all about crypto and my podcast i mean it was amazing so if you have not listened to the episode yet his poem was a true masterpiece i highly recommend you check it out and he submitted a super fun video for today's recording [Music] machine to join the early cipher punxi what advice would you give me [Music] i was just trying to tell like is this thing mixing back to the future in star wars metaphors hotel what advice would you give satoshi um github.com slash ethereum 2.0 specs are you serious like you would say this is the advice i'd give satoshi like build ethereum 2.0 i mean it's i do think it's it's a good architecture and that's like you might as well build a good architecture as being the first thing um you know otherwise i you know and if we want kind of smaller and more concrete and more concrete uh one-sentence things um then i think um and if it definitely first of all satoshi had a really hard job because he just could not have predicted not which way the ecosystem would have went uh which way the um like the just the fact that it would turn into anything more than a science experiment and all these other things so i think like on a technical level at least kind of suggesting a path that opens the door to upgradeability to like improve to proof of stake and and to kind of more powerful virtual machines and all these other things by that do you mean some sort of like governance mechanism or not government not a governance mechanism just a kind of just a technical design that makes it easier to upgrade so um from a kind of social point of view i mean definitely to kind of pay attention more to the more to the governance layer as something that could and end up failing and getting captured um like i think in satoshi basically just disappeared and kind of kind of handed it off to gavin and then things went from there and then they're going to spiral out of control a few years later yeah and i think actually oh here's a good one um set explicit norms in writing so like for example and like and set kind of an explicit direction in writing so for example one of the things that we did for ethereum early on is we said you know we want we are going to do proof of stake in charting and we've said that even all the way since 2014 and 2015. and that helped because it like basically creates this community agreements that you know yes ethereum at this time is a chain that has that technically evolves and you know yes this is rough like this the spear proposals that change it in the spirit of those ideas that are saying should be adopted and i think um that kind of social contract of uh like of technical improvement and like even possible of technical improvement in particular directions is something that that has ended up serving us very well and it would it would have also you know it's probably also possibly prevented um situations that could have otherwise led to arguments that could have led to stagnation like you could have been the key if those things had not been said like there could have been a much larger contingent basically saying you know haste group or mistaken square sharding let's just keep the chain exactly as it is or let's go in some totally different direction right yeah so i think um like trying to set a more a more explicit kind of path for future improvements is definitely something that he uh that could have probably very significantly improved the outcome like i can tell why he didn't right like when he launched the thing even in the white paper or somewhere it said you know when something like when the system is launched like the rules are set in stone forever which ended up totally not being true but you know that's this is what you would say if you were someone who just thinks that it is going to be a science experiment and not a multi-million dollar cryptocurrency yes okay so let's we'll do the second listener video and actually after this stephanie can you give me my phone hi i'm chandan lodha from san francisco part of the coin tracker team thanks vitalik for taking these questions and laura for organizing the question is two parts one what do you think is going to be the first mainstream use case for cryptocurrency and second what do you think about facebook's initiative to create a stablecoin and messaging apps like whatsapp thanks um so and for the first one i would say like things i am kind of near-term optimistic about include i mean first of all in the decentralized finance space second of all the i am gaming and like i do mean gaming as in like you know like video games not as in like a euphemism for casinos or whatnot um third um the on the non-financial side like identity credentials key revocation and all of those things um just even you know like the the htc phone like with social key recovery and all that for example like has made me more more optimistic that things like that could be done like basically it seems like there are kind of platforms that are launching that could just like deploy these identity solutions um fourth plus um possibly um an interesting one i like i i got mentioned from the community and um is parametric insurance so this is basically insurance that says if some extreme weather event happens then pay me 500 and this seems like the reason why it's interesting is because first of all it's very useful and it's particularly the sort of thing that would be useful in things like developing environments you know um economies and like generally kind of unlike under financially included communities and all these other random groups of people that you know we have ultimately wants to help but also because it's like clearly actually implementable because it just all that it requires is a data source and you know now we have oracle eyes we have agro-oracles we have all these other projects that are trying to make oracles at kind of different levels of you know centralization and decentralization spectrum so the tools are totally there to build it um so and you know there is this project called hurricane guard dot io that's been like actually building out the thing and the team like i think one of them is based in puerto rico the other two there is a base somewhere else so i do hope to see more things like that happening and then from there i guess we'll see and facebook coin yeah facebook coin um i honestly like don't know enough about it to be able to comment okay all right well we'll do the third we'll do the third video then hi laura my name is frank hutley i'm from the uk where i run a blockchain consulting service called fh blockchain consulting i've been a big fan of unchained for some time my question for vitalik is what would be taught with metallic rooter in university so the the sound on this video is a bit low but he asked what would be taught at vitalik buterin university which is a cool question because you didn't even go to college yeah no um [Music] i mean i guess like it's been like there's different ways to interpret the question because there's like things that people should learn in general but then there's things that more people should learn but if literally everyone in the world focused on them that would be a disaster but my goal is really not necessarily everyone needs to learn all of them um i like one way to answer it is to like just say you know like the things like cryptography and and you know like economics and all of the things that that like none of the technical things of this particular space but i think that's almost not a very interesting answer because like you can teach different things different things but it matters like in my experience it matters more how things are taught and i feel like there's ways like society is definitely society's tools of education are very far from perfect and there's ways to improve them that at least i feel like i've been trying to kind of find do for the spa for the spaces that uh that i happen to kind of be more of an expert in but there's uh but they could totally be expanded to other spaces as well so for example even when i was a bitcoin magazine writer i quickly seized upon this uh kind of seeming like seeming gap that we have where on the one hand we have like popular science articles that are just terrible to the point of being incorrect on the other hand we have i need to be a science writer just fyi [Music] not all popular signs there are articles the um on the other hand you have in all of all fans in a different group of people which is um basically math papers which 10 and like computers anything written in latex um even wikipedia like that category of things which just tends to seemingly just place zero or negative value on comprehensibility and then you know you have that and you have that and there's this wide gap in between of things that are basically materials that actually just actually tell you what's going on and actually like semi-rigorously explain things and like show you know here's like here's the actual math here's how the thing works and now you can understand how the thing works to the point where you can build it but do so in a way that also is actually understandable and is relatable to people who have not taken the exact same series of university courses as the author um wait so i'm gonna have to stop your answer because we've got a bunch of questions that you all submitted on slido and we're running out of time so i'm just going to ask maybe one or two sure the top voted question is a fun one though which is who was your favorite troll in the ethereum ecosystem oh can i see kevin pham you know maybe i'd have to go with the same i actually wrote an article about him before i was even into crypto so that's just kind of a we have a history i guess you could say um all right next one what is the most promising eath competitor in your eyes ooh i know you guys should all be journalists yeah no i mean um in terms of like things trying to do like general computation i mean i've and i tend to find dfinity pretty technically competent um i've um for those of you who didn't hear he was also on my show i don't know if he would use the word competence to describe that interview but anyway yeah yeah you know you know dominic's got like really great stuff on and things like uh threshold signatures and distributed key generation and like he does real like dfinity does can like really contribute to kind of the leading edge of the space and that's something that i really respect when i was learning about like the beacon chain and all that i was like oh this sounds like dfinity yeah so although i think dominic and i we don't want to use the word competitor we use the uh possibly euphemism possible but possibly an aspirational term sister network okay all right so we are we are basically out of time this is sort of a weird place to end we're talking about diffinity but um it has been so fabulous having you um so thank you so much for coming uh to learn more about vitalik and ethereum check out the show notes inside your podcast player this first unchained live was a massive undertaking i want to thank vitalik again for agreeing to be grilled by me on stage and also flying out here yeah i'd also like to extend my gratitude to columbia journalism school for hosting us i'd like to thank our venue sponsor quant stamp for helping to make it happen i also want to give a huge shout out to my event coordinator cynthia helen cynthia back there thank you so much she went above and beyond in every way imaginable to make sure this event was a hit we had a short turnaround time and she really threw herself into the work and endured a lot of unexpected and last-minute surprises and she really took care of everything so i could focus on this interview big thanks also to raylene gullipoli stephanie bleyer stephanie cohen liv bear brittany newman a.d catering kaylynn buckley and tracy ballen and let me just point out this was an all-woman team totally unplanned if you have friends who missed out on the first unchained live let them know they can check out the video of the live stream which will be at facebook.com unchanged podcast if i can i will try to also download this for the unchained podcast website because i have been getting tweets saying i already deleted my facebook account which i should have thought of before you know i'm new with this um if you are not yet sign up for my email newsletter go to unchainedpodcast.com right now to get my thoughts on the top crypto stories of the week plus previews of exclusive podcast content and for the true early birds my book is coming out in two years so
