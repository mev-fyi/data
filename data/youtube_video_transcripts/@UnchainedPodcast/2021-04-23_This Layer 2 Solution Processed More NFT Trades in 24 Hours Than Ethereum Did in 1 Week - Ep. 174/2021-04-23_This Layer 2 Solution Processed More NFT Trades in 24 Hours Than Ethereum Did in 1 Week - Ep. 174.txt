hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the show that reveals how the marketing names and crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines it gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon i'm your host laura shin a journalist with over two decades of experience i started covering crypto over five years ago and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time nir is an open source platform that accelerates the development of decentralized applications overcoming high fees and slow speeds with its fast scalable low cost and climate

laura the link is in the description today's guest is robbie ferguson co-founder and president of immutable welcome robbie thanks laura good to be here quick disclosure before we begin immutable was a previous sponsor of my show immutable recently launched the first phase of its layer 2 scaling protocol immutable x what problem are you trying to solve with immutable x uh we're essentially trying to solve two problems first is gas fees for nfts on ethereum and second is the security of the scalability solution that solves that problem so it's not just make trades free otherwise we could have made a brand new blockchain or run things on a centralized database which many people are doing it's how do you actually create a scaling solution that natively uses the network effects and the security of ethereum and we're the first people to do that so we're very excited so despite these issues which i did experience when i tried to buy my kings of leon nft which it only cost me 60 bucks but then the gas fees were 90 bucks um so despite all this we've actually still seen nfts take off in the last several months and i wondered if you thought this was especially a problem for gaming in a way that it's not for other kinds of nfts absolutely i mean you're putting the words in my mouth so i think the reason we've seen nft's take off so far uh it's mainly been in the digital art category and that category are very high value assets with low trade volume where the gas fees probably don't matter as much if you're trading a 69 million b pool you probably don't care about paying a 60 gas fee but you do care about the security of the blockchain your asset lives on which is why it's really really essential that scalability infrastructure for nfts is built on ethereum and not a side chain or not a competing blockchain like flow so that's kind of our thesis but absolutely what we think x is built for is the scale of if a major gaming company wants to move into nfts they can do so via emittable x and that's because we can hit you know transactions per second essentially of more than nine thousand well that's amazing because obviously ethereum is at i think about 15 transactions a second that's i'm five nft transactions per second okay okay so orders of magnitude higher so how does immutable x solve these issues yeah it's pretty simple actually which is first i want to start with what does layer 2 actually mean the definition of a layer 2 is it inherits the underlying security of the layer 1 block chain so really what we're talking about here is when you perform a trade on immutable x it's game theoretically secured to the same extent that a transaction on ethereum mainnet is and that's really really important because that's the fundamental difference between building another centralized database or building an actual decentralized solution and that's what a lot of the people who come and talk to us care about and also personally i like it because i think that you know ethereum is the place where all the network effects and activity works but back to the actual question which is how does it work it's very simple right now every time you perform a ethereum trade on l1 you are performing a transaction that costs gas you're using work on the ethereum blockchain what we do is we take those trades and instead of performing them directly on ethereum you sign a transaction with your ethereum private key we then grab a bunch of those trades we wrap them into a proof and that's where starkware's proving technology comes into play as our technology partner and we bundle up that proof and basically upload that to the ethereum blockchain um it's in what is known as a validity proof and this is quite important the difference between um fraud proofs and validity proofs so fraud proofs are what optimistic based solutions use and they're a really good fit for some things like especially d5 contracts so synthetics is obviously launching on optimism uh but fundamentally what you need for nfts is a solution which is correct from the moment it hits the ethereum mainnet and that's the difference between a a validity or fraud brace proof is a fraud based proof requires one to two weeks for it to be correct anyone can challenge it or say that it's fraudulent and a validity proof is correct from the moment it hits ethereum from the moment we upload that proof which is essential for nfts because you essentially can't market make or provide synthetic liquidity for people wanting to withdraw nfts because how can i as a market make a loan you were you know a one-of-a-kind things of leon nft or whatever unique instance of that nft was whereas i can do that for say synthetics where you can have market makers providing sort of a better experience when users want to withdraw yeah and so for gaming why is that especially important well if you're gaming you probably want to be able to withdraw your assets instantaneously you also want the security of your assets um to be completely essentially there and and that's the big reason why we weren't happy going to say like a side chain or a new blockchain um but also importantly is in gaming you have the ability to mint nfts as a play to earn scheme so a common progression of games is when you play it you receive an item and reward for your essentially experience um or however you're spending time in the game and what we do is we allow that to be done completely for free so game developers can now mean sort of millions of assets a day and they can use that to reward their players and they're not paying 30 to 50 per asset for the creation of those assets and so on immutable x how much are they paying zero you pay zero for the instantiation of an nft we take clips on when they're traded for value so we make money when the people using our protocol makes money but essentially the way that cost structure works is we pay very significant fixed costs to run the uploading of proofs every year um and that means we're able to make the the trades free for everyone who uses the protocol and then so you're making money on what on the initial sale of the items or yeah the the initial sale and then use it a user tried to value after that oh oh so when you users sell to each other then you make a cut from that oh yeah but the important thing is like those fees are set at a protocol level so if a marketplace were to use us and implement us as a gas free scaling solution for trading their nfts they can put whatever marketplace fees they want on top of that and if a game would use us they could put whatever gaming fees they want on top of that so really the goal is uh we kind of make money when we're processing you know tens of billions of dollars in volume right right like a long tail as other games come to your platform yeah and just for listeners i did also want to mention so starkware is the partner enabling this and they did come on a show i did with dydx because they're also working with dydx and if you're interested in learning more the difference between optimistic rollovers versus zk rollups we did go into that but essentially optimistic roll-ups have an optimistic attitude of assuming that a transaction is good which is why they look for fraud after where zk roll ups is more of a pessimistic view which is trying to be certain from the outset so um so since you've launched a medieval ex on april 8th how has that changed um trading of god's on god's unchained yeah so it's been really exciting it's obviously incredibly pre-alpha if you use our marketplace the front end is a pretty sparse experience and that's intentional we are really just testing does this protocol work in production so our partners can roll out their experiences but it's been way beyond our expectations so i think in the first 24 hours alone we processed more user-to-user nft trades than ethereum had done in the previous week and now we've saved users something like nearly 2 million us dollars in gas fees so we've been really excited the stat that actually really excites me is the average value of a trade is 17 u.s no nft is traded at 17 on layer one because the gas fees as you say are like 50 to 90 to trade a single uh nft so really what we're doing is we're unlocking an economy that should exist that can't right now because of the topology of these prices and gas fees underneath yeah so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about that but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show

and in 2021 that number is growing faster than ever if you're looking to make your first nft check out near's fast scalable low cost open source platform nir is investing 80 million near tokens and community-led projects over the course of five years to power sustainable innovation through its ecosystem with fundraising opportunities and support for dows and dapps to engage fans and reach new audiences come learn why nier is the infrastructure for innovation at nea.org so earlier when you were talking about the different options for scaling i noticed that the immutable twitter account had tweeted quote switching away from ethereum is laughable and you did kind of imply that in what you were saying so just talk about that why did you feel that trying a competing blockchain would not be in line with your goals look it's obviously a bold statement to make but you ultimately have to draw a line in the sand when it comes to discussions of users security for their assets and the reason we are so hardline about this is two reasons one when we initially set out to build immutable we very clearly wanted to build a scaling protocol for nfts and we looked at many many solutions along the way we looked at plasma we looked at state channels days didn't work out and quite frankly i think a lot of people at that time said for two reasons they were going to build competing blockchains with ethereum one was they wanted to own a very valuable protocol and that was kind of the favorite vc hypothesis at that time was you had to build a new blockchain in order to be able to control value on your network uh and two was nothing was scaling ethereum particularly for nfts there was literally no end in sight you know eth2 was years away and then literally i think three months after dapa made the decision to build flow and we were still looking at what to build zk rollups first worked in production on ethereum which was really the first time we saw the light at the end of the tunnel for ethereum scaling and so that was a very clear choice for us because ultimately what is going to govern success is where do network effects live there's a reason that every single eath killer basically hosted their ico on ethereum there's a reason that successful nft projects organically emerged from ethereum rather than being bought by other big chains and i can't tell you the amount of times that a live blockchain has come to immutable and said hey like what do we have to do to get god's unchanged on our blockchain but the truth at the end of the day is two things one is you know a lot of these competitors are basically the microsoft services network to the open internet they're simply going to fail because they closed garden ecosystems rather than embracing what nfts are supposed to do which is an open token standard on a completely decentralized protocol to power the physics of digital ownership but second the important thing is where do users want to trade where is money being spent these things really really matter and ultimately fighting ethereum's network effect is a very tall task people have raised tens of billions of dollars to do it and as of yet everyone's pretty much failed the ones with the biggest traction are also the ones with the biggest risk um whether that's because they've just copied you know um essentially ethereum's virtual machine and and the code running uh ethereum and they're gonna run the same scaling issues that ethereum does without the people building layer twos on top of them uh all because when they take a centralized action because of the incentives of whoever is running it everyone realizes the inherent existential risk associated with that database essentially and you see capital flight of expensive assets so earlier when you talked about some of these microservices network style blockchains would that be something like flow which is more centralized look yeah i think ultimately there are a lot of competing blockchains with ethereum right now and the short way i say it is the only way any of them are achieving scalability right now is by reducing the decentralization level like you don't just magically create 20 000 tps yes yes um that is obviously it's the um legendary what is it called the blockchain tri scalability trilemma so this game exactly right yeah now that you have immutable x what new features can you offer that you could not before so this is actually something we're really really excited about and the short answer is we're obsessed with providing liquidity for nfts what does that mean it means that when a user buys or trades in nft they're getting the best possible price and the problem with nfts is the thing that makes them awesome which is that they're completely unique digital instances auxil makes them suck for liquidity because if i have 10 million gods unchained nfts or a thousand kings of leon nfts i have 10 million individual order books each with their own bids asks and spreads and the majority of them will never be traded on because people only want to buy the cheapest or the most expensive or things with particularly unique provenance so what you need is you need a way to create fundable markets based on the characteristics of the nfts at will while also allowing to retain their uniqueness and people have tried to create solutions to this you know erc-1155 but the problem is then you're just losing uniqueness completely you can never track the provenance of who owns something or who uses something so the thing we're most excited about is metadata based orders we call it which basically means let's say there are 100 kings of leon nfts you can actually trade that set of 100 as a fundable market if you care and if you really just want the one that was you know actually used by someone famous or owned by someone famous you can only trade it on that market or you can instantaneously fire a zero knowledge proof listed on a fundable market that trades based on the characteristics of the nft or you can see the use cases elsewhere whether it's you're taking uh a gaming item and you can trade it based on the underlying characteristics of the asset rather than having a thing unique based on its experience uh or whether it's an art asset this allows us to do the functionality of say open orders like nifty gateway implements um but via a decentralized zero knowledge proof rather than a centralized backend um so this is really really significant and it's impossible to recreate on layer one which is the thing we're most excited about oh that's what you just said is something interesting that i didn't understand before so for erc 1155 tokens there's some metadata that's lost oh interesting oh wow you know what's so fascinating i okay okay because i actually thought that that was some kind of improvement on erc 721 and didn't understand there was a trade-off so that's that's very fascinating but for listeners who aren't aware so an erc 1155 enables you to do something more similar to like um ticket nfts where you know there's probably maybe some kind of general admission type nft uh for some event and so you know there's like a limited number but you know within that class they're fungible um all right so very interesting thanks for making that point so immutable is also now recruiting what you're calling alpha partners what kinds of partners are you looking for are they only other games on uh decentralized games or can there be other kinds of nft creators yeah no not at all uh ultimately we look for kind of businesses uh to be building on top of that protocol because then those businesses can go and get their customers and kind of build their strategy on top of us rather than say if you want to do an nft drop we we can't support you but you know most of the time we're going to be pointing you to someone doing drops run by immutable x so we're really at that kind of protocol level uh in terms of where do we sit in the stack of businesses so the way to think about us and this is often confusing because you know there are a bunch of new drops websites and aggregators and marketplaces coming out of the weeds and we really don't compete with any of those our vision is to be the scalability protocol powering them under the hood so when you perform a trade in a marketplace that marketplace is running that order via immutablex underhood and they're getting all the benefits of ethereum securities for nfts uh or when a game wants to create and trade assets they're doing so by our immutable likes under the hood but you never even have to go to immutable.com they can be run entirely within the context of of the gaming application um whether that's fortnite or whether that's an assassin's creed or whether it's a runescape and that's important because you know fortnite isn't going to send you to immutable.com marketplace they want it to be created within their gaming context now i don't know whether fortnite will end up using ethereum at all um or whether they'll go with their own system but the fundamental perspective is if we're going to make ethereum mainstream for nfts we have to allow people to trade where they want their business to have their users trade and so when you talked about businesses are you primarily imagining games are there other types of businesses that you think would be interesting literally everyone so i mean we're talking to all the major art marketplaces all the major drop web sites uh all of the um we're actually talking to a few d5 nft uh contracts which is really really interesting obviously super farm is using immutable x and they're essentially a generalized minting protocol so that you can kind of create nft reward schemes based on any underlying fundable token so basically if you need to create or trade nfps in a decentralized manner and get the best possible like liquidity and network effects for them come talk to us and we really do service everyone and can you just um get like draw out that example a little bit more with the d5 nft where you said it was like rewards how does that work yeah so i mean the the big category here is there are a lot of d5 contracts and protocols now that using nfts we saw uni swap v3 do the very bold decision to switch to lp tokens becoming nfts rather than erc20s which allows you to denominate the range of price at which you are happy to be a liquidity provider we saw yearn finance issue and insurance nft more and more and more we're going to see huge swathes of financial products being represented via non-fungible asset classes because this actually is it represents a huge portion of value in the real world whether that's you know insurance is fundamentally unique term deposits are unique contracts um a bunch of the stuff that is traded like trillions of dollars per year are traded in in unique manners and characteristics eventually they're all going to move to the blockchain and so those people need a scalable way to do that immutable is purchasing carbon credits to offset the gas that the protocol consumes on ethereum how did you come to that decision it was pretty easy for us uh it was both a decision that we felt good about and also a decision that is good for our business and those the easiest decisions to make so ultimately what we really care about is true decentralization of nfts right which means when people trade in nfc they're trading on the biggest public blockchain that no one can take your asset from like that really matters to me because whoever wins this race now over the next few years is going to be the default infrastructure the digital asset trading for the future universe people are going to live in vr they can be trading digital assets like we we want to make sure that the infrastructure lives on ethereum rather than something that's owned by vcs or rather than that something that's owned by a government so that um that is important and that leads me to the next thing which is you can't have anything holding back people from using a public blockchain especially things like carbon neutrality because every other side chain or um you know public blockchain out there can say that they are completely carbon neutral because they don't use any miners to secure the network like it's very easy to have your 300 computers running a database be carbon neutral you're just paying the electricity costs for 300 laptops and so it's very important that we give that same ability to ethereum itself all right yeah and i just want to remind listeners that actually you know your kind of philosophical stance here um i think harkens back to one of the initial sparks around the popularity of your game which was the hearthstone controversy where um a player on that game expressed his political views about hong kong and um was uh i guess punished for it and you guys uh you know invited him to your game and sent him some money so um yeah so you know a little bit of history there all right so in terms of nfts and gaming what do you expect to happen with immutable x that was not possible before and what might me what might we see from god's unchanged by the end of the year so my time frame six months ago was that mainstream games i'm talking about market caps between 100 million dollars up to 10 billion so big studios would start to seriously look and experiment in nfts in two to three years i've brought that time frame to now and every single uh you know corp dev studio or or strategy studio is now rapidly spinning up a team to say how the hell do we make sure we stay on top of nfts they're now gone from the curious incumbent who is trying to make sure that they stay ahead of the game to terrified that there is going to be a a new way of running digital assets or running digital economies that they are missing out on and also they're seeing this to be a more legitimate way for them to monetize and actually create success for their business they're not seeing it as much of a disruption and more is something that can actually enhance their business model so i think it's that's really exciting from not just a threat perspective but also a hey this is the way to do it better what i think immutablex allows is two things one is we allow that to be done in a way that is dedicated for like i mean you know we built god's unchanged so we would have the perfect customer to build the scalability protocol and also to take on hearthstone as you said but um the the reality is we've designed this for the most complicated use case and the most expensive use case because you want to be minting millions of millions of nfts a day if you're you know a major economy with like 10 million dow or or 50 million dollars what the biggest games in the world are so we need infrastructure which supports that level of scale so like in short what i think immutablex provides is a way for them to access nfts that their users can know will always be secure that they can run a business on without having to compromise around we have to send eyeballs to to here or lose this kind of critical component of our business strategy but most importantly they're going to use nfts now we're making sure that they have a viable way to use it on ethereum rather than going to a centralized killer great well thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed it's been great talking with you thanks laura it's always a pleasure don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this

bitcoin miner is quote an energy buyer of last resort that can be turned on or off at a moment's notice anywhere in the world it then provides statistics showing that unsubsidized solar and wind energy is now about three to four cents per kilowatt hour and two to five cents per kilowatt hour respectively while the average cost for fossil fuels such as kohler natural gas is five to seven cents per kilowatt hour the paper then describes a problem in renewable energy called quote the duck curve in which energy demand is greatest in the late afternoon and early evening while solar energy is most abundant during the day and wind tends to blow more heavily at night while batteries will play a crucial role in storing renewable energy the paper suggests that bitcoin miners are quote an ideal complementary technology for renewables and storage doing so would help more solar and wind projects become profitable enable more solar and wind projects in places not as well connected to the grid and provide the grid readily available excess energy for especially hot or cold and therefore energy-intensive days additionally the paper says it would spur quote a sizable transformation and
