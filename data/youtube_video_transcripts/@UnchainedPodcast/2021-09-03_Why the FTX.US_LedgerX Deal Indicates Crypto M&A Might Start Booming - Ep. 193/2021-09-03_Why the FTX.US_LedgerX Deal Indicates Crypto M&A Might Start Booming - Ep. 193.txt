radio a long time listener first time caller [Laughter] so ftx had some big news this week tell us what that news is and why it's significant right so so ftx specifically it's the us-based exchange ftx us uh announced that they had acquired ledger x essentially a cfdc licensed company that can offer crypto derivatives um bitcoin and ether contracts futures options swaps things like that and it was a really interesting story because in some ways it kind of brings the strategy that ftx international ceo sam bankman freed used to so successfully internationally here into the us ftx us started about a year ago it's it's volume is relatively nominal especially in light of coinbase which typically does over four billion dollars a day in transaction volume kraken's over a billion even finance us buying binance's u.s arm is over a billion dollars and uh ftx us is only i say only but only around 350 million that said once assuming that this merger goes through which um i think should happen sometime around october assuming no roadblocks ftx us will be able to offer uh crypto derivatives to us clients which is not something that any of this other major u.s based exchanges can do so that gives them a distinct advantage and typically also these types of contracts and offerings are much more profitable than than spot transactions so it is a pretty uh it is a pretty important uh deal for ftx us and so tell us a little bit about ledger x in terms of like its history or you know how it came to be in this position sure so i mean ledger x started out a few a few years ago i mean they had acquired these these licenses and they really tried to break into i guess like the institutional derivative space and also the the retail space um crypto derivatives though have tended to be a bit of a slow climb especially in the regulated institutional space i mean they've really taken off internationally in the unregulated space where i mean i i think ftx does something like 500 billion dollars a day or something nominal value i have to double check that that's that but um hi everyone quick correction that steve had me add after the show which is that he misspoke here and he meant to say 500 billion dollars monthly but ledger x really never seemed to kind of rise up to the levels of the derivatives and and ftx's and and finances and and and so on and so forth and it could be due to a multitude of reasons but i believe at some point they just decided look um we have these licenses they are valuable we're not finding the right type of product market fits so this is probably a good time to find an exit and it's hard to imagine i would assume they've talked to a few different partners to find the best deal for them but given ftx's playbook that they can use in the u.s it's hard to imagine that they found a better partner than than ftx us to consummate a deal and hopefully grow the business so as you mentioned ftx is pretty tiny compared to other major u.s crypto exchanges in terms of its trading volume so how do you expect this acquisition to affect that competition between the crypto exchanges in the us so i think right now ftx us is probably going to have a relatively clear length to to do this uh i mean kraken does have a futures offering but the geofence around the us i mean coinbase i don't think has any plans to offer uh derivatives anytime soon although i would imagine they will at some point i mean coinbase actually recently pulled back its margin offerings uh i think kraken still does but but but minimal so ftx us will have some clear lanes to play at of course they have to compete with cme which i think is the third or fourth largest uh derivatives exchange by open interest and volume so they are a big player and they do dominate the institutional space but uh ftx us can can try as well and they also have some more specifically target some more offerings specifically targeted towards the retail market which um traders like um um traders that could buy a contract for as little as about five hundred dollars in uh depending on what the prices are of of that given day i think the more interesting question though here is kind of what does this who should trade uh especially when the retail sector who should trade these instruments and and for what because crypto is already so volatile uh derivatives do play an important role in healthy markets i had a long conversation with ftx ceo sam beckmann freed about this a couple of weeks ago and i mean in crypto just like any other market in the world volume on derivative exchanges on derivatives is much higher than spot and they help as far as more efficient trades price transparency price discovery but in crypto it's a little bit different because the markets are already so so volatile that once you start um offering these products and then putting leverage on top of that which could be 5 10 25 100. i mean that can really create cascading liquidations that really don't do much to help crypto's reputation so ftx us when they start offering these products it's going to be important for them to be conscientious about who they offer these products to making sure that those people have the right level of education because these products can be used to hedge against risk and to lower volatility but it is a more advanced type of product so retail traders that perhaps this is not someone for a retail trader that just perhaps doubled their investment because they bought a token and now they want to press their luck um i mean these are for traders not for for gamblers and one other thing that um i feel is fascinating about this um acquisition at this moment in time is that recently there's been a lot of noise about crypto regulation and it seems to me at least that there's kind of like two camps emerging amongst the regulators and there's the camp that's kind of in favor of stricter regulation and then one that's um i don't know if it's if i would say that they want looser but they're they're more amenable maybe to like adopting new regulations for crypto or you know just kind of letting it play out a little bit uh to you know instead of regulating right now when the technology is kind of less advanced and um we see both of these trains at both the sec and the cftc and um i just kind of wondered how you thought the different regulators might take a look at this merger in the entrance of um ftx into the space here in the us in particular gary gensler's view the chair of the scc has actually expressed openness to a derivatives focus bitcoin etf rather than you know a spot one so i was just curious for your take yeah i mean that that that is one of the the million dollar questions and if you talked against their um talk to officials at cftc i mean they're trying to figure out like where do their the lines of demarcation go like where does each respective story each respective jurisdiction and then it's hard to know i think i think denzel actually asked congress to help decide for them because it is really difficult um the idea of the cftc and talking about an etf a derivatives etf is actually really interesting um i spoke with sam about this when i was interviewing him and i mean his opinion is that one of the reasons that uh gensler might be so keen for a derivative focused etf is because gary ganzler was a former chair of the cftc and he trusts the cme more so than perhaps at other exchanges that um that he operates although some other sources that i've spoken with have said that as far as when it comes to something like crypto a derivative focused etf is not necessarily the most efficient way of doing it i mean perhaps it's a way to shoehorn in the first etf that we'll get but at the same time it's it's much less efficient than a spot one especially for an asset like like bitcoin where custody is really not much of an issue now that we have these enterprise grade custodians and there's too many to to name here i mean i think the cfdc i would anticipate that they've already done some feelers out so they're confident that this deal will be closed i also expect or believe that ftx us probably did not um they looked at how long it would take for them to get this license and they were counting in years and they just figured that would be much faster to kind of jump the line buy this license or buy these licenses from from this exchange and sort of specialize in what each one each one does best so on this particular deal i i don't anticipate it's going to be too um it's going to be too hard to get approval on but it doesn't answer the larger question that i think you raised to me just now so in a moment we'll discuss the future road map i guess for ftx as well as other crypto murders and acquisitions news but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible do you love sports collectibles or fantasy sports so rare is blending this together to

with steven ehrlich so as you mentioned you recently interviewed sam benfenfried what do you think we can expect to see out of ftx um beyond just this week's news i think there's going to be a lot out on the horizon and i mean most listeners every show i'm sure i've heard about ftx's recent 900 million dollar raise the largest private fundraise in history that given the exchange an 18 billion dollar valuation i mean that's a very massive hunting license for them to go after i mean the company itself is already profitable um it doesn't have a ton of overhead aside from i guess like a handful of employees and and and a big tech stack so i really think that sam is and and fdx is going to try to further promote its brand expand vertically expand horizontally vertical integration is actually something that i know is very important to him and it's funny when i was speaking with sam i mean one of the questions i asked is he's recently said he spends about five hours a day dealing with regulators and i kind of asked him to contextualize that a little bit what are the types of conversations that he's having and he kind of said they fall into a few different camps i mean one are regulators in countries where they already operate and they're trying to figure out how existing regulations apply to crypto then there's others where it's a country that doesn't have the right type of regulatory architecture and they want to engage with people in the space that know the industry well so they can have meaningful conversations and he really just said it's a lot of those types of those types of discussions and that also lends to the m a point that i think we're going to talk about in a little bit which is again now that they have this this war chest they can go out and buy companies and and expand they have to make a calculation on whether or not it's faster to to build and get the licenses themselves or essentially import one acquire it acquire the people the local knowledge and and go that route especially with spot exchange the scale is everything because margins are increasingly getting thin so that's very important but but at the same time ftx and i think this is applicable for for almost any other major exchange i mean if their ambitions are bigger than that coinbase wants to be the app store uh i mean other exchanges are looking to offer derivatives and and become market makers and uh prime brokers and and things like that so i i do think we're going to see a period of massive m a in this industry as some of the real category winners and leaders come to the forefront and other companies that haven't really been able to gain that size that that scale are going to look for exits that help reward the shareholders their founders their their investors and and and try to um find find the right threats and are there any particular areas that you feel are ripe for m a and crypto right now or any particular trends you're seeing in that regard coming up yeah so there's a couple of trends i mean i tend to think that we're not going to see the m a surge like instantaneously because the market is doing so well for the most part and most tokens are are going up i mean i don't want to uh general generalize for the entire crypto market but but for the most part we're in a bit of a bull cycle especially recently as it's recovered from its um recent nader but at some point companies are going to have to get realistic about where they are and and where they stand i mean most ico projects are worthless at this point except for the lucky few i don't mean lucky it probably means hard work and a bit of luck in this case but they have to be honest about about where they are and there's going to be a matchmaking process it's the same things happening in the real world where i mean m a activity in 2021 in traditional the traditional financial sector we've seen trillions of dollars in m a deals and there's no sign of it stopping soon because companies are trying to figure out where they fit during this coveted post-covered world and and trying to reorganize themselves and in crypto it's important for firms to also be to also be self-aware i had an interesting conversation with with one of the co-founders at hermes earlier today and i mean he and i was asking him a little bit about the rationale behind the deal um the the 250 million dollar token lockup with polygon and it was really interesting his candor which was basically we felt like we had a really strong product we had great tech but we weren't necessarily seeing the adoption that we were hoping for then um here comes polygon i mean they have a huge brand name they're they're expanding i mean they're seen as the layer two darling and now their ambitions are growing bigger than that and it was just a perfect marriage because polygon wanted their tech and hermes was not going to be able to match their their footprint their mindshare at least in the short term so it was it was a perfect kind of marriage i think there are some questions about whether or not the sec and other regulators are going to care about a deal like that but i mean we can talk about that as if you'd like but i thought the self-awareness was was important and that's really important for companies to be proactive and be honest about where they stand and so that they can find deals that help create value for everybody what i don't want is that if the market starts to to go down and everyone just starts grasping for for life rafts and lifeboats and and we see these sloppy deals come through that destroy shareholder value or token holder value excuse me and and and that would be um poor for the entire industry yeah it's fascinating that a token merger because obviously i mean it was such a big deal and um you know it's unusual or or kind of something new i guess and at the same time we who knew that the sec uh really has its sights on d5 so can you address that regulatory issue that you brought up i was curious to know what you thought the sec might think of something like this so it's it's really funny i mean i i spoke with um sandeep that at polygon i i spoke with um some folks at hermes i mean they both told me that they they really didn't have any conversations with the sec i mean for one they say they're not an american company so they don't have to i i would suspect that some people at the sec may disagree with that categorization uh assuming that just maybe yeah i mean i guess i could probably talk to the folks at telegram for uh for an opinion on that but i mean they are of the core belief that these are utility tokens they're they're not securities they have legal opinions um to that effect they come up to me as very honest people that don't um that aren't trying to skirt any sort of regulations or laws they are trying to do to do the right thing these laws are they are gray the sec just for one because that's the regulator i know the best i mean they are going very slow i mean really the only two tokens where we've gotten any sort of relatively clear guidance our bitcoin and ethereum and everything else is up up for grabs so if you're a company for instance like like hermes that maybe in a year they don't have a year or two of runway left maybe they do i don't know that for sure they get they get this deal like what what would you do is it better to make this deal and hope that the sec gives it its blessing or whatever the regulator is or say you know what i'm too worried about this it's not it's not slam dunk either way but i don't want to take a chance i mean at some point you kind of have to perhaps take a leap of faith uh that said i mean there are some really important considerations with the deal i mean like on the hermit side they control about 90 of tokens so between them and their investors and groups that they know so they did a quick telegram check to see if everybody was sort of okay with this now on the polygon side i mean they told me they i mean this is this is this is out there but i mean they're able to finance the purchase with tokens that they own in their own treasury so they didn't actually have to go to like matic holders to get a sense of what they thought about this but if these deals become more common i mean there are structures for how m a should work i mean there's ways of going out and clearing it with regulators and also getting shareholder approval and and i would imagine that at some point we're going to have to see those types of questions and answered and procedures done if it really becomes a trend which i suspect it will be as this industry matures and we see further gaps between the winners and the losers all right so we're going to totally switch gears can you tell us a little bit about who ferrous chef pharaoh is and how she and her organization were using crypto yeah i'm happy to laura that was an interview that really was fascinating to me as well and and a bit uh personal uh and i'll explain what i mean by that in a second so freshja she is an afghan expat she's actually a former refugee herself uh she's she's in her her 30s her family actually had to leave afghanistan during the 1980s with the soviet invasion because her father was a high-ranking member of the mujahideen which is a essentially the taliban precursor but the u.s was was covertly aligned with them to fight the soviets back then long story short she ended up studying computer science in iran getting a masters in in cs in berlin coming back to afghanistan after the u.s invasion i believe in about 2010 to become a professor of computer science there and um and then ultimately she started the coding school for girls where they learned how to code solidity they learned how to code smart contracts to query data from from blockchains and then once they graduated they would they would get money they would do they would actually get work coding blockchain and they would be paid in crypto i mean it was really kind of a wonderful like these are the use cases we like to talk a lot about making money and investing in crypto but its intrinsic value is rooted in use cases such as this where it creates economic value where none could exist otherwise and uh and then what makes the story even more interesting is that aside from just creating this mini economy with crypto at some point she actually had to fund the school using crypto itself i mean they had used to have a local bank account they had like a jp morgan account in the us and they would wire money over it was expensive but um that's what they had to do they would sometimes use western union it was expensive as well but especially as um in the earlier part of this year when the taliban started to go back on the offensive after the 2020 doha agreement which sort of consummated the us withdrawal that just finished some of those payments started getting wired back due to aml kyc concerns western union i believe since i wrote the article stopped servicing the country which is not unsurprising because everyone's not trying to figure out what the relationship of the taliban is going to be so the school actually now is funding itself entirely with crypto as well so it really is one of those fascinating cases but i mean to be honest um i mean fresh freshdesk would probably be a great guest for your show at some point too if you're interested as well but um i mean this was a very it's a sad story it's a story of hope and it's also one that was a little personal for me because i am a former intelligence analyst myself for the department of defense and and i spent um a large portion of that time working on afghanistan trying to help build support for the transitional government there um combat extremism and um and so it is i mean it is a sad day when when this happens although i'm not i'm not afghan i'm not afghani and obviously it's much more personal for for her than it is for me as far as i know right now the school is still operating but but it's remote it has been for for a while ever since the taliban researchers came and and and i think it's really um too soon to tell what's actually going to happen with it i think the taliban is trying to put up a good front it's true it doesn't want to be seen as a pariah state it wants to have relations with the rest of the world and i think a portion a big part of that's going to be how it treats women and whether or not it's going to allow women to to study to be in government to have professional careers so i'm optimistic she told me she's willing to engage with with the taliban to talk about what she's doing and and i hope she gets that opportunity or at least lets is able to continue operating her school yeah well um i i you know really love that story i i do think maybe i would love to have her on my show so i'll have to get her details from you later um but thank you so much for sharing that

on and off-ramps into bitcoin you can think about this as a decentralized exchange for fiat brock views tbd as a missing piece for the crypto industry which as currently constituted relies on centralized third parties like coinbase and cash up to facilitate fiat transactions tpd plans to build its project out in the open completely permissionless intending to allow any non-custodial wallet to plug into its decks for now brock and dorsey hope to keep tbd bitcoin native however as bitcoin is not a smart contract platform like ethereum or solana the tech stack must improve for tbd to succeed brock mentioned rootstock a smart contract bitcoin sidechain as a possible option for building out the bitcoin decks however he noted quote the gaps needed to build this may be too large which would also have us consider other chains as a bridge speaking of jack dorsey according to mac rumors twitter may soon enable users to tip creators with bitcoin an unreleased beta version of twitter's
