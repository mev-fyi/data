topic is whether bitcoin can be secured by transaction fees only here to discuss are justin drake researcher at the ethereum foundation and vijay boyapatti author of the bullish case for bitcoin welcome justin and bj hi there hey thanks for having me great to finally speak with you yeah yeah i agree so the impetus for today's discussion came about from a previous show i did with justin in which he contended that in the not too distant future like about maybe 20 to 30 years from now he believes bitcoin's block reward will be so low that the system will mostly be reliant on transaction fees and that that that those will actually not be large enough to secure the network since the show that we recorded previously was actually intended to focus on ether as an asset i decided that this topic is big enough that it needed its own show so before we actually get into the meat of that topic though let's just have each of the guests state their background in crypto and also what they do now so that people can get a sense of each of your experience in the field so justin why don't you start yeah sure so i'm a researcher at the film foundation i'm helping design what used to be called ethereum 2.0 basically a set of upgrades to improve ethereum i've been a different foundation for for close to four years now before that i was an entrepreneur building on top of bitcoin through this project called um open bazaar and before that i was involved you know tangentially with bitcoin by running a bitcoin atm and also by um running the cambridge bitcoin meetup group in the uk okay great and vijay so i'm a computer scientist by training i came to the us to do a phd in computer science but ended up at a startup called google i spent you know many years at google i i left to do some political campaigning but came back to tech and i discovered bitcoin in 2011 in a bet with a friend where i won the bet and the bet was for a silver coin but he told me to take the bitcoin and i said what's that and uh i've sort of been going down the rabbit hole for the last decade trying to understand bitcoin and i wrote an article in 2018 uh which i think has become the most read non-technical introduction to bitcoin it's been read over a million times translated into 20 languages called the bullish case for bitcoin and it's been now published as a book so i'm really interested in the economics of bitcoin i've you know studied austrian economics for a long time so i'm a computer scientist with an interest in economics all right so now let's get into the topic of today's discussion and why don't we just have justin begin by laying out your theory for why you think bitcoin will not be sufficiently secured by transaction fees and then we can kind of so you can just you know say that at a high level and then we'll like unpack it in greater detail throughout the show so go ahead okay sure so um i guess you know in terms of uh the basics of bitcoin security we have what's called the security budget um and the security budget is basically the rewards that are given to miners to help secure the bitcoin network and this is made up of two components component number one is btc issuance so btc is bitcoin the asset is just minted out of thin air and given to the miners and then there's a second component which is the fees now to have this 21 million limit what satoshi nakamoto did is that he had a exponential decrease of the issuance so right now the insurance is about 1.6 percent of the of the total supply and there's a halving every every four years roughly so if we look at a multi-decade time span for example 20 years that's five halvings which is the equivalent of reducing the issuance by a factor of 32. so we go from roughly 320 000 bitcoin issued every year to only 10 000 bitcoin issued every year and there's you know relatively good reasons to believe that 10 000 bitcoin per year alone is not sufficient so we need to and and also this number 10 000 will will keep decreasing exponentially so if you wait another 10 years or never 20 years it effectively almost goes to zero so we need um to be thinking about the security of bitcoin from transaction fees only and it turns out that transaction fees are problematic for various reasons one is that they cannot the the total fee volume cannot be guaranteed so you can have periods of time where for some reason or another the transactional utility of bitcoin just dips below a safe minimum and so you don't have this guaranteed security factor that you could have with issuance another problem with transaction fees is that they're very volatile so for example during bull markets they could be more than ten times larger than doing uh bear markets and so you know that that leads to various problems um for example overpayment for security um which is kind of the the the dual um of of of underpaying for for security um and then there's there's more subtle aspects related to transaction fees um for example the fact that they can be stolen so what do i mean by stolen i mean that if you have a a transaction with a very juicy transaction fee that transaction could go in a block a or it could go into a block b it does it doesn't really have to be assigned to a very specific block unlike issuance where every single block kind of have a has a very controlled amount of of issuance and so there are some instances where when you have very high variance in the transaction fees in a given block that the longest chain rule starts to break down it is is no longer incentive compatible for miners to follow this rule and you you start having what we call chain on stability so basically transaction fees are are worrisome from both a quantitative standpoint and also from from a qualitative standpoint uh relative to to it to issuance um so that's that's in a nutshell the the the the basic argument as to why we should be at the very least um you know having the discussion and asking ourselves um will uh bitcoin be be secure in the context of low and low issuance okay and bj do you want to start with kind of like your just overall basic response and then we can go one by one through these points yeah there's actually tons of stuff to unpack and i think this debate is a great opportunity for education in general uh and i i hope you'll permit me laura just take a step back and talk a little bit about security and and and what it means with bitcoin because i don't think many people have really delved into you know what does it mean when someone sends me a bitcoin like what's what's the security around them sending me a bitcoin to do that i just want to very briefly talk about the concept of ownership uh because sending some someone some bitcoin they they own the bitcoin but in our real world we have this concept of ownership where you possess something laura so your microphone in your your house you possess that and we have this social structure around it which is an apparatus of coercion which is the government or the state uh and the government steps in when someone takes that microphone from you so this is kind of an imperfect system of ownership and and what um bitcoin and these other cryptocurrencies are trying to provide is a form of ownership over a digital good which doesn't require an apparatus of coercion now with that background the concept of perfect ownership would be something like i give you laura uh a car or something like that and the car has a force shield around it and no one can touch the car except you that would be perfect ownership we don't have that but we try to get close to that with uh something like bitcoin and the way it works is that when i send a bitcoin to you your ownership of that your strength of ownership increases over time as you have a number of block confirmations and the way you can think about this or try and give an analogy so your listeners can understand this imagine i give you a block of gold or a brick of gold and each block confirmation is like a brick wall that's built around that block of gold and each time there's a new confirmation it becomes harder and harder to get that gold and so if you have a whole number of confirmations then it's very very costly to get that that bar of gold because you have to tear down the wall to get to it and this is essentially the security model that's used by bitcoin and you know various other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies and i think it's important to have that kind of concept in our head that this isn't really binary when we talk about security we can't say when i send you laura bitcoin you have it you just have greater and greater confidence over time that you really have it because the cost of taking it away from you of unwinding the transaction that's sent to you becomes so high that it becomes infeasible infeasible to take it away from you now each brick in this wall that's protecting the gold bar that we've we're securing is made up of two components it's made up of the block subsidy which is kind of the reward that a miner gets when they mine a block and transaction fees so you can think of the height of the brick as made up of two things and over time one part of the bricks uh is going down which is the block subsidy's going down so the size of the bricks will go down and we we don't know how small the bricks are going to go it's going to become the bricks are going to be essentially just transaction fees imagine the brick has two components a green part and a red part and the green part eventually is going to go away and the bricks are just going to be the red part and the red part is transaction fees so i think it's important to have that mental model because uh one thing i think is important to understand justin brought this up is that sometimes we overpay for security currently the bricks that are being put around each transaction are huge because the block subsidy is really large and so uh it's interesting when an exchange receives bitcoin they will say we want six confirmations before we believe that we have the bitcoin because we want a very low risk that this can be unwound and what they're saying is we want six very very large bricks around this confirmation that we received some bitcoin now it is possible there are you know alternative strategies where you can say um if the bricks got smaller you just wait for more bricks right and this is actually true for other cryptocurrencies uh which have much less work put into each block so for instance uh bitcoin cash the amount of mining energy that goes into mining a single block of bitcoin cash is much much lower so if you're in exchange you're not going to say we will accept your bitcoin cash with six confirmations we might wait for 60 confirmations i'm saying all of this is kind of like uh to provide an analogy and to give some context as we as we talk about this discussion uh going forward but my point is it's i think it's important to the bigger point i'm trying to make is that we don't know what the right amount of security is security is a spectrum it's not good security or bad security it's a level of security and that level of security is actually a little bit subjective it's it's not necessarily the same for everyone so me accepting a small payment if you sending me you know a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin one block confirmation is certainly enough for me but if someone's sending you know a billion dollars worth of bitcoin they they the people who are the person who's receiving that billion dollars might want 30 confirmations because the amount of security that they want would be commensurate with the amount or the value that's being sent right but so if i were to summarize where i think you're going with this you're trying to say that even if part of what justin is saying is right or even if someone were to try to attack the network that there was only so much they could do because just the amount of effort to really unwind things would would be far greater is that a fair because by the way justin clearly disagrees with you is making all kinds of uh faces and whatever so i definitely want to get to him but i want to make sure that you know we understand your point uh in terms of this discussion this is only one of the arguments i have there's a whole number of them but most of them center around the fact that i think justin's argument is kind of a static analysis that doesn't really think about the game theory of what happens uh when bitcoin is you know widely adopted uh and it's this this is more just the context to think about how security is treated from a micro perspective rather than a macro perspective from the perspective of someone who's accepting bitcoin they are able to change the amount of security that they want for a transaction so you can conceivably say that right now we're massively overpaying for security like justin i don't think justin can um realistically claim that he knows what the right amount of security for bitcoin is uh i would actually argue that right now we're probably overpaying for security for bitcoin because the block subsidy makes the rewards so high that we have just a gigantic amount of resources being put into bitcoin mining it seems to me that the network could probably get away with less security over time but you know we're going to get into the argument of nation-state attacks which i think is going to be interesting uh and how many resources they can bring to bear but i think my view is that it's not correct to think about security as a binary thing okay so go ahead justin with your response yeah so um vj is correct that security is a spectrum if and this is a very important if if the attacker has less than 50 of the hash power then he is right the notion of confirmation makes sense you know if you have you know six common information that's better than one confirmation etc etc but the if might not hold true there is a possibility that the attacker has more than 50 of the hash rate in which case it is binary is no longer a spectrum the attacker has essentially achieved god mode over bitcoin the the blockchain and one of the things that the attacker could do for example is one of the simplest attacks is simply to mine empty blocks for the rest of time and as such even if you have a bitcoin which is a utxo behind you know a million confirmations doesn't matter you know you can think it's yours in the sense that you can look on the blockchain you know on blockchain.info or whatever block explorer you can be happy that you own the one bitcoin but you're unable to spend it why because all the blocks that are empty and bitcoin has lost censorship resistance so i would i you know i very heavily disagree with the fact that security is non-binary it is binary as soon as the attacker reaches 51 of the hash rate now you could ask yourself the question is it reasonable yes or no for an attacker to have 51 percent of the hash rate and i would argue that yes it is very much reasonable for an attacker to have 51 of the hash rate even today it would be reasonable why is it reasonable and the reason is that at the end of the day hash rate is is can be manufactured it can be purchased and so you can think of it in in dollar terms and so you can look for example um at the hash rate of the the bitcoin network which is roughly 150 million tera hashes per second and then you can ask yourself how much does it cost to manufacture and deploy you know one tera hash per second and you can put a dollar amount to that you know maybe 50 maybe a slightly different number um but let's say that we assign 50 then the the cost to make the most naive attack possible which is to to manufacture you know 150 million terror hashes and then to just turn on all the hardware and in one go and perform a 51 attack is roughly 7.5 billion dollars so that is the security shield right the economic security of bitcoin which in the grand scheme of the things is peanuts right if you look at the government uh like the united states the military budget is 750 billion dollars per year that's for just a single year um so in a single year the united states has a hundred times the budget to go 51 attack bitcoin uh you know gained this this god mode capability um and and effectively remove all the the nice properties that uh bitcoin enjoys today could i just respond to that i i want to um split this debate into like the the incentives to attack bitcoin sort of endogenously versus exogenously which is the people within the network what is their incentive to attack it versus the people who are antagonistic to bitcoin and want to attack it i think it's important to separate that out because i you know justin's making a point which i somewhat agree with but he said that you know when you have 51 of the network you're in god mode and you can do anything and you will you will do anything that that's actually not true there's been any empirical studies where there have been periods of time when more than 50 of the hash rate was controlled by a pool and there was they there was no 51 attacks they never tried to do a 51 attack and satoshi just designed the system so that it's much better to just mine the coins than to attack the network if you're participating in the network there's a huge detriment to attacking if you're being rewarded in bitcoin and you're trying to steal a bit steal some bitcoin with a double spend attack you're undermining the network in which you're being rewarded right but i think what he's saying is this is somebody that isn't participating in the network you just want to kill it but also one thing justin it i i don't think it's true that if you 51 that you can just go to god mode because there's like it's kind of limited what you can actually do and for other minors that win rewards like they can continue adding to the blockchain so um there's this basically three things that attacker can do the first thing is censorship and it can be full censorship as i mentioned you just mine empty blocks or it could be partial censorship so you could imagine for example if it's the chinese government that makes this attack they could say you know chinese transactions can go through or chinese friendly chinese unfriendly transactions and can't go through and so the associated utxos would be essentially lost there's one type of attack another type of attack is is reorgs um so for example someone you know spends bitcoin the the recipient thinks he owns a bitcoin but actually he doesn't really because a re-org happens and the utxo is spent to someone else and then there's the the kind of third type of attack which is breaking down the the like lines so the way that like clients work they're not full nodes what they do is they only check the header chain of proof of work um and for like clients you can you can really fool them greatly in the sense that uh you can make them believe that uh you know they have bitcoin when they don't or vice versa you really do have got mode over these like clients and why i like clients um important they're very important for example in the context of bridges between blockchains so when you have two blockchains uh for example you know bitcoin and ethereum and you want to bridge the two the way you do that is you will build a like clients so for example ethereum you'll have a smart contract which has like client access to bitcoin um and you know we there could be you know billions of dollars hundreds of billions of dollars that are on this bridge and so these these like clients become huge targets for attackers all right let's let's actually um now go systematically actually through some of the theory so the first component at least and this is based on actually what you would write now before the show so if it doesn't match exactly the overview at the beginning that's why um so justin the first component of your theory is about the security budget and the security factor you talked about how the security budget is what we pay to miners total and then you have something that you call security factor which is the security budget divided by the market cap and um so one of my questions for you was since the security factor is divided by the market cap and since both of those are denominated in dollars why is it that you don't think that the rise in price will just keep up with the having of the block reward so that the subsidy is kind of either at the same level or even like a greater level in dollar terms right so there's this there's two things you can do you can look at security from an absolute standpoint you know what is the number of dollars required to attack bitcoin you can also look at security from a relative standpoint which is basically relative to its market cap like how how much how many dollars do you do you need to to break um you know a greater number of dollars um so the the security factor is going to be the um the the security budget divided by the by the market cap and the smaller the security budget the more leverage you have as an attacker so for example if the security factor is only 0.1 percent then roughly speaking for every one dollar that you spend attacking bitcoin assuming that you are successful then you'll be able to break 1 000 bitcoin now if we take the the the standpoint that you know bitcoin will become the the future of money you know that it will reach let's say a market cap of a hundred trillion dollars um then you need to consider nation states um as attackers and if your security factor is only 0.1 percent then the the the cost to attack bitcoin is only going to be a hundred billion dollars and in the grand scheme of things a hundred billion dollars is is is tiny right to to to break the the money of the internet for the whole world so we i mean we kind of went over this but i guess what i'm asking is like so if mining costs and for for like equipment and energy are like somewhat fixed obviously as the hash rate goes there's just gonna be a greater number of miners so in that sense it will the co that cost will grow but like the dollar value of um for like for you know bitcoin uh in terms of the issuance has been halved every four years right so like you would just kind of need the dollar value to double or i guess it's like the mark you would just need the not the market sorry you would need the security budget um just to double in order to keep up with the having of the issuance every four years which like that doesn't seem that challenging to me am i wrong am i thinking about this wrong maybe i'm not thinking about it correctly okay though i think i think you're focusing on absolute security so let's let's let's focus on that so there's kind of two problems about absolute security the first one is that even today absolute security is kind of not satisfactory right we talked about it you know 7.5 billion dollars of economic security around bitcoin that that's not satisfactory for the long-term future you know okay so so it goes back to the nation-state thing it's just like even okay the second problem is that the the happening of of the issuance that's a pro that's an exponential process that's going to last for decades we cannot have the price of bitcoin go exponential for decades it has to stop at some point like you can you can't have for example a bitcoin as an asset to be 100 times larger than the rest of all the assets in the universe combined right there needs to be a point at which you know bitcoin has reached maximum penetration and maybe that's on the order of 100 trillion dollars that's kind of the best case scenario maybe for bitcoin um beyond that point you know it cannot double every four years the exponential has to stop somewhere okay okay let's actually so there are so many components to this let's just actually keep moving because this one was also really uh interesting yeah um so i i actually agree with the point you're making which is what really matters is the purchasing power of the security budget uh not necessarily denominating in bitcoin terms and say this is a tiny fraction of the market capitalization of bitcoin it's how expensive is it in real terms to attack the bitcoin network i think that's important i think justin's making the point that as the market capitalization of bitcoin goes up the incentive to attack the network goes up uh but incentive and increasing incentive doesn't necessarily mean an increasing capacity to attack the network so i do think it the absolute security of the network is an important factor to consider the other thing i think is really important to think about is this is a sort of theoretical analysis and i think it's really interesting i you know i think justin has laid it out really well but i think it's much more complex than this because you have to start thinking at this stage if the mental model is okay this is so big that nation states want to attack it we need to think about the game theory of that as well right it means that a lot of nation states have probably adopted bitcoin and they have a stake in bitcoin and they care about bitcoin you can almost imagine a sort of sci-fi future where uh you know one nation state sit drops bombs on the mining facility of another country that's trying to attack bitcoin because they have a stake in bitcoin the us for instance might have uh bitcoin as its reserve currency and china is attacking it and so they go drop bombs on the mining facility in china uh so the game theory is much more complex we need to think about stakeholders we need to think about how individuals in these countries will react who own a lot of bitcoin like imagine the united states government decides we want to attack bitcoin but all of the large financial institutions have a massive part of their savings in bitcoin are they going to allow that to happen would they just sit by idly uh from you know theoretical model it's interesting but in reality people are going to lobby and people are going to put political pressure and and this is going to this is going to be true at the nation-state level as well uh political pressure can come in various forms it can come through military mind it can come through lobbying yeah it's almost like so the game theory is quite complex and you know justin's bringing up a very interesting theoretical model but we need to sort of expand our scope here and if we are talking about the case where bitcoin has become so big that it's the reserve currency of the world or something like that yet the uh block subsidy is decreased to a very low level it's mostly transaction fees there are two things there it's the security budget versus the adoption and does the adoption itself provide protection the fact that people have a financial stake in this imagine for instance like the uh politicians in the us try to ban 401ks outright just banning them and saying all your 401ks are confiscated what do you think would happen you'd have riots on the street in america um so that that's certainly something i think we need to uh consider here as well yeah it's like if it gets to the point where a nation state does feel the need to 51 percent attack bitcoin then it's like they already lost at that point you know so well and there is one other thing i i want to bring up and you know justin and i have spoken about this uh a few days ago i think it's important to understand that there is a nuclear option here as well bitcoin has a proof of work function which is sha256 it's a sort of formula that is used to by miners to calculate whether they've got the right pattern to win the block reward under a extremely grave situation it would be possible for participants in the network to say we want to change our proof of work function what would that do to an attacker every machine that they had bought all of the electricity that they put into attacking the bitcoin network would instantly be worth nothing it would wipe away the value instantly so you need to think about the participants in the network as well people who have a stake and who would say the value of our bitcoins are being attacked what can we do we can change a proof of work function that's a nuclear option which would be very contentious because people you know there's a fundamental building block of bitcoin but in an extreme situation you could imagine something like that happening you could also have people in the network just rejecting a particular chain if you have a chain split where you have an attacker trying to double spend uh and building on their own chain each individual node can say i am not going to accept this chain so you have this internal game theory as well what do people who are stakeholders do when there is an attack that's the part which i think is not really being brought up or thought about and it it's very complicated because we don't know exactly how that would work people behave in all sorts of crazy ways and you know we saw in the um bitcoin block size war that happened in 2017 there was all sorts of crazy game theory where people like the miners were saying look if you keep mining the legacy chain we're going to try and kill your chain we're going to use that power to kill your chain and it wasn't clear what exactly would happen so there's a lot of complexity to think about but we need to focus on the stakeholders as well okay so in a moment we're going to get justin's response to this but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible ledger is

with justin drake and bj boyapotty okay justin what are you what's your response okay so i have a few thoughts um the first one is that you know which i i agree with with vijay you know that we should be looking at a skin in the game you know if you have a government for example that wants to attack bitcoin we need to understand how vested they are in bitcoin now it turns out that you know there's going to be some nation states which are maybe overweight bitcoin and some nation states which might be underweight bitcoin so just just to to illustrate what i mean by overweight underweight let's imagine for example that bitcoin is 20 of the world economy but that in a specific country for example like china it's only one percent of china's economy in that situation china would be underweight bitcoin it's not un implausible for china to be underway to bitcoin in 20 years why because they're preventing banks from dealing with bitcoin they're preventing exchanges from dealing with bitcoin they're preventing miners from dealing with bitcoin um and who knows um you know you know the trend is pretty clear that they don't want uh bitcoin to be a large part of the economy so they want to be underweight bitcoin in this situation they have relatively low skin in the game and they actually have an incentive to go attack bitcoin because they're essentially short bitcoin there's a bit of game theory here to adoption as well i think if you look at the gold standard you can say look we don't want to be on the gold standard but eventually there's a massive financial disincentive to not be on the global standard uh you know in the 19th century eventually everyone adopted the gold standard because by not being on it and when everyone else is using it you're harming yourself and your own nation you know some nations will try to pursue a path of ortaki which is like completely enclosed having a closed economy doesn't interact with anyone there there are massive economic costs to that my view is that bitcoin will eventually become the world reserve currency because it has the properties that make it suitable as a world reserve currency and the nations that are lost in line might be upset because they didn't get the biggest benefit from jumping on bitcoin early on but they'll just inevitably have to adopt bitcoin if they want to be part of the global market well i i agree with justin that they could china is a good example simply because of how long they've resisted the normal internet but i could actually see two scenarios one would be that they would attack bitcoin because they don't have it and um other countries do and it's like no um you know uh nothing off their back if they attack it um but i could also see that you know if they do want to unseat the us dollar as the global reserve currency then actually maybe they would um start to suddenly embrace it so i actually could uh you know see it going both ways but anyway justin did you want to continue with your response and and your yeah yeah sure that's that's one aspect you're trying to to look at a skin in the game and um you know you your response vj is that you know it it harms them to not have skin in the game but you know that that's that's based on the assumption that bitcoin will be you know the the winning monetary shelling point for the internet and you know the whole the whole reason why we're having this this discussion is maybe to to to to put that to to a test because if if you want to be the monetary shuttling point uh for the internet you need to have predictability and as such you need to have predictable security for you know decades and centuries to come and and this is not something that bitcoin provides um um out of the box the other point i wanted to make besides you know skin in the game of government is that this is not only a game of governments attacking bitcoin is a game that is accessible to individuals right not it would be rich individuals but individuals nonetheless so we could look for example at you know elon musk he has several you know whatever it is 50 times the budget to go attack bitcoin single-handedly this is one single entity um you could look at large entities like like strategy right micro chassis g have over a hundred thousand uh bitcoin and they have no plans to sell them right it's accumulation only and so maybe in 20 years they might have 200 000 bitcoin and that would be 20x the annual issuance and so if for some reason or another you know this this this one entity is is compromised uh you know maybe they're hacked maybe they're under pressure by some government or whatever it is then you know they would have multiple times the budget to to to go out to go attack um bitcoin so you know this is not just a game for um nation states it's also a game for for large um individuals then another point that vj put forward is that we always have the nuclear option to replace proof-of-work and i don't think that's true i think this is a a flawed um kind of argument and and and the reason is is as follows if you were to replace uh proof-of-work what would you replace it to now you don't have time to go build um another proof-of-work system you know that's based on asics you know that's the maturation process which in the case of bitcoin you know it took many many years um and so what you have to resort to is basically proof-of-work on commodity hardware now what type of commodity hardware do we have we have basically three types we have cpus gpus and fpgas that you can just go buy off the shelf and use for for proof of work now let's assume that it's it's one of these three doesn't really matter let's assume it's it's gpus well that's not that's not going to be sustainable defense in the sense that the attacker has now just simply has to buy whatever it is 10 billion dollars of of gpus and tada now they can go attack uh bitcoin and now you could you could think to yourself aha well we could we could do the nuclear option another time right and we could change proof of work another time but what i what are they going to move to you you know we no longer have these the asic you no longer have gpus so now you don't have to go to cpus and then you might do it again in fpgas but then you've now you've run out of options you you've covered all your commodity hardware and and and there's nowhere else to go to go hide in terms of changing the the proof of work well you have to think about the context in which this argument is being made but bitcoin is like widely adopted and you switch the proof of work function everyone who has bitcoin and is a stakeholder uh suddenly switches to mining on their computer and so you have millions or tens of millions of computers on commodity hardware mining and somehow this attacker needs to uh accumulate that number of uh computational power that's being used by all of the stakeholders of bitcoin who want to defend the network i i think that it's not it's again something which isn't like uh that you can do immediately like a an attacker can't suddenly accumulate tens of millions of computers and put them in a uh a mining facility and start attacking again i mean i think that's very very implausible now i think the the the model that you bring forward is implausible so there's basically three types of models like like that you could try and put forward when you look at bitcoin security there's there's basically the the honest majority so what that means is that basically you have uh you know the the majority of the network which is honest like generally this is not seen as a as a realistic model and so you you want to go to the uh the rational majority so the the match the rational majority will only mine you know to defend the bitcoin network if it's if it's if it's rational to financially rational to do to do so but the thing is that they only it's only rational if the the the cost of of doing the mining is is smaller than the rewards that they get but you know the whole context of this discussion is that we have low issuance and we have totally unpredictable fees and potentially extremely low fees during during bear markets um and so there will only be so much uh mining power that will that will be rational and so what you're assuming is you have altruistic miners so these are miners that are willing to pay to secure a common good and and the problem with with common goods is that you have the tragedy of the commons um and you can't just assume that people will altruistically burn tens of millions of dollars every day um to secure a network which and and for which the action of doing so doesn't benefit them directly it's only benefits this common good where we have a tragedy of the comments yeah and even just on a coordination level coordinating millions of people to do something is like really really difficult but anyway vijay what were you going to say i want to also talk about another part of justin's argument that i have a bit of a problem with which is the idea that we've done a historic justin's done a historical analysis of transaction fees over time as the the block subsidy has decreased and it hasn't dramatically increased i i think uh it's important to understand bitcoin's path to becoming the global reserve currency because i think that plays into it as well like people's usage of bitcoin now isn't what it will be in the future uh there is an evolution of money where money goes from being uh and i talk about this in my book it goes from being a collectible to being a store of value then a medium of exchange and eventually a unit of account this is a big misunderstanding a lot of people had when when bitcoins first created they thought oh this is a medium of exchange we should be using it for buying and selling things in commerce and they were really confused why no one wanted to do that so part of the the reason my i believe that we don't see you know a really large increase in transaction fees right now is that bitcoin is transitioning through this phase of becoming a store of value it's a nascent store of value and people largely use bitcoin as a means of savings they don't move it around very much i think this is going to change over time i think eventually bitcoin is going to become more of a medium of exchange and as it does we're going to have much more movement and much more transaction fees ultimately though i think most medium of exchange usage is going to happen on second layer networks and that what bitcoin at the base layer is going to be used for a settlement between banks so large financial institutions are going to settle with each other on a daily basis so jpmorgan and and citibank for instance will settle three billion dollars worth of bitcoin on a daily basis because they their customers are sending funds back and forth and they'll have some uh difference in balance and they'll settle with each other on the blockchain once we get to that stage i think the the fees that are going to be used on the bitcoin network are going to be much much higher uh this is under what i think will be a bitcoin global reserve standard and i think we could easily see bitcoin fees in the thousands or tens of thousands of thousands of dollars because people are settling very large amounts of money uh and i think the demand for the block space will be much higher in the future than it is now which is going to drive transaction fees i don't think the historical analysis is uh you know what they say in the stock market um past performance doesn't guarantee future returns i think past transaction fees for bitcoin doesn't necessarily get you know predict what the transaction fees are going to be in the future i think that really is because of the stage of monetization that bitcoin is in prime primarily uh a means of holding savings and justin's talking about how you know the fees go up during bull markets and go down during bear markets this again is part of the process of monetization it happens we've kind of learned we've never seen this before by the way we've never seen a monetary good being monetized in real time in the space of like a few years or a few decades the process of monetization for gold took millennia and we see it's a very compressed time frame what we've learned is there are these hype cycles and and i agree with justin that you know the uh the the transaction fees increase during the boom phase or the parabolic phase of the uh hype cycle because people are just trading back and forth in this speculative frenzy uh and using the block space just to move to exchanges but that won't be true in the future but these hype cycles are going to diminish in magnitude as bitcoin becomes more widely adopted we're not going to see a hype cycle in 20 years from now where bitcoin drops 90 as bitcoin gets to the market capitalization of gold and surpasses it as i believe it will its volatility will be commensurate with the volatility of gold and eventually decrease below that volatility uh so the model that we're thinking about is like a sort of looking in the rear view mirror it's not looking forward uh to look forward we need to think about how will bitcoin be used what implications will that have on transaction fees how much demand will there be for block space and i think all of those things are going to change very dramatically as bitcoin becomes adopted by financial institutions by nation states by wealthy individuals it's going to change a lot justin what's your response yeah so i guess my first response which is kind of qualitative is that it's for me at least as a kind of designer of blockchains as it were it's unsatisfactory to have the security of the blockchain rely on something which is unpredictable and it's almost as if bitcoin is assuming the best possible case for bitcoin you know is going to be money for the internet and you know in that situation you know and this very large transaction series then you know maybe bitcoin can be can be secure but you know that that is quite a bit big if right um but you know i'm happy to make that assumption i'm happy to you know put aside you know the past which is the past and which doesn't predict the future i agree with that and i'm just assuming the best case scenario so let's assume that the bitcoin network is the bitcoin asset sorry is worth a hundred trillion dollars um now let's say that um we want to have a security factor of one percent one percent by the way is smaller than the current security factor which is at 1.6 now because there's only so many transactions that the bitcoin network can do every year because of the the block limit which is fairly small it turns out you can only do roughly 100 million transactions every year on bitcoin and so to achieve this one percent security factor as vj said you actually need 10 000 average transaction fee now ten thousand dollars is an insane amount of money to do one single transaction even in the context of settlement now one one of the the the reasons is that there are ways to settle other than doing a transaction on the layer one bitcoin blockchain and if you have two ways of settling and one is significantly cheaper than the other then you will go with the cheaper one that's just the rational aspect of the model that we have the rational players now let me give a you know an example right you have um you have a a a a lightning channel right um when you make a a transaction you know you want to let's say settle some amount on the on on the lightning network um that doesn't accrue fees to the to the bitcoin network or you want to settle on the liquid network or you want to settle for example wrapped bitcoins on on ethereum or there's various other ways to settle then to use the the layer one so i think there's basically three three big assumptions assumption number one bitcoin will take over the world um assumption um number two that even if there was no alternative to settling and the only way to settle bitcoin was using layer one that these these uh institutions would be willing to pay ten thousand dollars per transaction which is questionable but three that there's no competition to the settlement of of bitcoin um that that i don't think is is true i think there's a disagreement of terms i mean i think the difference there is a huge difference between payment and settlement like using the lightning network to do a payment is not the same thing as settling in uh settling bitcoin settlement of bitcoin is having confidence in final possession of the bitcoin that you think you own uh like financial institutions in in the 19th century when they're under a gold standard they had customers paying back and forth with pieces of paper but that didn't mean that they believed they had the gold they had the gold when they settled the gold and when the gold was you know entered their vaults and they had the gold the equivalent for bitcoin settlement on the blockchain like a lightning payment is definitely not a form of settlement i would i would disagree um when you like the lightning network is designed in such a way that um you know receiving x amount of bitcoin through the lightning network is essentially the same as receiving the real thing like it's designed to be trustless it's um you know that there is this this this one one assumption that basically the the base layer is sensitive resistant but if you have that layer that which you need in order to have you know this monetary status then the lightning network is designed such a way that that bitcoin that you receive is is as good as the real thing and so um you know transactions on lightning are effectively settlements at least from a security standpoint i mean the one thing i will say about what vj said was um the idea that bitcoin will be a settlement layer for big banks i think is um it just means like we're sort of in the same system we are now where we're all bank customers and um we don't you know like it like this technical it's almost like the technology nothing changed at least from the user point of view and so in that regard like i feel like that i i think i would disagree with that i think that something very important changed which is that the money is not owned or controlled by any government and can't be inflated that's very very different to uh what's currently the case which is banks settling with each other using dollars because the underlying underlying monetary system that's being settled on is uh very easily politically coerced very easily inflatable uh this is where i think the biggest impact of bitcoin will be is that it is a new monetary standard that can't be inflated and it can't be politically manipulated the fact that we have a financial system on top of it i think is inevitable and hal finney um the guy who received the very first bitcoins from satoshi wrote about this all the way back in 2010 he said we need second layer systems we need banks on top of bitcoin because bitcoin is designed in a way that it's very hard to change and satoshi wrote about this a long time ago as well he said as soon as bitcoin version 0.1 was released it was set in stone it's designed in a way that's very very difficult to to change uh and that's a good thing because we can rely on bitcoin's inflation schedule we can rely on the fact that there's only going to be 21 million bitcoins it was easy to change bitcoin as it i think very easy to change a whole most altcoins um i have no trust in their inflation schedule so i i don't think the fact that the financials you know institutions that are built on bitcoin look somewhat similar i think there would be big differences for instance they'd be like using lightning instead of using the federal reserve that doesn't mean that the change isn't profound but very geopolitically profound to have a different monetary base which is non-political and non-inflatable and but then when you said like it'll be jp morgan settling will i as a customer of january we're giving examples it won't be jp but like so will i be transacting in in bitcoin on my end or will i still be using dollars you will probably be using the lightning network and you'll be connecting with some uh node operator on the lightning network okay and that that maybe jp morgan it may be someone who's currently building out their lightning node now i was kind of just giving it it's probably not jp morgan yeah i hope it's not jp morgan but yeah but well also they're doing their um shoot quorum or well i guess they sold that to consensus but anyway okay justin i think you wanted to respond yeah um i think vijay is is heavily downplaying the the lack of self-custody um you know i see it as a as very problematic for bitcoin i mean in a similar way that a lack of easy self-custody for gold um you know didn't turn out so well for for gold right gold has all the properties you know that that vj was talking about it can't be controlled by governments it can't be inflated away and yet gold hasn't you know really succeeded um in in modern society and part of the reason i believe is because it's difficult to self custody gold and so what happens is that you have banks right you have these financial institutions just like the future that vj is talking about and the problem is that these central entities now become pressure points right so they become pressure points for for for for governments to start um coercing and so you know um one of the beliefs of the the ethereum community is that you know you can only achieve true resistance to coercion from governments if you remove you know these these custodians and you have self-custody um of your of your assets um i mean another thing that that that vj talked about is that you can rely on the 21 million limit um and actually i i think this is a an illusion a dream i think it's a meme that has weak fundamentals and the reason it's a meme with weak fundamentals is precisely because of the topic of of today's discussion which is security if you have an asset which is insecure then it's it's its basic livelihood is is is jeopardized and so basically what i foresee is the situation where there's going to be two bitcoins like the unsustainable bitcoin from a security standpoint will continue on living and then there might be a group of people who say hey we're going to fork out the 21 million limits and we're going to have sustainable bitcoin and then guess what market forces will come at play the unsustainable bitcoin will you know likely die off because it's it's insecure and then the the sustainable one will be the next best thing that we can have because you know we don't live in an ideal world and we can't always have the dreams that we dream and so in that situation where you know the sustainable bitcoin wins out uh you've effectively been debased um and this is kind of the there's a saying right that uh you know faith loves irony and it's you know that the bitcoin um the bitcoin philosophy is to try and and and be as as ossified as possible kind of for the sake of ossification um but it it it's quite uh possible that the the premature ossification of of the the bitcoin network will lead down the line to a necessary change and so bitcoin in that sense has sacrificed long-term predictability for the benefits of short-term predictability in the short term um you know we can predict what will happen but at some point things become so unsustainable that something has to change and one of the easiest things that could change is simply removing the 21 million limit well and in that instance would it then become just a perpetual issuance or is that what you would propose yeah i think a one percent um tail issuance um is is a is a pretty good um you know design um at least it provides a guaranteed security factor and this is something that i believe other bitcoin is i think this is uh vijay told me this that uh it's one of the the the the things that uh peter taught not i agree often with peter todd but in this specific instance uh peter todd wished that bitcoin from day one had um you know this tail issuance to provide guaranteed uh security factor okay so pj do you want to give one last response because um i mean by the way you guys i had like so many questions and um we didn't even get to all i mean i think we hit on most of the topics this is just like there's just so much to it but there is one last question i do want to ask after bj gives his last response yeah i i don't want to get too wedded to this idea i think you know part of you your response to justin's response to the financial institutions was like oh you know everyone's going to be using jp morgan i think it would look very different that there'd be far more financial institutions and there would still be in some individuals who did self-custody bitcoin but if you look at it mathematically it's simply not the case that everyone is going to own on-chain bitcoin it's just impossible there are 8 billion people uh there are 21 million bitcoin and a person owning that tiny tiny fraction of a bitcoin is not going to be able to transact that bitcoin it's just not going to work so some very large fraction of the world's population is going to own bitcoin through custody through a different kind of financial institution a much smaller i think financial institution they will interact with someone who's on the lightning network the other thing is i think bitcoin is not going to change the 21 million supply limit i don't think it's ever going to happen i think bitcoin is treated much more like a protocol than as a piece of software i think ethereum is treated more like a piece of software than as a protocol and the difference is with protocols immutability is incredibly important i'll just give one quick example there's a protocol for power sockets in the united states which is the shape of the power socket and all the devices that use it you do not want to change that protocol you don't want to change the shape of the power socket because everyone who's using that power socket is suddenly unable to use it now you can make backwards compatible changes so for instance with the power sockets in the us there you didn't used to be a ground they added a ground which didn't make it so that all the devices which used the old power sockets couldn't use them anymore so bitcoin has this philosophy it's a value transfer protocol and it's incredibly important to stay backwards compatible it's very strongly ingrained into the culture of the community and i think if you embrace a different culture where oh we can just change the protocol whenever we want the trust in the protocol that you can build on the protocol is severely undermined and the properties of the protocol so ethereum for instance has made the so-called ultrasound money by changing the issuance of ethereum i think this only proves that because sorry ethereum's issuance can be changed and could potentially be changed in the future if enough people in in the ethereum development community became keynesians and started you know subscribing to keynesian economics and said well we need really good inflation here because we believe that's required for growth then that could happen i think that that's a big difference and i think uh that's one of the reasons that bitcoin is is not going to change is this belief that it's a protocol not that it's a piece of software okay so i'm i'm glad you brought up ethereum because this was the last question i did want to ask um justin you said in the last show that we did that you felt ethereum was the fulfillment of satoshi's vision and as i'm sure we all saw on social media that was a very controversial statement to say the least i mean i knew it at the moment um i was trying to wrap up the show so i didn't want to go there at that time um but can you explain what it is that you mean by that yeah sure um so one of the things that so by the way i regret using the term satoshi version because there's literally a project called satoshi vision and i didn't mean to like align myself that project at all if anything um but yeah after the show one of the things that i did is i i tweeted satoshi's very first commit right so we have um you know a very good record um of uh satoshi's very first piece of of public code for for bitcoin and one of the things that you'll find and this is not at all kind of obfuscated or hidden in any way like in in the code satoshi was thinking of building a marketplace on top of bitcoin when you want to build a marketplace you basically use money as one of the lego blocks but you're gonna need many other decentralized lego blocks in order to get a marketplace running you're gonna need decentralized identity you're going to need decentralized escrow contract you're going to need decentralized stable coins you're going to need decentralized reputation you're going to need decentralized file storage there's lots and lots of things that you are going to need to build in order to get a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace which was the vision of satoshi literally in the code the very first commit um that he he put forward for bitcoin now unfortunately bitcoin has become well maybe not unfortunately but the the the fact of the matter is that bitcoin has become digital gold now gold is this very interesting asset it's a it's literally a rock a shiny rock that you spend a ton of energy to get out of the ground dirty ground and then you just put it back in the ground just in the vaults of some of some bags it's kind of this this somewhat crazy concept but you know that that's what money is um but the the thing that's a little bit disappointing is that it's not a lego block in the sense that the idea of bitcoin is that you hold it in a vault for decades and you just don't touch it you just look at it it's shiny and you you enjoy just looking at your your pet rock um in the context of of ethereum we we're trying to build you know these money legos that's literally what we call them and we want to stack them together and we want to build cool stuff such as decentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces and by the way this is part of the reason why i was working on open bazaar is because i i felt you know that this was kind of pro choice vision um and i wanted to to help out it turned out that i was maybe 10 years too early right all the building blocks were not there you know we had escrow contracts with bitcoin script we had bitcoin but we don't have you know many of the things like stable coins and a reputation and identity and all these other things so yeah long story short is i i see the opportunity kind of this this total addressable market for for blockchain technology to be maybe a hundred x larger than this this this digital um gold aspect which is interesting uh but you know in the grand scheme of things is is uh missing the missing the big picture and missing the the wider opportunity and vj what do you have to say about that i think ethereum is a big experiment as a computer scientist i think it's doing something that i i think is actually not possible i think you that you know the saying smart sexy saying pick two i think there's equivalent for blockchains which is decentralized turing complete and scalable and uh i think ethereum is trying to be all three but one of them is going to fall apart and i think the thing that will fall apart with ethereum is the decentralized aspect i think there's another problem with ethereum you know sort of taking this approach of this is cool software and we can upgrade and we add all of this stuff is that anyone can do that too if it's a piece of software if it's not something that's immutable and you trust it and you believe that it's something you can store value in and you you have these other projects coming along saying oh we'll just copy the things that we like in ethereum and add all this new stuff if you're an ethereum and you're trying to make a change to you know help the scalability because ethereum right now is almost unusable with the fees on ethereum if you worry about fees uh i don't worry about fees as a settlement system but i worry about fees if i'm trying to do these tiny smart contracts the fees on ethereum are insane right now so you have these other platforms coming along like solana saying we can do the same thing with way way cheaper fees and we can scale way faster than this and we can do all these new things it's very hard to change something like ethereum when it's at scale it's like changing a plane that's flying uh and taking the engine out while it's in mid-air and changing the engine so they're trying to do this kind of thing uh and they're trying to make ethereum scalable at the same time as allowing it to do all this stuff i think at best it's an experiment i think it's a very uh it's an experiment very unlikely to succeed because i do not believe it's possible to have these three attributes at the same time decentralized turing complete and scalable but you know justin is working on this justin i you know just from speaking here is incredibly smart person you know i commend the efforts of people who are working on this thing uh it's it's worthy of effort i just think it's a doom to failure all right well we're well over time um and i feel like this conversation could have gone on a lot longer because as i said i mean there was there's just so much we didn't even discuss that i had on on my list but um maybe we'll you know revisit this because this is a kind of perennial topic i remember learning about this potential issue back in 2015 when i first started learning about bitcoin and i was like i know i've said this before but you know i was thinking oh you know that's going to happen in 2140 and i won't be around to see it and i wanted to know how it would turn out but um apparently justin thinks that it'll happen in a couple of decades so maybe i won't get to see what happens um but you know people are constantly you know writing pieces on this issue and and talking about it so i think maybe we could revisit in the future um but in the meantime you guys this was super fun very thought-provoking and um for each of you why don't you say where people can learn more about you and your work sure happy to go first um you can find me on twitter drake f justin dj you can find me on twitter as well real underscore vj and you can find my book wherever books are sold perfect all right well thank you both so much for coming on unchained thanks laura thanks again thanks justin thanks thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about justin bj and the issue of whether bitcoin can be secured by transaction fees only check out the show notes for this episode unchained is produced by me laura shin with help from anthony yoon daniel
