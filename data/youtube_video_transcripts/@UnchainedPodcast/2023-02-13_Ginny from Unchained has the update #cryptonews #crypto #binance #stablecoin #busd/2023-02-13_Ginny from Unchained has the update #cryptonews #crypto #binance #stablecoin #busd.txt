earlier today the crypto broker paxos announced that it would stop issuing busd binance's stablecoin the New York State Department of Financial Services asked paxos to stop issuing the coin in response to unresolved issues and it's not just the New York government the SEC which has been ramping up its regulation of crypto firms is suing paxos for violating investor protection laws this is the first time the SEC has gone after stable coins which were until recently the Adam Brody of coins innocuous Dependable adorable with Leighton Meester legally stable coins need the backing of actual asset before you ask no that does not include vintage magic cards or nfts of vintage magic cards Fable coins are supposed to be tied one-to-one with the US dollar but then again I'm supposed to floss every day just to say yes the value of busd has dipped below a dollar don't worry though paxos has said that all the coins are fully backed and the binance CEO took to Twitter to say that all funds are safe would a crypto executive lie about something like that
