link in the description today's guest is adam cochran partner at cinnamhane ventures welcome adam hello thanks for having me just a heads up for people watching on the youtube adam just moved and cannot locate his webcam which is totally fine by me because it's really most important what he's gonna be saying so that's just why we are gonna have his headshot here okay so there has been a lot of news regarding three euros capital in recent weeks and notably also this week but before we actually get to this week's news why don't we just give listeners a picture of what your thoughts adam were on the 3d situation before some of the more recent news this week so for instance in early july when you heard the news about three arrows capitals liquidation and how they had filed it themselves etc what was your first thought yeah so i think across the industry we were really surprised to see this take place as we think of three arrows capital as one of these prominent uh operators who's a lot more experienced in this space and probably a lot more at least we thought from the outside risk averse and and so it was a bit of a surprise but then to see them request their own filing for liquidation you know it's not something that you see as commonly and it begins to raise some eyebrows of why are they taking that action is it uh is it just the realization that they're in a bad spot and they need to liquidate and their backs are against the wall or are they trying to do it for putting themselves on a preferential footing in legal proceedings it was an odd thing especially when we put that in conjunction with the otherwise radio silence that we're seeing from them and you mentioned in that tweet thread that there's a concept called the corporate veil and that this action might shed some light on kind of what they're trying to do in that regard can you explain that sure and i i'll preface this with you know the fact i'm i'm not a lawyer and i'm not well versed at all on how corporate law in in singapore and the british virgin islands work um but there is this concept that we have called the corporate veil and it's a legal concept that kind of divides your personal liability and your corporate liability and says if you're running these limited liability corporations or you know other corporate entities and other jurisdictions in a compliant manner then there's a separation between you as a person and the business as an entity itself where debtors can't come after you personally however there are these times when what happens we call it piercing the corporate veil and that's you've taken an action that kind of violates the requirements that you have as a corporation or kind of muddies the waters between you as a person and the corporation itself that can make you personally liable and so if you didn't want to be liable for the debts that your corporation had when you were going under you might want to make sure that you're putting yourself on the best footing with any judges or liquidators or any claim in the in the process and so you'd want to be well behaved in the eyes of the court being responsible in the eyes of the court and this gets into like very nuanced things about different jurisdictions and how they'll perceive that in the proceeding in those regions but it may be that if you're acting responsible maybe it's more likely that there isn't going to be this piercing of the corporate veil and by acting responsible one of those potential actions could be filing for liquidation yourself yeah absolutely you could be saying hey we know things are bad we're trying to work with creditors you know it show that it's complicated claims show that you have some of your own money possibly on the line and and are taking these steps to try and rectify the situation right because there's a big difference between uh in the views of a accord getting in over your head and getting into a messy situation where you owe a ton of money and maliciously owing a ton of money and then and that can be really hard for us to parse on the outside of were these actions malicious or was this you know a black swan event and there was a whole bunch of contingencies and it just looks bad from the outside and so there's still that opportunity for you to put a good foot forward towards courts and adjudicators and things like that to show hey we're trying to engage so obviously this week there you know was kind of a lot of news uh regarding 3dc with that huge document that was released and one of the things that really had people shocked were that xu himself listed himself as a creditor for five million dollars kyle davey's wife also said that she was owed 65.7 million dollars what do you make of you know what they're trying to claim here honestly it's really hard this document i read through this like thousand page document that we saw leaked and it actually raises a lot more questions than it gives answers and there's still a lot of unknown as to the assets part of the challenge here is that we see these payments to you know related entities we see assets being purchased in other people's names loans being given from the executives into the business and the reality is that that can all actually be legitimate like when we're dealing with multiple feeder funds and multiple jurisdictions and complicated residency jurisdictions there are absolute legitimate tax and legal reasons to have assets in your family members names to you know if they've made a ton of money over x number of years and the business is going through a hard time loaning some of your personal assets back into the business that's all legitimate and if that has happened then you are entitled to make a claim and some jurisdictions may be compelled to make a claim and have that full and honest report of the assets outstanding so it it's kind of a a challenging thing to to point a finger at and i know there's been a lot of people who look at it through the lens of you know it's an unfair kind of claw back but i i think it's important for us to acknowledge there can be legitimacy to those claims and it may also be another thing that makes it easier to say hey you know we were damaged in this too you know we're willing to waive some of our claims and and it may shift some of the piercing of the corporate veil or personal liabilities or things like that and get favorable assets pulled back at a an opportune time and discount but i think the likelihood is that there's probably fair and legitimate reasons and it comes down to where do they get placed in the pecking order of other people who have to be paid back and what is the pecking order i think that's going to be challenging to discern with all these different jurisdictions that are taking place between the fact that they've filed a chapter 15 bankruptcy recognition in the states and we've got british virgin islands and and singapore for these different feeder entities and lps all over the world i think what's unfortunate is what we would want to see uh the retail investors who had exposure through these secondary platforms like blockfi and voyager and things like that repaid first is that it will probably be pretty uniform across the board and but it's going to come down to some really nuanced legal proceeding in these specific jurisdictions that i don't think we have enough visibility or expertise on to to really know how that's going to play out and you know when you say that you read the full document and you talked about how there can be legitimate reasons why they might put in personal money um in general what's your sense of kind of what all happened there um you know what what is it that truly brought a 3ac down i i don't know i i think a lot of what we see in this document is this luna exposure trade that they have and obviously that was a challenging time for anybody who had that kind of exposure but also the broader market saw massive sell down so if they had other asset exposure outside of that especially that they were using as collateral in other places that was really going to feel a strain i don't know if we have the full picture of their assets the documents last breakdown of full assets comes from 2020 and we don't really have insights into what their current holdings were and so i think blockchain.com in in kind of their complaint in this document points out that they believed based on the net asset value of the fund that was being reported to them at the time of this borrowing uh and the moves in the market there wasn't mathematically a way for them to become so insolvent and so i don't know if we have the full picture of what happened behind the scenes i think we understand what a few of the key events like the luna ust implosion and the broader markets sell down uh we understand that these events were contributing factors but there still seems to be a few pieces of the puzzle that may be missing one other thing that people talked about a lot was obviously this issue of the yacht can you explain what happened there and you know explain what you think the significance is of what they were trying to do with this yacht uh honestly i i have no idea about the yacht thing other than it'll make a fantastic part when this eventually becomes a movie there's these allegations in the document that maybe the yacht was bought with borrowed funds and was like being paraded around to show investors about how great three arrows capital is but i don't think in the document we see any really firm proof that it was with borrowed funds and it kind of just makes these suggestions that it was alleged and things like that so i i don't know how much of that is legitimate and how much of it is taking on this this meme story of its own but that apparently they've purchased this absolute mega yacht that would have been you know the largest in singapore and they made a massive down payment on it and it's to be delivered into italy in the next few months and and so i think that will be definitely subject to the the court proceedings and seeing was that actually with borrowed funds whose name was it in how does that get liquidated you know the discount on a massive item like that because of the limited number of buyers is always going to be challenging i don't see you know blockfi wanting to walk away with a yacht they're going to want cash in hand but if it was with borrowed funds that's absolutely a crazy and audacious move to make yeah i think people were really calling out the timing there so in a moment we're going to talk a little more in depth about some of the assets that are at stake here but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show

conversation with adam you wrote up a long thread on why this liquidation could be consequential for the price of gbtc the grayscale bitcoin trust what do you think will happen with gbtc3ac owned and then how do you think that could affect the price yeah so this is an interesting one that in this past kind of week we've we've learned more as these documents have come out that they did post up a lot of the gbtc shares that they had as collateral with different lenders and a lot of that was liquidated now i think part of the challenge is that because this isn't on chain and it's kind of opaque we don't know how much is still outstanding i i think in the documents there's roughly 23 million shares were liquidated by different lenders and we know at peak they had 38.9 million shares or so so there's still this group of those shares that are out there and outstanding but because it's below these reporting thresholds we don't have an update on it and because we're not getting reports of the assets right now we don't know where that is who has it how it will be liquidated if it's already liquidated and things like that so that could put a bit of a strain on the gbtc uh and i i think as i said in this thread that i had written on twitter we would probably see not just the grayscale bitcoin trust discount widen we might actually see the market pulling towards it as market makers kind of arbitrage this opportunity pulling that discount up a bit and pulling the spot price of bitcoin down i'm a little less worried about that than i was before we got this big document dump because it is a much smaller amount that could still be out there now but in these thin liquidity markets it could definitely still have an impact where i think there's a broader impact is in a lot of the smaller entities where they may have had vesting tokens or in some of the private equity shares that we've seen such as in that you know document genesis who was really hurt by this was talking about they should get some claims on the darabeth shares and the starkware shares that three arrows capital was holding and what do you make of of that contention do you agree that genesis is right in thinking that well i mean they're owed a lot of money and so the the kind of approach is they can accept what money can get back on on liquidation uh or they can take in-kind assets if they're if they're willing to take that on and if that's what the jurisdiction will allow and i i think actually if if i was a lender in the situation and i knew how depressed valuations were right now how uh both in the liquid market and the private market markdowns and i saw projects that i had interest in long term and i could absorb that liquid capital loss i would definitely want to take the shares rather than just the raw cash back because they would probably be discounted significantly because part of this liquidation challenge is how much is a derivative share or a stark ware share worth at this point in time and with the markets being down i think the the lenders have a good opportunity to kind of negotiate on that and probably help them recoup some of this lost investment by the future appreciation of some of those equities basically acquiring them when the prices are low or when they're cheap exactly what do you make of how large of a loan genesis had made to 3ac genesis you know obviously is considered probably one of the maybe more like blue chip crypto lenders i would say and they did have like this 80 collateral requirement you know what does this say in terms of their business practices or the crypto lending space generally yeah i mean i without visibility into what their lending practices are i don't want to make too much commentary my hunch is that they were doing things by the book and we kind of had this um unforeseen perfect storm of events hit this space where a lot of lenders were caught off guard and a lot of different assets and collaterals went down in price and i think they'll probably re-examine some of their risk approaches in the future but i think the broader impact here is that we're definitely going to see stricter requirements put into lending desks especially any that have you know exposure with retail assets we're gonna see these lending facilities and trading desks re-examine their entire risk model and that's going to create a bit of a a credit crunch in this industry because there is going to be less capital lent out higher margin requirements higher collateral requirements and perhaps even stricter requirements on what type of assets these entities are willing to take as collateral overall and that's really going to shift the liquidity available in the market and the ability for new startups to get liquid cash investments and really be able to grow and i think that secondary impact is actually a major concern point that is overlooked because it's very hard to see let alone calculate the scale of but i think it is non-trivial one other thing that i was curious about is that dcg digital currency group the parent company of genesis has assumed the liabilities of genesis and as we were discussing also it's you know one of its other products is the grayscale bitcoin trust so i was wondering kind of what you thought the impact of this whole thing will be on dcg as a whole when it's all said and done it's it's a a great question i i think at their scale and the success of operation that they've had you know obviously absorbing a loss of that size is painful right but i think they're in a position where they can look through it and i think what will depend a lot is how the rest of their book looks in terms of risk and if they can look through kind of the turbulent times in the macro environment i think the outsized volatility to the downside that we're seeing in the crypto market you know the worst is probably behind us i think anything is going to be driven by the larger economy and we shouldn't see any outsized volatility moves or long tail risks to this scale again so as long as they can look through that i think they'll be in a in a good position but it may force them to pull back on risk investment operations or other lending operations at a time where it could be very fruitful for them because there are major discounts on startup rounds and so you know capital that is being deployed right now into seed rounds is going to pay much higher multiples in the future if this market recovers so i think it is a an opportunity cost for them but my hunch is that absorbing that is right for them especially when they're in this huge push with regulators to convert these products that they have in the in the bitcoin trust into an etf they want to make sure that their grayscale trust products have the best footing clear stability are viewed as in this blue chip manner and are kind of insulated from any further damage from mass liquidations of assets or claims or things like that so i think it is in their best opportunity uh looking forward and they'll probably be able to weather that storm quite well one other thing i want to bring our attention to is obviously the creditors to some of the counterparties such as voyager digital which you know for a company like that or for celsius that is more retail when it comes to the ac obviously it's more like these industry players but i just wondered what your perception was of how the 3ac bankruptcy will affect these more consumer-facing companies like celsius and voyager and not even just their these companies but frankly their customers i i think first off it's so devastating for the the retail consumers because the people who are using these platforms are the least crypto native the least defy native the least exposure to that kind of space and they're really just looking for an opportunity to get a leg up in society and and you know make a little bit of money with this investment and so i think turning them off of the space and and wiping out a lot of their savings is so damaging to the reputation of this space and these individuals in general i think it's a a shame that the centralized lenders are looked to as safer and advertise themselves as safer than uh defy alternatives which held up incredibly incredibly well during this stress well except for tara yeah sure um maybe when i'm saying d5 i specifically mean some of the more robust blue chip ethereum based defy apps that have been around for a while and have you know proper collateral mechanics and lending you know the compounds and the aves and the makers they all held up really well people lost money but there wasn't insolvency right because everything was on chain you knew exactly where we were at so i i think it's a shame that that happened i think the the two major impacts that we're going to see are because so many consumers got hurt at scale regulators around the world are going to bring down the hammer in a way that they wouldn't have before and really damage innovation and growth in this industry we're going to get much stricter regulation because this industry has now handed them the ammunition they need to get something much more far reaching past the other challenge is that decentralized entities were really the only place that large pension funds were moving into for crypto pension fund investment isn't like vc investment they're not looking for a high risk 100x where they expect something to you know maybe go bust they want their stable late stage growth capital to do a 1x or a 2x and they only invest in mature stable businesses and they were convinced that this was the way to play the crypto industry was to get into these lenders um many of them two very large late stage you know series c d and e investments those went under and that means these pension funds who do not have an appetite for risk because they're playing with people's retirement money they are not going to look at this space in the same way again for years and that really dampens the ability for this industry to get late stage growth capital for our more mature businesses and i think that is a huge unseen challenge that we're going to have as our businesses continue to scale in this space there's going to be a gap between uh startup venture capital and going public that right now we don't have investors willing to fill because they've been scorned by this space yeah i think of that pension fund in canada is it montreal or something yeah exactly this is exactly the kind of group that will look at all these events in a very different way from i think a lot of crypto people all right well this has been a fascinating conversation thank you so much for coming on unchanged thank you

us department of justice arrested former coinbase product manager ishanwahi along with his brother and a friend for committing insider trading in crypto assets the doj alleges that waukee leaked confidential coinbase information regarding which assets were scheduled to be listed on the exchange the men are being charged with wire fraud conspiracy and wire fraud in connection with a scheme to commit insider trading and cryptocurrency assets with a maximum sentence of 20 years the sec brought similar charges as well overall the men allegedly generated and realized roughly 1.5 million dollars in gains according to the doj notably the doj press release referenced an april tweet from crypto tweeter stalwart kobe who had posted information about quote an ether dress that bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of tokens exclusively featured in the coinbase asset listing post about 24 hours before it was published rolling on the floor laughing while he had attempted to flee the country in may after coinbase asked him to appear in an in-person meeting but was stopped by law enforcement from doing so he along with two others are now in custody in the press release u.s attorney damian williams thanked coinbase for cooperating and had this to say about blockchain fraud today's charges are a further reminder that web3 is not a law free zone our message with these charges is clear fraud is fraud is fraud whether it occurs on the blockchain or on wall street the sec's naming of nine crypto assets as securities without explanation sparks criticism what may end up being even more important than the insider trading case is that the sec named nine coins amp rly ddx xyo rgt lcx power dfx and krom as securities in its own complaint regarding the actions of mr wahi coinbase reported that the sec declined to comment in response to a set of questions about whether the action set a precedent for how the agency would identify crypto assets as securities or whether it intended to bring enforcement actions against the issuers behind these assets or any exchanges such as coinbase that have listed them however the circuitous way in which the agency identified these tokens as securities caused a fair amount of criticism cftc commissioner caroline pham spoke out against her fellow agency's decision via a statement describing the sec's move as an example of regulation by enforcement and calling for a more transparent process for digital asset rulemaking jake schravinski head of policy and the blockchain association tweeted the sec alleges in today's complaint that nine digital assets are securities but don't explain their analysis for even one they also didn't sue the issuers or exchanges where the tokens traded the people with resources to fight back or as crypto lawyer stephen palley put it how can you charge people with insider trading without charging the massive publicly traded exchange for listing unregistered securities after consensus lawyer bill hughes hypothesized that the defendants may settle with the sec chervinsky surmised and then the sec acts like they've established precedent and moves on to the next target yes that would be my best guess immediately after the news about the complaint became public coinbase made its own commentary on the roundabout way in which the sec labeled these crypto assets as securities it released a petition calling for the sec to develop a new regulatory framework for digital assets rather than continuing with arbitrary enforcement the ethereum merge has a date an actual well tentative date during this week's proof-of-stake implementer's call ethereum core developer tim baiko suggested that the week of september 19th is a realistic target for the merge depending on the success of a rehearsal on the test net gourley as cited in meeting notes written by ethereum developer ben edgington on thursday during the all core devs meeting it was projected that the date for the merge on gourley will hit between august 8th and 10th furthermore even if the merge is kickstarted on the week of september 19th it won't finish then at least according to galaxy digital researcher christine kim who reminded excited aetherians that the merge is actually a bundle of two hard fork upgrades which will be scheduled roughly two weeks apart having a named date however tentative may have excited investors for example eth is up thirty four percent over the last week as a thursday morning additionally the price of steath or staked eath a derivative product that will unlock at some point after the merge is completed is trading at just a two percent discount to eth up from a roughly 3.5 percent discount last week according to coin gecko tesla dumped 75 of its btc according to tesla's q2 2022 earnings report the electric car company sold 75 percent of its bitcoin worth 936 million dollars for fiat currency investing youtuber dave lee divided the dollar value of the company's remaining bitcoin by the value on the close of the day they had sold and came up with the number four 42069 bitcoins as the number that tesla had remaining musk responded we don't have that many bitcoin but it's close during the company's earnings call tesla ceo elon musk explained the move was not a verdict on bitcoin rather he said the sale of bitcoin allowed tesla to boost its cash position during covet lockdowns in china musk did note that tesla had not sold any of its dogecoin well not mentioned on the earnings call it is notable that if tesla had not sold its btc coindisk estimated that the company could have faced up to a 460 million impairment charge on its books due to the way bitcoin must be accounted for despite the news bitcoin appears to be doing just fine with the asset dipping just 2.2 percent in the 24 hours after the earnings report came out celsius's bankruptcy plan mining at its first bankruptcy hearing attorneys for celsius revealed that the firm owed roughly five billion dollars to over half a million creditors with retail investors most likely being the last to be paid out notably coindesk reports that celsius has roughly 1.7 billion dollars in assets as of july 14th down from 14.6 billion at its all-time high and about 3 billion away from being able to pay out creditors the bankrupt lender cites losses from tara the overall drop in prices in 2022 and a number of losses including losing access to 50 million dollars worth of eath via a partnership with steakhound as causes of the massive hole in its balance sheet to recoup the losses celsius is hoping that celsius mining will become a cash cow with the company asking for permission to spend five million dollars to finish constructing its center in texas celsius says it already has 43 000 mining rigs and then it could be in the position to mine 10 000 btc this year if all goes well which is a big if even if that happens mining operations would only yield 225 million dollars in cash a far across from the billions necessary to make celsius whole celsius's second bankruptcy hearing will be held on august 10th gemini and block 5 staff still in limbo while the market felt a bit of a reprieve this week crypto companies are still hurting techcrunch reported that the winklevoss-led crypto exchange gemini quietly let go around 7 percent or 68 employees this week the news comes less than a month after the company cut ten percent of its workforce citing a crypto winter similarly crypto lender blockfi has begun offering employees voluntary buyouts just a few weeks after cutting twenty percent of its staff decrypt reports that employees who sign up will receive 10 weeks of paid leave and health insurance blockchain.com also made brutal cuts this week laying off 150 people or 25 percent of its team minecraft bans nfts mojang studios the firm behind minecraft published a statement declaring integrations of nfts with minecraft are generally not something we mojang studios will support or allow additionally blockchain technologies writ large are not permitted to be used inside the minecraft client or server applications nor will any skins persona items or worlds be allowed to be tokenized on a blockchain mojang cited multiple issues with nfts for example the purchase of an nft provides the token that states the ownership of the original digital file and yet with any digital file that file can be copied moved or even deleted mojang also mentioned that speculation was another signal to stay away however the main reason for disallowing nfts is a lack of inclusivity nfts however can create models of scarcity and exclusion that conflict with our guidelines and the spirit of minecraft wrote mojang to ensure that minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our client and server applications the announcement seems to have surprised nft worlds a third-party blockchain focused on nft minecraft integrations which saw its floor price fall 70 percent according to coindesk circle a fully backed stablecoin in its july 14th report circle the issuer of the stablecoin usdc

company has been able to accomplish yet time for fun bits a joke turned into a 98 eth loss this week saw some crazy ens news including a sale of sony.eve for 72 thousand dollars and a 1 million dollar bid for amazon.eth one user who found the ens purchasing spree and bidding war to be frivolous decided to mint a meme about it the user franklin is bored minted the enns name stop doing fake bids it's honestly lame my guy dot eth and immediately added a 100 eighth bid of his own to his nft the huge bid prompted a bot to offer franklin 1.89 eth which franklin decided to take however before franklin remembered to cancel his fake offer for 100 eath the bot sold the nft back to franklin because his 100th offer was still live to summarize guy fake bids 100 eth on his own domain accepts a different bid to sell it for 1.8 eth new owner accepts his 100 fake vid instantly down 98.2 eth this up only meme comes full circle on this week's episode of the nia podcast which i believe is not investment advice podcast guest michael saylor did the unexpected he recommended my book the cryptopians for context sailor was discussing why he was skeptical of ethereum and use the backstory from the cryptopians to make the case that the eth monetary policy is anything but cemented have you guys read the kryptopians you should read the kryptopians right it's the entire story right i mean the
