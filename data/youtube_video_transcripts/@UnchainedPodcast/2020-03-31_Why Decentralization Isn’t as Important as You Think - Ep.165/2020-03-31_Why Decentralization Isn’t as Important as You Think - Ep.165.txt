hi everyone this week we have a fabulous essay titled why decentralisation isn't as important as you think from Hasib Qureshi of dragonfly capital and it's about why he thinks the focus on decentralisation can be overhyped he looks at why decentralisation can be important but then makes clear by dissecting what it is important and when it's not and to whom it does and doesn't matter that it isn't the be-all end-all goal for every endeavor he talks about which questions we should be asking beyond jest is it a centralized and also explains why that question doesn't even make sense one note about the essay this was written before the corona virus pandemic had spread from the east to the west so it doesn't make reference to any recent events or the economic impact of the virus that said it's still a superb thought-provoking essay I think people will love this one and it will spike sparked quite a conversation would love to hear your thoughts on Twitter once again here's why decentralisation isn't as important as you think enjoy the show cipher trace cutting-edge cryptocurrency intelligence powers anti-money laundering blockchain analytics and threat Intel leading

trading Kraken is the place for you the cargo cult of decentralization by Hasib Qureshi if you've spent any time at all on crypto Twitter you're familiar with the web 3 narrative it goes like this in the beginning the web was truly decentralized against all odds the world wide web won against the corporatist designs of companies like Microsoft and cyberspace became the territory of hobbyists and hackers the internet was henceforth enshrined as a neutral platform and any publisher no matter how small or powerless was free to set up shop in their own corner of the web but eventually this decentralized Eden fell from grace or so the story goes now in web 2.0 93% of searches happen through Google 64% of browsers use Chrome and 79% of social advertising dollars go to Facebook a handful of companies now effectively control cyberspace web 3 advocates see public blockchains as the catalyst to reverse this trend they want to put power back into the hands of users and replace Google and Facebook with open platforms perhaps platforms that are owned collectively by their users operated as public Commons some version of this story has been sold to the Economist The Wall Street Journal Gartner and pretty much all of the tech press I believe this story this decentralization fairy tale is predicated on an error it's the same error that underlies most utopian projects let me ask you this why did Satoshi choose to make Bitcoin decentralized actually it's a trick question Satoshi didn't have a choice Bitcoin had to be decentralized or else it wouldn't have worked before Bitcoin every previous attempt to create internet native money either went bankrupt or was forcibly shut down by the government see digit cash in gold or Liberty Reserve so Satoshi made Bitcoin decentralized he made it use proof-of-work mining to achieve permissionless consensus he built in a p2p networking model so the network would be decentralized and eventually he disappeared from the project entirely so it would have no ostensible leader he did this so Bitcoin could survive and have a chance of fulfilling his vision of permissionless decentralized money so here we are today Bitcoin is a hundred billion dollar plus currency and it has spawned a renaissance of hundreds of crypto networks all trying to innovate in digital finance and now invoking the spirit of Satoshi they all argue and bicker about which of them are the most decentralized look how centralized your mining pools are you're one to talk with your block size your corner well we have no pre mine so we're the real decentralized ones what's going on here why are they all doing this in this article I want to suggest maybe we should stop worrying so much about decentralization I know this is possibly the least popular position I could take in crypto but before you reach for your pitchfork hear me out I think by the end of this piece you'll understand where I'm coming from and hopefully elect not to make me a human sacrifice maxwell's Bitcoin daemon entertain a thought experiment imagine a parallel universe where your experience of Bitcoin was all an illusion all of your direct experiences of Bitcoin were the same it ran the same software you click the same buttons your UT exo's showed up on block explorers all the command-line interactions were the same but there's no decentralized network there's no p2p anything there's no actual decentralized consensus every Bitcoin transaction just runs on one giant Postgres database run by some dude in Canada if you've actually read a little bit coin code then suspend your disbelief here for a second all the miners the consensus the hash ray explorers they're all just pinging this guy's server whenever someone minds block they send it to the Canadian guy and he inserts the block into his database and forwards it to everyone every external feature of the system looks exactly the same the monetary policy the block time the scarcity all of it we still have a block size debate we still have Twitter trolls we still have Craig right and we still have an inexplicable link between bitcoiners and carnivalism it's just not decentralized that part is a mirage how would that world be different what actual facts about the Bitcoin system will be different from the Bitcoin we know today what features does Bitcoin have in our world that it doesn't have in its thought experiment think carefully about this here's the answer almost none it's just as scarce this is hard just as much better than gold the only material difference is one of risk that maybe someday the Canadian police could kick down this guy's door and make him turn off Bitcoin that would kill Bitcoin that cannot be allowed to happen that's why bitcoin is decentralized it's decentralized to survive attempts at censorship manipulation or shutdown but other than that bitcoins decentralization doesn't actually do anything of course it's important for its image and its narrative if it would not be centralized at this point we wouldn't see it as legitimate but all of the material features of the system would basically be the same thankfully there's no Canadian guy who controls Bitcoin no one can turn Bitcoin off and that's great but this perspective reveals something important about decentralization Satoshi made Bitcoin decentralized to solve a specific problem that previous forms of internet money kept getting shut down a decentralized form of money is resilient to insolvency attack or censorship but decentralization wasn't itself the point it was just a means to an end the point was to make a form of Internet money that worked the Satoshi decentralization was valuable insofar as it mitigated some other fundamental risk censorship platform security corruption it's the properties decentralization gives us that we care about not decentralization itself you cannot compete on being more decentralized as a crypto VC I often hear from projects that claim they're going to be X but decentralized usually this is the tell-tale sign of a bad pitch here's a problem with it decentralization is a global emergent property these properties are almost impossible to compete on there's a simple framework for thinking about the properties of a network that I first learned from Nathan Wilcox there are two axes a property can be either global or local and it can be either direct or emergent so let's first start with local and direct properties think the local whether it's local to your city and everyone in your city feels it so it's direct people frequently choose which side you live in based on local and direct properties like the weather then there are local and emergent properties think the voter turnout in your city people in your city know what the voter turnout is and it's good for this number to be high but nobody actually feels it directly even though people care in an abstract sense about civic engagement it's hard for cities to compete on having better a voter turnout let's say global and direct properties think global warming everyone in the world feels global warming directly it's in different degrees but it's hard for people to coordinate around solving the problem that said everyone feels it and everyone responds to its consequences and then there's global and emergent properties these are the most insidious they apply to everyone but nobody experiences them directly an example would be something like privacy not that kind of your neighbors can see through your window privacy but more like multi-billion dollar companies have lots of data on you which is weird and uncomfortable even though nothing obviously bad seems to happen because of it and here's the problem decentralization is in the last category its global and indirect nobody feels it you can feel latency you can feel transaction fees but networks ostensibly feel the same whether they're centralized or decentralized if the decentralization of your network drops how would your users even know as a general rule it's almost impossible for products to compete on the basis of global and value propositions such as decentralization now you might counter this is not about competition between products to see this is about building a better internet fine go build a better internet by yourself in your own personal Macedon server but that's not enough for you you want the world to join you and rightly so if you want that you need to compete for the world's attention and you must compete on the merits decentralization in this context is not an advantage it is a handicap so be it you can still win if decentralization actually lets you do things you couldn't otherwise do this is why bitcoin Wan despite being a decentralized network it enabled something genuinely new the permissionless transfer of unsensible money and bitcoin has proved its value by being alive and well today more than 10 years later having successfully evolved past it's unseemly adolescence mal Cox Silk Road dark net markets Bitcoin survived because it is decentralized but let's be more specific many advocates claim that it's the developers who will choose this new world it's the developers who are fed up with the walled gardens of the modern Internet it's the developers will propel us into this decentralized future ok let's look closely at that we know developers today have a tough time building on decentralized block chains they're slow expensive hard to use and block chains don't have that many users yet but the decentralization advocates will counter don't you know the Twitter API story Twitter originally had an open API but when they shut it down all the entrepreneurs were building on them had the rug ripped out from under them entrepreneurs don't want to use API is owned by somebody else that's why web 3 will win but here's the problem developers don't care about decentralization either when a developer is evaluating whether to use linux and PM react or Twilio they don't give a damn whether they're decentralized or not developers care about risk they want to minimize technical risk they want to minimize the risk of their API is dying on them but they also want to minimize the risk if their users migrate away from the platform or never show up to begin with they care about the risk that the underlying tech breaks they care about the rest of the tooling degrades or never and so on risk is a multi-dimensional vector decentralisation mitigates some risks but not others I guarantee you that developers today are more comfortable building on what's left of Twitter's api's than they are building on top of public blockchains twitter has 38 million accounts regularly using their api's while total DAP users are still well below 1 million and to be clear decentralization lowers some risks the risk of censorship are shut down or lower in a decentralized system but are these really the primary risks I care about as a developer rather than uptime or cost or user churn it depends on what I'm building and what risks does decentralization increase what does it do to my p99 response time or the chance that fee spike on the network so my users go elsewhere is that set of trade-offs worth it to me as a developer look I'm the first to celebrate the fields that crypto has disrupted so far crypto has brilliantly used its censorship resistance to attack money and decentralized banking and finance brilliant what do people hate more than banks but the web 3 story says never mind all that instead we should try to decentralize uber and airbnb you know two of the most beloved products in the world that just got started appending stagnant decades-old pre technological industries and Google you know one of the world's most trusted brands in the u.s. sure let's try to re-implement the most difficult computer science and data problems imaginable on aetherium the technological equivalent of a graphing calculator decentralization is valuable when it lets you do new things fundamentally better not old things fundamentally worse web 3 advocates are trying to pick a fight with the most beloved products in the world while handicapping themselves would you centralized architectures if you want to win a fist fight you probably shouldn't choose the strongest guy in the room especially when you've got one hand tied behind your back innovate against products that suck there are no shortage of them in this world you'll win if and only if decentralization is a genuine advantage today's episode is brought to you by Kraken crackin is the best

compliance initiative and receive authoritative crypto AML reports quarterly WWF root race calm / keep crypto clean but is it really decentralized it's vacuous to ask whether something is really decentralized I wish this question would go away let me give you two examples that illustrate why invoking the D word is so unenlightened decentralized finance D Phi is commonly claimed to be more secure because it's decentralized by this they mean it's code is implemented in smart contracts directly on a public blockchain now any normal programmer would retort wait why would it be secured us because it's written in code and of course nothing about D Phi inherently provides security in fact a single bug in these programs could wipe out all of the money inside just look at the zero acts act where an attacker could have stolen all of the money in the system then of course there is the DAO hack the banker hacked the bzx attacks history is littered with examples like this there is nothing at all inherent about D Phi that makes it secure security starts with audited open source code that is written with best practices and ideally formally verified but the number one thing that makes something secure is just being battle tested with a lot of value at stake for a long time just the same as with centralized systems or let's take another problem that's close to my heart the Oracle problem people lose their common sense when it comes to Oracle problems so it's a good place to reality test but simply the Oracle problem asks how can a blockchain learn about things that happened outside of it by definition someone has to report that information to the blockchain but who do we trust to report that data and how do we know the data is correct frame this way the Oracle problem is a question even a child can understand how do we know someone is telling us the truth let's take makers v1 Oracle system it essentially consisted of twenty addresses most of which were anonymous pushing prices on chain the Oracle reported the median of all these twenty prices you might be tempted to ask is that decentralized this is the wrong question the right question to ask is what are the risks of believing what this Oracle tells us what is the cost to manipulate the Oracle whose reputations are involved what has been the value at stake so far and how long is a system function correctly whether it's decentralized or not is irrelevant to what we actually care about especially if censorship is not the principal risk to the system take a step back for a second how is the Oracle problem solved in the real world when someone wants to know the results of a sports game what do they do well they probably check ESPN how centralized of them and why do they trust ESPN scores what complex crypto economic game is ESPN playing such that we're comfortable trusting them one answer might be well if ESPN publishes an incorrect score someone can sue them for damages ESPN's bank account can be appropriated by the legal system so that's the incentive for ESPN to behave honestly thus we have good Oracle's thanks to the threat of litigation against ESPN this analysis is tempting but it's not quite right what do you think people would do for on chain Oracle's if ESPN started publishing game results onto aetherium I'll tell you people would just use the ESPN scores they use them instead of chain link or auger or any of these other supposedly decentralized Oracle's because they trust ESPN scores and this would be true even if ESPN expressly disavowed any legal liability for the scores why why would people trust ESPN even though it's not decentralized saying it out loud it suddenly sounds like a stupid question everyone knows why we trust ESPN scores because of reputation the value of ESPN's reputation is so great that we understand ESPN wouldn't jeopardize it it transcends anything as simple as they have X dollars at stake but if they corrupt the Oracle they could make why in some sense ESPN's reputation backs every score they ever post they have the same X dollars at stake for the entire lifetime of their business you could think of this as somehow cross margining all of their claims with all the money they'll ever make you can't do that with staking or bonds or any of the other craziness that people demand in crypto economic games reputations are precisely how iterated games enable long term value creation without reputation there wouldn't be enough capital in the world for us all to trust each other so what if makers Oracle system why do so many products in defy use it I don't think it's because it's the most decentralized I think the real answer is simple reputation people trust makers reputation of course they also all know that technically 15 individuals had collude and run off with the money and just as true a single developer tspn could probably post a fabricated game score but I think people deep down intuitively understand that maker the brand the dow has a reputation to keep up no differently than ESPN does and that reputation in some way that's hard to quantify backs every price it ever posts on chain in some abstract sense the maker system has much more economic value behind its oracle than any naive system that requires bonds and slashing if we accept the notion that dows can be like companies why wouldn't we be willing to consider the Dow's can have reputations worth protecting now we're maker down a monopolist we intuitively understand that his reputation would carry less weight but maker Dow leaves its front doors open to exit through global settlement if maker down messes up or as manipulated its users won't come back many defy projects have chosen the maker Oracle's despite their flaws and to be clear I don't think makers Oracle's are anywhere near the optimal Oracle design but they work and developers intuitively understand why the maker Oracle's are trustworthy and many researchers were considered an anathema to make such an imprecise security claim if it's not quantitative if it's not x times y equals Z that it's not proper crypto economics I'll say this I don't give a damn if your Oracle is decentralized I care if your Oracle works under the threat model I care about both chain link and augur have failed pretty badly in the past despite being more decentralized than makers Oracle I don't think the maker Oracle is perfect but it's a lot better than most of what we see today decentralization is not a binary but here's another problem with asking whether something is truly decentralized decentralization is not a yes or no question if you need a network that will survive targeted attacks by three-letter agencies then probably even Bitcoin isn't good enough but most people don't need that only you know how much decentralization you need and any more decentralization than that probably isn't doing anything understand at the margin decentralization does not linearly reduce risk it's more like an s-curve the first little bit of decentralization doesn't really accomplish anything take Napster for example Napster was kind of decentralized in that it didn't store files on their own servers but Napster acted as the search index that let people discover each other's files so if someone shut down the Napster servers they basically shut down everything all the little p2p elements of the Napster design were basically window dressing because the whole system could be trivially foreclosed from the top your early attempts decentralized don't accomplish anything until your decentralized enough to not be censored it's like trying to make a barrel waterproof the first little bit of sealing doesn't do anything until you actually plug every hole at that point you hit the elbow of the decentralization curve where suddenly all the work you're putting in makes a big observable difference to your shutdown risk then after you climb up the ass decentralizing the governance the token ownership the admin hooks you hit a plateau where the system is basically censorship resistant you can invest more into distributing the hash rate further or adding more nodes the peer-to-peer system or mitigating selfish mining or whatever but for the most part any change at the margin doesn't actually change the properties of the system that much for anyone none of those systems can be taken down by script kiddies and probably all of them could be taken down by a motivated nation-state most of the arguments about decentralization at the end of the spectrum are just point-scoring where do you think your favorite product is on this s-curve I'd argue that most of the large decentralized networks aren't closer to the plateau than most people like to admit Bitcoin is more decentralized today than aetherium certainly unlike the Koine theorems inventor is still around a story of the project and it has frequent plan upgrades but on the spectrum of risk bitcoin is actually not that much farther along both bitcoin and theorem can be destroyed by nation-states and neither can be destroyed by organized actors on the internet all I'm saying here is that there are diminishing returns to decentralization this is obvious marginal analysis but people seldom apply this concept to decentralization itself hence why we get never-ending series of papers and blog posts sneering at how blockchains p2p networks and governance aren't quote unquote truly decentralized it's also possible that protocol risks don't always decrease with the decentralization be centralizing too fast can introduce new risks that didn't previously exist I've never seen a centralized server that had a 51% attack or a front-running vulnerability or a fee sniping attack and of course you should not underestimate the power of responding quickly to a bug by shutting off your system centralized systems can much more effectively respond to threats and organized around technical leaders I'm reminded of how the computing industry rallied around his leadership in the wake of the specter and meltdown modes in the face of industry shaking vulnerabilities SWAT teams across Intel Microsoft and Linux worked on patches while carrying out an industry-wide disclosure in Bardo and in retrospect it worked pretty well this would have been much harder in a truly decentralized regime Angela Walsh a law professor at Saint Mary's University argues in deconstructing decentralization that a genuinely decentralized project could not have secrets like this in her words secrets reveal centralization well the bug fixes secret developer meetings and mining pool concentration all reveal sites have concentrated rather than diffuse power yet in uncritically describing blockchain systems as decentralized we skip over all of that end quote she's absolutely right on her premises although I reject the binary centralized decentralized distinction but I arrived at a different conclusion what this tells us is that the optimal equilibrium for a project is not currently 100 percent decentralized climbing further up that s-curve yields diminishing returns and the juice isn't worth the squeeze yet that all having said there are many networks that fail to make it all the way through the decentralisation s-curve iota comes to mind for me I'm sure you have your own favorite coin if you need to cross this chasm but fail the decentralisation really does matter but the biggest risk to many of these networks is not that their governance is too centralized it's that their governance is too incompetent sure I want the governance of my blockchain to eventually be decentralized but if you give me the choice I'll take world-class centralized governance over crappy decentralized governance any day of the week beyond decentralized purity culture despite all this cryptic communities love to point at each other and claim their competitors are not really decentralized in a way it's a perfect attack because anything can always be more decentralized it's the original sin that every project carries it transmutes decentralization into a virtue of purity the universal moral failing a ritual of self-flagellation but this decentralization purity culture is not just exhausting it's counterproductive I know I'm poking a bit of a hornet's nest here so let's be clear bitcoin would never have become what it is today were it not decentralized there is no other path to creating internet native digital gold but I don't want to see the best minds of my generation obsessing over the single dimension and lose sight of the most important problems to solve before we worry about decentralization let's worry about building things worth D centralizing in the first place let's not forget no one actually wants this stuff yet no one knows what problems it'll actually solve it's all still weird and complicated and impossible to use I agree with Jesse Walden on this point projects are too progressively decentralize as they figure out product market fit that is once they figure out what's actually valuable to build but for most everything in the space product market fit is still a long way away until then I think we can obsess a little less about being perfectly decentralized our focus should be on innovating and building better infrastructure for the digital economy that's the real goal if you ask me decentralization is merely at times the means to that end thanks for listening this is a seed
