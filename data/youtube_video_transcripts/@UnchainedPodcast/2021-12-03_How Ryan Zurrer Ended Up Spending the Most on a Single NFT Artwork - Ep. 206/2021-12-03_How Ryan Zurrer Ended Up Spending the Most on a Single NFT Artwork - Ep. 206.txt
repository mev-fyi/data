welcome ryan hey laura um it's great to be back thank you very much for having me on and i am so excited to to read your book um you know i think i think this is going to be the defining story of of of how ethereum has unfolded and and i imagine it was it was probably really difficult to edit with just all of the crazy stories that have unfolded and so um i can't i can't wait to read it i know it's been a long time coming and and we're grateful for the contributions that that you continue to make for our space thanks ryan yeah people will see the book starts with a list of characters because yes when you are describing decentralized worlds there's a lot of people to keep track of but people who know nothing about krypton who've read it have told me um yes they are able to follow and through various quizzes i've given them yes i realized okay they really did learn stuff so it's pretty cool to see anyway okay you recently spent 29 million dollars which is the highest amount of money ever paid for a single nft on human one by mike winkelmann by the way you guys i've barely slept and so is ryan so i think that's going to be a very fun conversation um mike winkelmann is beeple most people know tell us why it is that you decided to bid on human one and how you came to own it so i i've been developing a relationship with with mike ever since i bought the dick milking factory back in the spring and what deeply resonated with me with with respect to human one is the fact that it's this evolving piece which will be which will fundamentally change the relationship between collector and artist over many many years uh this piece will evolve and and and he'll continue to add to it over time so when i looked at it i thought this isn't one piece this is actually many pieces and sort of looked at it i guess in a different way than that i don't think the world fundamentally understood how many pieces this will be or just how big this project will be um and i thought that that was that was really interesting and i could embark on this multi-year um journey with with my good friend um who i just really like and we get along really well and then actually before you keep going on can you just describe the artwork for listeners since not everybody has seen it sure well i certainly would encourage everyone to take a look at a youtube video of just human one all all caps uh you know one spelt o any um but essentially it's a sculpture that is rotating uh sort of in this very methodical way and today within the sculpture is a a 3d moving image of an explorer i would say it sort of looks kind of like an astronaut right now but one would would refer to them as an explorer that's slowly traversing different digital lands and the important thing here is that this is a meditation on mankind's first steps into the metaverse and we're all confronted with this conversation of uh our dual identities that we all now have between our digital identity and our real world identity you know human one is the first metaverse native which which then invokes this this conversation and this set of questions that that i think is very timely and poignant for for society right now um and i thought that that the piece is important in that regard and so how did you come to acquire it and and i interrupted you so yeah i don't know if there was more that you wanted to say earlier too about how it was evolving and your relationship with mike etc you know talking back and forth with mike you know i i knew that this was something that was really special that had come together relatively quickly but but he felt like like was a seminal piece in his in his own career and it's really important to note that um you know mike has deeply impacted the ark and trajectory of digital art along his ent his entire career before when he was doing sort of you know concert videos and music videos and and and really experimenting to the the everydays which has become this this like global movement and and you know that commitment just that stoic commitment of creating art every single day honing and mastering your craft i think is a really pure story that people people really resonate with you could tell in in talking with him that that this piece marked a really significant step change in his in his own career and and that he when you talk to him about it he you can see that he's deeply committed that this is like another commitment on the lines of the everydays where he's going to continue to update and evolve this piece and and collaborate with others and i i felt like i want to take a real swing at owning this piece as i've sort of matured in my own collection uh over the course of of the last two years i've migrated away from kind of like many different experimental purchases to a few purchases of of higher quality more more sort of historical importance um that i you know that i can have kind of a deeper relationship with and this was this was an absolutely perfect one so i didn't think i was going to get it chrissy's i don't think thought that i was going to be the winner i think i i was able to capture a a fleeting moment in time before very well capitalized traditional art patrons enter in the space and have the confidence in themselves to make a bid like this um i think of you know in a future moment a a piece like this would not be available um to a collector like myself at this kind of price point and why do you say that like what what kind of is happening in the market now and where do you think it's going and and just out of curiosity like how is it that christie's even gave you the impression they thought you wouldn't get it uh well they admitted to me after the fact so they just said i like to see straight out and said that yeah we we we're not expecting you to win and for you to win at that price um because you know mike had spent a bunch of time with it's sort of your very famous who's who canon of of of traditional art um patrons and uh and one would have expected that they would come to the mat on that night and you know and be bidding really hard but it it wasn't the case the the bid to my understanding landed between myself and and another crypto native and so we're seeing this moment where traditional art patrons are are not really yet taking the deep dive like i would say the you know everybody's top five or top seven most important pieces of digital art or nfts are not owned by you know traditional art um collections uh they are taking a standoffish approach at this point but inevitably you know they will have to to to enter it will it will be a it'll be a question of their own survival but they're not going to be able to to to poo this for um for that long and so i you know i expect this this to evolve very quickly and that's why i think that over the next year certainly definitely two you'll see more accepted among traditional art patrons and traditional art institutions you know where this piece has been the first piece that has created a conversation with sort of leading art institutions around the world that want to to display an important piece of digital art that kind of represents their own first foray into the metaverse um and and so as i've seen these these conversations come up with human one i'm optimistic that we are moving in the right direction and quicker than traditional art would usually move in a new direction super interesting so we're going to have to talk a little bit more about that because i have questions but first a

traditional art world maybe is sort of coming around um and i was curious kind of like what you what you saw there um what your take is now on how the traditional art world is looking at nfts and how that's evolving you know i think miami is a microcosm for how uh the art world is treating nfts where within the miami fair there is almost nothing with respect to digital art and nfts there was one booth that was sort of dedicated to to traditional art and nfts whereas all of the buzz all of the energy that was happening in the city around the week were around the nft drops like the you know the rafika nadal piece on the beach um yesterday evening or or people's work or or just you know other digital artists doing drops like for example christie's and and open c doing the mad dog jones drop later this week and and so everyone's talking about digital art and nfts whereas the the sort of powers to be who curated the core event are are almost like missing the opportunity to to integrate it into the core of the event i think it was a bit of a missed opportunity in that regard and again they'll have to they'll have to evolve very quickly because it it will matter for for art basil to to to continue to enjoy the lead or the the premier position that it has like it will not be the premier art fair on the planet in five years if they don't get serious about digital art very quickly and so it was an interesting thing to to to see that unfold in that way with like the outside being the thing that everybody was talking about and the inside being this kind of you know sort of stodgy outdone um not that new or innovative event there's nothing new in the affair in miami that you wouldn't have saw in 2019 right everything new and fresh and interesting was happening outside which is related to nfts and digital art well so people in the nft world themselves have even like people sash mike uh said this himself that he agrees that nfts are in a bubble and that pretty much all not all but the vast majority of the nfts being sold will someday be worthless he's said this so how do you kind of reconcile that view that he has along with i'm sure you're well aware a lot of traditional artists uh or art collectors have looked at nfts and said oh i don't see anything of value it does so in a way they sort of agree and yet it seems like you you don't you don't see those two viewpoints as being the same so can you talk about that a little bit definitely so any time that we've seen really compelling new technologies being applied to a market you get this this sort of gartner hype cycle ebb and flow to it where you know and this happened with icos and now it's happening with nmts where you'll have this run and yes 90 plus percent of what's created in the run-up will prove to be worthless over time but let's not miss the forest for the trees here and remember that the 10 that does survive will be will go on to be incredibly valuable assets will be incredibly important pieces of infrastructure and technology in our society and so this will happen with nfts it probably happens sometime in the next 12 to 18 months where a lot of your 10k pfp projects and and and and and different sort of lower quality pieces of art will prove to to be relatively worthless but there will be that upper crust um that will survive that will that will flourish and and that will do really well this is true of the artists and this is true of the art across a range of different categories and so i'm very optimistic that that even though we're going to see this flush out of of of lower quality that that's just the natural ebb and flow of technology applied to markets and and that's okay we embrace that and beyond that you're also going to see other art categories picking up the slack such that the general market is expanding so you know i think 2022 is going to be a great year for music nfts and spatial ar vr nfts and and and thinking about art in this in this more interactive way um and so the the pie will grow even though we're we're sort of culling as we go yeah yeah and i think i'm just trying to remember uh somebody else in my show made a similar sentiment and it might have been devin finzer of openc the ceo i'll have to check back but yes um i mean i think that's true for you know crypto in general and then how i navigate this moving forward is the same way that i've used since i've i've come into to to collecting which is i use this concept that i call proof of artwork and proof of artwork draws on um a sort of baseline concept around proof of work that the the baseline like lowest possible value of a proof of work network is the total sum of the capex and opex that has brought the code base and the network or the ledger to that moment right and so all of the investment that has gone into that to that moment is your like baseline minimum cost and when i look at a piece of of digital art i ask myself you know how much training and artistic merit and time and collaboration and and just effort and and human resources have gone into the creation of this work what that that does is give me a baseline of like okay this is at least worth this and then i can kind of reason for for what you know how i should think about value with with that piece what that does is it causes me to miss out on some of your more cheeky pieces like you know like the pack pixel or like an x copy would like not be a thing that i resonate with but it leaves me with a a portfolio of really high quality digital art that's very technically sophisticated and future forward um things like you know brandon dawes work or rafiq annadel's work or or mike people's work where i can see and feel and understand very intuitively the amount of time and effort and resources that went into creating that piece of digital art and so i just try to stay true to that north and know that things will kind of like work themselves out if i'm if i've got like that kind of baseline covered in this concept of proof of artwork one thing i wanted to ask you to talk about a little bit more was your personal relationship with mike slash people you were talking about how this artwork will change over time and how i mean you guys are kind of like essentially friends and i guess i was just thinking what's fascinating to me is so in a way you're going to be able to most likely influence the development of your own of this artwork that you own i think that that would be my yes um and it's just kind of interesting because it just made me think that you know a long time ago kind of when there were things like patrons of the arts and you know not like we don't have that today but just kind of in that more old model you know you might be seen as something like that but probably the relationship was quite different and so i'm just kind of curious how you view that relationship now and um in the context of nfts yeah i mean i think this this is a really fun part of it that that we get to to collaborate in this regard and i i want to make it clear that it's not going to be like me calling up mike and being like hey it's my birthday like put a birthday hat on the guy or like you know like like hey can you like make it look more like me or something like that it's not going to be like that you know i'm part of our our relationship is is really good because i have a deep a deep sort of reverence and respect for the stoic path that he's walked to become the standard bearer of digital art at the same time it is really interesting to be able to like jam in ideas and and and talk about different things and i flew down there to to to charleston um earlier this week and was completely i'm still like taken aback and like have goose bumps thinking about this so so mike was like yeah come down to the studio and i was thinking i'd go down there and be like you know a big garage he's got like some screens and stuff that he does his art on and and and that's that's kind of the end of it and he he does these really interesting physical pieces um where he i think really he and rafique are the leaders in this this kind of relationship between the physical and the digital piece so so he does physicals for all of his digital piece which it again and just sort of deep in the relationship that he has with his collectors and and so i get down there and it's not a studio it's a full-on like sprawling campus and he has you know he has a whole bunch of like aerospace engineers working for him and different artists on this massive sort of warehouse that has all these offices and rooms and different things and different people doing different things it it honestly seemed like this crazy mix of like warhol's studio with bell labs where they've got like 3d printers and laser cutters and they're just doing wild things that i completely blew my mind and so when you get this this sense of light of just how much they're they're willing to push the envelope and and move things forward and you know and his brother scott is a really brilliant engineer and and very fundamental to the whole to the whole team it's funny like it takes a community and when i think about this rationally at this point in retrospect like very clearly you know couldn't be all one guy doing all the all this stuff like it's all one guy doing the like the pure digital like the digital pieces but all of the support around him like 3d printing these collector pieces and and and experimenting with doing these like scale real world manifestations of what was otherwise a surreal looking digital piece it's pretty remarkable i think charleston is going to be this hotbed of innovation in the space as he continues to to bring in artists around him that what what's going on down there in charleston is is something very unique and very special um so i'm just glad to be a witness to it and be a part of it and i'm just glad that we get along so well you know we he grew up in in wisconsin it's not that far from from where i grew up in canada where we're about six months difference in age and so like from the moment we started chatting with each other especially because i had bought something you know comical or and interesting like the dick milking factory we just kind of hit it off as fast friends and just like  talk and swear and stuff like that with each other and so a huge part i'm like this sounds kind of flippant and cheeky but it's not a huge part of the reason why i bought the piece is because i was like well i get to buy this relationship with this amazing human being who like i want to be around for the next 20 30 years this thing will pay for itself in belly laughs with my friends many times over um and so uh so that's that that feels like a better investment than than something from some faceless person i i just want to give listeners contacts you spent more than 500 000 on that the cost of belly laughs for you is different than for other people i just needed to point out but okay before we but what we we don't need to dissect that more than we just did um but i did want to ask you before we go where do you think nfts will go over the next year or so well as a as i mentioned i think we're going to see a washout and a sort of migration quality um and that's why i spend more time on on on kind of like single pieces that i'm more excited about than collecting like you know a piece a day or 10 pieces a week or something like that but nonetheless the pie will expand uh because new categories are emerging like spatial vr nfts which we're really excited about you know more things in plato and gaming uh will emerge you know photography nfts are starting to have a bit of a moment music nfts are going to be massive music entities you know music to my to my knowledge is the the largest category of of art so it'll make sense that music nfts are also the largest category of nfts over time i would think well let's see uh you know wu tang like kind of tried it sort of pre having the the like the technology to to do it as a one-of-one but i think other artists will follow suit in that regard over time and so while there will be pain over the next year in it certainly maybe in the visual art nft space that's just the natural heaven flows markets and you know we should be used to that in our community by now all right well we will have to see how it all plays out thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you laura don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break there's a new cryptocurrency made for mobile that you can earn by downloading the nodal cache app it's free easy to use and there's no hardware to

started today that's n o d l e dot io unconfirmed [Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap before we dive in i just wanted to urge you to check out four articles that i published this week on medium i read about the graph protocol which is basically a decentralized google as well as why one of its potential competitors decided to instead help support the graph and become one of its core dev teams on facebook bulletin i explain the tokenomics of both bitcoin and ethereum if you need a refresher on how to value btc or eth or know a friend that is just falling down the crypto rabbit hole go check out these primers on my bulletin page all four links will be in the show notes for this episode first story about your dow hack left one user minus 906 btc badger dao a d5 protocol built to provide yield on bitcoin fell victim to an attack on wednesday night badger dao tweeted badger has received reports of unauthorized withdrawals of user funds as badger engineers investigate this all smart contracts have been paused to prevent further withdrawals according to peck shield the total loss is over 120 million dollars based on peck shell data it appears roughly 85 of the 120 million dollars came from four large bitcoin addresses which lost 906 491 203 and 184 btc respectively equating to losses approximating 51 million dollars 27 million dollars 11.4 million dollars and 10.3 million dollars as a press time thursday afternoon the cause of the exploit has yet to be confirmed however tritium or tritium or some pronunciation like that a batch core contributor speculated in the discord that it could be a front-end issue with the badger.com user interface tritium wrote there is no problem with the smart contracts it looks like a bunch of users had approval set for the exploit addresses allowing them to operate on their vault funds and that was exploited once we noticed we froze all the vaults so nothing can move and are trying to figure out where the approvals came from how many people have them and what next steps are such an attack which targets the front end of battery dow rather than the decentralized protocol itself raises many questions which a badger dao discord member named sciguy laid out in the main discord chat this hack has really opened up a can of worms for questions for me one how can we make sure what we approve in metamask is legit two how can funds be moved even with a rogue approval from a ledger secured wallet eg if i swap a coin on uniswap i must manually hit the buttons on my ledger twice once for the approval and once for the actual swap how is this hack possible three how the heck does a front end attack happen does this mean he hacked the server and uploaded a modified contract so when users click claim they get his while badger devs have yet to release any answers to the above questions eagerl capitals cryptocat vc pointed out on twitter that front-end exploits can be avoided through proper metamask approval hygiene practicing proper wallet approval techniques can save users from giving defy unlimited allowances tokens a feature deployed by dapps where users only have to approve the wallet dap connection once rather than for every token deposit while convenient this setup leaves users funds at risk as hackers have shown the ability to drain users wallets giving unlimited allowance to d5 protocols to allow this cryptocup vc explained don't trust the site's ui take the address manually from the metamask data and look at that contract on etherscan she added never approve more than you plan to use you can always approve more in the future yes it costs a few more dollars so is psychological help once you will get rugged square rebrands to block square the jack d'or sea lead payments firm is rebranding its corporate and identity to block according to a press release on wednesday since launching in 2009 square has expanded its scope to include a variety of crypto linked services including square crypto a square offshoot focused on bitcoin development cash app a mobile payment service turned bitcoin exchange title a music streaming service with nft aspirations and tbd 545-66975 a yet to be built decentralized crypto exchange in addition to building out services for crypto assets square also purchased roughly 170 million dollars of btc back in february the rebrand acknowledges that square is no longer just a payments company specializing in commerce solutions software and banking services for seller businesses says the company we built the square brand out for our seller business which is where it belongs said jack dorsey co-founder and ceo of block block is a new name but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same much like how facebook's rebrand to meta did not alter the name of facebook the social media app disclosure i write a newsletter for facebook meta block explained that its name change only distinguishes the corporate identity from the other parts of the company like square cash up title and tbd 545 and each 66975 those entities will keep its name square crypto however is rebranding to spiral a term the company thinks reflects on the nature of bitcoin as it continues to grow like a spiral from a single point encompassing more and more space until it touches everything the news comes just on the heels of block ceo jack dorsey stepping down from the ceo position at twitter the social media app he co-founded in june dorsey famously explained if i were not at square or twitter i'd be working on bitcoin if it needed more help than square and twitter i will leave them for bitcoin dorsey told the crowd at bitcoin2021 with his time at twitter over and squares rebrand a block it appears that dorsey is making his summer statement reality metaverse land is going fast metaverse real estate is getting hot data from dapp radar shows that out of the top 10 most expensive land purchases on the sandbox a virtual metaverse game eight of them happened within the last two weeks with each plot of land selling between eighty one thousand dollars and one hundred ninety one thousand dollars on decentraland a similar metaverse game five of the top ten most extensive land purchases happened in the past 14 days with eye-popping values stretching from 415 000 to 2.42 million dollars the latter purchase for 618 000 mana was claimed by the metaverse group which announced the largest metaverse land acquisition in history a 116 parcel estate in the heart of decentral land's fashion street district notably the metaverse group purchase outed an anonymous thanksgiving eve acquisition of genesis land in axi infinity for 550 eth or roughly 2.3 million dollars which marked the largest sale ever for a single plot of digital land at the time according to axionfinity's twitter account in total dap radar shows that over 100 million dollars worth of digital real estate traded hands over the seven days ending november 30th according to digital asset manager grayscale such buzzy numbers from the metaverse are to be expected going forward the metaverse is estimated to be a trillion dollar revenue opportunity across advertising social commerce digital events hardware and developer creator monetization wrote grayscale in a recent report banks want to get into bitcoin without getting into bitcoin a report from coindesk's ian allison says that goldman sachs is among a group of us banks attempting to figure out how to use bitcoin as collateral for cash loans allison cites three sources familiar with the plans goldman was working on getting approved for lending against collateral and tri-party repo said one source and if they had a liquidation agent then they were just doing secured lending without ever having bitcoin touch their balance sheet coinbase and fidelity digital assets were mentioned as potential candidates with whom the us banks are in discussion goldman and a handful of other big

million was lost in a defy hack spanning ethereum and polygon approximately 31 million dollars in cryptocurrencies were stolen from monox in a hack on november 30th monox a d5 platform specializing in liquidity pools saw about 18.2 million dollars in wrapped ether stolen along with 10.5 million dollars in matic other tokens were taken as well according to security researcher moody gupta the exploit was caused by a smart contract bug that led to incorrect price updates when doing token swaps he added the attacker did a bunch of swaps from mono x token to mono x token to pump the price of monox token in the system once the price was obscenely high they swapped their monox tokens for all the other assets in the system in a postmortem monox noted that it has a one million dollar insurance poll which it is working on distributing monox also hinted that more compensation could be coming for affected users please note that fixing the issue is at the forefront of our thoughts and most
