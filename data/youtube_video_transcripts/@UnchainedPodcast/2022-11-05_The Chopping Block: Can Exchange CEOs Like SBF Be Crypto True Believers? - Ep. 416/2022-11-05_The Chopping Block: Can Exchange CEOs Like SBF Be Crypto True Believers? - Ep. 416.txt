not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem all right hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so start with intros first up we got Tom the defy Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert crypto connoisseur and captain of compound next we've got to ruin the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and finally got myself I besieb the head hype man at dragonfly all four of us from early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice so it's been a wild week uh the big news of the week so I'm I'm in San Francisco right now and uh all of SF is a buzz about this finally Elon Musk was forced to buy Twitter and I was there I was here on um Friday I think Friday was the day that like he he came into the building and started cleaning house and um there were a bunch of reporters outside the Twitter office which is usually like kind of a dank part of SF uh people were just waiting for for employees to come walking out with like all their stuff in a box to try to interview them so it's it's been it's been crazy to see everybody is kind of a combination of scared and excited it turns out there's a lot of interesting crypto elements that are weaved into the story so for one part of the investment uh Syndicate included 500 million from binance CZ was interviewed about hey what do you think about investing into Twitter and he was like oh it's great I love Free Speech apparently Sam Baker freed was a shareholder in Twitter and so Sam Banker freed made some quick money I think he is he said he owned somewhere between a 50 and 100 million in uh in Twitter and so the buyout obviously did uh well for him uh Dogecoin for for him probably Dogecoin has gone nuts best performing ass set in the last week I think it's up well over 100 percent what do you guys think about the Twitter acquisition we're here now and everyone's worried about it well let's just start with the Doge piece because I think that's the most relevant and fun and interesting for uh the crypto audience so uh one of the documents that I saw that was released um pursuant to the lawsuit was actually a conversation he was having about you know the future of Twitter as a blockchain asset obviously you know leading up to the acquisition there was interest from a lot of crypto people to participate and CZ participated there was interested from SBF there was interest from a lot of other people obviously Elon Musk was well known for espousing an interest in crypto and so one of the documents that came out was actually him being asked about how Twitter could work on a blockchain and even though it was probably an offhand comment and it was like you know discardable and might have even been a joke he said that the tweets could themselves be posted onto a blockchain like Dogecoin and you might be in this situation in the future which are actually paying Dogecoin you know as a transaction to um republish the same content um or to retweet sort of retweet would potentially cost Dogecoin so I actually found that one interesting that he was talking about how maybe it could exist on a blockchain and to that you know whether it was a deliberate you know wink wink you know not to the community or not that you referenced Dogecoin as an example of how Twitter could integrate and so you know I think that's what was one of many things that fueled a lot of excitement um over the last week from the Dogecoin Community you know it might have been a joke Alana is truly the master of trolling in every sense of the word but I found that interesting that it has been a conversation about how Twitter could integrate in that you know he was using Doge as the example so these were in text messages right that like came out in Discovery or something so these are not intended for public consumption to be clear correct so I saw another Elon text League that came out also came out in Discovery where I forget who was talking to him about like running a decentralized Twitter and he was like very damn idea he was like no like that doesn't make any sense like there's not nearly enough scale to be able to process that you have like State blah blah blah and so it's like I don't really know where his head is at and it also reminded me like what's happening with blue sky blue sky is spot out but I'm assuming Twitter still owns some of it so like you know what's the latest with that project how does that relate to the Twitter acquisition um I don't quite know they did release their their uh first version and um yeah I'm friends with the person who runs it and I haven't talked to her in a while since she actually joined but before that she was more free they're actually doing something I mean the their model of the world is like they want everything to look like it and they want like everyone to be able to like clone their own Twitter repo and like you know be able to do you know like Forks of it um it's a little bit like I do feel like it's way too developery in the sense that it's like I could kind of it's I find a hard time imagining a non-developer using it it's like why did it take a long time you know git was invented in like the 90s like Linus Torvalds committed it I think the first commit message was like 1990 1981 but it did take bitbucket GitHub whatever to actually make it use useful but you know before that people were using like perforce Mercurial things like that and so there is there is kind of this trade-off of like if you make it a little too git-like and like need everyone to manage their own local Forks it's like really it's like yeah theoretically a wall is supposed to do that for you but it's like really hard with a social network at least in my mind well isn't that what Mastodon is supposed to be and like there was there's been this talk about people migrating away from Twitter to Macedon as like protest of Elon I assume this is like massively over by my favorite thing is like you know I would say like if I had to describe myself in the like the groups the the not really intersecting groups and Twitter I'm in that's like crypto Twitter ml Twitter some of math Twitter thumb physics Twitter and like physics Twitter and math Twitter are just like we hate Elon but whatever and ml Twitter is like oh my God this is going on this huge Rampage and then it's kind of ironic because I'm like these are people who are like the head of head of ml at Amazon like or head of ml open AI or like researcher at like professor at University and I'm like it is kind of ironic that the people who are working on the like most centralizing technology in the in the history of mankind are like we want this decentralized like chat platform like I I still can't get over the irony of that well but here's here's the other irony here's the other irony right is that a lot of the storytelling about why we wanted decentralized Twitter was that Twitter was making all of these unilateral decisions censoring people deciding which viewpoints were okay and which ones are not Elon is now explicitly saying Twitter's gonna stop doing that we're gonna be the platform of free speech blah blah if that actually happens which I I'm skeptical that it's going to happen and they're going to be able to retain advertisers but let's let's say that in fact it's going to do what what Elon says is going to do it kind of defeats a lot of the ostensible value proposition for why you care about censorship resistant Twitter if Twitter massively tones down the censorship on the other hand the people who are mostly complaining are really more on the left they're really more people just don't like Elon Musk think that he's an [ __ ] thinks that he's like bad for the world don't like the idea of billionaires owning platforms so their their protest is like a very different kind of protest than the kinds of protests that are previously animated call for a decentralized alternative to Twitter now of course the actual decentralized alternative Twitter today which is de facto Macedon is still like a tiny nothing that nobody really cares about I mean it's cool it's an awesome project but in reality it's like so small compared to what Twitter is I I don't know it feels to me a little bit it feels a bit too shrill right now and obviously we don't know what changes Elon is going to make he's talked about freezing moderation decisions until they construct some kind of council and that council is going to be making like very large important moderation decisions for the platform which is basically exactly what Facebook has if I recall and so essentially Twitter is going to become more like Facebook which I'm not sure really how radical that is and also for some reason do people perceive it as radical on both sides like I think on the on the right people are like wow that's like a radical change of open free speech and on the left they're like oh that's a radical you know reversion to allowing hate speech and all these other horrible things happen to my mind it's basically turning Twitter into Facebook I mean my favorite thing right after the announcement was all of the LARPing of like oh look I see no Bots around look I see more there's a there's a lot of like misinformation about misinformation which was kind of one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen uh that happened over the weekend I feel like I feel like yeah there's there there's a tremendous amount of virtue signaling going on right now around the Twitter acquisition uh or not acquisition but the best thing about it is all these people like who are tweeting about how to go follow their Mastodon server and then you go back to their Twitter the next day like oh no no actually like hey you come to my math zones are in it's like every day they're writing a tweet I find those tweets I find the funniest there's actually a really good like Hacker News comment someone was describing how to set up their Mastodon server and do all this and then someone was like yeah you could also like write out your you know message on the notes app and screenshot it and it would have the same effect because No One's Gonna See the [ __ ] Mastodon post um save yourself some time it was pretty good yeah to be clear we're talking a lot about Mastodon so it's probably worth explaining what it is so Mastodon is a Federated social media platform it's kind of like you know you can sort of set up your own server that acts as your own like sort of mini Twitter and many different people can have their own servers and servers can reference each other so it's like a Federated version of Twitter but it's entirely kind of self-sovereign servers and so this is It's existed for a very long time it's been kind of Niche and now people are talking about it because they're I think mostly because they're virtue signaling about Elon Musk buying Twitter so we'll we'll see what happens here there's been some Rumblings about so you know beyond the Dogecoin stuff there was also a potential leak it's a speculation unclear that um Twitter uh has been building a product to have a wallet integrated directly into Twitter were there any more details on that or was that was that this is it comes from a tweet from Jane Wong who I've followed for a long time she's great she generally I think her strategy is she like decompiles app store binaries and sort of pokes through it to find features that are in development and they tend to be pretty accurate and sometimes she even gets like screenshots of stuff that's in development so I would assume there's something in the current Twitter App Store binary that alludes to a wallet or as some sort of prototype for a wallet so I mean Twitter has been like the most Pro crypto of the big tech companies um which is which is kind of strange well I mean they have the crypto user base it's the feedback loop there right it can't just be one way like during the NFP boom I think I remember the interesting thing was like watching all of these accounts that had you know 150k to a million followers on Instagram coming to Twitter for the first time because they wanted to sell nfts and they like couldn't like no one on Instagram was buying any nfus and so I thought that was like a that's a pretty interesting Dynamic of like hey the market actually is like if if Twitter has any monetization vehicle that isn't just charging more for verification uh it probably has to use crypto I don't really see Twitter Twitter remember Twitter was Banning crypto advertising right so like they were making money on Twitter users by showing them irrelevant ads but if they were showing crypto ads they I think Twitter would become a crypto company they would have made so much money yeah the last cycle they should have right like 90 of nft marketing probably was Twitter and Discord and if we look at the two companies did they make any money off of that like I'm sure they're they're stock went up a bit based on some numbers but I I don't think that they made any like on a direct accountable Revenue basis you know imagine if they had an affiliate marketing thing with open City or any any link that went to openc from Twitter like openc paid them like two basis points of the fee-fi basement I mean I they could have done a lot of things could be more aggressive possible they are doing that for the pfps yeah they could be doing that for people that's true yeah I mean think about how much money metamask makes on you know charging 87 bips or whatever you bake that into Twitter like I don't see why not yeah unfortunately um Elon kind of took this thing over at precisely the wrong time to get the ring very much out of the crypto industry [Laughter] Finance pay however is the most impressive product of the last three months that I've seen period in crypto right like no I've not used it wait walk us through what it is because I have not used it yeah so binance has basically been actually Tom if you want to get up the busd market cap or bosd versus usdc market caps in the last three months I think that tells half the story but uh binance has really been working on getting busd their USD like stablecoin which is actually held in New York bizarrely because it's sort of issued by paxos and they've been working on getting that integrated in a lot of places and also you know actually removing usdc pairs on binance and like trying to encourage people to use busd yeah I think that's the bigger story right is like you basically are getting force converted into busd if you have usdc I don't know how much binance pay is driving that conversion but binance pay though has had like 10 billion dollars of actual volume that's just people sending the USD on binance to each other there's there's actually like quite a bit of like payment stuff that seems to be happening in bosd terms in Latin America and Africa actually in in Colombia during Devcon I I walked by a little like almost like local Bitcoins like place that would like take local currency and give you busd and I was like the first time I've seen that I've only seen that around amongst like local Bitcoins type of things I've never seen that for like a USD stable point wow and so I think the USD is I mean yeah you can just see the market cap growth it's like clearly you know they're really pushing on trying to get it to get used and it is 50 it's almost 50 of Circle of the ucc's market that's pretty close and it was like nothing before so so I think cz's been actually saying like literally since the accession closed like hey like I'm gonna keep trying to push like Finance pay to get integrated into Twitter so which is just using busd settlement kind of like the way Solana pays doing USBC settlement like um similar yeah you can see some of the growth here yeah there's kind of loosely related one of one of the things I've seen some handwringing about coming back to the Twitter story is the fact that there's so much um foreign ownership of Twitter and uh of course CZ is is one of those actors he owns a significant amount I think the um uh some of the Saudis own a very significant chunk of Twitter and then of course Elon Musk himself has significant business interests in China and has relationships with the governments of many other countries what do you guys think about the the the kind of free speech and or you know making something like a neutral a neutral ground for public opinion being potentially jeopardized by all these foreign interests having a big stake in Twitter I mean I think there's a lot of interest that held Twitter before it was taken private you know uh you know as a publicly traded company there's a lot of people that owned that you know I don't think it's going to change I you know I don't think you know it's going to increase uh necessarily you know they call it the intervention into what content's allowed and not allowed on Twitter I think in general Alum seems like he wants to take it in the opposite direction which is way less control over what content is allowed and so I think in general it's gonna you know you can call it free speech or you can call it you know whatever alarm wants it to be but I think there's gonna be less moderation I mean the other thing to keep in mind so Tesla is worth 670 billion dollars Twitter is worth something you know fair market value is probably somewhere in the order of 30 something billion so it's 1 20th less than 120th the value of Tesla to say nothing of SpaceX um and so very much from the perspective of Elon I have to imagine that his a matter of exactly what is interested in Tesla is but has to be much larger than his interest in Twitter and so to some degree Twitter might just become subordinate to his business interests in he did sell a lot of Tesla I mean not a lot relatives hold Holdings but like 10 something to defund this yeah but he still has more like net overall yeah it must be it must be a lot more so like look if if China's leaning on him and China basically says like look we're gonna cut your contracts uh or we're gonna make life much harder for you to do some of your manufacturing here or to access our our markets unless you blah blah blah blah with Twitter I I think that that does seem actually pretty seriously concerning and that might be in some sense the best argument that we have left for why Twitter why a decentralized version of Twitter is potentially more compelling Than A Moment Like This anyway okay let's let's move Off from Twitter we'll probably have a lot more to say once we actually know can I ask a quick question one one around the horn thing for each of us answer so do you think if Twitter moves to this Eight dollar you have to be your verification is paid for you will have less spammy check blue check marks do you think it'll increase stay the same decrease uh I did decrease I yeah I don't so I don't actually understand the concept here is it like if you're already verified you now have to pay or is it either that anybody can pay to get verified I think I think it is actually I think you have to pay if you're already verified but but I think they're going to change the verification process at least that's what yeah it does seem a bit too vague it seems a bit too vague right now what exactly is going to happen what I saw was that people who are verified I think it's ever anyone I think the problem with the current verification process is literally like do you know someone who works at Twitter ask them to give you a blue check mark and then they'll vouch for you are you saying this because you're the only one of us who's not verified so you sound a little selfie you know you know some of us are are men of the people oh okay that's right right that's right I just I'm never joining this new techmark cabal that's like that's like that's like the uh Knights of Columbus of of online media yeah I mean obviously like the purpose of the verification right is to prevent you know fake accounts and and bots so giving that to everyone seems kind of silly but I think the big question is just like why this monetization method like I understand maybe the desire to get away from advertising if you're going to be coming down in moderation but like if you just do the math like this doesn't really scale out to be meaningful to Twitter's bottom line like you know Twitter made like five billion dollars last year in Revenue like you you have to be able to make five billion dollars charging people eight dollars a month assuming of certain opt-in rates and certain usage patterns so it seems kind of like a weird sideshow yeah obviously a very small number of Twitter users are verified now if they do open up verification and say verification now means you're a real person rather than that you're a notable person or maybe there's like a two-tier system there's like a gray check mark for you're a real person and then a blue for you're a notable person I think there's just no way they're going to get rid of the blue check marks being a separate and special group of people that just seems like kind of intrinsic to how Society is organized right every single social media platform even Discord has this concept of like the blue verified check mark they're like yeah you're like a special notable person um it's on Facebook it's on pretty much every single social media platform has this concept so I'd be very surprised if Twitter get rid of it gets rid of it but they may add another thing which is you are a real person and everybody is going to be filtering your ability to engage with Twitter based on whether or not you can pass this real person test which is basically just civil resistance right it's just like pay eight bucks a month so it's almost like you're asking do you think paying eight bucks a month is like a good civil resistance mechanism I'm like yeah probably because like there's no way that the the average bot is making more than eight dollars a month bot irr it's pretty low that's why it's that's why it's so like you know it's because it's so cheap to spin up a bot on Twitter that's why all these things that's why they're there you know when I was at uh Airbnb I had this friend who actually worked at Spotify and then left Spotify to make a bot Farm like one of the the phones or farming Farms like the oh wow and they they they said the highest highest uh highest return is Spotify for sure because musicians will like pay way more to get moved up the ranks because like they have direct economic ties to it like uh record labels will sign you based on like those metrics so like it's literally worth money to them so oh yeah that makes sense so I was when I was at Airbnb I used to work on payments fraud and so we we had a pretty deep view into the economics of you know basically what it costs to spun up a fake spin up a fake account usually it involves like some kind of supply chain if you go on the dark net you buy uh you know compromised email whether it's like a Gmail or a Yahoo or whatever um you use that compromised Gmail that has some reputation to like create an account on Airbnb you you buy a you know a fake uh passport that's like the most expensive part of that supply chain if you actually have to kyc that's why kyc is often the gold standard is that it's just the most expensive to fake yeah for the most part like it gets you into the several dollars and unless you're on a very high value Marketplace like Airbnb Airbnb is very very high dollar value if you can scans on Airbnb because these transactions are you know hundreds or even thousands of dollars but doing it on a much smaller scale and a smaller platform just doesn't unit economics just don't work so I I'd imagine during the during the Heyday of crypto it would have been worth it because a single Arc can net you so much money if somebody Falls for your scam but today with many fewer eyeballs on crypto and people just being more um just being less crazy and less kind of maniacal about what's going on in the space my guess is that conversions and Roi are super down for freelance cameras across the industry actually one I guess this brings back one other question amongst the current crypto native uh actually I saw this in the YouTube questions which is why I wanted to bring this up which is like amongst you know lens and forecaster kind of where do you how do you feel about the like native crypto social networks I think we've actually never talked about them on the show all right remember exactly where what are your opinions on them because I you know I feel like I don't have a fully formed opinion other than I I've definitely heard a lot of people saying that like forecasters like the VC is a VC Twitter just migrated and lens is like the d-gen's migrated but like that's like the highest level thing and I've used lens I've never used forecaster so I don't don't have much strong in terms of strong I feel like that's right I don't know is anybody active on either forecaster or lens I check out fart Caster sometimes maybe once or twice a week you go on twice a week that's pretty good yeah yeah okay yeah I feel like um with with these with these crypto social media plays I feel like they're mostly there's a great piece by Eugene way called status as a service it's like the quintessential piece on understanding how new social media platforms come into existence and like how they compete with each other um and I think the the primary thing that matters when it comes to giving life to a new social media platform is understanding what is the status game that's being played on this new platform and what is the crew or the community or the vibe or the um you know just the group that I'm going to be joining if I join this platform and so I think it's much less about the technology it's much more about the community and the people and the and the kind of status that you're afforded by getting on this new platform and so I think Tyrone you're absolutely right one's for djans one's for VCS um if they can make that work maybe that's a good way to see the new community um but I but I think it's tough right most social media plays fail just you know kind of on the from the beginning yeah forecaster reminds me a lot of early Reddit like kind of 2002 2007 2008 when it was like seeded by all the YC people and so similar kind of thing like people uh mine what is already happening on a social network and so that's kind of the vibe of the culture that's like been seated on on farcaster yeah I don't know that people are fundamentally driven by I like this thing because it's decentralized you know I think like maybe for Macedon I think Mastodon is actually a good example of people who are really ideological and are abusing something because it's decentralized or because it's Federated or whatever whatever you want to call it I think vast majority of users don't make decisions that way they make decisions based on a value proposition and for social media the value proposition is social so it's like who's there what's the content that's there that's what's going to make people make these decisions um but I can imagine that starting from the place of we are going to be this you know Max lady centralized Place attracts the right people attracts the right crowd builds you the right culture I think it's possible but um you know you have to you have to prove it here's my extremely naive and extremely macro perspective on this so if you look at like what tech companies have been in the business of doing over the last like 10 years like in general it's been a massive struggle to build enough server Farms to even like host and keep up with their platforms because they have in some cases actually a billion users which is incomprehensibly a large amount of usage Google and Facebook and Twitter like everyone who's like been in this market has just been investing so hard and just keeping a platform like up and you know when I look at centralized versus decentralized just like data and compute and hosting it's like yes all of these platforms are amazing when you have 10 000 users like you literally can run anything on a blockchain with 10 000 users you really can't run anything in a decentralized or distributed way when there's a billion users unless you make like radical changes and compromises and so you know I I think all of these you know Alternatives look amazing When you're counting users in the tens of thousands I don't necessarily expect the you know function you know when there's 100 million or a billion I don't know if 100 million or a billion people want to use something just because it's decentralized but like the hardest problem is building something that 100 million or a billion people want to use and that's unbelievably hard and once you do that it's just an unbelievably complicated and difficult Tech problem of being able to serve them without going down instantly I mean I will say one thing I think that's interesting about the lens version of the world is like it sort of implicitly assumes that there's going to be hundreds of Roll-Ups and each Community is going to like run on its own roll up and like you and it's sort of in my mind like if the multi-chain thesis and like people are willing to have their own coin for validation works like you I could see that being a better version of um sort of blue sky or Macedon yeah like like I can kind of see that the incentivized version of those for many small communities could work versus like the one big Melting Pot type of thing and and I like the it's cool to see the experiments with that I mean that's basically the difference between Reddit and Twitter right like Twitter is a giant public forum Reddit is like a bunch of little communities it feels like I mean I I'm not I haven't spent that much time thinking about these things but it does seem like those are two almost different categories of social media and I don't think you're going to end up in a similar place right like the kinds of conversations that happen on Reddit are very different than the kind of conversations that happen on Twitter and sometimes people complain about that they're like oh the idea like anybody can kind of jump up and reply guy you when you're on Twitter and on Reddit like you're in these very specialized forums oftentimes they're very different rules very different etiquette people often try to create those sub communities within Twitter and say okay well this is like this is the part of Twitter where we talk this way and we do this kind of thing but you kind of always know that like you're not an enclosed space you are talking in public and um that it feels like one of the different categories of how social media and how these sort of digital spaces effectively are going to be cordoned off and how we're going to think about the rules around them like if you look at the way that people the way that people use the decentralized Social Media stuff today the interesting thing about it is that it's mostly starting almost all these communities are starting with very high value users right so they're very wealthy they're usually accomplished they have a lot of free time these are not like the the person who's joining Twitter today is very likely a very low value user the really you know can a wealthy knowledgeable connected Elite people they're already on Twitter they're already on social media and so in some sense I kind of feel like a little bit of what's happening with these decentralized social media plays is they're trying to attract a very very wealthy High LTV community and if you can do that then it's a value for for users who are in your lifetime value lifetime um it's plausible that um if you have like really really valuable users because they're all like kind of the crypto intelligencia or the crypto super wealthy and they hang out in one particular place that their eyeballs will be way more valuable than other eyeballs right but fundamentally that's how social media platforms monetize they monetize on eyeballs and they advertise stuff to you right so you can imagine that maybe that's a story of how even if these social media platforms that are decentralized don't become world scale they don't get hundreds of millions or even billions of users um but they're just a place where everyone there is super valuable to advertise to um that's one story of how they can become valuable another story is that they monetize in a totally different way so you know obviously people have talked for a long long time about the idea that you have to pay to tweet you have to pay to retweet you have to you know people get paid for curating blah blah I'm skeptical of those stories I think like free is just so good it's just hard to it's just it's just so charismatically obvious that that's what people want they just want they don't want to think about paying money to interact with a with a social media platform but I think that's the to my mind that's the pull case is that you build a really engaged really valuable community and that Community even though there are many fewer people than you have for broader social media they're worth a lot more dots yeah I mean that's definitely true you know my my dumb Heroes because until I see a 10 million view Tick Tock video about someone being excited to pay for clicking like it somehow has to become like its own meme and like there's no way paying from going from free to that will be but this idea of like somewhere in the middle of Reddit and Twitter finding like a hybridization crypto might actually be good for that it it sort of is it does send lend some properties of both sides of that public Agora versus the like very you know hierarchical structured Niche combo right okay well let's let's move on we have a another interesting topic that took place in the last week so SPF same the founder of FTX um he released a bunch of statements about this proposed regulation called dccpa um I have no idea what it stands for but it doesn't matter basically digital currency uh regulation that is still we don't have a finalized bill yet but the bill basically is going to one put the cftc in charge of regulating the crypto spot markets as well as a bunch of other stuff that may potentially touch defy or other elements of crypto it's a little bit unclear right now what's gonna actually end up being in the final bill and so he posted a bunch of tweet storms about his views on how crypto regulation and crypto policy should evolve and there ended up being a lot of backlash against SPS use here it seems like all of a sudden SPF has turned from the hero to the villain of the crypto Community now a lot of people are very suspicious of his views on any of this stuff you want to say something when has an exchange CEO not have had a fall from grace in crypto I I can't I think that's literally everything alone not a fall from grace yet that's that's a stronger term I think than what he has I think it's more of like uh you know a reveal that yes Sam Baker freed has his own interests that are not just but okay but every every exchange CEO has had that as far as I can tell including hate if you count hate in those one even Hayden has had that I feel like shift Sweden hasn't I mean a little bit I I feel like the the post Sushi thing kind of like changed the change to have a little bit of this I I I I I think people still love hate it I don't think there's that I I think I think Sam I think uh Brian Armstrong and CZ each of them have there's there's a there's a shadow to them now that I think people people understand and appreciate that once upon a time they didn't you know I I correct my statement I said every exchange to you star has never had that happen star was always you know star okay that's fair that's fair okay well okay so he so he posted this stuff got a lot of backlash and there was a fantastic debate between him and Eric Voorhees who is the founder of shapeshift so Eric Voorhees long time kind of Bitcoin uh influencer thought leader type person his founder of shapeshift which back in the day was one of the biggest decentralized exchanges back you know before that was a really uh totally coherent defy thing um so Eric Voorhees published a long piece in rebuttal to uh Sam's uh proposal for crypto regulation and they ended up doing a debate on Bank list which I thought was fantastic if you haven't seen it it's like two hours long but it's really a fascinating debate I think it goes into a lot of the core questions behind how crypto ought to be regulated and kind of kind of in a sense goes the heart of what we're even doing in this industry um what did you guys think about this argument between sandbank and freed and uh and Eric Voorhees I mean before we get into the material of the debate I do want to say I feel like Sam I like Sam but you should probably get like an image consultant I think he lost pretty much just purely on the Aesthetics of the debate it's like Sam and like the FTX call center like you know bouncing his leg up and down and like you're kind of tweaking out and speaking like a thousand words per minute and then Eric is in this like giant mansion in Denver and he like speaks extremely calming and he has like glow around him and I'm like even if you didn't know what they were saying you know there's definitely a a bias here but I think um yeah there's there's one sort of very poignant point which sort of got circulated around footer which is sort of a rehash of this argument that's that's discussed a lot around the difference between like Gmail and SMTP where you know you can have a protocol and you can have a client and that you can interface and the client can make certain implementation decisions and uh but everybody gets to you know subscribe to this protocol and basically you know Eric sort of rolled this out in front of Sam and asking him like you know why do you think we should treat D5 differently than we treat email and there was not really a good answer and I think that was kind of the moment when the when the debate tipped and so yeah overall I think like you you know I think if you actually read the proposal it's it's not that unreasonable I think the main sort of point that people take issue with is the Neva regulated front ends but still allowing the protocols themselves to be unregulated but certainly you know I think again just uh a lot of the sort of narrative and Aesthetics based um which is sometimes unfortunate so just just to summarize briefly actually Tom can you pull up the image from that video because I think it illustrates exactly what you're talking about but the Crux of the disagreements there's there's a few kind of minutia but they got stuck on one particular question which was should front ends be allowed to be regulated and Sam's view was that look it's not great if front ends are regulated like front ends for D5 protocols uh like you know the website the URL the domain name whatever um it's not great for front ends to be regulated but if you're going to give up something give up that rather than give up everything else so he's kind of like look chalk up chop off the hand to save the body and Eric's view is like look why would we chop anything off we don't even know that we need to drop anything off like we have to fight for the whole body and why are you giving up so quickly it seems like you have some ulterior motive if you're giving up this quickly that was kind of the thrust of the disagreement between between the two um it's it's definitely the case oh okay this is great we got Sam and then uh we got Eric and you have to kind of watch the debate I think to sort of get a full feel for it but it was great I think they both made great points but Eric has such blue eyes it's amazing it was yes kind of uh kind of terrifying how gorgeous of a man is um you saw the debate as well what were your thoughts I didn't see the debate oh you didn't oh okay I have other things to do I'm not just a investor I don't have time to listen to podcasts all right all right I'm sorry well here's here's what I said Keepers don't write themselves you know I know I know I know here's what I say having having uh having listened to the date and and um I think the problem Tom you said the problem is one of really messaging and I think in many ways it's true during defy summer Sam really came to prominence for his like kind of just his extreme and extremely rigorous thinking and clarity and uh when you're analyzing like liquidity Mining and you're trading stuff and like that's the name of the game and you're talking about Solana and serum and all these different things it's like oh that's amazing you're like a metallic-like person and he made people rich and he may be maybe no don't forget I think that's of course the important halo effect yes 100 100 I think it's very similar to Andre in many ways like I think he sort of had an Andre like cult of personality around one making people money but then also a similar Fall From Grace similar Fall From Grace because um or not I get fall from grace too strong I would say you know just kind of um losing that halo around him and I think part of it was because that same analytical rigor when it comes to a moment when it demands that like that bitcoiner like political religious grandstanding right like you kind of have to stand up take a stand and give a sermon I think that's where Sam is not the strongest and you've heard the debate like Sam was kind of like like wait hold on to find your terms what do you mean by this okay is this like a one out of a ten is this like a seven for you is this a nine um he was all he was really trying to like get this like step-by-step breakdown of everything that Eric was trying to debate and Eric he was making this very impassioned claim look what is the point of all the stuff that we're doing you know he's kind of flailing around he's kind of making this big beautiful you know in a church speech exactly exactly something that looks like a church exactly about what he believes and why he's in this industry like he's a True Believer you know and uh I think that that really came across in that in that debate and I think this is one of the places where I think Sam from the perspective of a regulator is extremely reasonable and they're like he is somebody who a regulator can work with um but he's not somebody who the people of like crypto Twitter just you know drawn broadly feels like they represent them as a religious leader yeah and that's right I think now the breakdown is happening Sam has like less wrong brain you know he's like I'm a rationalist and everyone else is a rationalist and you know unfortunately I think for most people it's actually not a very compelling argument unless of course you know you also are yeah I I guess you know maybe I'll take his side somewhat and win one way which is like I think if you're an exchange CEO you always kind of have to be duplicitously on both sides there's just not any way to actually be a True Believer in anything because you're running a venue whose entire goal is to make no sort of like long-term belief in any one asset you're trading you're just trying to believe in like the net volume growing and so like that's inevitably like your utility function if you're a utilitarian you know your utility function is much more correlated to that whether it's a defy exchange whether it's centralized exchange and I think the problem is the narratives that exist in in Twitter and especially I think in in Define nft land are much more emotionally charged in some ways or at least like evocative and less about like utilitarianism of any form whether philosophically or whether it's just like hey I'm an expected utility maximizer and somehow I think you know every exchange CEO has to go through it's just like not possible for them to Forever ride the wave up and I think it's all it's inevitably also correlated with Market going down and like you know people are now like kind of like oh like looking for someone to blame for for things especi and if it's someone who got you rich and then maybe perhaps if you're joined later and made you poor or whatever in your eyes as an emotional Trader as opposed to a rational one it's very easy to see the see the see how that that can happen but I just don't think it's possible to to run an entity like an exchange and somehow ever have any real philosophical belief in anything I I think that seems too strong that seems too strong yeah I think like Brian Armstrong and like Jesse Powell seem pretty passionate about like you know they're sort of like uh was it like Rob Lowe in the NFL hat they're just like they love crypto you know it's a lot more as they stepped away CZ is a True Believer CZ is absolutely a True Believer like I I think it's possible to do both I think Sam is relatively unique in his kind of compartmentalization um but I think most exchange CEOs I don't think that's true I think most CEOs are true believers like you kind of have to be to stick it through that brutal of bear markets um I mean for binance it's not as true I think for like okay for who I'll be for you know bitmax for sure the folks who've been around for Kraken right for even for coinbase like you had to stick it through some really freaking brutal times when nobody cared what you were doing you still sort of are not like I think if you started 2017 or later it's probably quite different than the exchanges before and like that's why you made this exception for binance right like when you said it it's it's a lot less philosophical and there's a lot less like provenance of like when you ask people why they are interested or got into space they don't have a like great Cypher Punk Awakening or like a like oh like this particular hashing algorithm I'm the inventor of it like you know there's none of that type of stuff and so like because of that I think I think like if you're new especially if you joined during the 2021 cycle you know I think like you you you also didn't do any provenance what you know research behind and to inevitably get these time-based conflicts it's it's like it's like uh speedrunning you know uh gen Z hating millennials it's true FDX has also kind of been up only since they started right like it was uh what was it 2018 2019 when they started so they've kind of just burst on the scene it's been kind of perennial bull market for them since uh they've been here so maybe that's also part of it did you all see the um story today where their balance sheet was released to coindesk yes alamitas yeah yeah so the high level summary I believe they had what was it like something like uh four billion Equity or six billion equity and a lot of it was ftt they had a lot of FDT on the balance sheet that they used to to borrow against that's right yeah yeah it did feel a little bit incomplete in the sense that like there's just not enough to really understand what is going on there without understanding like what did their loan agreements look like uh you know what's the relationship between Alameda and FTX you know how much like is Sam backstopping personally some of the some of the loans that they have so it's hard to tell really what's going on there also this is June so probably A lot's changed between June and and today as well but you have to imagine all these numbers are probably a lot bigger at the end of the year so but again hard to know I mean also I mean obviously they have to have a ton of ftt a if if they sold any ftt everyone is dumping immediately there's no there's no doubt about that they're the biggest Market maker that uses ftt is collateral so first of all there's that secondly they couldn't sell all that without taking 99 haircuts on everything so I would just throw away the ftt part because it's all about rebates on their own exchange right like I mean you have to stake ftt uh so I would kind of ignore the ftt part and like focus on the other part the two billion dollar Equity book was interesting because I was like that's a lot of private deals to have done uh I I don't know that seemed a lot larger to me it could be it could be FTX Equity though you don't know that's true but that would be bad for their disaffiliation story to get past the cftc and to get all these trust licenses right it could be voyages they have a major shareholder who is in the main Market maker yeah I mean look I the reality is that like this leak was so vague that we don't really know anything they also they they said in the leak that coindesk reviewed these this piece but they also didn't know whether this was the only entity that elementa owns right so like very often there are multiple entities involved in these things we might just be seeing one part of the balance sheet so yeah he's like look unless you go do due diligence on Alameda you really don't know what the complete picture looks like yeah and also ftt is a weird rehypothecary asset for getting fee rebates and stuff right so you should you should really be very I don't think you need I don't think you need like a billion dollars of [ __ ] to get free release right like clearly that that's just like they have that for collapse I mean if you are the number one market maker and you want 99 of rebates because the rebates are distributed by ftt staking and you made the coin wait but like doesn't Sam own Alameda so like Sam is paying himself yeah like what who cares well I mean why would it why would it matter taking revenue from FTX and distributing it to Alameda shareholders I mean his other shareholders FTX sure okay fine yes but it's just it's very anyway it doesn't matter I I mean I'm just pointing out that it's not that unlikely you know if you're like truly you tell I think Steve's point was you don't need a billion dollars of ftt to get like the max rebate yeah maybe you do need a billion dollars to defend the ftt price because you we're trying to get SPF back on the show at least once or twice so hey I just I defended him in this Eric Voorhees thing I I think it's it's okay just the nature of being a shame to you you can't all right Robert what's your what's your view on the the Sam kind of you know dark side coming out I I think I think pretty clear that his interests are in making money and what he calls effective altruism um his motives are not the benefit of an industry or the decentralization of an industry or to see any individual project succeed whether it's the smallest startup or Bitcoin I don't think that matters to him I think what he cares about is operating successful exchange and trading business fair enough well um so I'm I I I've actually I knew Sam before he got into crypto because I've also been a long-time effect of altruist and I first met him in 2015 I think it was 2015. back when he was still working at Jane Street because it was you know a pretty small community at that time the one thing I will say about Sam is that Sam is um he's a very very honest person and so I think he's now he's now in a tough position because he has a lot of he has a lot of stakeholders that he has to be responsive to some of them are you know people who own equity and FDX some of them are you know users of his platform some of them are just people in crypto right I remember last year he came in to try to save Sushi and you know kind of took it over from Chef Nomi he was doing all the stuff you could tell that it was very much for him the feeling of obligation to just like be kind of a good guy and do the right thing now those it clearly the the things that are pulling at them are much more complicated and coming from many more angles than they were at any time in the past um and so I I feel for him but at the same time like it's very clear that uh you can't keep that Halo for too much longer if he wants to have real power in this industry pretty much nobody gets to keep that Halo if you uh stick around long enough so unless you want to be just like a Pure Freedom Fighter and not make any real money I would not say Eric for he's as poor though do you think Eric Voorhees does a Halo the Satoshi dice didn't roll themselves laughs that is a fantastic lie to it I gotta I gotta give you credit for that we gotta we gotta we gotta make that the uh the subtitle for the show okay last thing so last thing that happened this week is that we saw um this this interesting phenomenon of these Reddit nfts blowing up the volume has kind of died down a bit now it's being replaced by the um those are art goblers art gobblers you can tell you can tell I'm very cool they gobblegoons does yeah that's right that's right so we are the most NSF NSFW high value nft that exists yes it is true but so the Reddit entities were very interesting because of just how broad-based it was right so like the the art gobbler is very kind of crypto native very kind of Insider thing the thing that's fascinating about the red nfts they had millions of people who were grabbing hold of this stuff now they were not trading it on chain they were not actually swapping the stuff but uh yeah Tom can you walk us through like what exactly was the pro like how did Reddit introduce these nfts yeah and uh what happened with the trading volume so these have been around for a while um so they launched this summer but the initial version of it was kind of more like an art nft platform like a foundation where it's like you can go and mint it and it's all on polygon and you go pay the artist for Yosemite cheese and like they weren't that popular but they launched this second version which is very abstracted out so when you go and mint it it doesn't call it an nft it doesn't call it a wallet it calls it you know a collectible and you create a vault and so it's like and you kind of see that actually in the usage numbers where yeah the user numbers look very impressive and it's almost 3 million people who own these but very few people have actually traded them and so uh you're looking at like a few hundred people who've actually you know traded them and so you kind of get the sense it's you know there's this idea of like sort of like the defy mullet where it's like the front end is you know all dollars and the back end is plugged into D5 this is like the nft moment it's like it's you know Reddit on the front end and you don't know that their nfts on the back end whether that's effective product strategy or not it's kind of TBD but interesting to see like this time around they've actually gotten a good chunk of activity so do they do they actually call them nfts or do they just call them Collectibles they're just called Collectibles I think in the documentation you can see that they're nfts right but in the actual product experience yeah I mean the best part was reading some of the posts of people being like these things are much better to trade than nfts they don't have the baggage like I love being able to sell things and it's like uh okay there's a lot there's a lot of like convoluted like circular reasoning yeah some some of the comments that were on Twitter and Reddit especially were incredible where people were just like you know nft bashing and saying like nfts have absolutely no utility whatsoever thank God for the digital Collectibles they have so much and like unironically I mean just like people couldn't separate you know the fact that you know their digital Collectibles were nfts I mean in a way what it's telling us is that like we kind of messed up The nft Branding right like the concept behind nfts and digital collectible like yeah totally perfect product Market fit but the word kind of has some stank on it now and so I feel like a16z needs to come in and Rebrand nft the way they rebranded crypto to web3 like we need a new we need a new word yeah yeah web for digital work that's what yeah wait was it did we do web five we got to go to web six now jump to web five but we see yeah so we gotta we got it yeah we got it's like Windows 10 right like you skip you skip nine you take up the middle one why why no no no no no you can't you get no you get the middle one because then that means that windows that there's no windows it means that web 5 is better than you already look Windows went backwards it went from Windows uh 2000 to XP and then to seven that's true that's true that's a big drop yeah yeah well it was it was it was 98 and then 2000 and then down to seven so you're like dropping two layers that that is true three one is the best though Windows three one I mean I love that one yeah only uh only only certain people remember this oh yeah well interesting how have you guys been uh doing the art cobbler stuff no I I haven't I made a vow to myself at some point a couple months ago that I would no longer purchase nfts and so I am wait what what right yeah it was public we talked about it on the show I think yeah we talked about on the show did we talk about the show we mentioned that you guys gave me like some Flack for it oh yeah you were like hey what a wimp why wouldn't you buy nfts well I'm glad that I I don't remember this but I'm glad that my past self did what I wanted to do just now so um I feel Vindicated yeah okay how does it feel how does it feel Being Sober on on nfts and if it's Friday it's interesting I mean it's like drinking water at a party right like everyone else is like you know having like a wild time like it's you can have a great time just drinking water watching you know and having conversations and all that but I'm not a participant in this one so I just find the concept gross and I would feel embarrassed if I ever was involved in purchasing one in any way shape or form it's just like the grossest story and I just like look at those nfts I'm quite repulsed the same here it's some sort of uh furry thing right that's my understanding it's Paradigm plus the guy who made that show uh Rick and Morty yeah Rick and Morty yeah but like it's like it's like a little too gross for my taste like I kind of like yeah sure maybe like the five people who watch adult swim and also use crypto Twitter are gonna love this [ __ ] and that's just the five of them on that I think there's actually a pretty large overlap between like kind of you know Peter Pan Stoners and people who buy a lot of crypto interesting thing about the the uh it was a one of those Frida free to earn launches um and basically you know obviously all that does is just make the Mev auction take all the initial Revenue instead of the Creator but whatever uh you could see the Mev auction actually the one of the first ones someone paid more than the first resale that they did so it started with the start with the now but I think the interesting thing about this uh kind of start of this thing I mean I think the cool part is they have like this two token thing it's sort of like it's almost like an own bond in some way except instead of a bond you have this like nft then if you own enough the nfts you can like mint the erc20 this goo and uh you keep you kind of have a cycle of like use the liquid asset and use a liquid asset and that part is kind of interesting but it's it's just like the mechanics of this thing and the way the like if you looked at the actual like number of users a number of unique wallets there was just like it was not this was it was a very like pretty non-organic what was the total number of users like I I hadn't looked today but I think sometime yesterday was like almost 3K yeah but it was it was pretty pretty non-organic you could see like if you drew if you like drew the address Cycles there's a lot of washroom because of the way this the mechanism Works to like move between the like liquid like own the nfts on the goo stake it and you get more nft like that stuff basically seems to be dominated by like you know 50 10 to 15 people if I were to guess that makes sense it feels a little bit like mechanically kind of similar to dark force in that like it kind of nerd sniped a bunch of people who are like both smart and into nfts and for everybody else they're just like kind of excited about the the price movement I think if they did this last year it would have been a huge hit it would have been like could have memed like um but this year it is a huge hit I mean it is like number one on open C I think it was at least yesterday compare the number one on openc now to the number one open C six months ago I mean true and my point is like it's on it it could have it could have had a it was like a little late for the cycle like right and it's also just doesn't have a Mass Appeal like the thing about board apes and crypto punks is like they don't offend that many people and at the end of the day like they're not like really that offensive I feel like a lot of people would find Art cobbler's offensive it's fair that's fair uh but it does it does definitely fit well into the crypto sensibility um because I think crypto crypto does kind of embrace a lot of offensiveness kind of at its core so I I feel like it's not too far off the mark there but anyway I think we're I think we're up on time uh so we'll we'll be back at you uh in a week or two so until then thank you everybody signing off [Music]
