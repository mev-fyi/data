foundation welcome Kathleen and Ryan thank you great to be on here Thank You Laura just a heads up for listeners Kathleen and the foundation will not be commenting on any questions about pending lawsuits so you won't hear any questions about those today Kathleen why don't you start with how you got into crypto and tell us what Tazo says oh well I drew can we say that I married into cryptocurrency so my husband and I are pretty passionate about the core promise of cryptocurrency overall we're just to make a world with online native digital asset to the Internet and so we got interested in Bitcoin pretty early on around 2012 or so and in 2013 we started to think a little bit more about the cryptocurrency craze and around that time was the first sort of alt coin boom which we come referred to as a Cambrian explosion of different forks of Bitcoin all of which purported to have new innovations on top of the core Bitcoin protocol which we've been following pretty closely and so the common argument around that time was that this was actually great for Bitcoin overall because all of these innovations which were seen in things like like coin the first iterations of Z cash in this first papers that led to Z cash could all be folded into the Bitcoin protocol and the question we posed was how you know cuz Bitcoin didn't have a very clear way to upgrade itself in the code base that was attached to it and so from this core observation was born tezo's which is a smart contract platform which was launched into a beta net phase on June 30th of this year so it's been a while but basically the core observations and ideas that led to this originated from our close observation of the space in 2013 and led to the beginning of Tesla's development of 2014 and finally the be no net launch which was a few weeks ago and in terms of what tase us is it is a solution to how it is that you could upgrade such a protocol it has a governance mechanism by which people can propose different upgrades they can actually write the code for those they can maybe if if the people who are using the protocol like the proposal can vote to adopt it and then those developers can also then be rewarded in tokens for their contribution correct yeah that's the core promise of ties OSes well block teams are ultimately a coordination technology and bitcoin and every other cryptocurrency does have some form of governance mechanism but what tezo's tries to do is by formalizing this process and giving people a way to actually amend the process itself hopefully there's a better better mean to iterate on existing innovations in the space and the ecosystem and just for listeners who don't know Kathleen's husband is Arthur Brightman who he's the CTO of dynamic ledger solutions is that correct indeed yes okay yeah and so he wrote the first phase white paper under under a pseudonym LM Goodman named after a Newsweek reporter who tried to name Dorian Nakamoto a Satoshi Nakamoto all right Ryan you got in encrypted and what you do is head of the Taser Foundation yeah that's a great question let me give a little bit of a background so I was a an executive and turnaround specialist in the healthcare industry and also during that period of time co-founded a software company that I sold and then after that decided to do something totally different to jump in the humanitarian space for about two years and really researching researching and experimenting on ways to help the poor in developing countries and how to lift them out of poverty and help them love that work after that decided to jump back into technology and had an executive role at a fin tech company and then during that time just became I had to call a colleague introduced me to you know to blockchain and all things blockchain and just became incredibly passionate about it just about the technology and about the promise that there is through the technology to see really a change in the world for I believe the better and so I would just spend a ton of time researching deep diving on different aspects of blockchain technology different protocols and came across Tasos and you know read the white paper and was really impressed by the ability clear back in 2014 of Arthur to be able to look into the future and to be able to see the problems that would be relevant in the space and then also to provide solutions for that and so I became a regular contributor during the you know donation period and subsequently like many became concerned when I heard about the dysfunction at the Talos foundation and so helps to organize the the global community around a petition to be able to make sure that the the community's voice was heard and all that was happening and and through subsequent events and continuing to help organize the community became ultimately you know the president of the TSS foundation someone who was seen as a trusted intermediary I think to be able to solve the know that the situation that the the dysfunction and really to move things forward yeah so we're gonna get more into this function that existed that is a foundation before you came on board but before we get there if the next set of questions are actually primarily directed at Kathleen because I want to go into taste of this history but Ryan you can feel free to jump in where you see fit Kathleen Jesus started as a white paper that Arthur published but you didn't and that happened in 2014 but you didn't have your ICO in 2017 so what happened in those intervening years 2014 to 2017 yeah I mean it was a pretty tumultuous time in the cryptocurrency space during the course of those three years or so I think some of the ideas in Tasos faded in and out of fashion and so we kept on working on the code we had a prototype in 2014 and a lot of the same logic from that core prototype is really what you see today in terms of divorcing and three layers of the protocol using a generic network shell in order to distinguish what's the canonical version all that logic has basically been around for the past three years or so mostly what's been worked on the past year and a half or yeah year and a half give or take it's been the networking layer in the peer-to-peer messaging layer of Tasos which is of course very fragile and very important to the functionality of the code base but I think what you mean to ask is why why conduct a fundraiser in 2017 and why go that route well the short answer is Arthur and I kind of had a hobbyist attitude towards this project and so it was simple enough to do this nights and weekends and have a interest in what was going on but I think the ecosystem was very immature at the time and it wasn't really easy for us to engage at what point we should jump in or if Tesla really even garner much interest but it became pretty obvious in 2016 for a variety of reasons that the core premise of what we had touched upon in 2014 was at the very least in vogue if not deeply needed by a but by the marketplace and say we thought that was an interesting experiment to endeavor upon and by that are you talking about the issues with scaling and Bitcoin and then what happened with the etherium hard fork yeah exactly basically the tezo's white paper when he came out in 2014 and a fair amount of people picked up on it some of the existing advisors read it and they were very impressed for example so we've had the same advisors for a few years now but largely the fanfare was was not exactly there because the position paper for example talks a lot about a lot you know some severely abstract terms many of which have been study now like the whole notion of minor just you know incentive alignment is something that we discuss in the position paper but it seemed kind of far off at the time but since then people have studied how miners act in Bitcoin for example and how they may not have the same interest as token holders so things like that tension seem very abstract in the position paper but came to I think came to be sort of the discussion or part of a fruitful discussion 2016 between the scaling to being Bitcoin and between the contentious hard fork in etherium in 2016 with the dow hack yeah I definitely agree that has events played out it became clear that a solution like Tasers that had so-called Unchained governance could be an interesting way to try to go about and resolve these types of issues although you know this doesn't mean that it's a certainty that arching governance is actually going to work you know obviously everything is an experiment now but what under one other thing I wanted to ask about those years you were working at r3 and it just fill in you know kind of what it was that you and Arthur were doing professionally during those time during that time yeah of course uhm yeah so I guess 2014 I finished up a stint at broader associates which is a hedge fund in Connecticut and then I went to work as a consultant for Accenture by my own admission I'm not a great consultant and so when the opportunity came in house to kind of build up a blockchain practice I jumped at that because I knew quite a bit about Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency and so I soon started working on the internal sort of blockchain working group and I quickly found it much more interesting than any other consulting opportunities I had at the firm and I found more and more excuses to participate in that and I was very lucky to have a lot of guidance and mentorship within the firm that was hospitable to me actually in indulging in my interests and that soon led to an opportunity at r3 which was well it is a fin tech firm that had just established a massive consortium of banks in order to use their blockchain solution so I worked there is the senior strategy associate for guess nine months and I had a great time there but it just became pretty obvious that the opportunity to work on tezo's was too good to pass up so with great regret I left I guess in September 2016 and Arthur in the meantime worked in finance for about ten years as a market maker an options market maker at Morgan Stanley most recently and then he also made a pretty big pivot in his career and he worked at way mo in the self-driving car group at Google at a Google X rather for about a year and a half prior to joining tasers full time the TSI CEO which occurred about a year ago was at the time the largest in history raising 232 million dollars berto the reason for that was that Jesus did not cap the funds it raised why did you guys choose to do an uncapped sale well that decision actually laid with the foundation but the rationale at the time was that basically this ecosystem this network benefits from rather who's building what's called Metcalfe's law meaning the more users that participate in the network the more robust and and valuable it is and so this was a rare opportunity to bootstrap that type of network and distribute the token amongst people who were very interested in it and so that was kind of the rationale there yeah I agree with you know that philosophy in the sense that as we saw with things like basic attention token we're only 217 addresses or something got got in the sale I feel like it leads to what I call the ticket scalper situation where like if you ever lived in New York and try to get into a hot concert link basically the ticket scalpers what would take all the tickets like in the first second of the sale and then you would be forced to spend a lot of money later and pay them or in California Burning Man yeah and I felt like the same thing what's happening here with these um with these i SEOs so in that sense I do agree that it's sort of like if you uncap it then the speculators cannot the ticket scalpers cannot cannot make a killing for doing nothing but scamming people anyway so the other thing is that why did you guys do the sale before you launched the network I remember you know shortly like around maybe the spring of 2017 I asked you if you felt that you ran any regulatory risk by having the sale before the launch and you said you felt comfortable with the timing because the launch was gonna happen within five months of the sale obviously that didn't happen so would you do things differently now if you could do them over again I think by and large now there's some personal choices I would not be justified um that's when were you putting it but I think by and large I really do believe in the nonprofit structure and I really do believe in the way the network was bootstrapped and the number of participants that were included the diversity of participants I think that's ultimately what makes a great community and I think these ecosystems are ultimately at the behest of a great community right like that's what drives this ecosystem and so what came out of this ultimately it was like a great group of people you know people like Ryan Jess person for example participating is a testament to the the virtues of the network and the capabilities and the vision around it so obviously it hasn't been without stress or without any sort of missteps I suppose on behalf of many people but certainly I don't I don't regret the outcome right I think ultimately litigious is a great community it's got a great ecosystem around it I'm really excited about the future and that's largely because you know thirty thousand Walter opened up by tremendously talented and interesting and excitable individuals all of whom brings something to the table and somebody to the ecosystem but in this case where we've seen that the regulator's now do seem to be it may be trending in the direction of making a distinction between guns that are sold before the network is live versus tokens that are sold once the network is live like for instance with the wyoming laws which for listeners who aren't familiar that you can listen to an episode i did uh nun confirmed with caitlyn long who was instrumental in pushing those laws through but that is one distinction that the wyoming laws make and then here with kind of i mean this is very indirect but with director with SDC director Hinman's remarks about if very ether no longer being a security the way he phrased it was you know at leaving aside the manner of sale you know he was kind of implying that at the time of sale perhaps either was a security but now it's not which again makes that distinction between whether the network is live or not like despite you know this new development and the way the regulators are are talking about what determines whether some things is secured you not you still feel that you would have done the sale before the network launched well functionality of the elf net has largely been unchanged since February 2017 it was made public so I think it's a little bit unfair for you to ask me this because quite a bit has happened since the fundraiser and I don't know exactly what could be done today so I'd you know unfortunately like I don't think that I really can't answer that you know I'd like to but it's there's a lot of facts and circumstances that have changed since July 2017 well July 13 7 2017 to be more precise you're the CEO of dynamic ledger Solutions which owns all the intellectual property for Tasers but will eventually sell it to the foundation what is the purpose of having two different entities one corporate and one nonprofit I think it for us like what we kind of saw is the beauty of that was a clean break between the Foundation's responsibilities and DLS his responsibilities and a clear line between like what the founders would get and what would go back into the general ecosystem so basically writing a clean line was kind of the benefit of that ultimately and so the previous head of the foundation was a man named Johan covers and this is sort of the elephant in the room that we have been moving around but you had several disputes with Johan and so I'm going to start kind of describing what appears to have happened here and here I'm summarizing from the wired cover story on TASIS by Gideon Louis Krouse which I will link to in the show notes and I interviewed Gideon for my other podcast and confirmed I'll link it to image the in the show notes so you can listen so immediately after the close of the sale Johan proposed a CEO for the tasers foundation who he also proposed with serve as CEO for his own start-up mana toss he then appears to have proposed a contract for tokens for himself that he told you would be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars but privately expressed to other people was likely worth millions after his suggestion for the part-time CEO for tasers field he tried to get the CEO of mana toes installed as the Taser CFO but didn't disclose that conflict of interest he also directed the other foundation board members to stop talking to you and Arthur and what kind of due diligence did you perform on Johan good question I think that's something that Gideon doesn't go into a tremendous amount in the ward story so it obviously is a very exhaustive piece yeah I mean certainly Arthur encountered Johan and he had positive interactions with him previously but I think what's more Johan was both recommended by many prominent people in the so called crypto Valley we did the standard background checks on him but the man has lived in several different jurisdictions and so they weren't perhaps is exhaustive or thorough in retrospect but certainly that type of diligence was done but what's more like you know the guy was introducing Arthur to pretty much anyone who you know quote-unquote mattered all the movers or shakers in the Grand Valley ecosystem and so I think it stands to reason if you're kind of porting Silicon Valley logic to to general business practice but yeah you know why would someone pick up the food from someone who they didn't quite think was a source why would you know politically connected and very savvy people engaged and actively fraternize with someone who they didn't think was a person of good standing or who character so is a mix of like just general positive attractions also the types of things that Johan had represented himself is doing for example he I think indulged bitten body tosses success and it in fact Laura several people who contributed to this fundraiser are also investors in mana toss none of whom felt the need to contact me about any of this until well after the news and mana tosses bankruptcy came too late for example so I think it was just a general air of he seemed very well respected there is nothing terribly suspicious and his background of what we knew of course and you know the guy also I think misrepresented himself or maybe he represented what he thought was a version of the truth but would she make out with reality I was curious you know you raised all these questions about why it is that different people in Swiss Switzerland's crypto Valley did respond to Yohan's calls and why you know they seemed open to doing business with him why why do you think that is I well in retrospect I have no idea I mean this whole thing has been very confusing on several fronts and some of the stuff just like you know it's not worth trying to figure out what happened because the past is the past but certainly a lot of things look very odd in this strange light of day so meaning at the time it seemed like he was somebody who was a really respected and central player in crypto valley which is where you wanted to set up your TSS foundation and then it turns out now what what is your perception of of him well I think this show is very pg-13 so let's try to keep it that way I mean I don't have very nice things to say which I think if you read the Wired pieces eminently clear and you don't have any theories as to why things was seemed one way on the surface and so different when you began working with him well I think that like certainly the amount so I think there's a few things that happened if I'm going to be a little circumspect about it but I think that part of this was like Johan has never really had a lot of professional success and certainly ma notice was apparently going down the tubes Volta Zeus was gaining a lot of notoriety and popularity in the crypto ecosystem and I think that what might have been a very earnest attempt to be a board member turned into something a bit more opportunistic once a lot of money was pledged to a foundation that he had ignored an amount of control over I think that another part of this is that in general it seems as though there's a lot more emphasis and veneration for being agreeable rather than being confrontational in at least the zoo business culture of which I was you know rather surprised and and rather disheartened to kind of find out firsthand and so I think like the path of least resistance isn't to just castigate someone who is acting in a certain way and that's certainly not the case in New York where I come from and it's really not the case in Silicon Valley so I think there's a cultural element to this we're like there's a path of least resistance to kind of have Johan do whatever Johan wanted to do and then what's more I think that this man who is in middle age and has never really seen a lot of success who I think struggles with relationships to reality you know kind of had an opportunity to sort of reshape his image in in this area that he fairly clearly felt a deep personal commitment to he's credited as being the founder of the Crypt of aliens so I think he was trying to look for a way to recover his ego and find some success and he was being a very opportunistic in trying to change the the tone of the tenor of the tezo's project when given the opportunity and to go back to the due diligence you guys did who did you talk to you and what kinds of questions did you ask because as you mentioned it seems that people later did come out of the woodwork and really tell you what their history was with him and it wasn't very positive so you know what what did you do at that time what did you ask and who did you talk to oh well you know I'd rather not I'd rather not implicate anyone who's still doing business in Zurich like less the foundation I have to work with them but suffice it to say there are a number of different people who are very prominent in the big Bitcoin ecosystem who allow did Johan for his deep pockets but short arms and his business savvy I know several former employees of mana toss who never uttered a negative word about Johan but who later went on the record for example I'm talking about his malfeasance and how he had defrauded many of them and so yeah I was you know I'm just a surprised frankly that that people kind of didn't mention anything at the time but certainly I think we were relatively you know obviously hindsight is 20/20 you know I didn't enjoy my time with Johan at the Foundation's head or Foundation board but you know certainly we did try to understand the character of the guy and really no I never said anything nasty about him beforehand but then and when a lot of the allegations came to light many of the people who contact me contacting me had also disclosed that he had threatened them with lawsuits if they ever uttered a negative word about him so I think there's a fair amount of bullying going on as well and again like this path of least resistance would you just be quiet was certainly aided and abetted by the fact that he's a rather litigious gentleman who seems to relish bullying other people and trying to take litigious action against them if they cross him and just so I'm clear are you saying that the the people that you contacted for the due diligence were then later the same ones who then reveal to you what had actually you know what their true experience had been with him or were they different people so the ones who had given him positive reviews were different from the ones who later told you negative things I would say there are about 40% more people who came out after the fact but there was still a pretty big cohort of people who thought it was great that Johan be the head that has this foundation thought it was a great choice and congratulated me even like nagging such a successful person in the souq ecosystem and then like I don't know I remember in October I got like a phone call from some and who had who had characterized Johannes having deep pockets but short arms and very fiscally responsible who was like yeah no one likes that guy you know it's it's I have no idea what sort of tune changed but I certainly have a Rolodex of people who I knew before and after the Johan debacle and I'm not gonna like name names and throw people under the bus because most of them are just innocent folks who are like either early on in their careers or who are just private investors who got swindled by Johan in their own way through the mono toss debacle which is another crazy story but you know I think everyone just kind of felt like what's the worst this guy and maybe they didn't think it was worth kind of going out on a limb to just warn me about his potential malfeasance but certainly a lot of people came out of the woodwork and contacted me from Yohan's previous circles and you know what was even kind of weirder is I had like a handful of mutual friends at least on Facebook with Johan and so I would reach out to them it's like well you know Johanna we spoke very highly of you and I know your close friends they'd be like wait what are you talking about I met that guy once at a conference five years ago and so I kind of got this picture of like a very lonely and an aggressive person and I have no idea exactly what prompted people to do this but I think just the kind of the order of damage of what he did to myself and my husband is far greater than anything else probably anyone could have imagined frankly and so I don't think that anyone could have ideated that someone whose incentives were so clearly aligned with the project being a success would try to would try to push it by the wayside and basically like stop the projects productivity dead in its tracks when given the opportunity I think it's the combination of a lot of things and I'm trying to be sympathetic to people who didn't speak up before though as someone who's like a bit confrontational my own personal life I did find it a bit appalling hey listeners just a heads up that after recording this episode I asked Johan for a response to the claims about his behavior made in the podcast he invited my questions but did not respond to the three emails that included the questions we're gonna discuss how you broke the dead and what it is that you plan to do with today's us now that you've launched the beta net but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell the listeners about our fabulous sponsors now it's

exchange comm to check terms and eligibility to join the crypto solar revolution start earning solar-powered money today I was speaking with Kathleen Brightman and Ryan Jefferson of tezo's so how were you able to eventually break the deadlock and I think Ryan also might finally jump back in here um you know I so it was around you know I'd started hearing about the dysfunction of the TASIS foundation and I think as well as all of the other community members was just you know really concerned obviously about you know allegations that were going back and forth and and the apparent just inaction of the foundation and really providing a meaningful resources or any resources towards what they were intended towards is you know for the tasers protocol and so starting the first part of December of 2017 I started to get ideas about how to help organize the the TASIS community and really make sure that the the TASIS community's voice was heard in what was happening and so we lost a petition the first part of December and admittedly initially you know as the first signature started to come through I was just hoping come on you know let this be something that we can rally around and let this let us kind of unite our voices to to make sure that we're being heard and it was really neat just to see the strength and the resilience of the community and to ever see everybody from all around the world we ended up with almost 2,000 signatures from over 95 countries and to see that wide just a diversity of community members United around this this theme of hey like we want to make sure our voices are heard and helped service resolve this you know this dysfunction that the foundation it was extremely encouraging and so you know because of my background you know more in as an executive role and I've been on boards before you know I knew that the it was great that as a community we were uniting around this cause and that we signing this petition but also at the end of the day you know for the people that had mattered to have here this they probably wouldn't give a lot of deference or or weight to a group of disparate community members signing you know a petition online but we really needed to represent it in a way particularly to the to the supervisory authority the authority in Switzerland that oversees foundation just so that we could present this in a formal way to the body who helps you know oversee you know foundations in Switzerland so there was a conversation I had with with my wife she's been a saint through all this I've you know I'm married and then I have three small children and so I remember talking to her and just saying you know honey um you really I believe in this project Tasos and to really make sure that everyone's voice is heard I I would like to hire Swiss counsel and I need to start sending them money to be able to to help you know this effort to move forward and so I started paying for competence with counsel to represent that voice of the community to the supervisory authority and really doing it with the perspective of just trying to help find a solution on to the problem and so not adversarial necessarily in nature but just hey let's figure out a way out of this and then after that we started to think as a community you know maybe we should still no resources are flowing and so maybe we should you know start some sort of sort of organization and just all donate ourselves to this and provide resources towards development because the funds aren't flowing from the foundation and then after that you know we started to realize that look I mean we need to solve a problem that's bigger than that you know we need to make sure that there is a safe place for the network to launch if the if the first foundation can't get his act together if the TASIS Foundation and I think what's really incredible about this time period that people don't realize is just the I think the grit and the the determination of Arthur and Kathleen is incredible in all of this I think hats off to the development team who continued to work and and progress towards you know towards the launch of the protocol and work on the code like heads down despite all of the conflict that was happening and the lack of lack of resources so so we wanted to provide a safe place for the network to launch and so we in essence launched what was called the t2 foundation which would be an alternate foundation that the network could launch at if the the first was not able to do so a Swiss foundation and recruited a you know a strong board to represent that that foundation but still the the tenor and the disposition was hey this is really it's not adversarial to the tails foundation it's really not we just care deeply about the technology and we want to help find a resolution to the to the situation and so I think through that process and then just because of maybe kind of the disposition and and I'm a fairly you know calm person I'd like to just kind of logically go through things and I think and just deeply care about the the protocol of the project and so I became this you know trusted intermediary to help - I think find a way out of the of that dysfunctional state ultimately ending in with me you know with Johan givers stepping down from the foundation you know me being made the president of the tasteless foundation and then you know immediately after that or very soon after that we we expanded the board to a seven person board to help ensure that the foundation would never return to that dysfunctional state we had very competent people on that board you know Olaf is on that board we have you know premiere research scientists you know the first a female in Switzerland to receive a master's degree in computer science it is on that board just a global representative board that really you know cares about cares about technology and about Tassos let's rewind to that point where there was still this standoff between the Taser Foundation where when Johan was in charge of it and tasers or or DLS at that time the amount that you guys had fundraised had balloon to I think 400 million and so what was actually happening at that point the foundation was in control of the funds and for that reason you couldn't hire developers to continue developing the network for launch is that what was going on there well the arrangement was that after the fundraiser the foundation would basically pick up were DLS left off and it would fund the last bits of development which included code reviews and audits which are rather capital intensive and so the expectation was that the developer contracts would be sent over to the foundation and the foundation would renew them and carry on with employment of the development team and also contract out for a variety of other different operational rules which had to be covered for launch I mean I think it's pretty well documented that they did absolutely none of that and so the developers who again who are the real heroes in the story like if there's anyone who's just above reproach it's the development team I think the interview that they did with Gideon that like really touched my heart quite a bit was that they just basically came into the office every day as though nothing was awry as though they would ship this by hook or by crook to use a phrase and so they really kept their heads down and they just focused on the project there was no hemming and hawing there was no drama in the office it was only almost eerie because we had all these like pieces written about us that were like talking and spelling doom about the foundation we had like people grading harassing emails two or three myself and trying to extort us and give us death threats but now the dev team just kind of like stayed on point and just kept on doing what they were doing but yeah that was the expectation that the foundation would fund the last bits of development and I guess you know eventually they did do that but certainly that was the beginning of acrimony with the foundation was being remiss in its obligation so you know I think the most successful thing that Johan did in this whole public saga is that he framed this as a personal dispute between Arthur myself and him whereas I think you know there's a bunch of people who have a vested interest in this project and who were given employment contracts own and so forth who were also very deeply hurt by the actions or inactions that he took and so I think it was a more of a miscarriage of justice against the project at large and not necessarily something that was like DLS versus the foundation like in theory we're all you know rowing in the same boat swimming in the same direction and so there's no reason for there to be a personal acrimony over one party's failings to do their their very basic tasks and then just to understand how t2 played a role and finally moving things forward t2 didn't have money is that correct so how did that how were you planning to use t2 to launch the network right would you like to take that sure you know t2 did not have any money except for the money that that you know that I paid you know for legal fees and different things so I think just providing a safe place for the network was the most important thing for us I mean ultimately yes there were significant runs our funds raised during the donation period but what we care about mostly is to see you know the Taser project to succeed and and to go live and to and to make it and yes the the funds help to promote the Tassos protocol and it's going to help the ecosystem and there's a lot of uses for it but we were going to find a way some way to make it work it was reported earlier this year that the SEC had sent subpoenas to dozens of ICO issuers and other providers to tasers receive a subpoena from the SEC we don't comment on any regulator any regulatory matters okay so you can't say anything at all about whether or not you have received a subpoena there was an article that came out in fall 2017 that said that you guys had not as far as legal and regulatory matters a weed we don't comment on that so I wouldn't take it as one way or another that we don't comment okay and just to go back to the amount of money that you personally put in wasn't it fifty thousand you yes okay so just out of curiosity you know we have a lot of these ICO projects that are turning to the Swiss foundation structure what lessons do you feel like you've learned about using that structure for icos and for managing decentralized crypto you know I think generally I've certainly had a great experience as I've moved to Switzerland the the ecosystem the Swiss in general have been extremely gracious and kind to me and and my family and our children I represented after I became president of the Tassos foundation immediately that I would move my family to Zook and so my wife and kids we we now lived there we've lived there since the first part of April but really wanted to to represent that number one the tasteless foundation you know things have changed we are moving forward and and also secondarily that that we want to be the model for how this type of project for how this type of foundation structure should work moving forward and so as I mentioned before we quickly expanded the board and I've had a great experience in Switzerland I think that you know in general you know learnings there's probably you know several key points that can be takeaways as far as is you know moving forward as far as this kind of structure but hindsight is always 20/20 right but but I think that at a large you know board a strong board I think that a clear strategy and focus on what matters you know generally as the the foundation were not about the hype we're about the focus is on on delivering technology and you know cutting-edge technology that can change the world I think secondarily you know really staying true to that ethos and that mission of decentralization we are really focused on that that you know the taste foundation is part of a of a larger community the Tassos community made up of scientists of researchers of developers enthusiasts act and we're all part of this this community together now the foundation does have a somewhat unique role obviously it has significant resources resources that has been it's been given and our our job and mission as I see it is to be wise stewards over those resources and really use them effectively through grant making you know processes and other similar means to help you know the community to enable them to build the you know the tastes ecosystem in the tazers community and to have a thrive go blue so I think that a combination of those things I think that staying true to those roots of decentralization staying true to some basic kind of you know governance rules as far as size of boards and whatnot and then you know having people involved that deeply care about the technology that combination is a combination I think that the sets us up for success let's talk about you know what you were mentioning before about how you're putting all these resources in to make sure Tazo succeeds etherium has the lead in the smart contract platform space now us launched June 1st you guys launched your baton at June 30th we've got Definity Kadena hash Graf polka dot re Elgar and all these others that are sort of kind of in a similar space in the blockchain slash crypto world and they're all either gonna launch soon or are in the works what's your plan for success with so much competition sure I think generally it's a few things so so one of them I think is is deploying there are the resources for their intended purpose in a meaningful manner so we just announced a grant program where we're going to be expending you know significant resources towards research institutions local community groups of the Tasos community people who are building tools and applications to work with Tasos a significant grant making process to allow the entire community to come forward and to be a part of building the future of Tazo so I think you know expending a resources is going to be a significant part of that we've already announced you know partnerships with premier research institutions and different kind of tooling and in in software helps that will help people interact with with the tastes Network I think the second part of this is an interesting one that I've been thinking a lot about lately so you know one a part of it is obviously this you know expending resources and being a wise steward I think the second part is is this is that you know I think when all is said and done as we move you know go forward two years and kind of look back generally I think it's not just about the Genesis block and I say that broadly meaning technology but it's also about the Genesis story and about the network and about the community that's created in a lot of people look at the dysfunction of the foundation and you'll see a lot of headlines about hey here's went wrong you know this and that and in the media likes to gravitate towards you know headline right you know some something negative but really I choose to see it and I believe it's going to be the opposite you know in any successful you know whether it's in someone's personal life whether it's an entity or even a society people you know reach these points of adversity and sometimes severe adversity and sometimes people shrink they step back they decide to quit they give up but those who are successful push through the adversity and push through that brick wall and come out the other side and they're tremendously successful and they're successful not in spite of what happened to them but really because of it so when we look at the core dev team when I look at you know the the effort that Arthur and Kathleen have made when I look at the community I mean in what world does a a normal community member you know become the president of a foundation that it depending on the time you know has nearly a billion dollars worth of assets but this is like the strength and the caliber of the people that we have involved in the ecosystem in the Tasos community and I think that people haven't quite realized that that yet but it'll become increasingly apparent that this is a tremendously galvanized group it's it's a group that's gone through adversity and and we've come out the other side and so I see that as a tremendous source of strength that through the status Jori I don't know if that's something this replicable you know easily yeah well I think it remains to see how well you'll come out the other side I don't know if this story is completely over on that but it's it's not but but we've and there's a lot long and I should I should phrase this correctly you know there's a long way to go and there's obviously a lot to be done but I think having overcome the adversity that we have and and having you know launched the beta net and the direction that we're going isn't extremely positive well it's about some of the challenges because so tasers is written in these languages Oh camel and Mickelson which are not very well known and it has it has an interesting feature I don't remember if we spoke about it much yet but you know here it is a lot of these walking platforms and smart contract platforms are dealing with or creating financial systems and as we saw with the Dow hack where 15 million dollars was pilfered from a one hundred and fifteen million dollar venture fund that was a smart contract but the reason was pilfered was because they caught the code allowed somebody to do that you know we have seen kind of a need for something called formal verification which is what Tasos has but you know I don't know if that many developers care about that you know if theorem doesn't have it and so you know how are you this is like a high friction choice for a developer to try to to build on Tasos how do you plan to persuade developers to build on to its formal verification just to clarify Laura formal verification is in a feature that something hazard doesn't have it's an operation that can be performed on the code base in order to prove certain things about its behavior and so it's it's kind of like you could formally verify a ham sandwich right like it's an operation that you do on something and the feasibility of like of doing so is kind of contingent and how things are written and what it strives to do and what you're testing for right so there's only a certain limitation or certain scope it's not a silver bullet it's not it's not an end-all be-all but principally you know if I if I do have one thing to clarify from this framework it's that it's not a feature it's something that can be performed more easily Tasos and you know to pick up on your previous question I think this ties together Tessa's was built with formal verification in mind and so formally verifying certain smart contracts and tezo's is mean much easier because the code was constructed with those operations in mind but I think if I'm going to just praise the team and the people who've been attractive the project so far I think that's kind of Casas key differentiator these are really really exceptionally talented folks in the oume Campbell community who've kind of come together rallied around tezo's the person who invented the language is part of the team that did the code review on it for example and so you have like extraordinary high-caliber folks many of whom often deal with things like very large financial contracts and the hedge fund industry for example or the aerospace industry or nuclear engineering zone and so forth and so there's a lot of academic discipline and rigor that's been imbued in the in the code Basin and the team and I think that's acted as a magnet and filter effect on the people who have been attracted to tezo's and I'm extraordinarily proud to the people whose resumes kind of come through to the foundation because they're all extraordinarily talented people and so I think that's been a very good differentiator I also think that the team had a lot of foresight and a lot of discipline when they were building the out the codebase in the sense that it would have been very easy for Tesla's to have launched with like proof of work for example several years ago just for the sake of getting it out but the team has so many like high internal standards that I think that would have been sort of an anatomy ax to their tastes and so you know I don't know if tezo's will be locked in in existence in 20 years but one thing that gives me solace and comfort is that the people who've been attracted to era to consistently just sew it extraordinarily rigorous in their thought and they're so proud of their work and they take a tremendous amount of pride in what they do compromise just isn't something that they they really focus on and how do you convince them like the larger subset of developers who probably don't know these languages how do you convince them to come over and build on tezo's well it's funny you should ask that because in 2014 when the Tesla's white paper was published okay what was still relatively obscure in the US for example like I never heard of it and so or I guess I had heard of it but it didn't know how to program in it Haskell's we're popular in the US for example as a formal sorry as a functional programming language but in recent years companies like Facebook I think has also stumbled upon the fact that oh camel is actually a really good language to write languages in it gives you a lot of great properties for free and it's there's a lot of extensive tools around it and so Facebook is using Oh camel to write some sort of AI engine and a proprietary language that they're using internally and so I think a lot of people have picked up on what we thought which is that a blockchain is ultimately a programming language and I know camel is an extremely useful tool for this so I think you know you find some developers who want to work with tezo's who are a little bit shy about Oh camel and switching into something that's not as popular and like for example United States but good can learn languages pretty fast you know I remember when Arthur was working in finance he would have - every time we switched jobs whether it was a bank or a hedge fund he'd have to learn their proprietary language and how they did it on the desk and usually it was a matter of like weeks before he was competing with his desk me it's over who wrote the cleanest code and so I think you know good devs aren't dissuaded by that sort of stuff I do think that because oh camel is a little bit obscure relative to other programming languages it does necessitate better declarative languages that sit on top of Mickelson and compile down to Mickelson so that more more novice developers can have greater use of the platform in a more accessible way but I think those bare bones that really have an eye on formal verification for example will make tezo's a really interesting option for people looking to build smart contracts you mentioned your consensus algorithm briefly well actually you indirectly mentioned consensus algorithms but you guys decided to go with delegated proof of stake which is a system in which you know people can stake tokens but also can delegate their the power of their votes to other holders with some critics say that delegated proof of stake systems are plutocracies government by the wealthy is that how you would describe your system and is that the system you want well I think we talk deeply talk krisi is a kind of a pejorative way of saying it but I think in general we write about the virtues of having skin in the game to make major decisions whether it's in governance or other sorts of sorts of measures and so by necessity I think having these large blocks of Delegates delegated tors provides an interesting option for governance mechanisms particularly because tezo's has what we're trying to call liquid proof mistake meaning you can kind of change your delegates in a dynamic fashion and so you can quickly pick up on malfeasance and the like and make more dynamic choices rather than having hard-coded hard-coded people who have kind of a fix take so that the community has another option or recourse to kind of challenge incumbents not just kind of a fixed or hardwired solution and before we move on can you just also describe what baking is so people know it's it's sort of like mining and Tasos I guess so you know baking is the method by which somebody helps to validate the network so if you're a stakeholder and the network you can participate in a process called baking now that's I think it harkens back to its French roots you know instead of mining or minting or whatever you want to call it it's it's baking on the tastes Network and so it's really encouraging to see the dynamics within the community and all sorts of people getting involved in this baking process and I think the neat part about it as well as just I think aligning everybody so the you know the validators are very much aligned with the people know that that are the token holders and and it's really neat to see that dynamic within within the community and also these different services pop up these where you can you know delegate and you know delegates who who are baking on behalf of other people and that can be done in a very secure way on the Tasos protocol where you basically can can give your rights you know to bake to somebody else to do it for you and maybe somebody else who is a little bit more tech savvy or or you know better able to do that that function but it's really encouraging to see everybody get involved and I think the last calculation I did is I think we can have roughly you know 76,000 theoretically and you know different bakers helping to validate the network based on on the numbers but it's encouraging to see how many different people are getting involved and and want to get involved and to see that ecosystem really take off just to throw out some numbers like there so far there's over 400 people who've registered as delegates in the network and around 98% of people who have activated their tokens and participate in the network have have taken part of the delegation process so it's been like extraordinarily robust and I think Arthur and I would both be surprised at the the sheer numbers of people coming out to participate in this this part of the validation and when you say 98% that includes both delegate errs as well as delegates yeah basically people who've either like assigned the right to delegate to themselves or assigned it to someone else Oh interesting so with baking which you know as we mentioned is valid any transactions is this linked with kyc AML meaning our people identifying themselves no you know the the KYC AML you know program that was something that was done you know it's a one-time operation you know really generally behind that it's something that you know as a board you know we personally are concerned about that you know needless home accumulation and gathering of personal data on the internet and we really value data privacy you know clearly the landscape continues to evolve in the industry and best practices continue to evolve and so it became clear that your current best practices are to do Qi caml and so we made that part of the process before someone can activate their toe you know access their token on the Genesis block you know that's separate from the baking process there's no recti of the record to any Baker's you know or personal information or that sort of thing it was just a one-time process to make sure that we were so in their people's personal data is not connected to any public addresses it's not connected to any bakers or anything like that now the initial process was to say hey if you contribute it to the donation period and and you know do the K by caml for this public address so we can just verify that that address went through ki YC EML but it's not used for anything as far as you know baking or the eco system or anything that's that's that's very very private information okay so um to wrap up just I wanted to take a look at what's gonna happen going forward what will be the first steps to launch you know what is sort of like the foreseeable roadmap I see the ecosystem and developing you know really well right now so you know we started to fund different different tools and solutions around around Tazo so you know through this grant making program so we have a grant out to obsidian systems they're based out of New York and they've been helping with with baking solutions and really helping to make sure that we have solutions that people are able to use maybe people that are more tech savvy but with the ultimate goal to kind of make a baking easily accessible for anybody so it'd be neat you know someday if they you could order a baker in a box for example you could plug it in and it would it would be a technology solution that was very easy for you to you know to bake with you know one neat thing that's happening now is you know the ledger naina Wes traditionally it has been used for you know wallet functionality and and and sending of tokens back and forth in a secure way we now actually see Ledger's being used for baking which is I think a way of using a ledger in Hannah West that's never been used before to my knowledge you know as part of a proof of stake system to you know help validate and network which is really interesting and it's really cool I see other types of solutions you know different wallets and things there that are popping up a lot of tools around the ecosystem and we're just starting to see different groups start to pop up around you know providing solutions for different real world problems I think focus for us the or that I would like to see generally within the tasers community but I think as far as from a grant-making perspective is we really want to connect the you know the technology to real-world applications to the things that are gonna change how we do things and really benefit not only people but institutions you know it can something significantly be done better because of blockchain and what is that and how can we help to support that so we're just in the beginning of this grant making process to help enable that and facilitate that but I envisioned and I look forward to some real-world applications popping up sooner rather than later great where can people learn more about each of you as well as Tasers you know they can go to Tasos comm and look at and at the website there and there's developer resources it'd be great to continue to grow this developer ecosystem there is more information at the as far as the grant making process at Tasos foundation ch so
