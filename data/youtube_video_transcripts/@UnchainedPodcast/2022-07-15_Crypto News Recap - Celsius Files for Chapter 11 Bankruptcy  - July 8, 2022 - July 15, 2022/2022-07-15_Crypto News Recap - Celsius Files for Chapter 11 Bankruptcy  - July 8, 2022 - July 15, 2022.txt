[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap celsius files for chapter 11 bankruptcy reveals 1.2 billion deficit in addition to celsius filing for bankruptcy later on thursday as more news trickled out bloomberg reported that celsius's largest creditor pharaoh's capital aka lantern ventures actually seems to be connected to ftx founder and ceo sam bankman freed pharaoh's capital's chief

bloomberg the trading firm currently has no relationship with lantern ventures similarly celsius revealed that it had a 1.2 billion dollar hole in its balance sheet that includes an estimate that its holdings of the cel token are worth 600 million dollars after the news of the bankruptcy filing the ceo token was down more than 10 percent however some analysts told coindesk they believed that this could be a fresh start for the company and that the token price may rebound as the bankruptcy process goes on celsius mining the btc mining subsidiary of celsius also initiated voluntary chapter 11 protection on wednesday this was not the only entity that joined its parent company seeking bankruptcy protection as six other subsidiaries follow the same path in march celsius mining had submitted a draft registration statement with the u.s sec to become a publicly listed company however these plans will not be fulfilled due to these recent developments the crypto lender also made other news this week the firm has repaid in full its debt to d5 protocols maker compound and ave after doing this celsius reclaimed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of collateral especially in bitcoin ether and steeth the liquid staking derivative of ether on tuesday celsius reclaimed 416 000 teeth from ave worth more than 400 million dollars and the markets are fearing a massive sell-off of that collateral as a consequence the steep discount which is the difference between the price of steeth versus the price of eth widened to four percent inflation hits a 40-year high the u.s consumer price index or cpi reached 9.1 percent in june its highest number in more than 40 years the increase in the prices of gas food and housing were the most significant contributors to this month's cpi the consumer price index measures the overall change in consumer prices over time based on a representative basket of goods and services persistent high inflation is not good for a country especially if it's unintended the fed which is responsible for controlling inflation is now pressured to push further with higher interest rates which is the only tool it has to achieve its goal of price stability there's almost nothing in an economy that can escape this decision from the fed as the interest rate represents the price of money for crypto it would mean that there is less money for investments in new projects less innovation and a potential sell-off to purchase safer assets the fear of a huge increase in the interest rate is already in the market is already pricing in an 85 percent probability of a 100 pips increase or plus one percent in the feds rate in the next meeting which will be on july 27th the last time the fed hiked 100 bips was in 1984 said macroeconomic researcher jim bianco one of the main narratives around btc is that it is supposed to serve as an inflation hedge because of its monetary policy however the inflation rate is at its highest in decades and btc has not been able to serve that purpose market has shown bitcoin should be thought of as a monetary debasement hedge not necessarily a hedge against cpi inflation said will clemente a bitcoin analyst openc lays off 20 of its staff thursday afternoon openc announced it would be laying off 20 of its employees this was communicated internally by open seas ceo devin finzer in the company slack we have entered an unprecedented combination of crypto winter and macroeconomic uncertainty said fencer he added that openc would now be in a position to resist up to five years of a crypto winter open sea volumes are down to about 12 million dollars worth a day whereas this past winter they were above 100 million dollars daily coinbase loses market share to its competitors coinbase the largest crypto exchange in the us and the first to be publicly listed is struggling amid market conditions the crypto exchange continues to lose market share to its global competitors according to research analyst dan dolev coinbase seems to be having troubles both in relative and absolute terms in november 2021 it had a monthly trading volume of seven billion dollars whereas the estimate for july puts it at roughly 1.2 billion dollars a month if we compare the same months coinbase had 5.3 percent of the global trading volume in november and now it only accounts for 2.9 dollar targets coin to be priced at 42 as of today the stock is worth 53 dollars and 42 cents last month coinbase was downgraded by goldman sachs which gave a recommendation to short the company with a price target of 45 vc funding for crypto is down 22 according to a report from the block research venture funding for blockchain related projects suffered a 22 decline in the last quarter going from 12.5 billion to 9.8 billion this was the first time that the sector took a dive in vc funding since the second quarter of 2020. however to put the drawback into context crypto venture funding accounted for 629 million dollars in q2 of 2020. even though this quarter's numbers were down against the previous quarters they are still 15 times higher than only two years ago the reason for this decline is most likely a combination of the macroeconomic environment the possibility of interest rate hikes and recession and the state of the crypto market in general with many companies going bankrupt and laying off employees something worth noting is that vc funding is a lagging indicator this is because there might be a considerable time between when the deals are announced and when they are made public it appears that smaller projects were the ones that suffered the most the deals under 50 million dollars accounted for 50 of the total amount invested during the first quarter and they now account for only 44 voyager token soars amidst short squeeze since tuesday the token of distressed crypto company voyager has experienced a massive spike in its price byg was trading at roughly 15 cents reaching a high of 94 cents which accounts for over a 500 percent increase it is now settled at around 40 cents it appears that a short squeeze was behind this massive appreciation pumping coins of insolvent businesses seems to be becoming a meta ck chung investment analyst at defiance capital told coindesk similar pumps have happened to tara's lunc token and luna's cel token mostly because of a short squeeze cz wanted to help but received harsh criticism on monday binance ceo tang pang zhao tweeted that a potential exploit had been found on uniswap according to the wallet provided by cz hacker was able to steal 7574 eth which are worth nearly 8 million dollars immediately after cece's tweet the uni token fell by as much as 21 however hayden adams ceo and founder of uniswap confirmed that this had nothing to do with the vulnerability of unisop's code this was a phishing attack that resulted in some lp nfts being taken from individuals who approved malicious transactions he said chain link god a crypto influencer said that cz's tweet seems like an incredibly irresponsible thing to tweet considering the fact that it was not an exploit finance was also in the news this week because the platform experienced a massive spike in bitcoin trading volumes after the implementation of the zero fee policy went live last friday this provided the incentives to perform wash trading a market manipulation strategy for that reason cz said binance would exclude btc trading from vip calculations in order to remove all incentives to wash trade and according to reuters binance continued to allow trading in iran despite being banned by the us government to operate in that country time for fun bits elon musk tries to terminate the deal with twitter but he is laughing about it elon musk decided to terminate the deal to purchase twitter for 44 billion dollars in the letter sent by musk's lawyer it said that twitter has not complied with its contractual obligations this refers to musk's contention that twitter allegedly didn't disclose the number of bots that are part of its platform despite musk's intentions it doesn't look like he is going to have it easy the twitter board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and the terms agreed upon with mr musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement said twitter's board chair brett taylor however musk took it quite lightly and posted this meme on twitter which reads they said i couldn't buy twitter then they wouldn't disclose bought info now they want to force me to buy twitter in court now they have to disclose
