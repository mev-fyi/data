[Music] hi everyone welcome to unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto i'm your host laura shin author of the cryptopians i started covering crypto seven years ago and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the june 7th 2022 episode of unchained with the crypto.com app you can buy earn and spend crypto in one place download and get 25 with the code laura link in the description this episode of unchained is brought to you by beefy finance the multi-chain yield optimizer beefy is the easiest way to earn more from your crypto deposit funds into beefy's secure vaults to auto compound yields across 12 blockchains got crypto choose beefy today's topic is soulbound tokens here to discuss are glenn weil founder of the radical exchange foundation and political economist and social technologist at microsoft research special projects and puja all haver strategist at flashbots welcome glenn and puja thanks for good to be with you quick note that i am in europe and do not have the cord that connects my nice mic to my computer so my sound is not great apologies and i also need to know that because i have covid or at least i had it a few days ago i don't know about now i may also cough during the episode i likely will hopefully i will not choke on screen we'll see all right first let's discuss each of your backgrounds and how it is that you came to write this paper with ethereum creator vitalik buterin on soulbound tokens glenn why don't we start with you so i have a background as an economist i was a professor at the university of chicago for a few years and then i ended up at microsoft mostly for personal reasons i was developing a lot of sort of radical ideas about how to reimagine our politics and economy and in 2016 when a lot of the populist waves started to happen in mainstream politics i decided to write a book called radical markets that put those things together uh jointly with eric posner into sort of a vision of addressing some of the big picture problems in the world and i was not all involved in what was then called the blockchain space but you know in fact i was quite skeptical of what little i knew about it but the book ended up not being a particularly great mainstream success but found an audience within the blockchain world and actually you know one part of that all happening was the great uh episode that we all did with santi siri a few years back yeah that was a great episode i will link to it in the show notes for people yeah and vitalik uh and i got to be pretty close through that process we've written several things together and we founded this the radical exchange foundation together he's been the primary financial supporter of the radical exchange foundation and he's on the board and we've just been in conversation about ways to integrate technology with reimagining new political and economic structures since then and in january he wrote a piece about soul bound tokens um and as we might get into there wasn't anything like that was huge technological breakthrough there i could talk about that but it made me see ways there was a much quicker path from the current state of the web through ecosystem towards some of the things we've been imagining and pooja and i started thinking about that and we wrote a paper around that and we you know ran it by vitalik and he was enthusiastic and contributed as well and that that's how this paper came about well i'm actually a lawyer by training and uh my first sort of career was in public policy thinking about uh issues this was around 2003-2007 and then i went to law school during the financial crisis and studied financial markets pretty deeply and then became an entrepreneur stumbled across glenn's book dm'd him on twitter thought this was really interesting i thought a lot of the ideas he proposed was kind of a third way between the left and the right and resolved a lot of interesting issues while raising new issues and through glenn i became introduced to radical exchange and audrey tong who i found to be a total inspiration in her movement in digital democracy in taiwan and so that has been my entry point more from the social political innovation lens and also in crypto as well i've always been interested in the social and political ramifications of crypto so let's just give a really basic definition of today's topic soulbound tokens and also talk about where this concept originates from yeah so soulbound tokens was an idea that vitalik discussed in january and he basically described it as just a non-transferable token a non-transferable nft basically and this has a bunch of different types of antecedents one of which is world of warcraft and the fact that there's lots of items in world of warcraft that are not just like tradable swords or something like that but that are actually attached to a character with like wings um and that was you know vitalik's inspiration there's an enormous community of people who've been working on things related to decentralized identity for years who have been thinking about things that have that basic structure for a long time and we can get into some of the details of that later but this attempt to connect it to all the exciting energy around new forms of social and economic organization within the web 3 community was really what i think the contribution that vitalik's paper made was and that's really what we tried to emphasize in this paper so soulbound tokens is is more of a general allusion to this notion of these non-transferable statements about people that are at least partly public so they can interact with the apps it's not really a full technical specification and the emphasis of the paper at least as we intended it was to be on opening people's eyes to both the near-term and really ambitious longer-term applications that these could enable and sort of painting a socio-technical picture there rather than to focus primarily on the design of a particular standard which as i mentioned there's been a lot of work on for some time and there's continuing suggestions about and happy to happy to discuss that but the intention of the paper is really around illustrating all the things that this can make possible when it interacts with the energy in the web 3 ecosystem and puja do you want to flush out what that vision is yeah so it's a bottom-up it's a vision first of all of bottom-up coordination starting first with individuals nested within their communities and forming broader nested forms of cooperation and so there's a few principles around our ideas one basic one is uh just local control on the idea that those who are closest to prom generally have like the largest stake in its resolution and so we try to do is paint a picture of how starting with like decentralized reputation and communities these you know communities can kind of compose into larger and larger networks of coordination a consensual yet decentralized and pluralistic way and uh yeah i mean we go into a lot we i mean we touch on we go to the far reaches of you know prediction markets and ai but the but ultimately the idea is to ground these technologies in the people that use them and have networks coordinated and owned by the people that use them and the communities that participate them in composable ways maybe glenn you want to take a shot at it differently i think one one other sort of philosophical element i would add is there's a there's a sociologist named george zimmel who was one of the founders of the field but got kind of forgotten in the 50s and he had this idea that there is no such thing as an individual in primitive human society you know early human societies that people are part of a group and that individuation happens as a result of modernity because people become parts of many different social communities your work life is different from your home life is different from your religious life is different from etc etc and as you accumulate all those social relationships sort of the pattern of social relationships becomes unique for each person this was the inspiration for what became social graph theory and you know the idea of social networks and i think that that underlying vision the notion that that network of relationships that the individual actually comes out of the collection of communities that she's a part of and that communities emerge from the you know set of individuals within them but that that underlying network of connections is the fundamental thing it was the inspiration for the internet it was the inspiration for so much of how we live and yet it's never really been expressed in the way that our technologies are you know set up and we're trying to describe a path from the current web 3 ecosystem to something like that that you might think of as sort of like the internet society that was imagined even before the technologies for it were possible yeah i just want to add on that quickly so in the paper we talk a lot about how individuals are differentiated by their communities and vice versa communities are differentiated by their individuals and so there are two ways to look at this so you can look at it as you know some people sort of got caught up in the framing around soul bound tokens you can also call them community bound tokens right because it's the communities in which you participate in right that really define you and that's what glenn was just alluding to yeah actually let's talk about the name because a lot of people i i tweeted on you know twitter um what i should ask you and multiple people asked about the name and i agree you know even just reading through the paper where it says yours your account will be called your soul i like it almost feels like it was purposely written to mimic some you know futuristic dystopian science fiction and i was a little bit like why not just call it an account so um yeah why why is it called stillbound tokens and why are you suggesting the account would be called your soul it's kind of interesting um i think the folks who have kind of come from a more pluralistic background and see themselves with a nested cooperation networks soulbound really resonated with them and i think folks who have a sort of more individualistic atomistic perspective community bound resonates more with them um but uh i i think it was frankly it was just a lot of fun to write the paper and riff off of the metaphor that was like part of it i mean as i was writing it i was having a lot of fun but the the other idea is i i get the salt can sound dystopic but but souls are actually things you're supposed to like be very careful about you know you don't want to just like sell your soul you don't want to like financialize your soul and so the idea was more around okay these are very careful uh your soul is something very careful and precious and uh you know you want to shepherd it carefully not financialize into some sort of like you know dystopian reality but glenn what do you think i mean i think part of the intention frankly was to do something whimsical and deliberately not something that sounds like a technical standard so that people wouldn't think that we were proposing a technical standard that should be called soul bound or souls or whatever we were trying to be more metaphorical and more elusive deliberately like now there's pluses and minuses of that and obviously there's a lot of people who've taken it very very literally and that's unfortunate and you know we i regret that at least but the intention at least from my part was precisely to illustrate and allude to possibilities rather than fully specify technical standards which if you use some much more technical term would have would have sounded that way okay yeah it's funny because i i was definitely going to ask about this but i wasn't going to have it so high up in the conversation but between the fact that it just naturally came up and then like i said noticing on my tweet like how many times that particular point got mentioned i was like you know what this is something people want to know about but you know another thing i think that is kind of like hard to see at this moment when it's this concept that's been thrown out there there's been a lot of examples given we're already seeing there's at least you know one token project that is looking to use this concept i i'm sure it's just at this phase right now where a lot of people are like what kinds of problems exist that this is going to solve so can you talk a little bit about you know what problems it is that you see that you feel that this is a solution um that makes sense for those well can i let me just start with things that are very very near-term and concrete these are not the things that excite me the most but i think it's important that we start with them because otherwise it sounds very abstract and futuristic so first of all there are a lot of organizations that would like to issue nfts promote more or less the same purposes that everyone's issuing nfts basically to allow for some meaningful provenance on some you know object that is in some sense digitally unique or scarce or something like that um but who think speculation is awful and don't want to be throwing stuff out there that's going to be the subject of speculative excess they want them to be purchased by people who are actually going to value them for what they are rather than just seek to resell them and i actually have another design that does a similar thing to that while still allowing for transferability but i think that a non-transferable nft is a very simple and natural way to just address that concern and i think it might unlock many more mainstream organizations getting all the benefits of nfts just to take one small step beyond that if you're an artist who's issuing an nft right now you commit to that being scarce by issuing a press release usually you say there's this is going to be part of a limited edition or whatever it is that you want to say about it an alternative would be that you could issue a soul-bound token to your wallet soul whatever you want to call it that is sort of counter-signed counter-signing or issued by the transferable nfts that you're putting out there and that is a public commitment to effectively not double spend in the sense that you're not going to recreate more than however many you said you would of that object so these are i mean these are very simple things right there's nothing amazing or earth-shattering about any of this but i do think that there are things that are really missing from the ecosystem that uh could easily be solved using this type of an approach and so some examples would be like your driver's license your university degree no i don't let's not go there let's not go there i i mean look i'm not saying that those things couldn't couldn't be included here as well and and but i certainly wouldn't want driver's license to be on chain and we really have to figure out the privacy model before you want that university degree you know a lot of people put that on linkedin anyway right a lot of people lie about it on linkedin yeah and it would be nice i think if people could have more transparency about what's actually true there and this would this would be helpful in that regard but why did you not want to talk about actual examples because i feel like this conversation is a little bit difficult to have when it's so abstract and i feel like it's actually easier to understand through concrete examples so i don't want to talk about driver's licenses because i don't want those to be in a model where our primary idea is that this is public so university degrees i'm reasonably comfortable with i'm more comfortable with things like i just said before which are nfts that are not transferable or social tokens but like what's an example of a need for like why would i need that what would i use it for i'll give you an example lauren so like like let's take so and initially when we wrote the paper we started okay we assumed say take just a small set of tokens which people or memberships affiliations people would be willing to have public about themselves anyway right and so where is there a degree of high publicity um and also a problem of say like monopolistic power science is actually a really great starting point for that scientists are very public about their credentials they're very public about their journals and publications and yet scientists are like a really exploited group of sort of the academic class and in the knowledge production supply chain because right they they submit their journals to excuse me they submit their articles to journals they don't get paid right the journals are major rent extractors same thing with peer reviewers and so you can imagine like a small scientific community right getting together and representing their credentials which they do publicly anyway and their publications public anyway and forking away say like a rent extractive journalistic monopoly like nature or cell or something like that and and recreating that and and say and forking away those monopoly rants and sort of re regenerating them redistributing them back into the scientific networks to produce more scientific knowledge and having scientists paid in peer reviewer space like that's like a very low hanging fruit application i see another really like important application to the crypto space in general is getting a sense of actually how decentralized some of our systems are and and it's really important that we do that because the whole sort of premise and justification for crypto is decentralization right it's what protects it from being regulated by you know any trust and also securities regulation as well and so part of this paper was to help us give us some primitives to start to measure up the decentralization of our systems and justify them and i think we can actually apply the same analysis to traditional finance and have some really interesting conversations about the ways in which web 3 might be you know superior or even leading traditional financial networks that tend to also concentrate power so i think there are a lot of applications but i would say i'm very bullish on like the scientific network and research case another example that's very similar to that that i would give is open source software contributors again extremely public like the whole point is for it to be public open social capital in a public way not saying everything in open source is that way but that's the way that the dominant ethos of the community is soul-bound token type constructs would be very natural for roles that you have within an open source repo like maintainer contributor user etc and those are already public effectively badges that usually github gives out and a decentralized approach to them would allow a bunch of really interesting additional applications and and moreover even though i was not concerned about driver's license i was concerned about that specific example you gave it's not that there aren't a ton of examples that are credential-like that i would be comfortable with anything no one puts their driver's license on their linkedin profile no one puts their driver's license almost no one puts their driver's license on their twitter profile when we talk about things that are public and we're starting from a public perspective and we can talk about privacy that's something we're really interested in but starting from public perspective anything that you don't want to put on linkedin or twitter i would not say belongs in a public setting but there's lots of things that you do put in those contexts and they are pretty centralized right now and i think we get a lot of value out of decentralizing those types of things so choose any example that fits those cases and i'm happy to talk about it on a basic technical level how does a soul-bound token work because obviously you would have to have some mechanism by which you keep people from either transferring the token or um you have to account for situations in which maybe they're switching between wallets how do they you know keep the soulbound token or what if something happens where one of their wallets gets compromised and one of the soulbound tokens was in there so just in general like how how do you um kind of account for these different scenarios so a key to soulbound tokens you can you actually can't have soulbound tokens unless you also have this mechanism we described called community recovery and the idea around community recovery is that you you basically are the uh intersectional vote of your social network and so if you try to sell your wallet with your transferable with your non-transferable tokens you couldn't actually credibly do that because you could always just recover it back from your community so community recovery as a wallet mechanism is very key to sell bond tokens the two really go hand in hand and we talk a little bit about the end of the paper how do you boost strap both of these things and it's a really important area of probably the most important area of research and it's it's the hardest area of research so when folks like dm me and they're super excited about sylvan tokens i'm like okay okay that's great i'm i'm interested in community recovery right now right because the concept really needs that to take off yeah the only slight slightly would just qualify what who just said is that we don't have community recovery yet and these bootstrapping things are going to have to help us get there and so there's going to be things that are going to be sort of proto sold down tokens that will exist prior to community recovery working and i'm open to a variety of those and we discuss a bunch of different paths in the paper but at some level as fuji pointed out those aren't real soul-bound tokens until you have a community recovery mechanism that anchors them yeah and so what are some ideas for structuring the community recovery because i i definitely it's not this was not the first time i had heard somebody talk about these ideas so i feel like they're sort of like percolating out there now so let's say that i'm the person with the soul-bound tokens that you know were like i either lost the keys to my wallet or somebody fish them from me or whatever it is how would this work so a bunch of different ways to think about it i mean you might want to we talk about correlation discounts in the paper so maybe you want to apply some correlation discounts like the mechanism would apply correlation discounts too but before we even get there i think we should describe the basics of what it what it is at all so is that right laura yeah yeah just the basic idea laura is let's start with the idea of social recovery and let's explain that and then let's move to community recovery so the idea of social recovery is that you appoint a set of guardians other wallets and some sort of qualified majority of them let's say three out of five or whatever can always come together and unlock your keys and allow you to regenerate your private key and perhaps even you put some safeguards in there like if you're going to make a really large transaction or if you're going to make a bunch of transactions in rapid succession or something like that you need support from some qualified majority of those guardians let's say right so that is already pretty well established i think it's like generally working fairly well at least relative to other non-custodial approaches within the ecosystem right now the arjun and loopering wallets both have it so that's that's great that's that's a great mechanism and and we think it's something to build on and can you give examples of who the different entities would be or what types of entities they would be well usually in the web three ecosystem so far it's other friends it's just individuals who you have a relationship with and whose address you know so but the community recovery is somewhat different paradigm than that so i mean of course it could be a dao or something you know it could be it can be any wallet so i i don't know the distribution right now of when people use these social recovery mechanisms how often it's a dao or a group or a foundation versus how often it's an individual my understanding is it's usually a set of individuals who have a relationship with what we're hoping to do to go beyond that is to deal with what i see as some of the limitations of the social recovery mechanism number one you need to make sure all the people you're linking to like themselves haven't been compromised that they're still your friends that as your relationships evolve that you evolve that sort of so it's somewhat intensive for the user in a way that sort of only its relevance only becomes clear when you have a compromising event and so there i think there's a significant concern that that isn't really going to do a great job of i mean again it's much better than other purchased non-cassodia and i'm i'm a big fan of it but i don't think it's going to necessarily do the best job keeping up with the evolving nature of people's lives what we propose instead and it's somewhat vague but i think you can get a sense for it is that the soul-bound tokens that you have which denote affiliations relationships you know public elements of employment etc would be a substrate for choosing a set of people who are your guardians in the social recovery in an automated way so let me turn to puja's example of the scientific and just be super super concrete this is this is very very specific but just just to put in imagine that you have a soul-bound token for every paper that you've co-authored and there is a fungible but not transferable equivalent silver and token that's held by every other author of each of those papers and when you want to recover your wallet the system randomly chooses five papers that you've authored and asks you to get at least one co-author of each of those papers or maybe three of those papers whatever like some there's some bunch of floating parameters here but some parameters that you have to get those people to come and recover your wallet the nice thing about that is that stays up to date as you publish new things as your interests evolve um it's done in an automated way that doesn't require you to constantly you know maintain those things and it's um it can be enriched in a bunch of ways that pooja was getting at so uh i don't know if you want to turn to the correlation discount point yeah so right so like if you imagine sylvan tokens representing your memberships and affiliations what if you want wallet recovery to be secure you don't want for example recovery to happen with like a set of collusive individuals who could like say hijack your wallet right um you want it to be amongst like the maximally like uncorrelated diverse members from you know people from different communities who aren't talking to each other right and who can't like collude to steal your wallet from you right and so svts kind of give you a natural substrate to actually you know calculate sort of correlation discounts or like maximally uncorrelated individuals in real time to you know have wallet recovery and then there's a lot of it's a lot of research i mean it's nothing easy it's i i'm not an expert at this but there's all you know there's recency bias and other kinds of things you need to take into account and it will take a long and i don't know i don't know how long but it's not going to be solved in like the next like three months or something right i mean i i think that the you know you're the ideal version of this laura is one where it automatically generates a set of guardians for you effectively that whose only point of contact is through you like you're sort of the network central node in the set of guardians that are created by the by by the generation and like i'm not saying this will work for everyone but i can give very clear illustration from my life so i used to be an academic as i mentioned i was in the field of economics i have all kinds of friends from the world of economics i would never trust those people to like be the guardians of something for me because they represent one element of my life and like i'm not that tied to the economics community anymore and like i would be worried about a potential of those people like screw with me in some way i also have a bunch of crypto people that i hang out with there's like essentially zero overlap between the crypto people and the econ people and again like i might be worried that those people could get together and like you know there's all kinds of weird stuff that goes on in the crypto world you know what i mean and i wouldn't want those people alone to do it i also have a bunch of collaborators from philosophy and from ecology which i've written in those fields but like those people don't talk to each other at all their point of contact is through me you know and so if you had a system that auto-generated a set of guardians that was drawn from those maximally non-communicating fields that maximally have the property that i'm the central node between them that seems like about as secure of a way as you could come up with to to do my social recovery scheme and not something that you'd want individuals to have to do the calculation of themselves and that's one of the problems with social recovery is that it's sort of relying on them to do that yeah i can actually already picture which groups i would use uh for my um recovery because it just feels like oh these are the natural groups where i'm close to all of them but they don't know each other i'm sure most people could could do that exercise so you know it's not impossible to see how this might someday be applied so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit about things like decentralized society and kind of different ways that these might be used but

about in your white paper soul bound tokens are just a piece of this larger vision you have that you call decentralized society or dsoc what is that and why is that important so as i mentioned earlier there's there's a few principles of dsoc um i would say two key ones one is local control um and that's the idea that uh local communities who have the you know uh greatest stake in our resolution where problems should have control over solving that problem but also this other principle called cooperation or consensus across difference and we we write a lot about that and we provide some mathematical representations of that but the idea basically is that when you want to compose communities into broader cooperating networks to provide broader shared goods you want to draw consensus from the maximally diverse participants and that's a better signal for shared goods than say consensus amongst a group of individuals who might be correlated in some way and might be over coordinated or maybe colluding in some way and so decentralized society is really a picture of how we can get these communities to pluralistically cooperate into very rich social networks of broader coordination and generate broader and broader goods shared goods at different levels in a very dynamic pluralistic way there are a few kind of different applications that you say that you feel soul bound tokens could open up in the crypto world there's one example of a financial one which is under collateralized lending so how would this work with soulbound nfts so the basic idea is that if people want to stake some reputation that they have on something and this can be to get a financial loan or it could be to get in the case of the artists to guarantee that they won't issue something else very similar to this in the future just any time you want to stake non-financial reputation you need some representation of what that reputation is and you need to make some sort of at least semi-public statement that you will repay not issue something again etc in fact you can think of the double spend problem as just a very special case of this double spend is basically like i am giving you this currency and i'm publicly stating that i'm not going to give this currency to anyone else in the future and hold me to it you know you're doing that in a collateralized setting where you just have the currency in your account but there's lots of cases where you there are properties of you that are valuable but that you wouldn't sell all labor is like that right like our labor is valuable but you also don't sell yourself into slavery right so just the idea of work the idea like anything that is not just a purely financial asset relies on this principle of having properties about yourself that have value to others but that you don't offer as transferable collateral in the case that you're not able to deliver on that but you're just you know you'll accept the reputational hit that you will face as a result of again nothing in this is super creative or new and there's lots of other things that could potentially be used as substrates for this but they have to share this property that there are elements of it that are at least partly public so you're able to make that commitment that if you break it people hold you accountable for it what's powerful about doing it in a decentralized way is that it opens the possibility that you can do this in a community-based way where people are horizontally lending to each other or guaranteeing to each other that they'll pay back if another one doesn't pay back et cetera like the grameen bank does whereas if you do it in a purely top-down way things tend to be based on like sort of a single credit score that is shared across all contexts rather than on those relational aspects yeah i was feeling it's uh that it's more like a i don't know if holistic fico scores the the way but but just something more um contextual i guess um rather than yeah the fico score is like kind of it can only see what it can see and one other thing that i found interesting in your proposal was you talked about how you could use soulbound nfts and daos in a way to help support the diversity of of a dao how could you do that yeah so if you imagine each member of a dao having a set of their own memberships and affiliations right you could if you wanted to say surface minority voices within the dao that might be overshadowed by majoritarian influences you could programmatically right bring these voices to the center of the dao and elevate them if you wanted the dao to represent the members of the dao you could also surface those most intersectional members who kind of best represent right the dao as well so there's a lot of really interesting ways that we can encourage pluralism within taos that we really can't today because we don't have really any visibility beyond just like the wallet right let me give uh an analogy so there are kind of a couple of paradigms that often compete with each other for thinking about things like college admissions so you um one is like meritocracy like the best people should always get in there's some score that you're going to give to everyone and then we're going to get the best another paradigm is like well maybe there should be some amount of randomness to it so that we get something that's representative of the population an alternative that i find very appealing is to say well sure we want something like meritocracy but there's not the merit is contextual it depends on what else is represented and if we want a student body that is maximally diverse and maximally benefiting from the other people who are on campus then actually it's not like a select all the top ones problem it's a combinatorial optimization problem over a collection of people that will together be diverse representative and interact in a positive way and if you want within a web 3 context to solve that type of a problem you need to think about algorithms that can do combinatorial optimizations over a rich set of things that constitute people and not just like how much money does someone or how much tokens does someone have you know which reminds me also that another thing that i found interesting about the paper was that you talked about quadratic funding which you had discussed previously when you came on my show and i've really liked seeing how it's being applied and some of these dao is like get coined out where for people who don't know kevin owaki the founder of get coin dao and maybe he got this phrasing from you he says he likes to think of it as optimizing the preferences of the many and the poor over those of the few and the rich and essentially um if people vote for a grant proposal and they don't have as much money like it's like lower dollar amounts that they're allocating to it but there's many more of these people and then there's another proposal where some whales you know allocate a whole bunch of tokens but really it's just like two or three entities that actually really support that one then the proposal that has many more entities voting for it will get more of the funding but what was interesting is in this paper that you guys wrote recently you talked about kind of the pitfalls of that and said that contract quadratic funding doesn't scale but that you felt that soul-bound nfts could help resolve some of the issues there so can you talk about that sure so um the the problem with just simple quadratic funding is say a highly coordinated group could just swamp a mechanism by say each giving like a dollar right because as you said you reward the participation of the many right over the few so what soul bound tokens do is they give us a social substrate and let us actually look at what are the weak affiliations and strong solidarities right amongst people that lets us discount those groups that may be over coordinating and trying to swamp the mechanism and in that way you get as back to that principle cooperation across difference you get consensus right amongst the most diverse right members and you can elevate that with with correlation discounts and let the mechanism scale glenn it's your mechanism so maybe you have something yeah i mean i think what i would just say is that laura i actually really love the example you gave of like those big entities because even those big entities will tend to have let's go beyond the issue of like a pure civil attack and then just inventing people they're gonna have a bunch of hangers on of various kinds you know like every big entity does right and you don't want the mechanism to just get taken over by like a bunch of hangers on of some centralized entity who just give a tiny amount just because they're hanging on to whatever the momentum is there right you actually want people who are genuinely independent of each other and you want to match those contributions and there's just no way to do that with certainly with like basic quadratic funding not even with some sort of proof of humanity because it treats all people as sort of interchangeable but people aren't interchangeable people are socially situated and the problem that we need to solve is not really the problem of getting selfish people to act in the common good but rather the problem of getting people who are partial to certain communities to work with people who are farther away from them socially and that's what we hope you can get towards with uh this types of structures so you're saying basically that through the soulbound tokens people could say oh okay well community a which has this ring leader has been sort of flooding the system with their support but now we see that even though they have strength in numbers that actually when you look at the diversity of groups that make up this organization that communities b c and d are also not represented in this vote even though the number of you know tokens being allocated to this vote is high or something like that is that kind of what you're getting at exactly and and it comes back to exactly the thing that you said about the different groups in your life that you would appoint for the recovery of your wallet what you want is not oh i need a ton of friends because if all those friends are like crypto bros that you met at the same party that's probably not a really good indication that that's good for you in fact that might be part precisely of like a worst case scenario that they're like a gang of people who kidnapped you and then you know took over your social recovery thing or something like that right whereas if it really is people from completely different parts of your life that's a much stronger signal and you know fundamentally what i again returning to the point before is this is the right set of logics for a truly networked society where the thing that is at its core is not a set of individuals it's not a set of centralized entities it is the fabric of relationships the complex fabric of relationships that connects things and actually allowing systems to represent and compute over that and that's you know to me what decentralized society is all about and so with stolen tokens then also help mitigate against civil attacks which are when you know for instance one entity creates multiple wallets to give this illusion of representing many people or is that not possible because the part of me was like well you could just have ais that are creating these different souls with these different soul-bound tokens but maybe not i don't know maybe it would be hard to to do that well it's a it's an interesting point and it's exactly why we recommend in implementing this to actually start with humans and human actual bona fide human relationships with really rich communication channels because if you did say try to bootstrap the system off of just ai's fabricating relationships right then then it sort of pollutes all uh the signals so it is better to have silibond tokens actually reflecting memberships and if you have a sort of sufficient level of real sociality then you can start to like differentiate between like what are bot wallets and bot relationships because they're they frankly are those relationships that are outside of your social context right and and are just kind of like floating in a network that is very disconnected from yours or even from any any other sort of social being um so it is really important to um start these networks with sociality and not have them overrun by by bots but to answer your question yes it could it could very much help with civil resistance because you know those souls that have more sbts that are say reputable svts can be differentiated from those you know bot souls that have just sort of farmed and accumulated fake sbts oh so it sounds like simple attacks will then be possible with soulbound tokens as well well i mean so some form of simple attack is always going to be possible at some level right but i think this is a very powerful mitigation technique for simple attack so let's take let's imagine that people have their linkedin like the set of things that are in linkedin in in in their wallet in this world just again to make it very concrete so first of all some set of credentials that you can have in linkedin are going to be more recognizable than others to certain people not to others right so it's not a universal thing it's not like they're these are the good ones and these are the bad ones they're going to be daos that are going to be recognized by some people and other people will recognize the harvards and the jp morgans of the world and other people will recognize like different african-american community groups and whatever so it it's deliberately pluralistic and we don't think there's gonna be like one like this is a reputable institution and this is not it'll be contextual but in those contexts there are going to be like and any organization that's trying to validate people maybe some dao or whatever is probably going to have some white listed and maybe some gray listed set of affiliations that like make sense to them and there are going to be ways of differentiating whether something is the same person or not in most contexts so if someone has a rich cv there and there are two different entities coming along that went to different universities during the same years now maybe that could be the same person maybe they went to two universities at the same time but it's not very likely you know what i mean so there's there's usually going to be elements in that in that track record that are going to be very likely to be inconsistent with that being two people and certainly very inconsistent without being more than two people so like even if you could do a little bit of civil attack it's gonna be hard to do a lot and i think in some ways more importantly it also deals with sought what i would call soft sible attacks which is not that you literally get a fake identity but rather that you get someone who's completely uninvolved some complete rando off the street but who just is your friend and you bring them in that's going to be much much harder in this world because you're going to have that substrate of social relationships and affiliations to either identify a sybil or even if you don't identify a symbol show that this person is so correlated with the other person and the things that i recognize them are so connected that like they should basically be lumped together and not treated as separate entities so at the moment optimism which is one of the layer twos on ethereum has begun releasing the tokens that are going to be part of its governance structure and one of the aspects of its governance will be that they will have something called the citizens house which will be used at which is where sold-out tokens will be used they i don't think they've released like too many details but i wondered first of all if you had worked with the team on how they might use them or in general just you know based on what you've seen what your thoughts are on either how they might be used in optimism or just endows generally so i i didn't personally work with optimism i think metallic probably had some influence there in helping them think through it and i haven't looked carefully at their model but i do think it is a first step but what i would like to see more is is more protocols and more dows having soulbound tokens and once you actually have the sort of plurality of representations of your memberships and affiliations and you can really start to do cool things like we're talking about like mitigating civil attacks and having richer forms of pluralistic governance so i think it is a first step but uh i haven't looked at it too carefully to comment on what ways i think it could be improved or or not i don't know if you have thoughts i i i don't think they've released enough details for me to get clarity i've definitely talked to people at optimism over the course of years about this several times but not since the vitalik paper came out so i don't know what influence happened in what way so but i do know that git coin is cutting down a similar route they're using they're strongly thinking about using an interaction between ceramic and the verifiable credential standard to give people various spt like things to represent everything from physical location to to memberships or contributorships to different open source software projects and to start doing these types of analyses and we've been in close touch with them and in fact you're the second podcast that we're doing on this topic this week the first one was with kevin and and we talked quite a bit about the interactions with the githoyne ecosystem on that oh cool i'll have to check that episode out um and it's been on my list forever to have kevin on the show here actually so i will also have to make that happen what do you feel needs to happen next for this concept of soulbound tokens to kind of really take the next step so i'm planning a research agenda around this and i think a research community convening around the different questions community recovery a primary question and a lot of the incentive compatibility issues we raise around privacy and say splitting yourself amongst multiple souls and gaming all this is going to be intersectional research glenn you're doing the same on the academic front maybe you want to talk about that yeah i'm working in a bunch of different ways that will become more public soon to try to create a network of academic researchers to make the study of these types of questions into like a field the same way that ai or cryptography are fields that we can that can actually do experiments with and tackle some of these questions in collaboration with people that are actually out there experimenting with them you know in the wild not just the web 3 community but also what's going on in taiwan there's a lot of interesting stuff there there's things going on in video games so there's actually a variety of contexts for their experiments with these going on and they don't need to be tied to any particular infrastructure whether it be vcs or chains they can be just done on centralized servers as well i mean they're relevant in many contexts i believe even though i think they'll reach a higher potential if they're grounded in a more complete network community foundation but i think all those things can be really useful experiments and i agree with puja that one of the most pressing is these community recovery ones another one that i think is really powerful and important is what i would call socially programmable privacy we we discussed this in the paper it's the idea that we need to move beyond the notion of what's often called minimal disclosure where like you get a credential and you can reveal about it whatever you want to one where social groups can specify disclosure procedures so like we it could be the case that take like github for example or something it might be that i get a credential but i am not allowed to disclose that i'm a contributor without also just disclosing the names of the other contributors because that is you know credit sharing and whatever they're like or you you might want it to be the case that before disclosing something i need to check in with someone right so i actually think what we want because it you know it reveals information about them what we actually want or what i want is not privacy in the individual i can reveal whatever i want or not way but rather that social groups can together co-determine what's revealed to whom and how all right well this has been a really interesting discussion i think we'll sort of have to see how things play out over the next year or so because you know as we mentioned i think people are going to be experimenting a lot with this concept so where can people learn more about each of you and your work i guess twitter i don't know i'm not a i don't really have a a public research page but i work at flashbots and where we're thinking about the problem of mev and i see that as a special case around what glenn just talked about programmable privacy and moving away from if you think about it batch auctions are kind of the sort of collective group data cooperatives that that glenn is referencing so if we can solve this problem with atomistic transactions and in ethereum we actually can solve that in a lot of other more use cases uh that in some sense it's actually probably the hardest on-chain problem to solve from the perspective of programmable privacy so that is what i spend my time doing every anyone's free to reach out to me on twitter always happy to talk about research yeah can you just give your twitter handle at pooja all hover and uh you can follow me on twitter at glenn wild radical exchange website and blog carry a lot of materials i produce and i also have a website glenwild.com and you know ssrns there's a variety of places to interact it might work perfect well thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you laura yes thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about soul bound tokens glenn and fuja check out the show notes for this episode unchained is produced by me laura shin without from anthony yoon matt pilchard mark murdock shashank and clk transcription thanks for listening [Music] you
