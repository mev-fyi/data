today's topic is 2021 taxes for crypto people here to discuss are shihan chandra sakura certified public accountant and head of strategy tax at cointracker and john cardone senior director of washington national tax at rsm us llp welcome sheehan and john good afternoon yeah thanks for having us can you each briefly describe your background and how you came to know this area of crypto taxes shihan why don't we start with you sure um so i've been a cpa uh ever since i started my career got into crypto on 2016 2017 time period uh and then joined coin tracker in the early days um as the head of tax strategy and i started building the software there yeah so that's a little bit above my background and john i have a long history of government service in tax controversy representing the irs in court and then district court and tax court i also served as an executive at the irs and i first got introduced to uh digital assets in cryptocurrency back when the irs was issuing a john doe summons to coinbase and i was supervising the agents that were involved with that i then continued on with some of the irs enforcement programs around digital assets before coming to rsm great all right so let's start our discussion with a quick overview of crypto taxes let's first start with the main taxable events what are those sure i'll i'll go ahead um so cryptocurrencies are treated as property occurred in the irs notice that for 2014-21 so that treatment uh results in your different types of taxable event when you do different different things so let me break down the five different types of events that could lead to a taxable event so number one just cashing out crypto pretty self-explanatory you could have bitcoin you were cashing it out you got to pick up or gain taxes number two is when you trade one cryptocurrency to another so you could be going from ethereum to bitcoin or bitcoin to litecoin you don't necessarily have to realize any cash but the property treatment gives rise to a taxable event uh number three is when you spend cryptocurrencies to buy a good or service you could be buying a subscription or you could be buying a tesla uh that triggers a taxable event and number four is when you earn cryptocurrencies uh there are so many ways that you can earn cryptocurrencies it could be through wages uh interest income uh you know mining income staking income which is somewhat arguable we'll get into that later so whenever you earn cryptocurrency that triggers a taxable event uh and then the last one is when you go through a hard fork and receiving a new type of cryptocurrency or you're getting airdropped a new type of token that triggers a taxable event so so those are the five situations that you need to remember if you go to any of the situations uh you could have a taxable or reportable thing today you need to report on your taxes and john do you want to expound on how those different events are taxed and how people should think about their tax rates sure generally in in some of the events that xi'an described when you cash out or or when you exchange cryptocurrency that's when you exchange property when you you know you could exchange property you sell property you exchange one piece of property for another piece of property which would be barter generally if it's property that you've held that you've acquired and held and sold that would be taxed as a capital gain if it's property that you earn uh like uh income uh or uh uh proceeds then then that's that's taxed as ordinary income uh sheehan also talked about that there's uh some of the some of the some of the questions that are unclear involve certain kinds of coins uh what they call staking is that created are you creating property or are you earning property through your work so uh generally though it's it's it's a capital treatment okay yeah we will definitely discuss staking in more depth later on in this episode um but first let's talk about kind of some of the things that will probably be top of mind for crypto people for this year's tax season and i personally think that this discussion probably will start with nfts so let's um give an overview of how nfts are taxed and we can look at both how their tax for creators as well as buyers sure uh 2021 uh i think it was the year of the nfts uh if anybody asked me what was the hottest topic it wasn't bitcoin it wasn't d5 it was nfts uh and and those people who made money to nfds and also who lost money through nfds are going through the tax filing season right now so it's really important for them to know what needs to be reported and how to get those numbers so speaking of nft taxes there are two ways that you can interact with nfds one as a as a trader you can just flip nfts and make money uh the other way is uh as a creator you can create nfts and put it on marketplaces like opencv so people can buy it and you can enter royalties so let me kind of walk through uh nft trader taxes so nfds are very similar to cryptocurrencies at least in terms of how you know when it comes to tax implications so you have a purchase price you have a sales price uh fancy terms you know cost basis and the sales proceeds uh if you make a profit those uh profits are subject to couple gain taxes similar to any uh other you know cryptocurrency so pretty you know clear that area and obviously if you borrow nft and that nft lost in value and then you're disposing that nfd at a loss you're also eligible to get that kind of capital loss so that's that's how nft taxes work you know at a high level for traders one thing to note is that you know some of these nfts are based on artwork uh like you know both a yacht club and there are so many other projects so those artwork based nfts could be treated as a collectible under the irs tax code and if they're deemed as collectible uh those collectible gains are subject to a higher long-term capital gains are up to 28 percent uh versus the highest capital gain tax rate that subject which is 20 percent that's uh applicable to regular crypto coins and stocks so something to keep in mind uh if you're specifically dealing with art based nfts so yeah in a nutshell that's how you know nft taxes work for uh you know for creators and for creators uh obviously you can uh you know hire some people and you know create like you know i don't know like certain types of images within a certain characteristic it could be you know thousand uh off of certain type of character and you can put it on sale for uh those places like open c and super rare if you're a creator every time you sell those nfts that triggers a taxable event for you uh and the the amount of taxes uh amount of income you need to report is the market value that you receive at the time you're selling that uh nft to somebody and that could also be subject to self-employment taxes which is another you know layer of taxes you need to pay if you're in the business of you know if you're a creator if you're a full-time creator you've got to pay income taxes and also self-employment taxes because that's your trade of business well again so you get income you report income and obviously if you have any business related expenses you get to use those expenses to offset your income in some cases you could also get royalty income you know when that nfd gets traded in the secondary market and that also consists of income to you at the time you receive those royalty rewards so the trick for both creators and the traders is that kind of you know capturing those you know income events and converting those tokens into the market value every time you receive them and and figure out your uh capital gains that you need to pay taxes on which is a very very cumbersome task but uh if you went through the nfd uh that sag in 2021 i don't think it's a saga i think it's going to continue to happen make sure you you you you have uh you know good records so you can uh compile your you know capital gains and capital losses so one issue related to nfts that i wanted to discuss was people are also using them as kind of like way like tickets almost to get into dows or for you know access to chat groups or whatever it might be are those it pretty much taxed the same way as you just outlined or because they have a different usage are they taxed any differently so i think you're talking about uh using your nft to authenticate into some type of platform uh or get access to some type of thing i don't see that creating a taxable event uh i mean obviously you're using an asset that you have to access something you know valuable uh you're not disposing of that asset you know you still own it so it shouldn't create a taxable event oh well and but what if they sell like for f to for friends with benefits yeah if they sell their if yeah i i mean if you i agree with you that you know the initial purchase of the nft and the use to get into an event or uh then then i agree that that wouldn't be a taxable uh event however if you know if the event turns out to be a historic occasion that 10 years later maybe is it has a value in and of itself as a momento of that event or or a separate uh then then it might fall into the collectibility realm where if you just sold it i i'm not you know that that looks more like it's a collectible that something is sold but even then if there's no history it would just be a it would be a sale or exchange of the nft okay and but also for something like friends with benefits where i'm just trying to because a part of me is like wait do they burn those but i don't think they do i think people just buy and sell them i mean if it's something like a uh like a club or membership club then i think those have those have value and and and you sell those you would deduct your bases you would deduct your basis in those but then those could be taxable on a resale okay yeah which is you know because the price of those is definitely fluctuated so people weren't buying and selling them for the same price so okay so it sounds like then they are taxed if anybody's using an nfd as a ticket like in simple example and and you know you're waiting at the out of the stadium and you're buying a ticket for 100 and you know selling it for 200 it is a taxable event uh because you you're profiting from that thing so if you apply the same scenario into nfds and if people are flipping nft tickets or access to some type of event uh technically it's a taxable event just so i understand about the collectible issue it sounds like different nfts would be treated differently depending on the nature of that nft so obviously but you know everybody when they think about nfts goes first to jpegs or art but obviously there's you know things like domain names or you know now music or i mean there's there's just a huge variety so like how would the irs think about what is a collectible or how would you determine it when you go to pay your taxes or your accountant or whoever i would want to see more of a history of a market for a collectible i don't think given that there isn't a lot of guidance on point i'm not really sure that the irs will want to wade into the collectibility of whether something is a collectible so early on in the life of an nft um i'm i'm not to say that that won't change later on or that there won't be more specific guidance out there but i i think at this point that if a taxpayer you know records a reasonable purchase price uh um you know records their basis and recognizes the the income when it if it is sold or traded that i think that they're probably in a pretty sound position uh in the the irs won't start looking at a uh a collectible you know a determination oh so you would actually think that that's kind of a less likely scenario i i do i until i i think really until these they're nfts are older until there's a history of them uh you know almost like artwork you know like a providence that you can see the history of the sales that that that people are doing this is is a as you know as an appreciation or a collectible versus now i i think if the market's just too early they're more like an investment at this at this point in time and then just to go back i wanted to make sure i understood and uh shihan you may have misspoke because you were saying that so even though it seems like the collectible thing isn't an issue for now did you say that even the long-term capital gain on that would be 28 or did you mean short term so just to add to what joan mentioned uh yeah irs has not issued any nfd specific tax guidance uh but there are code sections that define what a collectible is and that code section is very broad uh it says you know any type of artwork or any type of uh i don't know music and et cetera could be true as a collectible so some conservative taxpayers they have started you know creating some of these art based nfts as uh collectible just to be on the safe side but i completely agree with what john mentioned you know iris hasn't said anything uh if you're reporting something uh even if it's not like even if it's not treated as a collectible that would be the better way to go about things coming back to your question laura so if it is deemed as a collectible uh then your long-term capital gain tax rate goes from 20 to 28 if you're a high net worth individual so the the idea is that you know irs came up with this in a collectible you know tax code section in the 90s so the idea is that you know if you you have collectible gains you're considered to be like a super high negative individual so uh i guess it's reasonable to have have them subject to a higher tax rate like eight percent higher tax rate than regular stocks and crypto coins are subject to so that's where that you know the tax rate difficult comes from okay and then for people who have been trading exchanges i know the forms that they uh might have gotten over the years may have changed for this year what forms could people expect to get and how would they then use those forms yeah i mean even this year like you know we we see different types of forms issued by different exchanges and wallets 1099 miscellaneous is a pretty common form that you're going to see if you if you state or earn some type of reward inside any of these exchanges and if your reward income was more than 600 in a given year so you're gonna get that form and that phone typically goes on the schedule one that considered other income another form that we see that that that has caused a lot of confusion is is the form 1099k which reports your grass proceeds every month and it doesn't report your cost basis uh so and as soon as the taxpayer gets is they're like okay these numbers are wrong these numbers are you know highly inflated and they naturally they blame at the exchange but the reality is that the form 1099k doesn't have any place to report the cost basis so the exchanges are doing what they're supposed to do under the 1099k reporting rule then your job is to kind of figure out the cost basis and pay the taxes on your actual net capital gains and all claim like a net loss so something to keep in mind so just because you get a 1099 k doesn't mean that you have to pay taxes on that entire gross amount as soon as you add the cost basis your tax liability is going to go down a lot another form we see today uh in some exchanges they issue form 1099b that has a lot of you know valuable information for the taxpayer it has your purchase date for your coins sold date for your coins purchase price uh and in some cases the cost basis as well if you get a form 1099b that's that's a very friendly form to you if the form is complete and if you if you believe the numbers look right your job is to just put that information from that form to schedule d and the 489.49 of the taxation and if you're using like a diy software um it just it's just an easy way to kind of file your taxes now that said there could be some 1099 b's you're going to be receiving this tax season with missing cost basis uh we can talk about you know why you know some exchanges cannot figure out the cost phases because you know how this space works but if it says in a missing cost basis or zero cost phases you got to find out the cost space if you do not find the cost basis you're going to be paying more taxes on that gross amount because you're not accounting for how much you paid for that coin uh so just to summarize you're going to see 1099 miscellaneous 10 99 case 10 nine nbs and then finally this is not a tax form but some exchange is going to issue like a transaction history reports it's mainly the overseas ones so you can go to the attack center just download like all the transactions you did throughout the year so that's another type of i guess a form that you can expect and then and then finally no forms at all right if you traded in uh metamask there's nothing for you to download so yeah so those are the variations that you can expect this tax season i hope someday that you know that the irs will prescribe a 1099 for digital assets so that it will be a lot easier for taxpayers and and i think uh shin went through the list of forums i think uh when when i was at the irs we recognized that there's imperfections in the way that the forms uh report now that they don't prescribe basis i i think the 1099-k is probably the least accurate of the of the ones year 1099-b if it if you've sold on one exchange will be the most accurate sheehan said that the most important thing for the taxpayer to do is is to do their best to report the income and and their basis as accurately as possible and if it doesn't exactly match up with what's on the form and your 1099k will never show basis that's okay is you know if if you have your downloads if you have your other records to substantiate that because there's not exactly a one-to-one match you know that's okay you can still accurately or or do your best effort to you know to report the liability you know as you mentioned there there's a whole plethora of different forms that people might get and um in some situations they may not even get a form so would you recommend that people and obviously well nothing that we say in the show is advice for any you know particular person but how should people decide which type of accountant to use um if one at all i don't know if you know tax software is is good enough but how should people think about this decision yeah i think um first of all i think you're gonna need some type of tax software tool because this software will help you kind of reconcile all the activity across multiple wallets and exchanges unless you're just using one exchange which is not the case a typical crypto user have two to three exchanges they have transfers in and out uh they have coins purchased at different time periods at different prices it's reconciling this activity manually or even using an accountant is is virtually impossible so so just know that there are tax software that's going to help you kind of reconcile your entire tax profile so you need that and then the the second you can use a diy software like you know turbo tax in conjunction with one of these tax software or you can use like a dedicated and accountant to help you file your taxes um so do not expect your economy no accounting firm to kind of do these reconciliations it's it's it's impossible especially if you're a complicated taxpayer so just know that they're tax software and after you connect everything to your tax software you can either use a diy tool or dedicated crypto uh you know specialized accountant to to file and be comply with your taxes yeah i would say you know especially if you if you have a complicated situation you know the accounting firm is at rsm we're you know able to help out in in in very complicated situations it sometimes it might take a you know an expert to help you reconcile the data you get if especially if if you're trading in multiple exchanges or in multiple protocols all right so obviously the other big hot topic from 2021 that involved crypto taxes was the provision from the infrastructure bill that addressed this issue and it's sort of unclear what the outcome of that was so can you outline what it is that people need to know about what happened there and you know what they should do for this year's taxes and also i guess probably future taxes sure so the infrastructure bill passed and uh it had some uh language that's affecting the the crypto community i think the main one is that the infrastructure bill is mandating cryptocurrency exchanges to issue 1099bs for the 2023 taxier and onwards so i'm sure you guys have seen the form 1099b this is the phone that you get uh if you trade stocks and securities in a brokerage like in a robin hood or tdm madrid so at the end of the year you get this form uh it has your sales price it has your cost basis your job is to just put those numbers into tax return and you're done but in the crypto space it doesn't happen uh so infrastructure bill is trying to change that uh from the taxpayers point of view it's actually actually actually a good thing uh because if you're just using just one centralized exchange starting you know 2024 tax season onwards you're going to get that nice form 1099b and hopefully that has your you know correct sales price and the correct cost basis uh and and your tax compliance going to be super easy uh assuming you're just using just one a cryptocurrency exchange but in most cases that won't be the case due to the nature of this space like for example like let's think about stocks like in in stocks every stock that you need to buy is in just one brokerage like i don't need to go from robinhood to td i'm a trade or i didn't i don't need to transfer anything uh in between brokerages the other thing is that the stocks don't allow you to buy another type of stock using another type of stock for example if i want to buy apple and i have google i cannot exchange my google to apple directly i gotta come into cash and then buy the second stock but in the crypto it's it's a reverse of what i said you know you see a lot of transfers and people have multiple wallets and exchanges because this exchange offers you higher staking reward or this section has this coin and ninety percent uh majority of the crypto transaction we see today they are crypto to crypto trades so when you have these you know complex transfers going in and out and when you see this you know token token transfers and especially between centralized and d5 exchanges it's good that you know these centralized exchanges are required to form 109 nvs but capturing the cost basis is going to be nearly impossible in in many cases uh especially if you're dealing with d5 which does which you know you cannot you know enforce these rules in the d5 environment because these are protocols right there there's no teams or anything like that so in that case you know you're going to see a 1099b but the cost base is going to be either missing or inaccurate the other situation where that the 1099b is going to be incorrect would be uh if you're self-cussing your asset a lot of people are self-casted in their assets uh for privacy and security reasons so imagine you know i would you know i have my bitcoin uh in my ledger wallet i transfer it to say coinbase and i sell it for fifty thousand uh coinbase would issue me a fifty thousand uh you know a sale proceed 1099b but it wouldn't know my cost basis so there are so many areas where that the 1099b regime could fail in the crypto space but uh in my opinion like it's a it's a right it's it's good that the the regulators are thinking about it and especially if you're just doing crypto exchanges in just one exchanges 1099b is going to help uh you know people with tax tax funding obligations but just just don't blindly rely on 1099 b's uh that's my advice i agree with you um i i think the irs will use this opportunity uh in in the infrastructure bill probably take again to issue a different kind of form a 1099 for digital assets that will be a little more specific the infrastructure bill does provide for reporting if if you stay on the major exchanges they will report transfers to the irs so in a lot of ways that will be beneficial to taxpayers they will see that you transferred from one exchange to another and they will have a record of that of the acquisition and the basis uh where there will be gaps is when you move to where there isn't a third party where it's a decentralized as she and said really decentralized exchanges will is where there will be a problem or if you transfer money off of the exchange into a a cold wallet or your own storage then the irs will lose visibility into that the chance of getting misreported proceeds that don't match up to your basis will increase so there are there are limitations i think though that the infrastructure bill will help improve the accuracy of the reporting and what about businesses that transact in crypto are there any particular forms that they might need to file yeah so there's another provision in the infrastructure bill uh code section 6050 i so that's mandating uh businesses who are accepting cryptocurrencies in exchange of ten thousand dollars to file this form called form 8300 essentially like let's say you know i'm going to go to a dealership owner i want to buy a car and instead of giving that person you know fifty thousand dollars i'm just sending uh one bitcoin which is which fifty thousand dollars so now that business is required to file form 300 uh disclosing uh you know my identity uh you know who i got paid from my social security and the reasons for the transaction etc it doesn't involve any taxes it's more about disclosure uh so infrastructure bill uh you know at that that actually that format 300 existed for cash transactions infrastructure bill expanded that into digital assets as well and john yeah i was just because the 8300 uh is is is a that part of the law is driven by the financial uh enforcement uh treasury's financial enforcement center and uh the you know i think the challenge will be for businesses because i know a lot of businesses are worried about the burden of you know filing multiple forms it's not it's not uncommon to receive you know have activity greater than ten thousand dollars so that uh the challenge will be to to get the regulators to try and mimic the regulations to as much as possible to cash and and you know right now if you receive payment in a check that's traceable you you don't you don't file the form so hopefully we will uh kind of reach a reporting a situation where it mimics cash as much as possible and not just every single transaction of greater than ten thousand dollars in virtual currency yeah and i know there was concern that this would affect individuals who made trades of more than ten thousand dollars worth which i think happens pretty often in crypto so you know does it look like individuals will have to report on personal identifying information of their transaction partners to my knowledge laura this formatted 300 is applicable only to our businesses um so you've had to be in a business of doing something and what is a trade of business is a matter of facts and circumstances there's no like a bright line rule or anything like that so i think the confusion came from like you know what about some of these uh staking pool providers and et cetera those could be treated as a rate of business again depending on the facts and circumstances you know how involved there is it really a trade-off business or something else but it doesn't apply to to individual uh participants it's it's for trade or businesses all right so

dot finance and take control of your financial future back to my conversation with shihan and john so um as at the time of this recording there was a very big tax topic that everyone was discussing recently and that was a case involving joshua and jessica jarrett can one of you recap that case and the kind of the recent development i don't know if outcome is quite the right word and then talk about what that means for crypto investors who participate in staking sure uh so jared's uh there are a couple from tennessee they were staking tasers during 2019 and they've received roughly 9 000 worth of you know tasting rewards uh and then they reported that uh staking rewards as income at the time they received it in in their 2019 tax return and then uh you know 2020 they amended the tax return saying that staking rewards should not be taxed at the time of the receipt because taking reward is a newly created property so their argument was that uh you know if you're an author and if you're creating a new book and actually laura you had your you know newly created book recently at the time of this recording it'll be coming out one week later okay great so you didn't you didn't have to pay taxes at the time you're done ordering the book you know you pay taxes when you when you sell your book on amazon or wherever and then you receive the cash that's a valid agreement and if you look at the other areas of taxation like you know imagine that you're you're like a miner that's actually you know mining for gold or mineral or something like that you don't pay taxes at the time you take you you might you know resources out of the ground you pay taxes at the time you sell those you know newly created property uh at the market same thing goes with uh farmers you know you don't you don't pay taxes at the time you see uh your crops coming out of the ground you pay taxes at the time you take the harvest and and go sell it in the market so they had the same argument about um you know staking rewards and then around 20 20 uh 2021 irs said okay it's fine uh you know you're right we're gonna refund you uh that whatever the excess taxes they had to pay because they reported that staking rewards at the time they received it interestingly jared said no i don't want to accept the refund i actually want to know the reason why you are issuing me a refund uh so jared's wanted to have the refund because uh the reason for the for the refund because if if they can get a reason from the irs that can set precedent for like you know others take us as you know the proof of stake has uh become so popular lately so that's where we are today so the the latest you know news in that case was that uh jared's uh declined to accept the refund they're taking this to the court uh so they can figure out the exact reason and that reason is going to be super valuable for other stakers to rely on so that's the case the case is not finalized yet and iris didn't issue any you know staking specific tax guns or anything like that because that's what you see a lot of people are talking about uh but but it's a very interesting development in the in this space yeah i would just say one she and uh i i agree with at one point though that that was part of the problem the irs didn't say you're right jarretts the irs just said here's your money jarrett's now let's just call it a day and move on and uh the jarretts are like well what about next year uh so it'll be interesting to follow to watch um and to see if we can get more specific guidance so john and what's your take on why they didn't provide a reason i i really don't know um i just know that when i was litigating cases i would like something more to rely on than like a q a or question and answer from the irs i i think federal judges uh they look to the regulations they look to the law and and really kind of the strongest point that the irs has out there now is a question uh pertaining to mining that was issued back in 2014 um and i just know that you know if i went into federal court and i and i gave the judge a question and answer from the irs that wasn't a regulation they would not uh you know they would look askance upon that that that i think so i i'm not exactly sure why they didn't give an answer i i but it it it really is reflective i think that the guidance isn't very strong you know leaves a possibility an opening for the taxpayers to take a position that staking income uh is created property and it's not recognized until you actually sell or exchange it just like when you sell your book or when you sell your crops and so you know as we said earlier nothing in this show is tax advice but for all the different people who did earn stinking income this year how would you expect most of them or their accountants to decide how to handle this i see like you know taxpayers you know some taxpayers are conservative so they are still fine reporting income at the time they receive it and then they will recognize income when they later sell it honestly it's a matter of timing uh because let me give an example because when i when i say it's a matter of timing like you know other people wouldn't understand so let's say you received like a tasers reward today which is for two dollars and then you decide to go on the conservative route and you report that two dollars today at the time you received it and then later you're selling it for twenty dollars and when you sell it for twenty dollars you would report eighteen dollars worth of capital gains because you established a cost basis by reporting that two dollars worth of income so that's a conservative round and that's what a lot of people have been doing uh up until this case now in case if you want to be i don't want to say aggressive i want to say non-conservative and you know follow the jared's case you could decide not to report any income at the time you receive that tasers reward in my case so you receive we receive two dollars worth of taxes reward but you decide not to report any income so zero income and a couple of years later you would sell that tasers for twenty dollars in that case you would report twenty dollars worth of capital gains so if you compare the two transactions you would end up recognizing the same amount of income subject to taxes but it's just a matter of time in the conservative one you report a little bit of income today and then you know you defer that other income to later in the non-conservative way you don't pay taxes today whatsoever but it doesn't mean that you're completely immune from taxation you got to pay taxes for the entire month when you let it sell it i don't mean to interrupt you but i would say that when when you sold it if you didn't if you didn't recognize gain upon receipt then then it would be ordinary gain uh it would be ordinary income if your sales were were later on if you treated it as uh created property that makes sense uh so those are the two actors that that i see like a lot of people are taking uh and i've also seen from some of my accounting colleagues that they're getting requests from uh taxpayers uh asking can they amend the return based on you know the case uh you know law because typically you can only admin up to the past three years and and request a refund so you know it's also a timing thing right because if you have been um proof of stake you know earning rewards for a while now that the the small window that you have to you know amend the return and get back the refund is is closing so that's another thing uh the accountants are dealing with i would say talk to your economy and see if it's worth you know amending the return like for example if it costs you know thousand dollars i'm in the return and your refund is going to be uh you know 800 dollars it doesn't make any sense because you're going to be at a net loss position so talk to an accountant amending is a somewhat complex process uh i would not encourage you to do it on your own talk to an accountant you know where the pros and cons and see what's right for you all right so let's also now talk about tokens that get rebased uh and what that means would be tokens where uh the circulating supply of those tokens has changed how should people who own such tokens calculate their taxes i think the right answer is nobody knows and i would love to get jones dots as well iris hasn't issued any you know guidance on this again whenever there's you know gray areas and in the crypto space there's so many gray areas i like to take two positions uh you know conservative question is to to report income at the time you're receiving it income under the irs code uh it's covered by section 61. it's it's a very broad code section so unless something is specifically excluded from that it's typically or it's safe to say that's income i know it's not super tax payer friendly but that's how it is if so if you're going to that you know super conservative i don't want to get into any type of you know even like a remote travel from the irs i will report those you know rebasing tokens at the time you receive it establish the cost basis and when you later sell it you would have a capital gain or capital loss event again it's it's a timing difference and if you want to kind of rely on this in a jared's case because some most of these rebasing tokens are based on you know some type of staking type of mechanism you could decide not to report an income and then you know recognize the full gain when you later sell those rebasing tokens into cash or another type of token so those are the two approaches that i would take i i would agree i think you would you'd definitely want to talk to an accountant especially if the uh based upon the protocol of the case and some of the rebasing tokens the amount the fluctuation the rebasing can occur quite rapidly so i mean i i want to say that the answer can't be you have to do it you know every single time that there is a rebase uh but we don't really know for certain i think you need to talk to an accountant to examine the protocol of these actual token but what uh you know kind of what sheen describes is if there isn't a lack of guidance and if the taxpayer takes a reasonable and consistent position i think then the taxpayer is probably uh in a safe place uh on an auditor or see clearly in a safe place for any kind of accuracy related penalties as long as they are you know if they if they do what's practical what's reasonable and they're consistent you can't take one position on one year and then take an inconsistent position or a different position on another year okay and there were a couple other big events one was that this past year there were a few different groups that received air drops and there are slightly different types of air drops from years past one was for users of ethereum name service and the other was for users of openc how would those airdrops be taxed for the different groups affected by those i actually tweeted about this uh as well but just to kind of keep it at a high level so the way that we're seeing air drops are happening today in my opinion has changed a lot if you compare it to past you know three four years i remember back in 2016 2017 you would set up some type of wallet and the next day you open up your wallet and you you your balance has increased because of an aircraft so it just get credited automatically but 2020 and even 2021 the way that these protocols uh conduct these air drops have changed a lot so typically they announce and then you got to go to a dedicated website and pay some gaso or some type of fee and claim the outro so the question is when is it taxed is it at the time you have the knowledge of the airdrop or is it at the time you actually claim the air drop the answer it depends uh it depends again that the uh the there's no exact rules that have been issued by the irs on the air drops some people believe that the the 2019-2014 remedy ruling issued by the irs address airdrops uh i don't believe so if you if you read the uh the remedy ruling they're talking about an air drop that happens after a hard work so the wording there is a little bit confusing because air drops and hard folks are you know two mutually exclusive things you know uh airdrops don't happen after a hard four coming obviously as you get free coins but that's not an airdrop now that said uh some of the concept that we're mentioning that uh revenue ruling is important for us to kind of form an opinion on you know how these you know new types of air drops should be taxed so just kind of by relying on irs's logic if it's a claimable airdrop it should be tax in my opinion at the time you claim it because when you claim it you gain dominion and control over the asset and that you claim it and you report uh income equivalent to the market price at the time you claim it and and that's a taxable event for you and if you decide not to claim it then you don't have a taxable event and you let it expire um and and that's completely fine too i'm pretty sure there's so many people who didn't claim these things because they had no knowledge and if we keep saying that okay you gotta you know tax airdrop at the time you receive it but what about the people who don't even know about it just doesn't make any sense so i've also seen people claim them but because they're so new because they're there's almost impossible to value that they give a a minimal value at the time of receipt uh recognizing that if they later sell it that that they will wreck you know they have basically they have little or no basis would they actually sell and they will recognize the game so i i think that that's also another uh you know a reasonable position if it's a if it's a brand new coin that many of them just go value-less uh very quickly anyways just assign it a minimal value upon receipt so due to high gas fees this past year there were also a lot of people that were transacting on layer twos uh moving you know money there how are those transactions taxed if at all yeah so if we strictly follow the irs rules again i would love to hear john's opinion here as well you're spending gas fee meaning you're disposing of a property in this case ethereum uh disposing of a property creates a taxable event so um you know so every so each time you get gas feeds you know you're disposing of an ethereum and that if that ethereum has appreciated value that gas fee creates a capital gain and if that ethereum or like you know small portion of ethereum has you know depreciated in value that gas requests a capital loss so that that's how i would approach gas fees i would agree that if you pay your gas fees with a coin that is a disposition of the coin and it can create a gain or a loss the actual the proceeds from that that that transaction though the actual fee itself uh you may be able to capitalize into the acquired coin as a cost of the transaction all right and then uh there was another big phenomenon this year uh it really started um the year prior but i guess we could say um you know earlier it might have been limited to other geographies there are a lot of people playing play to earn games such as axey infinity and for those players how would their earnings or losses be taxed again i would rely on the section 61 of the irs code i encourage everybody to just just google section 61 and see what it says uh section 61 defines you know gross income again it's a very broad code section um anything that you receive is generally treated as income otherwise unless it's otherwise specifically excluded from that code section so if you're playing a game and if you're earning something uh in if you rely on the general you know tax principle that constitutes a taxable income now there's an argument i mean is it newly created properly right if it's newly created properly you can take two positions so generally speaking if you want to be conservative i would report those you know new tokens that you receive uh when you up when you've been win something or when you achieve certain milestones as as income again going with the conservative effort that establishes your cost business and when you later sell it that creates a capital gain uh or you can take that other approach okay these are newly created tokens and i want to kind of rely on this jared's case and i'm not going to report anything at the time i receive it i'm going to pick up that entire income when you later sell it so those are the two ways that that i would approach that that question yeah i think the second point is a variation of the jarrett's argument that one if it's in the game uh the coins earned in the game are created properly and until it actually leaves the game or leaves the protocol uh that it's not taxable okay so i'm because we're kind of running out of time i'm going into lightning round so i'll just ask one of you to discuss each of the next scenarios um when people um have bought or sold virtual land in different virtual realities how are those transactions taxed and john do you want to take this one sure virtual land is uh is not real property virtual land is personal property and it's tax like any other token okay and um for when people wrap tokens such as wrapping bitcoin on ethereum or wrapping ethon solana how would those transactions be taxed shihan uh i hate to give this answer but it depends uh if you're going from uh bitcoin to rap bitcoin it's more likely uh it's very like that it's not a taxable event because an exchange has an occurred in order for for an exchange to happen under the irs you know regulations your tax ownership need to go from view to or to another person uh if i'm giving one bit going to the wrap protocol if i'm receiving rough bitcoin i haven't exchanged anything i'm in the same economic position as i was earlier so in that case that's not a taxable event but there could be other rapping situations that could trigger a taxable event so i'm not gonna go into that because everything is it's different so we gotta talk to economy okay and so for people who use credit cards that give crypto rewards how are those taxed john i think for the most part that they are uh treated as rebates from purchases just like your cash back on your current cards so those aren't considered uh taxable because it's it's really just a a reduction in purchase price that's borne by the uh the card issuer or the vendor but then is that income though because they're like if you receive crypto is it like an you know so so when you receive the crypto it would be a rebate if you then later sell it then it would be a taxable uh a taxable sale and and you would not have had any basis in that coin that you sold oh got it okay in general what problems would you say crypto people face each year when they go to pay their taxes like what are some of the kind of uh trends that you like common pitfalls that you see sheehan yeah i think a lot of people they don't even know where to start i think that that's the common pitfall and um common thing that we see a lot of people are getting different types of tax from the exchanges and some exchanges are not providing any tax forms and people get confused okay what should i rely on type of thing i would say those are the the main things and and and last but not least like just kind of blindly relying on tax forms you should buy the exchanges i wouldn't do that just just make sure they look right to you because by the way don't blame the exchanges and exchanges are doing the best they can if they don't do that they're going to get penalized as well and just know that they're working with limited information that they have because they only have access to what you're doing inside that exchange uh so just uh don't blindly rely on any of the 1099 eyes just make sure you reconcile them and talk to an accountant use a crypto tax software tool to to get to the truth and john what are some ways that people can save on their taxes particularly if they are heavy crypto users i if they're heavy crypto users i would encourage people to use a lot of the available softwares that are out there they enable you to uh right right now crypto since it's specific you can uh specify if you want to sell high basis assets or low basis assets you have a lot of flexibility uh on on when you want to which lots you want to sell when you use the software and some of them even allow you to program in uh i you know i want to sell high this week i want to sell low next week in that in that case that's perfectly fine as long as you don't sell the same lot twice uh so i would encourage people that are heavy users of crypto to use a software program uh to help track basis and what about um wash sales in crypto and other ways of tax loss harvesting what would you recommend there you know i know sheena has written a lot about that there there are no provisions involving wash sales i'm i'm a little concerned with sales that happen instantaneously that the irs might take the position that the sale uh they could ignore the economic substance of that transaction i would prefer to see a little period of time between a buy in a cell you know before you you know you harvest your tax losses because that that it looks more like a realistic you know that they are two independent transactions uh so that is true that there is no wash sale rule but there's also a a danger of the irs ignoring uh the economic substance of your transaction if it happens instantaneously okay so in general i i have done a show on crypto taxes um pretty much every year for the last i think like i'm not sure four or five years i i don't remember how many years but the point is that it's definitely an evolving space so going forward how would you and both of you now can answer this how would you expect that crypto taxes will evolve in the future let me start here i guess uh i i think the uh taxes need to be rethought in a decentralized role i actually tweeted about that laura i think you shared that i think the world is moving from an account based financial system to a wallet-based financial system so in an account based finance system which is the one that we are living today if you want to start your financial journey you would go to a you know robin hoods or coinbase of the world you set up an account using a username and a password and your account is tied to your actual available identity to to this process called kyc know your customers so you have the exchanges you have you and then you have the irs the exchanges or the brokerages they work as a third party information reported to the irs and that's why you get these form 1099 so whenever you get a form 1099 that information has already been reported to the irs by the intermediary the third party in this case the exchange now the tax works in that type of environment because of that third-party information system right because you get triggered to file taxes when you get some type of tax form you know that that's a simple story now that's in an account based system so the tax compliance is very high when you get that tax form because there's a third party to kind of see your transaction report it to the irs which you know uh imposes taxes now we're seeing uh you know more and more protocols and you know founders they're building stuff on web 3 which is based on wallets like take a look at you know platforms like wallets open c like you can sign up for you know open c using a student anonymous wallet and you're interacting directly with with other people uh and then the openc as a protocol kind of facilitate that transaction but they're not a third party uh that who knows who you uh that knows who you are or they don't do any type of kyc because of how the web 3 functions so in that type of environment this whole 10 9 and t slash you know third party information reporting system breaks because you're literally doing transaction peer to peer facilitated by some type of protocol but not an intermediary in that type of environment so we really have to set the right incentives for people to pay taxes you know regulators have to be very very creative when it comes to figuring out even taxable events and and you know not only you know coming up with new regulations but just to make sure that those are enforceable in that type of pseudonymous environment so i would say the next several years you know we're gonna see like you know a lot of people talking about this issue um and and hopefully we can find out a solution uh that's beneficial for everybody and john with your years of experience at the irs do you think that's possible or i think it will take a lot of cooperation or a lot of work with developers in the industry the issue really with the you know wallet-based taxes is not third-party reporting so the answer won't be third-party reporting the answer will be uh you know proper development of protocols to help taxpayers uh they use wallet-based systems to actually report their tax liability oh so okay but right i mean that's the thing i i feel like it's a little bit more like an honor system it is an honor system but i actually that you know if it's a true independent wallet-based system is not maybe pseudo-anonymous uh but i i think eventually there are you know the taxpayers if they might need to leave the system they would they would uh need to convert to fiat i think taxpayers run the risk of assuming just because i'm operating in a uh defy environment in a wallet-based environment that there's no third party reporting that um i don't need to report my gains and losses from that there's you know eventually those assets need to be converted those assets are exchanged eventually there's something that would could trigger a recognition or or or an audit yeah i think the other thing i wonder about is as the industry moves more toward privacy what that is really going to mean because then i think it will be even harder so um but i think that's a bit further down the road we'll see um one other thing i wanted to mention was i happened to notice that the irs posted a job or it might have been like a contractor position and essentially they were looking for someone who could exploit uh develop exploits for crypto wallets for seizure can you talk a little bit more about what you think that might mean and what the irs is looking to do with with this posting i don't know for certain um and but just based upon what i've read publicly in in other instances is that the irs will aggressively seize assets for a taxpayer or a recalculate a recalcitrant taxpayer and that could involve a cold wallet that could involve investigatory techniques so the irs will use will use other means to actually seize property of taxpayers property especially if they believe the taxpayer is attempting to uh move the property out outside of the reach or to to hide it so i think the irs recognizes some of the limitations of third-party reporting and is not going to rely solely on that to uh to enforce the tax laws all right to wrap up is there anything else that you either of you feel that crypto people need to know about paying their taxes this year or uh did we did we managed to cover all the important issues i i think again do you make your best efforts use the information you have um and when when you're stuck can consult someone an accountant um and that you know you'll be well positioned uh should you be audited by the irs all right okay uh and sheehan is there anything else that you wanted to add no i mean lastly just uh i know taxes suck uh unfortunately you know we had to you know report them and pay your fair share of taxes at the same time just know that there are so many legal ways that you can save your tax bills uh like you know taxes harvesting you know getting a loan against money uh and you know you know earning credit card reversal etc uh so just just use the tax code to your advantage uh going forward uh don't think about taxes only at the tax time think about taxes throughout the year uh that's the way to to minimize your taxable okay great where can people learn more about each of you and your work i i'm pretty active on twitter my handle is at the crypto cpa uh you can find me writing on the tracker or io block and and forbes as well and we're at rsmus.com we have an excellent digital asset practice and we're willing you know can help any taxpayers with with their liabilities perfect well thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you thank you
