at missouri welcome jamie and mason hey thanks for having me finally got on here hey laura hey jamie great to be on so jamie let's start with you tell us how you got into crypto and how you came to have nfts as one of your focus areas and what outlier does yeah well i'll give you the abbreviated version because um i've been in space for about seven and a half year well i found it out like seven and a half years ago been been in crypto personally for a little bit longer than that um and the short story is you know seven and a half years ago when we founded outlier ventures we were the first institutional investor in blockchain in europe um but there wasn't really much to invest in from a startup perspective so we were a bit more of a studio because we were getting applied learning we thought well maybe this will help us be a better investor someday understanding the technologies limitations as the space matured we began to believe that a lot more infrastructure had to be built before these wonderful applications would be possible like theoretical applications would be possible so we incubated protocols and like primitives um lower down in stack and as the spaces matured uh our model has moved up the stack uh in the kind of middleware in our application layers as an accelerator so this year we will accelerate 100 web 3 startups 50 d5 50 nft and many of them blurring that in the middle um and that is three times what we accelerated last year so god knows how we're gonna do that um and specific to nfts um obviously have been aware of nfts like everybody in the space for that long for a while kind of lost interest in them with when critter kitties broke ethereum like many other people got distracted by things like defy and then it was really summer of last year um where i came back to the space and was just blown away by what had been happening in what was supposedly an nft kind of winter platforms had been built whole new artists had been onboarded into the space that knew nothing about crypto many of them they were discovering crypto as a consequence of being onboarded into say super air um and became very quickly convinced that nfts would represent a super cycle as we were just kind of saying off-air nfts for the first time make crypto accessible to the masses the concepts the type of assets the behaviors of collecting are going to onboard billions of people that would have never otherwise gone to binance and bought eth right they end up with as a consequence of buying this collectible um so it's a crossover moment for us it's the gateway drug it's the red pill a blue pill red pill i know and i believe this will be a mega cycle that will at least 3x 2017 um long term 20 exit wow that's a really interesting and i do remember last fall i interviewed jake bruckman of coinfund who was saying that um nfts were going to bring in what we would call normies here in the crypto world and i understood it in an abstract way but really now i feel like i'm truly getting what he's saying um so yeah we will see just how big this can go because i agree with you i think it can get quite big so mason what about you how did you get into crypto and come to specialize in nfts yeah definitely i would say a former normie um first got into uh in crypto in 2017 i was doing my mba in hong kong and started working for a local cryptocurrency exchange out there fell in love with uh crypto as i'm sure you both have and subsequently decided that this was a area i wanted to commit a large portion of my career to so came back to states joined consensus bros on their marketing team and then joined massari last year where i specifically work as a research analyst focused on web3 nfts and a couple of those other emerging trends all right so um let's just dive right now into this this nft news so i'm sure most of my audience is aware that in the last few months nfcs have really taken off with the mainstream um we're seeing these non-crypto artists and bands and companies such as the nba taco bell kings of leon grimes banksy etc getting in on the action so mason and jamie how would you guys describe what's been happening in the recent months what would you say have been the major catalysts the major jaw-dropping moments for you and then just kind of zoom out and also give us like the big picture of what's happening in terms of what people are now calling this ownership economy i'm sure i can maybe talk at more high level and then i'm sure my fellow panelists will be able to go into much more detail at kind of the market level right the nuance um if that works for you guys at a macro level um i think you're clearly last year a lot of the attention around nfts was primarily around art as a use case um be it like one-to-ones um or editions and um you know primarily through platforms like super rare um and again offline i was kind of semi-joking not not joking about this distinction of um pre-people before people and after people and of course like when is the after be pulled maybe it's maybe it was yesterday um in the context of um his christie's sale yesterday today i can't remember um uh but of course you'll see it for listeners the day before yeah we recorded and and also for listeners super where um i believe focuses just on visual art in terms of nfts is that right that's right yeah and one-to-ones and stuff like that so um but you know he had a sale on nifty gateway that i think over a weekend the sale equals what super had done the whole year prior to that right so that was a watershed moment and um the reason was effectively people is a is a market in and of himself right he has his back catalogue of every day so he has the supply he has millions of followers so he has the demand and to be honest with you he didn't need nifty gateway if anything uh nifty gateway needed him um and uh but you know they they were able to service that demand without it falling over and so you know big respect to them for managing to make that happen but that was a watershed moment because effectively he was one of the first mainstream artists and i'd even argue you know to an extent he wasn't necessarily as mainstream certainly as he's going to be now prior to that a lot of crypto art had been very introspective very self-referential arguably kind of crypto meme art and speaking from a personal perspective when i began collecting so i started collecting proper summer of last year ended up accidentally creating a discord with 200 of the world's top nft collectors and we ended up accidentally creating a art district in decentraland with 20 galleries and very little coordination but a lot of them were um collecting artwork which was voxelated pixelated like me mart and to be honest you i didn't fully appreciate at the time like that would have value i kind of thought well this is just like the first gen and the place is going to mature more sophisticated artists are coming into the space with a higher aesthetic um and as a consequence all this stuff would be left behind what i didn't fully appreciate at the time which i think now is really evident is um the way to look at nfts i kind of use or evoke the marshall mcluhan quote it's you know the medium is the message right so you don't need to put too much attention on the actual content of the artwork itself cryptopunx is highly voxelated pixelated two-dimensional um but what that represents is um status in the story of nfts and that's why mark cuban will come in and pay a premium to be part of that club and to pay homage to the industry in its journey um so it's almost irrelevant what the art is at the moment what nfts represent is a stake in a native social layer to the internet born out of crypto which is kind of highly oriented towards mimetics and really these things form a kind of social currency and so i've actually stopped paying attention to the aesthetic as much to be honest with you and if you look at my personal collection it has literally degenerated i am a d-gen it's gone from like very you know high-end 3d multimedia to pictures of twerking uh rare pepes you know okay and um just for listeners in case you missed the interview i did with people when he did that fall sale where he made three and a half million dollars in one weekend you know that was the first money he'd ever made from any of his everydays uh and it was you know quite amazing at the time and now you know here uh that the the piece of the first five thousand every days has generated 69 million dollars uh for him and christie so quite remarkable which by the way makes him that's the third um the third the largest sale of a living artist ever i mean that's just mind-blowing sorry i just had to throw that in no i know it is it is mind-blowing for sure so mason what is your take on you know what's been happening in the recent months and also what this means in the bigger picture yeah so i think jamie kind of hit the nail on the head nfts are really in the cultural zeitgeist right now and so that just draws in a lot more people than uh say you're like average d5 project or application i think that there's multiple narratives playing out because if you look at nfts it's just a token standard it's a way to like transmit a file on a blockchain and so it has dozens of applications from gaming to art to financial products like carbon credits and so art has definitely been one of these like watershed moments but i would argue that it's not as retail driven because if you look at like super rare and look at their like users uh they have probably like 100 different artists like 20 200 to like 3 000 collectors and you know so like art it just is in the traditional world is a very wealth begets wealth type of uh sport not to say there's anything wrong with that but it's just it's not as uh you know like consumer retail driven versus something like mba's top shots which uh you know has brought over a well-known intellectual property in the nba to nfts and so that is very retail driven because everyone can connect with that that's something that you know you probably watch a game on a wednesday um versus like talking about art on your average wednesday unless uh unless you're a non-normie like us yeah and um one other i like industry i think that is probably going to have a broader appeal also is music which is why we're seeing you know like kings of leon and and stuff like that already getting into the space um so just out of curiosity you know i think for so many of us like looking at this it's very new the prices are really eye-popping well for for certain things but also even for things like you know like hash masks or whatever so what do you think would you say we're in an nft bubble right now or do these prices and does this activity make sense to you or do you think it's like just the beginning and it's gonna get way way way bigger i i would say that it is the beginning i would argue that we're also in a slight bubble where things are maybe like not being priced or valued uh you know in like the correct way and and part part of that is just like the fever around it collectibles in nature and art are very subjective in value and so like there is no you know utility or theoretical value to it uh over time like whatever remains a collectible will still accrue significant value and so i think uh it's really just a matter of of time time frame yeah and jamie do you have an opinion yeah i mean so uh so we're at the beginning of a mega cycle and um what's interesting about it is it's interplay so the interplay of nft and d5 and that hasn't properly begun yet you've got things like nifty fi where some of these things are now being used as collateral for borrowing and lending and that will increase as there becomes like a blue chip um class of nft but also you know you're seeing people earn nfts in gaming and so for example axes you know i i need that nft to play the game to churn um i need to hold the good cards i can't sell them so increasingly people are going to borrow against them to pay rent or like whatever they want to do in the real world um and so these things begin to collateralize defy um and as a consequence i think nfts will then fuel d5 and so you'll see this financialization of almost every form of creative media and if you think about that in a gaming context think about all the digital wealth that's currently locked in gaming platforms skins wearables you know they are uh constrained limited to um these platforms billions of dollars of value um and with and without the permission of these platforms will increasingly become um financialized uh off that platform and tim sweeney ceo of epic is already talking about the open meta versus well aware of nfts um actually there are many innovations that i'm seeing um being proposed whereby you can create synthetics um off platforms so you can actually trade these things as if um as if as if they're not constrained to particular platforms they'll be workarounds and you imagine when that hits the nft space that hits defy i mean that is a huge mega trend and so one of the interesting things is speaking to nonfungible.com a few weeks back and i was really surprised this has already happened so i i propose the nfts as an asset class as not like an alt asset would decouple from wider crypto at some point and i thought maybe that'll be in a year's time maybe that'd be in 18 months time they argue that it's already happened already happened you know in this quarter so what i mean by that is um the price of nfts are not correlated to the price movements of bitcoin or eth and you could argue even um nfts are now driving the price of eth and so not only are they decoupling but they're becoming the main driver within the wider crypto asset class um and so that is that is i don't know what that means right but it feels substantive it feels different to ico mania and you mentioned audio for example i know several artists some going through our portfolio like major artists that will be doing audio drops i know there's aspirations to have the first platinum nft million sales and nft that might happen in the next quarter so you think of music you think of gaming you know the demand for these nfts is totally uncorrelated to demand a bitcoin and so that's why i think there's a real potential that this this cycle is going to dwarf anything that we've seen with crypto and also because of the nature of this asset because it's thinner liquidity there's kind of less sensitivity to price discovery they might hold value a bit longer um so they might be a little bit more resistant to the kind of the volatility that we see in kind of fungible assets in wider crypto i'm that's above my pay grade to speculate on that but it feels like it could be this time it could be different there'll still be a correction wow okay you just said you just said so many things that i want to unpack but so but i kind of already have a lot of this in my questions so before we get into there into all that there was actually one really basic question that i want to ask you guys just because i want to hear your answer let's say there are some of my listeners who may be less familiar with nfts or they're people who kind of you know like did a search and they found this show i wanted to hear i want to hear you describe what an nft is to somebody who you know doesn't really know crypto who's like a normie sure i think the simplest explanation is that it's a file format for transferring data and information on blockchains so just in the way that we have file formats like jpegs pngs mp3s that just transfer data and information on the internet like that's all an nft does um and so like the fundamental level it's just a way to transfer data okay but then but then it's like well so then what makes it different from a jpeg the fact that you have a issue on a blockchain so it comes with like all the great things that that comes with whether it's whether it's transparency permissionless nature um i think that the concept of ownership is evolving and so like owning an nft and having like this like probable like proof that you own whatever this nft is say it's a piece of art uh is a really powerful concept and then there's also kind of getting into it what jamie alluded to earlier is you have this trend where you can financialize every piece of media or content and if it's an nft you can now like incorporate that into other existing protocols other software applications and that's really powerful when you talk about how uh innovation progresses jamie yeah yeah yeah so to understand what a non-fungible token is you need to understand what is fungible right in your life there are very few things that are fungible in your life like maybe the petrol or the gas you put in your car the electricity is in your house you don't really care like at the atomic unit of like what it is you just need to know it's available and it's it's cheap or like affordable um pretty much everything else in your life is non-fungible and so what that means is it's unique and by being unique there's a degree of scarcity and but also provenance is important and so i always look at this in the context of digitalness right so digitalness especially in the context of media files has brought like huge benefits so you know near to zero distribution ubiquity across device but it basically fundamentally undermined the value of anything that became digital so if it was like an audio file or a movie file it could be copied in neural times it could be shared innumerable times basically if it touched the internet it basically immediately lost value to the point of uh almost becoming free and again if you look at the behavior around digital things we now largely just consume them we don't own them and therefore we don't really value them like owning an audio file doesn't mean like an mp3 or mp4 doesn't mean what it used to it doesn't it doesn't mean the same as owning an lp now the really interesting thing about an nft is that for the first time you can have something that is digital so it benefits from digitalness um but it also has the qualities of um the the the internet broke so i like if you're talking about an audio file you could almost think of it as a digital lp right so lps have held value for a reason some of them have grown in value not just because of the superior audio quality but because i can own it it's tangible it has provenance it has status um i'm discovering it i'm i'm sharing it's a social thing um and so i think there's this it restores all of those qualities back into um music for example so does that mean that you will have to have the nft to stream at the moment no maybe in the future um so you might still stream the audio file on whatever you listen to music on but you still own the blou lp drop right because it gives status and then i kind of extend it one step further which is um it's also beyond the specific program programmability or characteristics of the individual nft um so on the one hand um the creator can program in rules to that particular asset um that extend beyond any one platform right so the price the the number of them the scarcity um the royalties perpetual royalty rights how they're distributed and executed by smart contract not just for me as a single artist but potentially a collaboration of artists on an album for example um but then once that's in the hands of the the owner the collector it becomes a way for me to directly interface with them so you end up with direct to create a communication so i'll give you one example and then i'll shut up because it's quite a long-winded uh way of answering your question but like if i'm blow and i know you own this lp i know you're a superfan now all of a sudden the fact that you have that nft um i can then give certain permissions for people that own that nft it's like a key it's like a vip card so for example i can let you into a concert in decentraland only if you've got that thing in your wallet um i could let you into a physical event scanning you at the gate right because you've got that thing in your wallet so it can be a pass into the metaverse it can be a pass into the physical world i can then drop you other things into that wallet because i know you've got this this vip nft so i think there's these whole layers of engagement that are going to be built in to and around just the initial drop or construct of an nft and so like when you think about it in that context these things are social assets they're like loyalty and rewards um the actual individual functionality of the anft itself is almost irrelevant this is really interesting because to my mind um especially your definition jamie kind of highlights what the benefits are to creators but i'm sure you've come across um and and i share a fair amount of the skepticism as well a lot of people don't really understand what it is that somebody is buying when they're buying an nft because if nfts are digital objects and there are already many copies that exist of that on the internet for instance you know jack dorsey here is selling the first tweet ever which was his tweet and um it's something any of us can go online and see for free and yet right now or at least as of yesterday the current bids on it were two and a half million dollars so um what exactly will that person be getting when they buy that tweet right are they really getting so i mean other than the fact that they have parted with millions of their own dollars you know are they getting anything different from what we are um minus the fact that we don't have to give a million dollars of millions of our dollars for it it's a status right so um again like ignore the content of an individual nft it's like what it represents in the context of a community in the context of a meme um and so you know owning the jack dorsey tweet just like justin justin's son who tried to buy the people one right you know that was trying to buy status in a community that derides him largely um and you know to to bad effect but still what it represents is um it represents that kind of status but i would also say like coming back so it redefines creativity in a digital context but it also redefines ownership in a digital context and belonging and i think like coming back to the thing that the internet broke right there is this definite nostalgia you speak to anybody that's really deep into nfts and they turn into a child they like start talking about i used to have these baseball cards and like they regress and and i think there's this like real this kind of sentimentality this the world that the internet broke right and i think this restores that in some way and not only does it restore it but it kind of puts it on steroids because now you've got a load of grown-ups with disposable income who are basically being kids again i was going to say in in some context it's just owning a piece of culture and that's pretty common throughout i mean history like people by art because it is representative of some cultural movement or some phase in time and like even if you look at like sneakers like michael jordan sneakers are valuable because he is a cultural icon not because they are the best shoe and so uh you know how value evolves is very subjective jamie mentioned earlier digital skins like digital fashion in fortnite there's a multi-billion dollar industry for essentially something that gives you absolutely no utility in the actual game and so what's interesting is there are examples where you have like so rare which is a fantasy soccer league where they have the actual trading cards but it's actually useful in the game and so like there's ways that you can now add value to you know these historical collectibles that people have always wanted and laura i'd build on that right so so at the moment these things are like very nascent so you've largely got a 2d file um or a linked association to a token to to a 2d file in a wallet and like that's not very social it's not very interesting um but increasingly these things are becoming multimedia um they're becoming 3d objects that can be experienced in virtual worlds like decentraland they're as i mentioned becoming like a pass into experiences and socialness and being viewed with more social qualities and i think what will also start to happen is as royalties get baked into these things they become income bearing instruments so by owning them you'll actually derive an income from them potentially you know i think with time certain rights to the underlying ip will be built in so again at the moment like blouse drop for example i forget how much it's sold for but this was to an album he released two years ago it's not even new music right he just minted some old music but to his fans that was like you know that was a great album they loved it they wanted a piece of it they wanted first nft um there's no right to the underlying ip just like with b-paul there's no right to the underlying ip he could reuse that in commercials and adverts and you get nothing from it with time that will change people will start to bake in write to the underlying ip however it's monetized especially in a digital context and we're also seeing there's a lot of criticism at the moment largely by bitcoin maxis to be honest with you that hate ethereum having any success which is right click save well i you you think you own it but i can right click save that and now i've got it but what that misses is that um yes you can right click save you know the the image um but ultimately you know you don't own you don't own the kind of the real value of that thing which is the kind of associated status that comes with it it's easy to kind of poo poo these things as as i think the layers of functionality and and value that will be built into these things over time is going to increase and as i said you can do that retrospectively you don't even need to kind of have that all figured out in the initial mint yeah something that's interesting to me is that i am kind of like personally skeptical of this um maybe because i also kind of i like to think of myself as a minimalist whether i actually am as you know afridibate but um yet despite my skepticism about this like i'm a fan of kings of leon so i haven't done it yet but i i do it's on my to-do list to get the kings of leon nft even at the same time that i'm like why are people buying these when you get you know what i mean so it's so it is funny that my brain is like well you know you don't get all this stuff so like why would you do that and yet the the emotional side of me is like i want to get the kings of land and empty and the kings of leon nft is interesting because it comes with not like they issued a few nfts one of them which comes with like perpetual front row seats and so like there's actually a nominal value on that that someone could theoretically like just do a discounted cash flow on if they wanted to exactly yeah yeah but i think that was very limited and it was like only for a few days where you could enter um i clearly missed that window but um so you know just to stay on this topic and it's funny jamie you mentioned that bitcoin maximalist because i did see whale panda tweeted and i i actually retweeted it i thought was a great tweet he was like what if someone sells an nft of a tweet and then the person who originally tweeted it deletes that tweet the original tweet then what so yeah can you answer that question yeah i mean so obviously there's specific to the tweet right so again the tweet happened even if you delete it it's capturing a moment in time right and that is the the the um the provenance of a meme a mimetic and part of that story but what i'd also say is um again at the moment the idea you know people can reuse an image um they can repurpose it and owning the nft doesn't give you actual control or permissioning of how that thing can be used in you know the general digital world or the metaverse but again that's going to change right so there are a number of different approaches that are being explored i was speaking to some people at nvidia um who are of course like big in gaming um and they were saying well actually look you know as increasingly gaming experience as a stream through the browser nothing actually will happen locally and therefore actually you can control permissioning on the server side so if it's being streamed through a server by having access um by having access to let's say the 3d file um you can it can be streamed into this 2d experience through the browser um but it can only be captured in a 2d sense right so you could just record that streaming happening into the browser but you would never actually have your hands on the 3d the 3d object and so again i think as more things migrate into the browser in the cloud in cloud and away from kind of local localness and local files um you'll be able to actually control you'll only be able to experience a particular nft if you own it or the person that owns it gives you permissions and so i expect in like a metaverse context so for example i have a gallery at the moment in decentraland and i just pull the nfts that i own into frames on a wall in a virtual gallery through openc um now anybody can do that so anybody could clone my gallery pretend they own my artwork unless somebody was really bothered to kind of click the link and actually see well does this person really own it they would never know now that's okay for now but the reality is that fundamentally undermines the value of the thing if that's possible and so i think increasingly there are going to be innovations coming through because there's enough economic incentive to solve it whereby you will only be able to experience this thing in the metaverse if you own it or somebody's giving you permission that's like coming it's inevitable it's not there now but it will be solved it's super super super interesting all right so in a moment we're gonna talk a little bit more about some of the kind of technical and sticky issues around um nfts but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible there's a lot to think about when building a commerce

before we kind of get into some more details around this stuff let's just talk about nba top shot because i think this obviously has been the really big story in nfts um why don't you guys describe what it was that happened there what nba top shot is why you think it's been successful and then i have a question for you about something regarding that yeah so nba tap shot is the uh flagship product of dapper labs and flow in their flow blockchain and so if you look at it they're issuing what they call moments which are essentially nfts that are uh you know they have like a really cool like user experience and so like you open up like a pack and each of those like digital trading cards are exp are like uh pieces of like actual game so like it could be lebron james doing a dunk stephen curry like shooting a three-pointer and the right now they just exist as collectibles but the idea is that they're eventually going to make it into a game and so uh nba top shots hardcore is hopefully going to provide some sort of utility some sort of use for those actual moments they still can have value as collectibles but it'll be really cool once the users can have a better experience so this goes back to the you know question of what are you buying exactly when you buy an nft because i don't know if you saw this there was a user going by the name dfi ted who wrote a long medium post about how he was attempting to withdraw the 45 dollars he had made in um his nba top shot account and even though he had completed the know your customer process you know in which he provides identifying documents that are meant to satisfy into money laundering regulations he wasn't able to and he had like screenshots of his conversation with the ceo of dapper labs rohm kirk gosliw who um not only actually created uh nba topshop but also cryptokitties um and rohan responded saying stuff like oh you know the reason that uh the removal of your funds is being slowed is because this is how we protect against credit card fraud and i wonder what you thought of that response do you think that that was the answer because if so then i mean if he completed the full kyc process all the way back in the fall then why is this a problem now um and so i just wondered you know and also you know like what are the rights that people have when they purchase something from nba top shop yeah i mean i can say obviously i don't know the the ins and outs of that i know rohan generally speaking is a good actor i think at the end of the day uh you know they are a startup scaling and i mean this was just unprecedented demand and so there are some people on that platform with millions of dollars of value and of course they want to cash out but like to move millions of dollars off a platform sometimes in a matter of days you know like weeks or months um and for that to happen with i don't know tens hundreds of people thousands of people that's going to put strain on any startup like even it's just a classic web 2 startup i expect that most of the constraints are not necessarily technical they're more a point of process right so i don't know how you insure um for that kind of money being withdrawn off a platform and especially credit cards you know because of course they if something is is fraudulent they're going to have to underwrite that so they are going to be like a pain in the ass to to to this platform now it's like well what do you mean you want to move a million dollars off a platform for a trading card right even if they've already signed up to so i just think it's i'm i think it's to be expected of course it must be incredibly frustrating to have like all that cash that you you can't move out um i think they'll solve it um but yeah i don't think there's anything worrying about it and maybe to use something that's analogous um if you look at robin hood and what happened with robin hood right you know everybody thought it was this mass conspiracy i know maybe it was but the reality was that they just didn't have enough money right um to to kind of handle that level of trading volume um and and i you know i don't know the nuances of it but like the indemnify in all various things the reserves required and so i wouldn't be surprised if it's just the same situation with with what's happening over there it's nothing nefarious um one thing's for sure i'm sure rohan would love people to be able to be moving millions and dollars on and off the platform because they're probably making fees on it right yeah yeah rohan actually did talk about the scaling issue and i do think there's some echoes of even things from like coinbase's early history um i think pretty much any crypto platform basically needs to ramp up their fraud protection when they um end up scaling and they become popular because it is true that um fraudsters i think descend on new crypto platforms and so if your algorithms aren't very good at detecting that then you know you can get eaten alive um and so speaking of scaling issues the nfts also have kind of like a scaling problem because each item is unique so for instance you know if you sell send either one or a hundred erc 20 tokens it's pretty much the same in gas costs but within nft the data is more linear so if you want to send 100 erc 721s that's like 100 transactions so when it comes to things like games and these other nfts that aim to be cheaper what do you see is the best way for them to scale yeah i mean kind of to give a bra like a broad outlook you've a gaming on ethereum has been like relatively challenging to to say the least and you've seen that to an extent with pretty much any game studio or game they've either built their own for a purpose blockchain so with example like dapper and flow or they're building out their own layer two which is a case of like axe infinity and ronin uh god's unchanged and immutable x and so like it's definitely a hard problem to solve because you if you have like gaming specific these assets should be worth like in the dollars um in most cases and so in order to do that cheaply uh scalability has become like a concern there are like better solutions in terms of not everything has to be an erc721 uh erc1155 which is pioneered by engine is a much better token standard for like gaming assets because you can send a hundred of like a sword or a card that all has like the same kind of like value in the game at once and right now would you say that there are going to be some blockchains that kind of look poised to take advantage of the nft boom and maybe even take some market share from ethereum because you know as for instance we mentioned flow is the blockchain for nba top shot what do you think is going to happen uh to ethereum based on the scaling issue so i mean clearly there are already contenders coming through um as you say flow there's also things happening at layer two and with matic and um of course with polka dot now and power chains there's going to be i i know for sure because we're looking at investing in one um uh you know them set up specifically for nfts or specifically for gaming and these kind of things so um i think that's definitely going to happen uh and but the one kind of watch out is that like circling back to this idea of nfts and d5 like the home of d5 currently is still ethereum and there's a very good argument it's going to be the global settlement layer for maybe ever or certainly for the next decade and so it's all well and good having a solution that allows for better minting transferability of nft's low value nfts high volume but when these things are collateral people want the mass collateral they want to borrow and lend against them that's currently ethereum and so you know you're going to have to create very powerful bridges and i know most are you know most are kind of looking at interoperability they're not looking at outright trying to replace ethereum so i think we're going to see a world of greater um interoperability and i think that's the d5 component and the settlement layer is probably the moat for ethereum to preserve a place in what i would broadly call the metaverse right this kind of open metaverse that's virtual environments gaming digital fashion i think it's going to continue to have a place yeah i think this is a really interesting question because it kind of poses a bunch of other questions like what makes an nft valuable is it the fact that it's issued on like the most permissionless network and so you might want that with something like a 69 million dollar piece of art like you want a pretty censorship resistant blockchain for that but when it comes to gaming and just the the demand for like a higher throughput application like if you want to build anything uh like a fortnight uh and use like a blockchain network like ethereum right now is is not gonna enable that i'd also build that the um so one of the challenges that's happening in the nft space now as platforms all platforms are kind of basically experiencing exponential growth right and they're having scaling issues and and they want to remove friction because most of the users are not crypto people right you know they don't they don't want to have to understand or tolerate all the stuff that we've kind of got used to as as natives um and and so one of the challenges with layer two solutions like workarounds largely to ethereum scaling problems is that you lose a lot of the associated metadata to these things and at the moment that hasn't been a problem or at least it hasn't been perceived as a problem but now these things are going for millions of dollars metadata is increasingly important um for example things like royalties so if something's kind of minted effectively off chain um by a platform and it you don't kind of have the the associated uh metadata which would allow for royalties to happen in pituitary on on any in any environment um then effectively you're relying upon an individual to honor that and we've had several instances where people haven't right it's the collector sold it in open c and they're like well you know so what they keep all that all the all the proceeds so again i think these things will be solved for we've got like a project in our portfolio and ft 42 they're working on something called infinity token and these guys are pretty die hard like die on a hill you know on chain gang and it's all about royalties and as much metadata as possible um and they're they're they're committed to solving that problem more that rather than workarounds and so again i think these things will be solved for um the reality is that these are things probably only relatively sophisticated like d gens care about large mainstream retail don't care about it right now and most platforms quite rightly are just saying well you know why why add friction when people don't care for now right this is like what the the the position that we're at i would just say though the one point i would uh push back a little is that i think that there's going to be like some severe limitations to just on-chain data storage uh particularly on ethereum and so i think there will probably some sort of like necessity for uh robust like off-chain storage whether that's from like a file storage protocol so i think that's like a really unique problem to nfts i do agree that it gets solved over time but definitely uh definitely not trivial well you're seeing with i think are we've is doing quite a lot of integrations now obviously ipfs but are we are doing some really cool things we've got a project called koi which is specifically looking at how um you can kind of have this link between are weave and its permaweb and nfts on ethereum or any other chain yeah and jamie in terms of what you were saying about um how that project i think you were saying it was nft 42 is kind of really focused on the royalties for artists i would imagine that then that would cause a lot of the creators to flock to a platform like that because i think i mean as a creator myself you know with my content that's been stolen in the past um i would prefer to work with a platform like that you know what i mean so i could see how even if right now a lot of the platforms don't care that eventually if they want to get creators to work with them then they will they will have to care about that and so speaking of um i was curious to know because just if i think about all this i just imagine so many industries are going to be disrupted so which industry or industries do you think stand to be most disrupted by nfts and like how do you expect this disruption to play out yeah it's a really interesting question and i i don't know if it's disruption or transformation it's like maybe a bit of both i think music is right for disruption so i think that's most likely i mean kanye west before he kind of disappeared off the map a little bit was talking about creating templated contracts for musicians to emancipate themselves from record labels right he didn't connect the dots uh at least not publicly that you could do that with smart contracts but so this is there's already a ground swell of artists um whether it's taylor swift or whoever that are basically trying to um you know go direct to to consume and of course jay-z with his streaming platform title um so i think music's that's that's already happening there's so much momentum there already um and then i think everything else is probably going to be transformational i think like gaming um as i said like i i know epic uh and unreal tim sweeney is already looking at it um he retweeted something that i did on the open metaverse os which is a thesis that we published only because i hijacked a tweet that he was in and i kind of made sure he saw it um but like you know he he read it at least he pretended to read it and like he got his principles right he knows the direction of travel he knows that they need to open up more and that that would be net beneficial but obviously they're a tanker and they've gotta like turn and you know a triple a game like the quality of content like the high f fidel you know it's a hi-fi experience takes millions of pounds several years like that's very difficult to disrupt when you look at the empty worlds of the open metaverse right decentralize great crystal voxels fun but like it's not a triple a game and so they've got some time to kind of figure it out and it's in their interest to gradually experiment and innovate so i think you've got this spectrum of industries that can afford to have the time that there's a very high barrier to entry from the content side versus industries that are already probably outdated that have somehow managed to kind of cling on to power i think you're going to see that spectrum yeah i'd echo that i would say gaming is going to be pretty deeply impacted by nfts there will be kind of a dichotomy i think between like these permissioned uh ecosystems kind of the walled gardens and the permissionless ones so i'm in particular interested how that evolves and then i would also agree that content is going to be a really interesting one because uh i mean jamie's right it's pretty like outdated and there's this like key problem within almost any type of like content creation where your most valuable piece of content is very much like venture capital it'll outperform you know your other 99 pieces of content but people aren't and creators specifically aren't rewarded for that in an accurate way and so i think kind of shifting that especially whether it's the use of like selling nfts or on-chain royalties like jamie mentioned is pretty powerful because like if you look at what's happening with people like he has had this massive success but he's been able to capitalize it on it on it in real time rather than like okay now he's famous let's go issue some more nfts and now capitalize on the fame yeah if you think of fashion for example right um sorry to just kind of add on that bit um like it's there's no downside for the fashion industry to do this right so you know they're not uh cannibalizing the wearing of physical clothes they're able to produce digital clothes without all the associated costs like one file one 3d file we're talking to a project called um artifact spelt in a funny cool way um and you know they've done a deal with snapchat where you can buy an nft as a wearable you can wear it in your zoom call um and like you know why why why wouldn't the fashion industry be all over that it's you know they can take existing clothing and virtualize it from the same 3d model um uh so and especially in the context of everything that's been going on with covid like where they're looking for new revenue streams you know they've got back catalogues of clothing they don't even need to create new ones they've got like 3d models for clothes they've already created for decades they just need to like make it available as nfts for weird people like me or maybe i don't want to call you guys weird but me to wear in a metaverse um and i'd pay a fortune for it right so no-brainer yeah i did see i i can't remember the name of the platform maybe it was um one of your investments jamie but um it was something like a famous person can kind of like select what their outfits would be and then people can buy their their outfits from the celebrity and wear them and yeah and i was like uh clearly i'm not the audience for this because i'm all about like marie condo and being a minimalist but anyway um so uh one other thing oh yeah actually just mason to go back um one other thing that was so fascinating to me was like you wrote this piece about you know the different business models for content creators and what was interesting is you know we you end of course with the ownership economy but then right before that is this subscription model which i feel like weirdly is only starting to gain traction for content creators so it's just kind of fascinating that this is coming along so quickly and i do feel like it is poised to disrupt it um i don't really have like a question but i just i remember being struck by that thinking like oh it wasn't that long ago that i was reading that sub stack is the new thing um but i was curious to know like you know what do you think that will look like now for me yeah for somebody who is kind of doing more of the subscription type thing yeah i mean i think to iterate reiterate like we are on like the precipice of this this is like the very very like beginning this technology is in its earliest stages and so the subscription era could continue for like another decade quite strongly oh um uh i think that it the like cycles of in which like technology goes through are happening faster so like i'm optimistic that like the subscription phase might not last that long and we can get to better ways for content creators to like make more money but like by the time it becomes like ubiquitous like this is like what everyone is doing um i think it'll take you know at least at least five years yeah and one other thing that i wanted to add was i loved in chris dixon's piece how he talked about how um content creators now will be able to capture more of the value of what it is that their fans are willing to pay and he had this like great line where you know the super fan is willing to pay a much much higher price and now the um you know these nfts enable content creators to set uh or or to have the to capture the value that those um super fans are willing to pay whereas you know before if you were gonna sell a concert ticket or whatever it might be or a t-shirt or you know whatever that it would be the same price for everybody pretty much um and yeah it like i personally actually do get donations from some fans but it's like really really you know not not a ton but i was like oh like maybe in the future i might see more of that and i might get you know more at different levels but anyway um okay so actually uh one other thing i want to be sure to touch on is so we have a ton of different nft platforms and marketplaces are out there now why don't we just talk through some of the biggest ones and then talk about like how they are differentiated in terms of both for the creator side as well as for the buyer side sure i mean happy to give a general landscape um the way i kind of view it is you have a few different layers you have like all these different issuance protocols and so openc is kind of at the top they're an aggregator you can purchase nfts from pretty much any platform and they do a pretty good job at passing royalties down to artists but uh it's not perfect and so like that's definitely like one major issue and kind of a key reason to use some of these platforms right now from the art side you have uh you know half a dozen you have maker's place super rare nifty gateway which is connected to gemini um you have kind of these newer protocols that have recently launched in the past couple months months which is foundation um zora wearable launched last year and has released their token this past like summer and i think that those like there's kind of this dichotomy in between like curation and more like open permissionless protocols is how i see it and what i'm most interested for is how these permissionless protocols allow other companies and and people to kind of like build brands on top of them and integrate them into different use cases because i think that's where we really compound and leverage the power of uh you know blockchain protocols jamie did you want to add anything yeah i was trying not to jump in straight away i get carried away sometimes give it a pause shoot invite me um yeah so you know at the moment there are still only really a handful of platforms that are taking up most of the volume and already with nifty gateway because i know some ridiculously large artists who can't get on right just like a waiting list and um and so naturally some of that is going to spill over into new platforms origin protocol for example um you know some people have using that um i think also some creators want more control over the experience and so um towards the end of last year i was talking about somebody's going to do a shop of five nfts now like there's 20 people claiming they're going to be the shopify nfts our bet is um nft42 create that because they just got the factory smart contracts that allow for um this kind of configuration but like who knows but that will then allow for artists to self-serve and you'll have this kind of long tail and i think this is going to be increasingly important a when there's an over supply in the market so there's definitely going to be an oversupply um and so how does how do that that long tail is going to have to self-serve um as other artists come through or brands like that want to you know have control of their ip if you're a luxury brand you're louis vuitton right you're not going to want to sell that through the retail experience of nifty gateway like you want to control the retail experience just like you control your store so you're going to want it all branded you're going to want to you know look the same feel the same um so they are going to want a branded storefront they're not going to want to just go into a marketplace that has a drop from lindsay lohan as well right so i think you're going to end up with people that want control of the retail experience not just a distribution channel um you've got this long tail serving um and i think also this this because of the oversupply there's going to be a great uh importance on curation and uh and curation is going to increasingly going to have to be done by community um and things like dows and you know you've got innovations happening with like flamingo doubt at the moment like that they're not minting nfts but they are buying them you've got things like b20 which effectively fractionalize the ownership of a people or blue chip people and so you can imagine that um these communities begin to curate and launch artists or creators um to act as a filter on this oversupply that's going to be coming into the market and then they'll capture some residual value by membership um and this is why i think it's interesting you're talking about subscription i like to kind of think about it it's like subscription plus because you kind of got that status component to built in so i think all these things are going to interplay i mean there's just so much supply that's going to be hitting the market it's going to overwork it's like a hose pipe it's going to overwhelm the platforms it's going to overwhelm the collectors and buyers and so you're going to end up with these curation layers you're going to end up with these ux layers um and there's going to be so much opportunity for everybody but what i will say is for sure maybe it's nifty gateway maybe it's somebody else maybe super air as i said like middle of last year there will be in the way that there was like a binance or a coin base for the kind of ico wave um there will be an equivalent uh unicorn that that comes about from um nfts i think you know i i was very envious of how quickly the michael vos twins managed to move on nifty gateway they always seem to have a nose for it and you know they've certainly got a really good chance but at the same time you know if they don't con they're not more controlled and considered like who is their community is it the mcdonald's of uh nfts or is it going to be something like more high-end i think the danger is if they just serve all the demand that comes at them they will dilute a brand and i think increasingly it's going to be like what do you stand for artists are going to select platform based upon a number of variables um that kind of match their ethos or or kind of you know perspective on on life or nfts as well all right um now let's finally turn to the topic that you mentioned earlier this is i think a very juicy one about how nfts can be combined with d5 in a way where nft owners can put their nfts up as collateral and take out loans on that honestly for me i'm a little bit like okay so nfts will probably fluctuate in value and even you know like yesterday um cz did an interview with coindesk where he basically said oh i think eventually all nfts will go to zero and andrew steinwald who's another big nft person who he runs the nft investment from s fermion and publishes an nft newsletter he even said the same thing and so a part of me was like okay so you have this nft maybe once it was worth something like the cryptokitty that you bought for you know like 10 000 bucks back in the day but now how do you know what the value is so i'm so curious how does this work yeah i mean i think the appraisal valuation of nfts is really challenging and it's really just about like creating a way like a robust way to value them and so there's lots of different approaches whether it's creating like indices of nfts that are of like a similar stature or you know having like actual appraisers um and having like a human element to it could be one way i think the uh it really just depends on the nft like if we're talking art and collectibles that's totally different than if we're looking at um something that can actually have like a a discernible value like a carbon credit um like that that's very easy to to price yeah i think there's different vehicles of approaching it right so if you look at whale and whale shark you know that's primarily or initially um a collection built up by an individual and increasingly is being devolved to a community and that becomes increasingly important so if you look at like generative art as an example in in a subset of collectibles um i mean that is highly specialized and believe it or not there are now like people who are specialists in like rare pepes or like crypto punks that's their job which is brilliant um i love how they explain that you mean in do you mean in collecting or in appraising it both yeah um i mean you know and i i just love how somebody's going to have to explain that at christmas this year to the wider family but um but you know so uh increasingly this is like com complex there's like data points of course um so you we're gonna see like big data analytics companies coming through i think that's why it's interesting nonfungible.com you know they've got really two years plus worth of data and this kind of thing that's going to have an increasing premium you're going to have to crowdsource a lot of this stuff as well and again that's the benefit of something like whale communities you could end up with specialists within a certain category like so i i personally can't really participate in most generative collectibles because i just have time to figure out rarity traits and like and you know price differential between this rare trait and and you know um but like if you can do that you can make a lot of money that nate who's part of nft 42 is like mate i don't want to say how much but like a lot of money flipping crypto punks is you know based upon understanding the nuance of like particular traits um and pranksy's similarly notorious for kind of you know having an edge in that space um as you said there are kind of now indices where you're kind of tracking uh um the kind of broad like so hash masks as a as a as a whole thing um or you know generative collectibles as a whole thing or a fractionalized stake in a blue chip piece i actually disagree that they're all going to go to zero as i said i think this is different to icos um i think there are already established blue chips um i'd argue cryptopunks is one of them because of what they represent in the story of nfts and the story of entities is not going to go away more people are going to come in and they're going to want to buy status i actually think so i'm in the middle of doing a an audio documentary interviewing the ogs of nfts going all the way back to counterparty and color coins with bitcoin um and there are so many trends like um trash art spam art that are like references to themes that are going to become really important in nfts like d platforming copyright um the fact that if i know you own a people because i can see it's in your wallet i can now spam you with stuff like nft flyers there's going to be loads of things that people have been considering for a long time making art about um that are going to inform the future of nfts that are i would say undervalued at the moment so i think once all the kind of noise dies down around just like this house pipe of new like you know lindsay lohan or like kings of leon i think um the blue chip will emerge of people that are key points in the innovations that have moved nfts as a medium forward um and there's going to be a mass retrospective i think like over the towards the end of this year there's going to be mass retrospective of people going back and rediscovering uh the past of nfts and they will be blue chip art and if you look at um robnes who's like the pioneer of trash art because he got kicked off super air for um copyright infringement it created a whole movement of trash art well beyond him it's like a meme in love itself i think he currently lists the original trash art piece at 300 million um now whether he'll get that not i don't know but um you know that used to seem ridiculous and now i don't know right so i think it's not true they're all gonna go to zero i do think um many will they won't have a buyer but again you don't have this price discovery that you get in crypto they're generally illiquid so what will happen is nobody will buy it at the price you've listed it at but you're not going to have this like this buy and sell wall for nfts where you know you're going to be exposed to mass volatility you're just going to end up with a load of nfts that stay at fixed price with no buyer during the next winter and we will get a winter i don't think it will be two years i don't think we'll lose 90 percent of value it might be like six seven months um yeah well i mean neither of them said all of them will go to zero but that many of them would um but yeah that's why earlier in the show when you said that you thought that um you know just everything was gonna have all this massive value i thought um i don't know about that i definitely think certain things will for sure um and and many many more things but yeah certainly i think there's a lot of stuff being created that that won't retain value but the question is uh how i how i re-ask the question it's like value to who right so um will a particular nft have value to um a mainstream speculator no right so there will be a group of people that are coming in and trading on things they have they don't care about just because they think price go up right but many of these things because of the social component will have value to somebody because of what they represent in the context of community and status and again that's why i think if you're going to price these things you need to look beyond necessarily the the immediate volatility you need to look beyond even the content of the nft it's like what does this represent and to who and how big is that community and is that community growing or is it just going to plateau and what you end up doing is you're valuing memes if you think about it and really what we're talking about are meme markets we've actually got a startup called marble cards and our current cohort and they are actually working on meme markets and that sounds like ridiculous um but actually once you start looking into it it's like well like elon musk tapped in like tesla tapped into the power of meme most valuable company on the planet or at least it was um the power of memes holds and i think that's beyond any kind of market cycle yeah i think the the one thing i would just briefly add is that like the value of a meme changes over time and so like crypto punks are incredibly valuable right now because they're largely considered like the first uh nft on ethereum but like you you still probably have under 2 000 wallets that hold crypto punks and so if those holders like you know believe that they will retain value and like they're strong enough they have diamond hands if it were to to keep that then yeah they could hold value but uh you know if the prices do tank 70 i imagine you will see some sort of of sell-off yeah so i'm curious what do you think will determine whether or not an nft either not only retains value or just becomes more valuable versus which ones will not retain value yeah so i just like reiterate for me it's it's the value of that thing to a particular community and so it is like the uh the level of the the breadth or level of depth within that community um and what that nft represents as a form of status in that community so as you say like some memes are um evergreen like rep you know pepe is is kind of just doesn't go away and it that one woman it's an alt-right thing and then the other hand it's like another thing it's just like the thing that never never goes away right um and then there are some that will kind of come in and out of favor and i think that's actually why what you're doing with nft is you are valuing the power that it's mean markets and once you understand it in that construct like how you price these things is how you value memes and so i i don't know how you do that yet but like once you crack it you're gonna make a lot of money yeah i think if if you refer to like nfts and like art collectibles then it's it's value in culture and that is like subjective and so like there's no it's kind of like bitcoin in a sense like it's valuable because people think it's valuable and the more people that think it's valuable well the more value it becomes it's like this self uh fulfilling prophecy and so i think that applies to a subset of nfts and then the nfts that become like gaming assets or music content like that i think is gonna have um you know a much more transparent valuation based on any sort of like royalties cash flows and traditional models so i think it'll be uh interesting to see how we we value them over time i think the gaming one's important actually because so something like axes or what have you you know these things are you know it's play to earn environments you need that nft to play at a certain level in the game so as long as the game's popular and growing these things will hold value if the game plateaus and most games have a shelf life then you can assume that they'll depreciate in value so they're probably a bit more tangible to a bit more objective ways of measuring yeah and i think when marguerite de carcel was on my show i think she also talked about how like um certain items could kind of like gain value um by certain players playing them or getting up to certain levels with those objects or whatever so um yeah even just through the course of play you can add more value to um but then yeah that's almost like proof of work in the sense that you know there there's kind of like a history there with that object um okay all right so last question um and well actually i just realized i was going to say this is going to be a last quick question however because of what we were saying earlier about how how hard it is to know what the value of any given nft is at the moment it is also hard to know what the market capitalization of the whole nft market is at any given moment however despite that how big do you think the nft market will be by the end of the year so i think for context uh non-fungible their 2020 report said that the nft market specifically like actual nfts like whether it be art axes was like 330 million give or take 338 yeah which is hilarious because now everything is like way bigger than that already but anyway totally i think we've easily doubled if not tripled that already um i i would say like the it's tough like if we like let's i'd say it's better to take like top 50 projects because then it's not just like okay everyone's just issuing stuff so if we said like the top 50 projects um i think it could easily be a billion dollar valuation jamie and then larger if we include uh all the nft related like adjacent tokens i'm going to give a much less sophisticated answer to that um uh so and i i don't have the numbers to hand but like um last quarter of last year i said that however you were however you would measure like nfts as a whole thing um with this run whether this is a 12-month run or an 18-month run or whatever it is we'll be three times uh crypto during the ico mania i don't know what that number is um i kind of still hold oh i think it was like maybe 800 billion or something i think you know if i remember correctly i think it was about 800 billion i think you could do that well i feel like that sounds insane totally insane but it it's and i don't again how do you value these things going to be very illiquid but like if it's like listed price i don't know like whatever it is or last sold price why not depends how long the run lasts i wouldn't say like necessarily the next 12 months but like whatever this cycle is i get 3x of ics i think long term you're right um i think it just depends on on uh yeah how long the market market cycle lasts and uh what comes out next yeah and actually mason earlier when you said 1 billion i realized you know when we were saying that 338 is where the market was at at the end of 2020 and you said oh we're already three x that that is yeah we're already out of billions so let's go 10x more than that 10 billion oh but okay but then jamie but jamie's estimate was two and a half billion roughly if if my memory is correct that it was 800 oh sorry 800 billion never mind right so i'm just doing the math now right so you would so when i'm saying icos i mean like the kind of money raised through icos right so exclude bitcoin and maybe you'd put the theorem in there i don't know got it but like you know that whatever the amount of money in the capitalization of ico tokens maybe excluding ethereum including bitcoin three times that i'm making it up it's not based on any science and uh so that's yeah that's a much lower number obviously um maybe like i don't know 10 to 20 billion somewhere in there yeah so i think that's fair okay okay so then 3x that would be somewhere between 30 and 60. all right okay well we will see by the end of the year this has been so fun discussing this with you guys i have so enjoyed talking with you so where can people learn more about each of you
