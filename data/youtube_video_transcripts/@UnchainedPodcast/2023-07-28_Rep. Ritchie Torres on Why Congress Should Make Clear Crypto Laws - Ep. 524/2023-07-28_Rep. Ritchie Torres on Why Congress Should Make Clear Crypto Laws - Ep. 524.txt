's guest is representative Richie Torres welcome representative Torres it's an honor to be here you're one of the most prominently pro-crypto Democratic members of Congress you just voted for the advancement of the financial Innovation and technology for the 21st century act which was republican-led and you've even called for an investigation into SEC chair Gary Gensler you've called for an investigation into the sec's failure to protect investors from ftx's failures Etc most people when they hear the words crypto and Democrat would not come up with a stereotype that fits sort of your stance or your position why is that what led you to have this unique position on crypto that's different from most Democrats well I I respectfully disagree with the premise of the question I would submit to you that the Divide on crypto is not so much ideological or partisan but it's generational and the opposition to crypto is largely a gerontocracy um the you know yesterday the financial services Committee in the house passed a market structure bill on a bipartisan basis and the bipartisan support came from younger Democrats like myself who are open to embracing the potentialities of blockchain technology so I see it as more as a generational divide and as Congress becomes less of a Jared toxic over time I suspect the institution will become more open to embracing crypto and would you say that that generational divide also applies to the Republican side because I can think of many republican members of Congress who are quite a bit older um but quite vocal in their support of the industry Republicans generally are pro-business so that's what's driving the Republican position but but to indiscriminately portray all Democrats as anti-grypto is to ignore the generational divide within the Democratic caucus and then setting aside the politics of Congress you know I ask myself what is crypto and blockchain you know the combination of crypto and blockchain has the potential to revolutionize Finance creating a better cheaper faster payment system it has the potential to revolutionize the internet creating a new layer of the internet known as web3 uh it seems to me that the project of radically decentralizing both the financial system and the internet decentralizing ownership strikes me as a profoundly Progressive Enterprise so if you were viewing the subject without ideological preconceptions you would naturally come to conclude that crypto and blockchain are powerful tools for affecting Progressive change or can be so let's now talk a little bit about some of these specific bills we um you know mentioned uh that there have been some recent votes and the house Financial Services committee voted to advance the financial Innovation and technology for the 21st century act and I think this was the first time that crypto specific bills were advanced in Standalone votes rather than as part of larger pieces of legislation and I was wondering if you could just explain what it is that you support in that particular bill I mean I support the market structure bill because it brings regulatory clarity or not exist the modus operandi of the SEC under Gary genzer has been regulation by enforcement he has taken what I consider to be arbitrary and capricious actions against crypto innovators and I'm of the view that we should create a federal framework for regulating digital assets that distinguishes the best actors from the worst actors right the best actors should be free to innovate while the worst actors should be held accountable and instead of focusing on the worst actors Gary Gensler has declared war in the whole industry we've seen not regulation but the weaponization of the SEC against the whole crypto industry and so there's a real urgent need for Congress to step in and to provide regulatory Clarity where not exist and so the market structure bill would distinguish restricted digital assets which would be subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC from crypto Commodities which would be subject to the jurisdiction of the cftc and the bill essentially holds that a digital asset is presumptively subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC until it is shown to be sufficiently decentralized to constitute a commodity in which case it is subject to the jurisdiction of the cftc so for the first time we're going to have in statute not only a framework for regulating digital assets and distinguishing Securities from commodities but also a clear delineation of the process by which a digital asset becomes a commodity and there was another bill that also Advanced the blockchain regulatory certainty act what is it about that bill that you support uh the two bills that I support were the market structure bill and the stable coin bill um you know everything else you know none of those bills were you know we had we were presented with an opportunity to negotiate so those are the only two bills that I committed to supporting and for the stable coin Bill I know you're a big proponent of those explain your position on those and um you know what you'd like to see happen with stablecoin legislation you know it it's it's often said that crypto has no use case which to me is is a fallacy it's often said that much of crypto fails to function as a currency the clearest usage case of crypto is stablecoin uh stablecoin is in some sense the truest form of cryptocurrency because it functions as a currency and there should be a framework regulating stable coins which has the potential to revolutionize payment systems in America you know we want to ensure that every stable coin is fully reserved and that those reserves consist of a hundred percent cash or cash equivalent and that customers have clearly defined Redemption rights under federal law all of that requires legislation and one of the most controversial issues in the negotiations around stablecoin has been the question of federal preemption or state path you know my view is that there's long been a tradition of dual regulation of financial services on the part of the federal government and the states just like banking has a federal Charter or a state Charter stable coin issuance should have a federal license or a state license the notion that states cannot be trusted to regulate stable coins strikes me as absurd you know by what logic can a state be trusted to regulate a fractionally reserved bank but cannot be trusted to regulate a fully reserved stable coin fractionally reserved banking is far riskier poses a far greater systemic risk than a fully reserved stable coin so you'd like to see the preservation of the bit license or the the power of the New York State Financial Department of Financial Services yeah I'm I'm committed to preserving the prerogatives of the New York State Department of Financial Services and if you're a stable coin issuer you should have the flexibility to choose between a federal license and a state license now there should be a federal floor that prevents regulatory Arbitrage but the state should continue to play a role in regulating staple points just like State's player role in regulating Banks which again are far riskier all right and so at this point the market structure bill I think will move forward for a full vote in the house as far as I understand the um stablecoin act just failed to reach a bipartisan deal so can you talk a little bit about kind of what are the next steps for each of these two bills so we passed the market structure Bill yesterday uh and we're in the process of considering the stable coin Bill even though negotiations between chair McHenry and ranking member awarders have collapsed I do anticipate that they will nonetheless be bipartisan support for the staplecoin bill and it's likely to command more bipartisan support than the market structure Bill did okay which so the market temperature Bill had six Democratic votes I suspect that the staple coin bill will have even more than six Democratic votes oh okay okay so this uh inability to reach the bipartisan deal at this moment isn't any kind of death now for the bill no but but here's the problem uh any bill that lacks the support of the ranking member Maxine Waters is is unlikely to receive consideration in the Senate and that's the challenge you know and and that's you know so um it it would have made a fundamental difference to have the support of a ranking member and given that you and the other Democrats who are pro-crypto are of the same party as representative waters you know what are the kinds of um conversations that you're having with her or people you know in a similar position in terms of either how you're you know trying to persuade them of your you know views or or what you're hearing from them in terms of their concerns I will Echo what I said at the hearing yesterday you know I have a number of colleagues who seem to believe that the status goal is working so which I reply the notion that the status quo is working a status quo that gave us the largest crypto Ponzi scheme in history FTX the notion that that is working is absurd like the status quo is not working it's failing and there there is a difference between Securities Law as we as individuals think it ought to be interpreted and Securities Law as the courts have interpreted it right I have colleagues who believe that Securities Law as is are is sufficient to regulate digital assets but a judge in the southern district of New York judge Torres how that Securities Law protects institutional investors in an initial coin offering but fails to protect retail customers on an exchange and so we have a status quo in which institutional investors are protected but retail customers are left exposed and the choice before the financial services committee the choice before Democrats is do we maintain that status quo or do we change it in order to protect retail customers and I prefer change and you know the crypto debate has been so unusual because typically in Washington DC Republicans are in favor of deregulation and Democrats are in favor of regulation in the crypto context it's the opposite Republicans are more in favor of Regulation whereas I have colleagues on my side who are in favor of maintaining a dangerously deregulated status quo which is a position that runs contrary to the normal impulses and intuitions of Democrats the regulatory impulses of Democrats crypto creates odd debt fellows and it creates paradoxes right so there's one more power attacks you know typically Europe is is is far less efficient at regulating technology than the United States the opposite is true when it comes to crypto Europe has been more reasonable on crypto than the US has been so for whatever reason politically crypto has brought out the worst in both Congress and the regulatory State yeah so I mean these are things I've heard time and again on my show and there's so much more to unpack uh in that realm which we will do in a moment but first a quick word for the sponsors who make this show possible undo Finance is connecting the on-chain economy to real-world

layer 3 or an orbit chain Propel your project and Community forward by visiting arbitrim.io today back to my conversation with representative Torres you know earlier you mentioned that you disputed the notion that crypto was a partisan issue but I did wonder if you thought that this divide had emerged more after the collapse of FTX because from my perception as a journalist covering this space I would have said that it didn't seem like strongly partisan and then after FTX to me it changed I wondered what you thought of that I I agree with part I feel like even before FTX Democrats were more skeptical about crypto than Republicans or there were more Skeptics in the Democratic party than in the Republican party but the skepticism took on a new intensity after FTX but again the FTX effect could could fade over time for me the the main issue is not the reaction to and then I would argue that FTX strengthens the argument for a regulatory framework rather than maintaining a status quo that led to FTX in the first place but the the main stumbling box here are actually The Regulators like I'm convinced we're not for Gary gentzer we would have had a much broader bipartisan Market structure bill we're not for the Federal Reserve we would have a much broader bipartisan stable coin though uh The Regulators have been intent on sabotage a bipartisan compromise and cooperation around crypto and it's been immensely frustrating to see firsthand you've been very direct about your criticism of chair Gensler and as I mentioned earlier called for an investigation into the SEC and him and you said quote the SEC is acting like an overzealous traffic cop arbitrarily ticketing drivers while keeping the speed limit a secret so I just wondered you know when you call for this kind of Investigation what are you expecting to find like what do you think his motivation would be or the agency's motivation would be to you know basically do something nefarious or to not do their jobs properly it's clear that I would characterize it as nefarious but I do view regulation by enforcement as an abuse of power and the SEC is has been rightly compared to a traffic agent that is picketing people for speeding without telling them the speeding limit right Mr Gensler has been sending Wells notices and taking arbitrary enforcement actions without issuing a single rule that clearly delineates the application of Securities Law to digital assets he has not issued a single rule he has not issued a single piece of written guidance and we've seen mixed messaging not only between the cftc and the SEC but from within the SEC itself at the cftc tells us that ether is a commodity the SEC has said otherwise contradicting the cftc and then missed against himself has an ever-evolving position on the status of ether Percy said no it is a commodity then he said yes it is a security then he said maybe so you know the SEC is like an Etch A Sketch constantly changing and and the law should be different from an Etch A Sketch law by definition should have stability and continuity and predictability which is lacking with respect to the SEC and so I view regulation by enforcement as as as an abuse of power and that's why the Ripple decision was so consequential because it represents a rejection of Regulation by enforcement by Mr Gensler indiscriminately declares that all digital assets are securities which is the basis for his practice of Regulation by enforcement and judge Torres said no you know the the Ripple case establishes what I call the torah's doctrine which holds that digital assets are not Securities in themselves but can be sold as part of investment contracts which do qualify as securities under the Howie test right so there's a difference between a security and an asset offered in the manner of a security offer and if you examine the Supreme Court case that established a Howie test the court never said that the Orange Grove was a security it said that it was offered in the manner of a security offering uh and and so the decision is significant because it will protect crypto entrepreneurs from arbitrary enforcement action and it prevents Mr genser from pre-judging All Digital assets to be Securities and engaging in regulation by enforcement on the basis of a pre-judgment that all digital assets or Securities and one thing I just wanted to tease out there was when you were talking about the xrp world and you basically said that judge Torres no relation to you judge anna-lysa Torres that she said that xrp and digital assets by extension are not inherently Securities or some phrasing like that I think the crypto Market structure bill would kind of make the SEC the initial default regulator um and then when um yeah the assets are sufficiently decentralized then they would be overseen by the cftc so can you just talk a little bit about your views on what crypto assets are inherently no I mean I agree with the the analysis the church Torres laid out the the digital assets crypto assets are not Securities in themselves but can be sold as part of investment contracts which do qualify as Securities so in order for a digital asset to qualify as a security it is not enough to state that all digital assets are security if you have to show that there is an investment contract right you have to show that there's an investment of money in a common Enterprise with an expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others you have to meet all those criteria of the Howie test as delineated by the Supreme Court now now to your question about the market structure about the market structure available and again this really reinforces the Paradox that Republicans are strangely in favor of Regulation but the the market structure Bill actually provides much broader protection than than the status quo as interpreted in the Ripple case the challenge of the Ripple case is it exposes the limits of Securities Law which protects institutional investors but fails to protect retail customers and so the the market structure bill is going to play a role in filling the Gap in investor protection when it comes to Everyday Americans who are buying and selling digital assets on exchanges I wanted to also ask you just one thing that's a little bit related to your call for the investigation into SEC chair againstler which was you also wanted to investigate promethium and called it a potemkin platform and again there is that notion of it being kind of put up as a display or something and I wondered what your reasons were for calling the investigation or what your thought is about what is going on there it seems to me that both the timing of the registration of promethium and the and the decision to register was politically motivated I mean here you have a trading platform that does not trade any assets not Bitcoin not ether it exists on paper rather than in practice and exists purely as a talking point to convey the false impression that there's a viable path to registration when in fact it demonstrates otherwise it demonstrates that the only trading platforms that can exist under Gary genser's interpretation of Securities Law are trading platforms that do not trade anything that to me represents a level of gamesmanship that's unprofessional and and and reflects the politicizing of the SEC and the attempt by the SEC to undermine the bipartisan negotiations around the market structure bill in the House of Representatives switching tax I wanted to ask about a bill in the Senate called the crypto asset National Security enhancement and Enforcement Act of 2023 which would essentially impose anti-money laundering requirements on those who control D5 protocols um it would kind of mandate that they collect customer information report suspicious activities block sanctioned individuals Etc I know this is in the Senate but I wondered if you had a chance to look at and consider this bill and what your thoughts were on it I have I've not examined the legislation but but the the issues surrounding anti-money laundering and counterterrorism finance are are all legitimate and should be taken seriously and we should find solutions to those problems in the crypto space um you know I worry that some of these bills are offered you know I cannot comment on this bill in particular but there are bills that are offered in bad faith that are not about solving these problems but are about sabotaging the industry and so a bill that might sound reasonable and benign on paper could have the intention of destabilizing the whole industry so the problem that this bill is attempting to address is something that to my mind really goes at the heart of both the opportunity in uh D5 or crypto and also the challenge so kind of you could say the purest form of crypto would be you know a decentralized financial system and as is uh famously documented Bitcoin itself was born during the midst of the great financial crisis and there's always been that connection that you know this ability to create a financial system that's not controlled by the big Banks you know came out of this time that was kind of showcasing the downsides of that system um however as you're quite well aware regulation typically has gone through intermediaries using them as Gatekeepers to the financial system employing them to go after Bad actors and this conundrum of how to you know create this opportunity for there to be an open and more accessible way of accessing a financial system while at the same time you know preventing Bad actors from using it that's been one of the challenges in crypto what do you think is the best way to resolve that challenge look I have no clear answer it's a it's it's one of the most challenging questions and I and I I'm I have enough faith that that our country has the Ingenuity required to identify Technical and technological solutions to these problems but but I want to push back against the notion of judging crypto by its worst uses every technology is open to abuse and the value of a technology should not be purely defined by its worst possible uses you know every year the automobile kills with forty thousand fifty thousand Americans which is a tragedy yet no one proposes that we eradicate the automobile because it is a net benefit to humanity just like there's more to money than money laundering there's more to crypto than ransomware and no serious person would argue that the concerns about money laundering is a basis for eradicating money uh and and there's far more money laundering when it comes to fiat currency and then when it comes to cryptocurrency so I feel like people have to not miss the force for the trees and keep everything in perspective and realize that over time we're going to develop Technical and technological solutions that will maximize the best of crypto and minimize the worst of

Twitter I mean X let's hear Ginny Hogan weigh in on elon's latest stunt an extremely manly move Elon Musk has rebranded Twitter as X to demonstrate he was serious about the change he tweeted out this which I have to imagine as a reference to deus ex machina something every Twitter investor has been praying for Elon also claimed that they're cutting Twitter's bird logo from the buildings with blow torches this is fair birds are way too effeminate I mean some of them are literally girls allegedly this move is because Elon wants to declare that Twitter is not the same social network he bought a year ago honestly I got that already from the fact that images no longer loaded my feed okay so there was an obscure altcoin the X coin that is up one thousand percent after the Rebrand yeah it's gone
