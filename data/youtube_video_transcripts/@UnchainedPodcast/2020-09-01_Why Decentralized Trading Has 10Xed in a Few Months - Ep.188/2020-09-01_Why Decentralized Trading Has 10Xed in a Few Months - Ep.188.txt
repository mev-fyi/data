hi everyone just a quick note before we begin the d5 space is moving so fast that parts of this episode have become somewhat outdated since the time of recording which was not even a week before this episode comes out for one i say that deck's trading volume has 8xed in august from the beginning of the year and by now a few days after we recorded it's 10xed i also theoretically talk about a new dex forking the code of uniswap and launching a token and liquidity mining scheme on it before uni swap v3 launches and sushi swap which is the definition of that launched the exact day we recorded and we were unaware of it or at least i was at the time we spoke then when we discussed the 24-hour trading fees on uniswap at the time of recording they were half that of bitcoins and now a few days later before publication they have exceeded those on bitcoin and finally we talked about how trading volume on dexes is smaller than that of centralized exchanges and while by the time of publication that statement is still true uniswap's 24-hour trading volume has exceeded that of coinbases which is pretty remarkable so if when you listen it sounds like this episode is old well it is in the world of d5 which moves at the pace of a live streamed video game with all that said this is still a fascinating engaging and fun conversation with haseeb qureshi of dragonfly capital and dan robinson of paradigm and i think you will really enjoy it now on to the show hi everyone welcome to unchained your no-hive resource for all things crypto i'm your host laura shin a journalist with over two

at paradigm welcome his steve and dan thanks for having me laura it's good to be here this year there's been an explosion in decentralized exchange activity particularly among the group of dexes known as automated market makers admittedly the growth is from a tiny base but the rise is still striking decks volume was below a billion dollars in january and hovered at about 1 billion through may then in june it was still below 2 billion but in the last few months it's exploded with volume for august having already surpassed 8 billion with almost a week remaining in the month at the time of recording just quickly before we dive into why this is happening let's first define the terms dex or decentralized exchange and let's also define or describe the specific type that we're talking about these automated market makers just so the audience understands the distinction dan you want to take that sure so um a decentralized exchange um is anything that serves the same function as centralized exchanges like coinbase or binance um but does it on a blockchain um or on an off chain scaling solution for a blockchain so that it essentially can be done without a centralized party custody in the funds or um or managing an order book an automated market maker is a specific subset of these dexes that provides liquidity according to an algorithm rather than based on orders submitted by um by participants and so the biggest amn um or highest volume amm is uniswap and it provides liquidity according to a very deterministic formula uh a very simple one so maybe i can i can kind of fill in a little bit of a sort of an analogy of what how you can understand what uniswap is as an automated market maker um so i wrote a post about this recently where i described you know imagine that you had a friend that decided that they were going to be a market maker and for those who are not familiar a market maker is basically somebody who is always willing to buy and sell some pair of assets uh so we often say they're market making that asset so like i'm always willing to buy some eth or i'm always willing to buy some ustc and i'm always sort of willing to quote the two prices at which i'm going to buy and sell those assets so what what a market maker like uh uniswap does is basically it's a market maker that uses an extremely simple algorithm which which we can go into at some point that decides when and how it's going to buy and sell what prices going to give for those two assets according to a simple formula but the thing that it does that's so different from any other normal market maker is that one it has no money of its own but it sort of raises money from decentralized investors who can give money to the market maker that allow it to buy and sell that asset and those investors can share in the profits of that market maker and in addition to that it's completely permissionless so it all works on chain it's it's it's all completely autonomous and that is very fundamentally different than any market maker who's come before it which have all been you know normal companies that go on exchanges that have you know shingles over the roof and employees uh uniswap does this entirely in an automated way through smart contracts and that's the really big difference between what's come before yeah and one little disclaimer that i do want to add is that dan at paradigm they've invested in uniswap so um that is something people watching the video might have figured out because he is wearing a uniswap t-shirt but we should uh let people know that because we are going to be talking about una swap quite a bit during this episode and one other thing i wanted to ask about was this idea of the constant function market makers um you know you touched on that very slightly but can you just describe a little bit more what that means so a constant function market maker so we can start with unit swap so uniswap has a particular function that it uses to decide how it's going to quote prices like how much it's going to charge for each versus usdc or whatever whatever is the two pairs or the two assets that it's quoting every algorithmic market maker or automated market maker for the most part that exists today uses some kind of uh very simple fixed pricing function that can be computed on chain uh given its reserves or given what it has in inventory so it's like if i have you know 10 units of eth and 10 000 units of usdc uh what is the rule that decides what prices i'm going to charge for the eth versus the usdc uh uniswap uses the rule called the constant product rule which basically says that uh the units of eth that i have not not the dollar value but the units so literally if it's 10 20 i don't care what the price of eat is i just care how many units of eat i have the units of my first asset and the units of my second asset multiplied together must equal a fixed constant and so let's let's imagine that it's you know uh let's say that i'm quoting you know sorry let's say i'm quoting usgc and tether right those are two assets that should be worth the same so if i have 100 usdc and i have 100 tether then 100 times 100 it's 10 thousand uh whenever i'm changing the price and i'm quoting somebody uh uh some trade against my uh against my inventory i should always make it so that when i'm done the two assets uh the two units i have of asset and asset b in inventory must always equal ten thousand multiplied together that's the constant product rule that's the rule that uniswap uses and it was the sort of the first and most influential of these kind of this generation of automated market makers that that uniswap really began uh but the the universe of functions that you could use is actually quite a bit larger than just constant product and so one of the other large platforms that uh has kind of really grown lately is called curve and curve uses a different function than the constant product function it uses this uh more complicated function that's a mixture of constant product and constant sum they call it the stable swap invariant uh and basically what that does is curve is optimized for stable coins only or other mean reverting assets like you know different kinds of rap bitcoin or different kinds of wrapped ether whatever and in that universe uh you you basically can assume that probably these two assets actually should trade pretty close to each other uh the the constant product rule x times y equals k it it gives you some slippage when you're when you're making you know moderate sized trades and for something like curve where you're trading assets that really should be worth the same almost all the time you can actually offer better pricing and you can offer tighter slippage in most ranges of inventory that you can end up with uh and so stable swap which is what curve uses allows curve to actually be more competitive on pricing because of the fact that it has this different kind of inventory and thus it can offer different kinds of rates so what we've what we're starting to see is this renaissance of different functions that are being applied to different uh different amms that are better suited for the diff particular kinds of assets that those uh amms are trading and so from the from the yeah trader side what are they using automated market makers for as opposed to for instance a centralized exchange so one area where automated market makers indexes in general excel is in sort of the long tail of tokens um that haven't necessarily been listed on any centralized exchange so uniswap um and a couple others like balancer support arbitrary erc20 tokens so as soon as something does in your c20 token it can be listed on unit swap and people can start trading it there um and it's also it's in part it's it's because it's permissionless um and on chain another reason uh that i think these automated market makers are good for the long tail is because you may actually need some centralized market maker on a traditional exchange to basically go on and actually uh make a market um both sides of market to may i have enough liquidity in a token and that's just not going to be the case for most tokens whereas on unit swap literally anybody can do that doesn't take any professional expertise basically just click a button and suddenly you're you're providing liquidity in both sides of the market for a particular token um and so that's proven to be a very uh um there's been proven to be a very long tale of tokens that people would be would like to trade now let's go oh go ahead go ahead uh one thing i want to point out that i think might not be obvious for folks who've been following the space for a while um so you might remember things like either delta obviously 0x was was a very big uh set of decentralized exchanges or protocol for decentralized exchange and none of these things really took off in a big way uh before unison and i think it's an important question to like really try to ponder like why what what's different now and i'm sure we'll go into that at some point uh and i'm sure dan and i have different theories of why uta swap has been so successful but one big very clear difference actually that i would argue between define now and what decentralized exchange trading looked like two or three years ago is that two or three years ago it was basically all long tail assets so the kinds of assets that you saw getting the most liquidity on ether delta or on you know the early zero x-ray layers they were mostly these long tail really crappy tokens that weren't getting listed on centralized exchanges and it's not that centralized exchanges didn't list tokens aggressively that some things were so bad that even centralized exchanges weren't willing to list them and now what you're seeing is actually quite a bit different profile in the types of tokens that are trading on d5 so you're seeing the the really high quality pairs like if usdc or eth tether or ustc tether or you know eath rap bitcoin you're seeing those start to gain really meaningful volume uh and that's pretty fundamentally different it feels a lot more sustainable than what was happening in 2017. the other thing that i would say has a big has a lot of explanatory power for why uniswap has been so successful which i i think was difficult to anticipate ex-ante was the power of what are called incentivized pools so incentivized pools are basically this idea so you know normally if i if i want to start a new uh uniswap pool because you know i want a market make for some pair i want there to be some liquidity so people can buy and sell it um you know i need to i need to provide some liquidity meaning i need to put some of eth and you know token x so let's say let's say ample fourth because it's you know a token that trades a lot on you swap um if i if i'm you know an early holder or i'm a community supporter or i'm the core team of ample forth and i want there to be liquidity um you know on a centralized exchange i could go like pay a listing fee i could go hire a market maker i could do all this stuff that's like kind of a pain in the ass it's very expensive it's very difficult um what if you do instead is i could go on unison and of course i could myself just provide liquidity i could just put a bunch of ethan a bunch of ample forth in the pool and let unit swap do the work uh but another thing that i could do is i could actually incentivize other people to go do that for me and the way that that works is essentially there's a so ample fourth has this thing they call the geyser and the geyser what it does is basically you can you can imagine that like every day or every week uh ample fourth spits out a bunch of new ample rewards to anybody who's providing liquidity on unison and so what that does is it's sort of like it's almost like uh it's almost like ampliforth can pay a market maker to market make the asset but but it's paying anybody who's willing to provide liquidity on unit swap so it's sort of it's sort of this like very clever way to incentivize the community to become your market maker and that's become a big driver for the success of unison yeah well this is actually where i was gonna go with my question is just you know why is it that we're seeing this explosion in dex activity and i do you know wanna also just put into context when i say explosion to be fair when i say it's you know the august volume is probably going to come in over 8 billion it's still small compared to the july volume on centralized exchanges which was uh 109 billion but it's not insignificant and it is growing fast so you know what has happened just in the last few months is it uh because of the incentivized pools or is it does it have to do with the yield farming craves or why just in these last few months have we seen this explosion i think um i think the d5 boom in general and the yield farming craze particularly have been big drivers of um of ethereum usage uh and dexes i think uh serve those uses particularly well because if you're doing something on chain with tokens if you're borrowing them on on compound if you're minting die maker or you're participating in yield farming in any number of these protocols um you typically don't want to go to the trouble of depositing to an exchange waiting for the deposit uh time to um to expire making the trade withdrawing it's like you're actually going to spend more potentially in transaction fees from the deposit in withdrawal than you would from an on-chain trade and so it's much more convenient for you just to go to uni swap and this is true even if you're trading a fat tail token uh or fat tail pair like usct usbc or usct having actually something to do on chain with tokens um has really increased the usefulness of dexes which in my opinion provide right now a better a more convenient user experience than centralized exchanges even with extremely high fees and slow uh transaction confirmation times i i agree with that wholeheartedly i think that i think there's a really amazing story about how dexa's and defy has started to look actually more convenient than centralized exchanges so in the in the post i share a story of a friend of mine who was telling me you know uh there was there was some hot token that was that he was interested in training and you know he got listed in a few places and he was telling me like look you know i i could i could go like look up on coingecko and try to see which exchanges it's listed on and how many of them are legit and you know where has the most liquidity and then send up an account and send my funds there but it's just too much work and so instead like i'm going to go i'll just like click a couple buttons and like buy it on an aggregator on unit swap or on whatever that to me was a little bit of a revelation they're like oh people are going to use d5 because they're lazy not because they're ideological not because they care about non-custodial training the other element of it that i think is also very important especially in this latest bull run that we've seen kind of centered around defy is that you know so much of what made binance successful in the ico craze was that binance was the first to list a lot of these assets right and so if you wanted to get in early and of course so much of crypto speculation is about getting in early you had to go to binance because that's just where they're what's where things got listed first and now you're seeing that actually happen on d5 d5 is worthless at first right comp first traded on on uniswa before it traded on any centralized exchange uma was trading first on on unispot uh so many of these assets are first available in defy before they're available on any centralized exchange and so if you want to get in early if you want to get in with the cool kids if you want to get in with what all the influencers are doing they're all on d5 doing it at all direct and i think that's another thing that's driving a lot of the uh excitement for people to get onto d5 of course it's driving up gas fees like crazy um but it's in in a way it's part it's become part of the game that defy is now you know the cottage coolest place where all the people are making all the money and that of course incentivizing people to say hey i want a piece of that and one other thing i was curious about is so una swap like you know when i asked this question i was asking about yield farming but uniswap does not offer any kind of liquidity mining so yield farming is not possible there but a number of the other amms are doing that and so i wondered do you think that the uptick in volume that we're seeing on these decks is that are not unisquat but ones that do have a token do you think that's something that will be sustainable or do you think that the volume that we're seeing on those dexes is is just you know kind of a flash in the pan just because people are being incentivized to put their liquidity there well so two things i want to say to that so one is that uh i think incentivized pools are basically isomorphic to yield farming they're kind of the same thing just in a different just in a different term right it's yeah what is isomorphic mean uh basically the same thing it's basically the same thing right it's just sort of a different name um because yield farming is this idea that like okay i put up my assets and i normally get some nominal yield but that yield gets juiced by some protocol rewards right uniform has the same thing right i'm supposed to put my money in a uniform pool i get some yield by the trading fees and the uh permanent loss but that gets juiced by the incentive you know the incentives in the pool but it's one of the things that's like the ample forest geyser here exactly right or synthetics or you know any of these incentivized pools that are that are getting a lot of action but it's important to recognize that what what that does is not drive trading volume it drives liquidity right trading volume is a totally separate deal so because because incentivizing a lot of liquidity up front gets these big fat juicy pools right and says oh great look there's so much capital you can trade against but if nobody wants to trade it doesn't matter she's going to sit there and do nothing right the actual the real interesting story is not the liquidity the really interesting story is the trading demand right where's all this trading volume come from because that's not incentivized nobody's getting rewarded for trading against unesco they're trading insulin swap because they like the prices that's what's really interesting and i i think you know the the fact that the the pools are really big i mean so most of the the the highest volume municipal pools are at this point not even incentivized they were in the earlier days but at this point they're not um and the same thing is true for curve right curve has incentivized uh liquidity because the people who are depositing funds into curve they are getting you know some curve tokens uh but people who are trading against curve they just want to swap stable points and curve has a ton of volume from people who are getting nothing except actually getting trades executed so the liquidity what it's showing us is that there is actually latent demand that's there if there was no lane demand then what you'd see is a ton of liquidity with almost no trading volume and that's the opposite of what we're seeing which is what's so interesting about what's happening now and let's just parse this out a little bit more because i i actually was going to ask a question about this but we can cover this now you know when i was doing research for this i did see things like yeah uniswap had obviously the highest trading volume out of all the amms but then something like curve which was smaller had more total value locked in it so can you i mean i think you kind of already started to answer this but can you just walk us through a little bit more like what does it mean uh for an amm uh or sorry what is a total value locked mean for an amm and then what does trading volume mean and and why and so if we see a lot of total value locked one place but then more trading volume elsewhere like what does that mean so you can think about the liquidity that's locked in a pool unlocked is really not the right word and we all use it um and feel a little guilty about it because there it's available to be traded against right you can think about that as kind of the maker side of the market the the maker orders where somebody's pulling liquidity and it's available at any at any price um in some quantity the volume is the is the taker demand and typically the makers are are there um they're sort of neutral up between these two assets and they're just trying to make money off of the fees um and the takers are trying are trying to actually trade there and what we found is that uh to some extent liquidity drives volume um the the quantity of uh maker orders because it determines how uh how much you can trade on this um without pushing the price too far um and so uh this it's not the full story and in fact um uniswap right now has has lower liquidity than um than curver balancer total uh in its pools but much higher volume and i think that's in part uh so it shows that there's some stickiness to volume aside from liquidity that and that's true even on the same tokens although the other thing that matters is whether this is liquidity in tokens that actually um the people actually care about trading and so i agree with with received generally that volume is a is a pretty it may be a better indicator um although it can be confounded a bit if this liquidity would be unprofitable otherwise and is there people will trade against it um but potentially that could dry up when if uh incentives try out so the i mean the right way to think about tvl which is total value locked in a protocol i mean it's it's it's a fun headlight metric we all talk about it and it's like it's it's really stupid um it's kind of like trying to measure how good a blockchain is by looking at its hash rate um which is like it's like one thing and it like kind of matters if you contextualize it correctly but if you don't like it's just it's just not the main thing to think about um i mean the most cogent way to describe like what is tdl for market maker for automated market makers is like again if you imagine that this is a market maker you know this is just literally a market maker that's buying and selling things that's the size of its balance sheet right it's you know this this this this thing if it's got 500 million dollars locked then it's balance sheet is 500 million dollars and that allows it to do a lot of trading because if you have 500 million dollars you can absorb a lot of a lot of volume now of course like compared to normal market makers right like the one thing you can't help but notice is that all of these automated market makers are incredibly capital and efficient like the amount of capital that's in curve is like absolutely insane relative to the amount of trading volume that it's doing right it just just on the absolute numbers it doesn't really need that much liquidity um but you know what's happening in a sense is that the the liquidity the balance sheet of curve is getting subsidized by this air dropped you know crv distribution and the same thing is happening in incentivized pools right like these things are getting subsidized by whatever teams are are subsidizing these uh these pools and so that may mean that normally uh you know at equilibrium if there were no subsidy really there should be less liquidity uh and you know the returns compared to the risk and so on it's obviously hard to measure all this stuff because we don't really nobody really knows what you know how much risk should you be taking how much should be rewarded for taking a certain amount of risk everybody's sort of you know just finger in the air like kind of take a rough guess but uh it's it's very clear that one effect of liquidity mining is that it is somewhat distorted of the sort of natural rate of uh sort of what you should expect to be the risk-free rate and the price of risk in these markets yeah and one thing i do also want to point out for listeners is this is another way to contextualize the volumes that we are seeing on uniswap at the time of recording the fees for the last 24 hours on uniswap were roughly half that of the fees on bitcoin uh it was about a half a million dollars on uniswap and then about a million dollars in fees on bitcoin and you know that's quite remarkable because you know swap is nowhere near as old as bitcoin um but actually i i want to maybe throw that uh to you guys is it fair to even make that comparison between the two because they're obviously completely different things i think it's i love the sort of fees paid as a metric in general um and i think uh maybe more than i like total value locked and i think it's uh it's fun especially to compare the fees earned by these applications on on ethereum to some of the smaller um chains that are still around from um you know from 2015 and before well yeah yeah i do think obviously there's ways um obviously there's ways in which it's it's incomparable and one way actually is that those units swap fees don't even count the ethereum gas fees that people are paying to use uh uniswap that's just um the transaction fees that are going to that are going to liquidity providers um and then on the flip side the bitcoin one does not include block rewards um uh which are for miners the primary source of their of their revenue um and that's sort of really what drives a lot of this um mining demand and then obviously again these are these are very different kinds of services but i do think it's i think it's useful to show just what are people actually willing to pay for so you know one thing that's interesting here is i mean it's not like uniswap uh is completely dominant but it is quite dominant and i just wondered what does that mean for decentralization so uniswap the protocol is um is completely decentralized in the sense that uh the contracts aren't changing can't change and can't be stopped by um by the team and if the entire unit web development team disappeared uh tomorrow unit swap v2 would continue to operate the interfaces are open source that said i think that's one of the benefits of decentralization is that you can have this kind of network effect building up in in one system without having the kind of platform risk that that would uh cause in in sort of more traditional internet businesses or any other kind of businesses that have existed before and so that's i think one of the one of the benefits is that it could be that uniswap sucks up all the liquidity in the market um but that's fine that said i'm not i think that's that's not necessarily going to be continue to be the case and i think there's going to have to be more innovation um in this in this field um it's not i don't think uniform v2 is going to be the final um word on on liquidity and just have uh sort of an infinite lock on the amm market well there's gonna be a v3 coming out soon anyway so right that's what that's what i was referring to you just have v3 will be that dan trying to be oblique yeah yeah well so i i disagree with one of the things that dan said which is that uh uniform has a network finally you're expecting disagree on everything and so far we've been waiting for you to take out your boxing gloves entire time waiting to start a fight and i've been telling you look i love you i love you to swap um but he doesn't believe me uh well first we can we can get to that maybe in a second but the other thing that i want to say in response to laura's question is that um i don't think that it um so i i agree with with uh with dan obviously that uniform is decentralized in the sense that nobody controls it uh but i also disagree with sort of the spirit behind the question that the idea that having something that's sort of outsizably successful on chain is a uh is a sign that something is not decentralized right because i think it you should sort of expect it to be natural that there's some power law to like what is the most valuable thing and what ends up becoming most most used by people or most beloved or most effective um and if there's some kind of scale effect to that thing then naturally it will end up becoming really big um so i i you know it's sort of like asking you know is is crypto not decentralized because bitcoin is the biggest one and it's got all you know everyone loves that one like isn't that kind of not decentralized uh and so in the same way i think i think uniswap being being uh sort of the right now you know by it's the number one largest gas guzzler on ethereum today which i think speaks to how much people love it how much value people get out of it um but i don't think that's any park against being decentralized all right i totally agree with that how is that that was very difficult i disagree with you on no i think it's network effect i don't think i don't think um has an error effect but huh yeah well that actually leads to my next question because i was kind of curious i've seen people chatter about how another team could fork you in a swap and for instance like i guess part of the fee now goes to the uniswap team instead of all of it going to liquidity providers and so someone suggested oh someone could fork in the swap and then have all the fees go to uh the liquidity providers or that someone could fork you into swap and then launch a token with it before uniswap does so how durable do you think uniswap's current lead is so i'll let haseeb answer that question because he's invested in a in a project that um is doing something like that um one quick correction there is that the uh there is a protocol fee switch in unisoft v2 but it isn't currently turned on um so right now all fees go to liquidity providers oh right so this is actually i was i was just chatting with somebody about this yesterday i think it's actually a very interesting question so um so there actually is a protocol we we're investors in uh one inch which is a which is a decentralized exchange aggregator basically meaning it lets you kind of route uh an order across like every single decentralized liquidity source so you can route it to unit swap curve balance or whatever it just finds you the best price across everything and so they launched their own version of uniswab a fork of it called munaswa which has a slightly different design basically uses the same front end kind of the same underlying mechanics and uh moon swap i think right now they're like at 100 million in total liquidity uh their trading volume is still quite a bit lower than unit swaps but they've they've managed to garner a lot of liquidity in a very short amount of time and in a way i think this is uh not a not a complete validation but it's it's something of a uh something of a sign in favor of uh hey you know uniswap does not have a a traditional network effect right and part of the reason why i say this and i think this is actually an interesting question right moon swap is uh is is doing liquidity mining so there's going to be a small amount of the one-inch token which gets liquidity mined to early lps who uh who you know put capital into into munich swap to help capitalize it and give it liquidity so naturally what that does is it juices liquidity right it brings a lot of capital uh into the into the into the pools and makes it so now you know trading can happen with lower slippage and so on uh and that's great it makes a lot of sense the question is could uniswap counter by having their own version of liquidity mining and sort of trying to pull it pull it back in their favor right and i argue that actually they couldn't um and this is this is kind of a weird argument this might be totally off kilter for for this podcast but i kind of want to i kind of want to talk about with dan so i'm going to go ahead and nerd out on it um here's the idea right when you do liquidity mining basically what you're doing is you're rewarding early adopters right you're awarding people who come in early before it really makes economic sense for them to provide a lot of liquidity you're sort of subsidizing that early liquidity in exchange for them having some ownership over a future revenue stream that's going to come when this thing becomes at scale right when the thing is really big and has tons of liquidity then then you know they're gonna the people who got in early are gonna get rewarded by getting some of the profits that would otherwise go to those late comers right so in a way it's sort of a redistributive transfer from latecomers to early comers right okay so it makes sense that you munis swap can do this because windows swap has no lane cars right it's a tiny protocol and they're rewarding that people come on early but unit swap is already at scale so right now a hundred percent of unit swap users uh all of the liquidity providers have or they are getting rewarded with the uniform profits right if you turned on liquidity mining in unesco then everybody who gets those profits would get like they would they would all be getting uniswap tokens which would give them just a portion of the profits that they were already getting 100 of so it's almost like a stock split or something it basically doesn't do anything to the amount of revenue that they get because they're already getting 100 percent of the revenue of unesco so my argument is that what liquidity mining really is is it's a way for you to juice your early your early growth and and to get uh early liquidity on board but once you're at scale liquidity money doesn't really do that much for you that's my order so right i think you said a lot of interesting things there but the piece that i'll pick out is that i you said that you think unit swap is is at scale is that that's for sure and i think there's there's quite a long way to go i think in fact um right now the the amount of the equivalent units off is a small fraction of what i think ultimately it will be uh and same for volume so uh i would say it's it's still early as with as with bitcoin and as with the rest of the space yeah that was pretty much exactly my thought i was like see this is this is this is nothing yet um all right but we're going to talk in a moment a little bit more about the future of uniswap and also talk about just the future of trading in cryptocurrency but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible how much in fees are you paying for your crypto purchases crypto.com is waiving the 3.5 credit card fee for all crypto purchases which means you can buy crypto with a 0

app today and enjoy these offers till the end of september back to my conversation with haseem qureshi and dan robinson so haseeb i think he wanted to expound a little bit more on the network effects in automated market makers yes so i don't believe that so dan earlier made the claim that uniswap has a network effect and i don't think this is correct um i think you can you can clearly argue that amms have a scale effect meaning that the more liquidity they have the better pricing they offer and that's great however you know if let's say i have you know a big pool of ethiospc and they have another pool of like you know ample eth or whatever um the eth uscc pool has no effect it doesn't help me in any way in getting people into the the next pool that i start so each marginal pool doesn't really benefit from other pools that exist within the same protocol so that when i think of a network effect i think like the idea that uh you know nobody can nobody can compete with unit swap once it gets to scale because the fact that it just doesn't ever make sense to list your pool anywhere else other than uniform and that's not really true if you're bringing your own i mean for something like ample right they're sort of bringing their own community they're bringing their own volume and if at some point when uniform turns on fees they're paying some of that volume to another set of of users at some point they might just decide like hey we're just going to fork into swap or we're going to use some other protocol that doesn't charge fees and we're going to take that liquidity in-house and so i'm not certain that you're not going to see the same sort of thing that happened with 0x where they created this you know when xerox was a public good and everybody loved it and found it really fantastic everyone was using it and then once it turned on fees and once it started becoming you know you sort of end up having this uh this this real question of like hey do i really want to be paying a third party for getting what is what is a nicely provisioned public good but actually not something i can't just fork and build in-house uh that you won't see the same sort of thing happening uh once unit swap tries to do that okay yeah so we'll we'll have to see what happens but one other thing that i wanted to ask about was has he view had written a couple of really great blog posts about automated market makers and in one of them you said that over time you felt d5 would probably attract serious market makers and that at that time we'll see more complex markets and the follow-on effect will be that uniswap will decrease in market share why do you think that there are a few reasons why i think that and i i want to cover all this with saying that unison v3 may really fundamentally change my analysis of uniswap because from what i've heard it's going to be very different um but let's just take minnesota so we can actually dan's just smiling he's not going to talk about it but that's right that's right that's right um so we are looking at him that's right that's right let's see two as the as the uh sort of core example um so you know what v2 like i mentioned earlier is a pretty a very inefficient market maker right like most market makers don't need 100 million dollars on their balance sheet in order to make a market with pretty tight spreads especially if they have pretty strong priors or if they're able to hedge or they're able to do other things that allows them to lower their risk relative to something like uniswap so the problem with uniswap is that unisop doesn't know anything that's going on in the world right it basically has no signals no inputs into its pricing function besides just how much of an asset a do i have and how much of asset b do i have that's literally the only thing it knows when it decides what prices to quote right of course if you look at real market makers if you just have arbitrary levels of intelligence right what would you do well look at what real market makers do they like use machine learning and they look at liquidity and they model volatility and they do all this fancy stuff uh and they also like you know try to hedge so that they're not taking on momentary risk and they don't have to they don't really need as much balance sheet to absorb all of that uh of the you know trading if they're if things are going one way or another they can draw credit lines they can do all sorts of stuff right they have they have unlimited freedom to do whatever they want and so now it's obviously true that up until now d5 has been so small that professional market makers just really had no interest or like the the kinds of professional market makers who had interest in d5 were very very small and not very well capitalized um and they pretty much all traded on order book exchanges which also didn't have a lot of volume and so that you sort of had this like negative um this kind of death spiral that was happening in d5 market making where the order books were thin that didn't bring attractive market makers which led the order book being thin and it sort of was very difficult to break out of this trap now it's very clear that that has changed right retail is here retail is trading on d5 and the first thing that every market maker i've talked to has seen is like holy crap if if d5 is going to be the next frontier we want to be there because we can see look at all these profits that unit swap is making right all these profits that uniform is making is not because uniswap has some brilliant pricing advantage it's not because it's like way more gas efficient than any other way of providing liquidity the reason why is it's the only thing there it's the only place where you can actually get meaningful liquidity today what i argue is that once professional market makers set up shop which is non-trivial it's gonna take a bit of time because it's complicated and their regulatory hurdles and all this stuff but once they do uh they are going to out compete almost all amms that are pricing difficult to price assets right so difficult to price assets they mean things like you know eth ustc which is a complicated pair to trade right like you know you you couldn't trade that from your bedroom very effectively um if you're if you're trading things like stable coins or you know uh bitcoin different rap bitcoin things then that's pretty easy and you can use i think algorithmic marketing makers fairly effectively to uh you know capitalize on on uh fairly you know the hard part of that is inventory management it's not really pricing right but for something like ethe usdc uh i think you're going to end up getting much more competitive on-chain pricing because it's a very liquid market it's thing a lot of people want to buy and unisoft is going to get competed with by smarter leaner more intelligent uh actors and i don't think that algorithmic market makers are very well equipped right now to compete with those kinds of actors uh and when that happens right it's not just that uniswap sits there and it's like oh man i didn't get as much volume this month uh what happens is that liquidity providers are like wait crap this is a crappy deal now i'm not getting a whole lot of volume i'm not really getting any trades and instead what i'm getting is the only people who are trading with me is only when my pool is mispriced and that's when the market makers the professional market maker is like no i'm not going to do this trade that's crazy but unisof is like oh yeah sure x y equals k let's do it and what you're going to get is this sort of inverse scale effect where now suddenly uh you're getting this adverse selection where the only people trading with you are the people who are um who are basically getting uh good prices better prices than they're getting anywhere else uh and the professional market makers are actually getting the the uh sort of the majority of the retail volume as opposed to the arbitrage volume so that's my argument in a nutshell of why i think amms are going to recede from being the kind of core liquidity sources in d5 well and then what do you think will emerge i suspect what will emerge is a is a larger ecosystem of actors that looks more similar to what you see in in c5 so now what does that mean there are many different ways you can imagine this this playing out so in my blog post i sort of paint this picture of you know you can imagine a world where there's a really simple software stack that any market maker can deploy that basically you know pushes out a smart contract and an api endpoint that anybody can ping that api endpoint forget a price quote and then automatically submit it to an on-chain contract which prints the trade and so that contract kind of looks and feels like you know swap the the assets are all on chain it sort of has the same affordance to the end user right it's like whether i'm using uniswap or using this or using that like i don't really care all i want is a good price and if that's true you can imagine like a network of market makers from all over the world none of whom you have to trust you don't have to sign an agreement with them you don't get to know them all you got to do is just like make sure they have a standardized contract and take their api quote plug it in the contract and it prints the trade at the price that they give you and you can do that you can do that today it's actually not that hard but you know most of these market makers are not defined native so they haven't ramped up on any of this stuff yet uh and of course up until now there hasn't been any reason to so that's one vision of how this could play out i think there are obviously many others it could be that order book exchanges are becoming dominant uh it's it's hard to say in advance but what i can say is that i'm fairly confident that the landscape is going to change and that centralized market makers are going to play a larger and larger role in providing liquidity on chain and so will that then so so basically that you know as you said will be more like an order book decentralized exchange but then in terms of like the interface would that be something like one inch exchange or what would be the interface for that or or is it just something like 0x so i imagine there are going to be a lot of sort of front ends for d5 right like right now right now if you think about like what d5s like to use today right there's like 20 different protocols you like go on d5 pulse like see what the newest thing is and you like google it you look it up on twitter to see if it's real you you know do some trades with it you try to look up like you know uh what orders what what books they have what actual trading pairs they do it's a pain in the ass it's super complicated like this is not the way that defy is going to work at scale right not every user is going to have to underwrite every protocol and figure out which ones are real and which ones are not at some point there's going to be some like sort of almost like a brokerage experience which is sort of what aggregators are today they're sort of the closest thing to that brokerage experience but there are also things like you know in sedap or xerion or things like that that show you you know look you go to one place and you say hey i want to trade uh uscc for eth or i want to take out a loan or i want to do this thing right and i don't care about the brand i don't know what uniswap is i don't know what balancer is i don't know what any of these things are i don't care what they are all i want to do is like do the actual thing i want which is i want to buy something or i want to trade something i want to invest something right that's going to be what d5 looks like at scale to my mind and when that happens right now you know most of the users today are going directly to the protocols and maybe something like 20 30 percent are going to aggregators today and i think a lot of that is that people don't really know what these aggregators are it's pretty new and um you know they're it's pretty complicated to even express what's going on on a lot of these platforms right like it takes a podcast like this to even explain what even is uniswap to a lot of people who just have kind of heard the name and just know things are happening um but eventually you know a year from now two years from now three years from now it won't be quite as exotic to be like oh yeah i'm trading on d5 you know it's not that weird at that point i think there are going to be much simpler affordances that make it so that liquidity pools like balance or uniswap are not the front ends they're not the things that users are directly interacting with they're sort of like wholesale markets they sort of work on the back end they're somewhere in the supply chain of what users are doing but they're not they're not the place where users are directly going because they don't need to there's no reason why they would be committed to a you know a single front end if what they want to do is just to do the thing not the protocol yeah so i know dan is going to want to rebut that or i think but before he does that i actually just want to kind of help listeners along so when we're talking about aggregators think sort of you know like kayak or expedia for travel and that's just what places like one inch are doing for automated market makers they're just showing what is the best price across all the different dexes and then people can use that to to trade rather than just going to each individual one and comparing and i will also say that you know i think these ideas are kind of percolating because i did see jose maria macedo of delphi digital he wrote something about um you know comparing basically uh dexes to what he called airlines and then saying you know the aggregators are where this is gonna go and um and so in his view he was saying that dexes they need to focus on their supply side like on on um the liquidity providers because the retail the traders that's not going to be how they're going to differentiate themselves um which you know i i have that in the show notes his tweets torment and his articles on that if people want to look because it's pretty interesting but anyway so dan i know you disagree with the hussein's idea that order book dexes will dominate in the future especially like once we get to more high throughput chains um unlike ethereum 1.0 um so dan what what do you what do you think is going to happen yeah so so i think as i understand deceive's argument um it's that professional market makers who have my access right to much more detailed information and can do much more sophisticated strategies than an on-chain market maker um will essentially i'll compete you just swap and offer a tighter spread and therefore draw away the high quality volume um and i think my response to that primarily is an analogy and this is to look at um in 1974 what you might have said to somebody who thought that they could compete with active managers of money by simply buying all the stocks in a list and just holding them and this seemed like a crazy idea at the time um and it was compounded with another crazy idea which was of mutualization which was um like actually an actual mutual mutual fund that was owned by its investors um rather than having uh being publicly traded or being uh having sort of an independent management company and uh vanguard obviously founded around that time um now the second largest uh asset manager in the world and the largest mutual fund and i think that shows um some of the benefits of of simplicity and of of low costs so market makers professional market makers that is referring to here often have very high margins um they pay their they pay their employees a lot um they can often have a have a relatively higher cost of capital um and generally like when when they're they don't think it's it's worth it to get out of bed for basically the kind of profits that right now um uh people on enchant liquidity providers are willing to um to do and so uh i think the the advantage that automated liquidity providers have is that you can get much more capital deployed doing this strategy um by both uh by by sharing all the you know the equity benefits essentially of of investing in the strategy with all the with the uh liquidity providers and keeping sort of the overhead minimal um and by just making it as simple as one click just to uh survive to this and you don't have to you know diligence some particular market maker in there uh and their strategy and i think that's that's part of my my and this this is very speculative but that's part of my vision for how uniform could not only compete um in dexes um and for crypto trading but could potentially change the face of i think market making um across the financial industry so i the three three counters that i want to make to that um so the first is that sort of going in reverse order from some of the claims that you made so one is that i agree i don't think market makers are going to summon as much uh capital on chain but they don't need to right the whole point is that uniswap and it's like are very very capital inefficient relative to normal market makers because they have to be right like in the in uniswop we call inventory liquidity which is a really weird way of thinking about inventory right like normally for a market maker liquidity and inventory do totally different things um and you can provide liquidity with your entire inventory or not and uh you know unit swap sort of uses a very narrow band of its inventory to do most of its trading uh the second thing that i would say is that um you know if you believe that unit swap is not a scale sounds like you're also implying that d5 is going to grow really dramatically and so if the bet is that market makers aren't going to get out of bed for a market that's going to go dramatically then it's like look either d5 is going to grow really big and it's going to be an interesting pie for market makers to attack or it's or it's not it's going to stay small and i i think i agree with you or at least your prior claim that d5 is going to grow quite a bit in which case i think the the pie for market makers is going to be attractive enough for them to get out of bed and and to attack this this new market um and of course the thing is you don't need that many market makers to do this you know you don't need a jump or a tower or somebody really really huge uh in order to get somebody on chain who can now compete you know swap like you really only need one or two competitive market makers to get a really strong ecosystem going uh and then the the third point that i would make is that you know the point you're making about passive investing um sounds like a great bowl case for for a set protocol uh but i don't think it really describes what uniswap is because uniswap is is not a passive strategy it's actually an active strategy it's just a very simplistic abstract strategy of i will always quote x times y plus k and like of course you know if if that strategy is tremendously successful right like you could get a centralized market maker to do the exact same thing right like they do have the balance sheet if the aprs are as sustainable as they are somebody will absolutely deploy you know 230 million dollars to just put on on-chain uh capital pools and just start earning those trading fees right like if that if that's the thesis then then there's no reason in principle why uh uniswap and decentralized lps would capture the lion's share of that so all that being said i think i agree with you that uniswap has changed things and there's no there's no going back from i think the new ideas that uniswap has brought to the table um which i think were very difficult to anticipate in the beginning right i think incentivized pools and bootstrapping liquidity these are really really new phenomena that were theoretical before this and now it's like very very clear how it works and why it works and that you can't put you can't take the genie uh back in the bottle that said go ahead oh no go ahead finish i i was just wrapping up this that said i i don't think they are uh i don't think when you look at the the market share two years from now i don't think it's gonna look the same as it does today yeah well one thing i also wanted to ask about was this introduction of yield aggregators like your why earn finance which basically seeks out the highest yield from any kind of d5 product whether it's a lending protocol or an amm or a yield farming scheme and i just wonder do yield aggregators make it harder for amms to compete because it just sort of feels like right now people can sort of you know all flock to one or another very easily with just you know using y-iron and i just wondered like how does that even affect the ability for some of these ammons to survive i don't think it really affects them in a direct way in an indirect way it does potentially because it allows these big gigantic pools of capital to just like kind of fly around at a moment's notice and that's a little bit scary but um it's sort of like they were sort of doing that anyway even before you know why iron came around uh because lots and lots of whales were just sort of following the best liquidity mining awards and right now um it's pretty clear that liquidity mining is here to stay and i i don't think you can blame the giant pools of capital flying and flinging around left and right on why iron so much as the underlying thing that iron is uh responding to which is huge amounts of subsidies being paid out that primarily whales are capturing right now yeah i i think it's um i think it is an important development i think it's something that we all thought was was basically inevitable eventually which is that on-chain liquidity is going to be quite flighty um it's going to it's going to seek the highest yield and i think the the protocols that want to be sustainable sort of have to design around that fact and it's a good fact in many ways i mean it means that you can with you know with with uh some incentives for example to sort of summon a huge amount of liquidity that you wouldn't necessarily normally be able to um i do think it poses extra risks and like uh essentially almost any of these strategies are going to have some discretion by governance um about what kind of pools are safe to put money into and so i worry about about it from from that perspective um but i think it would be a great outcome if if essentially people can can just pool their liquidity as passively as possible and have it safely allocated to whatever on chain um is providing the best the best benefit okay so one other thing i wanted to ask about which is you know just a sort of a one-off it's like a little bit separate from everything we've been discussing is the crv token launch um which uh basically what happened there is that an anonymous developer supposedly not affiliated with curve so crv token is for curve uh the curve amm which is the one we were talking about it uh focuses on stable coins and um this anonymous person or supposedly anonymous person decided to launch the open source crv token contract and uh paid about eight thousand dollars in gas fees to do so but a lot of people were surmising that this was actually somebody who either was affiliated with the team or that it was somebody who um the team had orchestrated this with and i wondered you know what do you guys think happened there and what do you think this incident says about how ams might launch tokens going forward so i only know about it what i what i've read on twitter um and i it didn't seem to me that anybody had an extremely strong theory about who this person was or what they were doing i saw sort of a lot of a lot of speculation flying around about it um it is kind of a just a remarkable a remarkable fact um that this can be done and a sort of a weird fact about um about d5 and about how token launches have been going that whatever happened like if someone random actually had just deployed the contract and like scott and sufficient community momentum around it um i could see how the team wouldn't actually have a choice um and that's that's a very it's a very weird thing where yeah where protocols essentially are not are not under the control of their creators they're under control of whatever the community wants to and wants to say is this is the crv token that's the cfv token yeah i i think crypto has enough speculation so i try not to add to it personally but uh i i do think philosophically it's fascinating the idea that like the community itself just sort of decided which crv token is the crv token and um i i think this is like one of those things that will eventually show up in like a philosophy textbook someday of like you know what what makes the what makes the token like the the token of that community uh other than just people on twitter deciding that it is and then starting to trade it and give it a high price and and the team you know if in fact the story as told is correct that's kind of fascinating that you know they sort of were like it wasn't up to them which crv token ended up being the one that they had to sort of you know canonicalize as as the uh core part of their protocol all right and one other thing we touched on briefly was some of these initial defy offerings or initial dex offerings like the uma token launch where they just put a liquidity pool was it uma versus eth or what that's right yeah on uniswap and that garnered a fair amount of criticism at the time can you explain why that was and whether or not you think that means we will see like a lot more of those or or very few of those yeah so i would say um and i think uh most people agree uh uniswap is not a fantastic mechanism for initial price discovery certainly not if you put it if you put a huge amount of liquidity out there and so uh one metaphor here is too is to like initially don't put a huge amount of liquidity out there i'm saying the more liquidity you put the worse because um because essentially the initial market maker ends up selling a bunch of of uh uh whoever whoever is the initial liquidity right ends up selling a lot of tokens at a price that doesn't it isn't close to where it uh where it ends up um and so i think the i think you know so there's been some other experiments around this and i think uh you know people have done sort of like batch auctions yeah so the the one metaphor here is to um uh initial public offerings where there's a lot of criticism of banks from mispricing initial offerings so that there's a pop on the first day and that's you know to some extent an opportunity cost of the company um i think just initial price discovery is very hard and you don't want to necessarily sell too much at the at whatever initial price you said no matter how well you valued it uh yeah that said i think within you know in a matter of a matter of minutes um i think the in the um tokens case it was trading very close to uh to where i was trading the rest of the day um and so you will get price score you just may get it with some very weird trading prices at the beginning of the process yeah i think there's still some science to be done on exactly how initial price discovery should happen on d5 obviously you know um i think was the first to really do this and i i should note um as a portfolio company they were the first to do this and i think they got a lot of criticism for it but they really did kind of show that like hey here's probably what you should not do and here's what potentially goes wrong and then there were other teams that have sort of neglected that lesson and sort of did the same thing like bzx and a couple others um i think people are still playing around with like okay can we do some kind of batch auction like on matcha or gnosis or whatever there are other folks who are kind of coming up with other ideas but it's still sort of uncharted territory the other i think question that nobody really has a good answer to yet is how much float do you need out there on day one for there to be good price discovery just in terms of you know there being enough supply um so if you have like you know look at crv right crv was sort of linearly releasing crv tokens out for trading which led to this really ridiculous first day fully diluted price of like 45 billion dollars which made it worth more than ethereum uh and then you know it's slowly been ticking down as more and more supply has been more float has been coming on the market um and you know you saw the same things we've seen this lesson many many times in crypto with like zcash with grin that having this sort of effect where a tiny amount of float comes out on day one and it slowly linearly increases until at some point it stabilizes um it probably behooves tokens that are thinking about getting some kind of price stability on day one to try to make sure there's enough float out there initially for that uh for that price discovery to be uh useful um but i i don't think anybody has done a full you know uh a full uh postmortem on exactly what is what are the right parameters for a new token so fees on ethereum are extremely high right now in the last few days they were as high as almost seven dollars six dollars and sixty cents and at the time of recording they're still at two dollars and forty cents and obviously ethereum is still in the midst of this lengthy multi-phase transition to ethereum 2.0 so ethereum 2.0 is not going to be able to accommodate this kind of d5 activity for a while and meanwhile we are seeing that ftx is going to launch a dax called serum on the solana blockchain and the ftx founder sam thank manfred calls solana ten thousand times faster and one million times cheaper than ethereum and serum apparently will also be interoperable with ethereum so i wondered if you think and it's not even just about serum but i just wondered in general do you think that there's a real risk that the defy community or ecosystem could move to another blockchain i think my views on those are pretty close to haseebs and he explains it very well so i'll i'll let him answer what what are my views hold on with the wall street the wall street okay okay okay okay got it yeah um so my take here is that i think it at this point it's it's basically over in the sense that ethereum has already solidified itself as being the wall street of crypto right now there is a very real question they're like look manhattan is now crazy crowded the rents are insane like traffic congestion is just unthinkable and so if you're not a gazillionaire you probably don't live in manhattan anymore right but that doesn't mean that all the finance in the world is only going to live in manhattan right they're going to be like even with gas prices being as high as they are obviously they are this high because people are willing to pay these prices and those people are you know they're mostly uh whales and people who are trading in very high volume and so it's worth it to them to trade on these venues but eventually they're going to be other places that open up other venues that sort of become like you know the analogy that i've given before is like sort of come to chicago to ethereum's new york right there will be some second place with some kind of bridge whether it be a layer two whether it be you know an interoperability solution like polka dot or cosmos or whether it be another one there's going to be some second place where people can go and probably initially that place is going to service a lot of the lower expenses the lower expense transactions so like you know folks like you and me who aren't really looking to place you know ten thousand dollar trades uh on any given day we're going to be trading you know for like closer to one cent or five cent fees on these chains that don't have as much liquidity they aren't going to be as juicy they're not going to have as crazy yield farming but they're going to be places where at least in the early days we're going to start doing some of the normal stuff that we used to do on ethereum um and so i suspect that's that's the way you're going to see some specialization among chains for d5 is that there will be some chains where the really high value transactions take place and those chains will probably be more congested but then there'll be places where you know sort of lower uh lower value but higher throughput stuff can happen which will likely be offloaded to to the the newer uh places where d5 is going to migrate and and do you think that might be what what happens with serum i think serum is um is much more of a verticalized bet than i think what what i'm describing with some of these other chains um it's sort of like uh i think i think serum is kind of trying to king make solana right now where serum is like this big fat super impressive project that uh i think both solana and serum are betting that like okay this is gonna be like the big thing that makes that makes a lot of work because serum is gonna be so big and awesome and attracts so many users that it's going to cause this ecosystem around it and this was actually a big a big thesis that you know a lot of uh investors were entertaining back in 2017 was this idea that like okay yeah ethereum is kind of working for some stuff right but like when we really get the killer app that killer app is going to decide who wins because they're going to decide hey you know ethereum's too crowded it kind of sucks evm is painful we're going to go to this chain and then they're going to bring all their users right and in a way that's kind of like the story of the libra and the story of some of these other big things is that they're going to bring so many users that they're going to cause this ecosystem to either migrate or have a new parallel ecosystem develop around them whether that will happen we'll see i think it's i think it's tough i think that serum has a really really big lift ahead of them but if it works it could obviously be really really incredible i'm looking forward to the serum launch in part because um it's going to be an order base uh order book based dex and so this will sort of test the the question of whether order books um for decks uh work better if you eliminate the scaling constraints i don't think it's it's sufficient but it is necessary yeah well so we'll see what happens all right so uh let's now switch to predictions for just maybe i don't know the next few years and when you give your predictions for what will happen with amms i'd also be curious to know what you think will happen with centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and this is on what time scale predictions uh i just think maybe i don't know like three years three to five i guess so i will lay down in the market which is that i think i think uni swap v3 will be um a really viewed as a really significant development um and will change the amm landscape um and that's easy for me to say but um uh you could if if i ever come back on this podcast you can make fun of me if i was wrong well you know i probably will have to i'm joking um do you think uniform will still be the number one uh uh venue for trading in three years i think that's i think that's the way to bet um and i will make that back with you maybe offline all right all right we could do it on there too i think i think laura likes these things um i think i think i think most likely in part because i think they have they have a head start and also because i'm just generally extremely impressed by the innovation that's been going on with the team um and i think the uh the community at large um so that's one i do think we're gonna see um some highly specialized amms uh come out and i'm thinking especially of options um and maybe of stuff like prediction markets where you could see something that's very highly optimized for a particular um use case and so i think i think we'll see some of those but in my view i think you know unit swap um and especially with what it's got coming down the pipe be the lion's share volume let's see so my prediction um unfortunately i don't have any really exciting picture to paint but i think i think trading volume is going to continue to grow i think that uh dexes will eat more and more of centralized exchange volume and you'll continue to see this phenomenon that uh a lot of tokens especially if they're on ethereum are going to start trading on ethereum before they start trading on centralized exchanges which is going to continue to drive people into the front doors um i think that you're eventually going to get to a place where the the experience so one i think we're already starting to see this but you'll see it more and more of centralized exchange is starting to integrate defy and to basically offer some of these services uh directly in-house because of course like they want to be the front end of crypto too they see what's going on here and they realize it's a threat um and you know these guys aren't stupid and they've got big businesses to protect but i think that's going to be one thing that we see um and i could see in that sense like you know like we mentioned before sort of d5 becoming almost like this this back end to the services that that people actually directly interface with and it might be that people still end up trusting exchanges and spending a lot of their time there but as exchanges are get more regulated or get more onerous or just get more annoying or you know are sort of too overprotective of their customers um those customers might choose to go direct and if they do they'll go natively on defined and they'll do all the crazy stuff that dan and i are talking about um i do think that a few years from now it won't be that weird too for people to be trading on d5 i think it'll be you know it'll it'll still not be like your mom but it'll be like your smart tech friends who will all be you know they just won't be that hard you'll tell them like hey just use this app like it or use this website it's like pretty good it like you know make sure that you don't touch any of the weird stuff and it like you know it'll route your orders to the right place and you're not going to shoot yourself in the foot right and that's most of what people need in order to navigate defy so i suspect that things are really only going to become easier and easier to use and that's that's the thing about technology is that centralized exchanges we kind of already know what they are you know there's not that much more room for innovation other than just adding more products or making making the things slightly smoother d5 has so much to go and the thing about technology is that it only ever gets better and that's that's the scary thing is that it's it's it's difficult to put a cap on like how good d5 is going to get it's hard to know and right now defy is only the only thing happening in d5 pretty much uh is is spot trading and of course we already know spot trading is a tiny portion of all the trading in crypto and so i think that's going to change as well but that's going to also take some time all right well we will see what happens all right where can people learn more
