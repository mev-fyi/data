onjuno app today today's guest is andy beal head of ecosystem development at florida and author of the 30 000 feet newsletter welcome andy hey laura thanks for having me everyone's been a buzz about the drama with a smart contract blockchain in cosmos called juno which launched in october and this saga involves a big whale in that ecosystem tell us what happened in the beginning it all started with juno's airdrop give us the context of what happened at that time yeah so the the the background for the story actually started in the fall of last year so juno like a lot of uh new projects in the cosmos ecosystem announced a what they call a state drop which is where they airdrop tokens to existing wallets that are staking atoms and it also applied to um it also applied to wallets that were providing liquidity into into osmosis too but wallets that have a you know some sort of locked stake in the in the ecosystem that juno's uh building on top of and this was a very it was a very generous airdrop it was a one for one so if you had 10 000 atoms staked in your wallet you would get 10 000 juno airdropped to you and the team very sort of wisely imposed a whale cap of 50 000 so even if you have a hundred thousand atoms staked in your wallet you were only going to get 50 000 juno that was the absolute maximum per person per entity because they wanted to ensure a healthy distribution of the token which is a pretty reasonable concern for any core team to have when they're you know when they're thinking about token distribution in launch now the snapshot for that was taken back in february of last year so you know seven months before the airdrop actually happened in october the juno team took a snapshot of all the wallets that were currently staking atoms and providing liquidity into into osmosis and so you had to have your atoms staked as of february shortly after the air drop the juno core team and the community saw a group of wallets 52 in total i believe consolidate airdropped juno tokens into one address and the majority of these 52 wallets had received the maximum 50 000 juno so they they had they had received up to the the whale cap and in total this consolidated wallet had two and a half million juno an order of magnitude you know above what was what the team intended to give to uh you know to any single individual or or and or entity and so they realized that you know there was a massive whale now in their ecosystem that that controlled a large portion of the token supply and so two issues off the bat right one it violates the spirit of the airdrop because they had very explicitly imposed a cap and the cap was known it also poses some real risks to the network especially if this whale doesn't have the best interest of the of the network at heart right they control a significant amount of token supply that impacts their that impacts their voting power they also control a lot of liquidity they can delegate their stake and and centralize the network so there's a lot of you know very reasonable concerns that uh the the juno core team and community were immediately immediately worried about so in october when they they realized this the community reacted pretty quickly and within a matter of days had had put together a governance proposal and this was this is proposal number four but we can call it you know the first proposal for you know for purposes of this discussion and that proposal was seeking to confiscate 90 of these whales tokens and then send them to a community pool and this was you know this was the community's attempt to sort of you know get back to neutral that's such an unusual step was that controversial at all or was the consensus just that what this whale had done was so egregious and had basically cheated and flouted the rules that that was what they had to do or kind of what was the talk at that time about that potential decision so based on the community discussion on the on the forums and and you know over other social media channels it it it seemed like the just the existence of the whale and you know any single person or entity having that significant stake in the network is just this um it's it poses this existential threat right there's always this thing behind your behind your shoulder right that could start to impact things liquidity voting centralization etc and so i think the community just just wanted to deal with this otherwise you know it's a risk that that's always out there that you're always worrying about yeah like a ticking time bomb type thing exactly exactly and you also have to think about you know do we need to continuously sort of appease this whale to make sure that they're happy and they don't do anything to negatively impact the network too right so so maybe you start to you know cater your decision making as a community to make this one large token holder happy right which you don't want so the first time the juno community tried to resolve this the whale issue they wanted to confiscate and reclaim 90 of the tokens they were going to put those into a community fund and the discussion around this was you know did the whale intentionally gain the airdrop that was one that was one consideration and then there was part of the community that you know irrespective of whether they intentionally did it or not right it violated the spirit of the airdrop and you know they they essentially came into an amount of tokens that they should never have come into right once this proposal was was posted the whale actually reached out to the juno team and explained their position and so at the time what the community learned was that the whale was actually not an individual it was a fund or a platform that was holding adams and now juno on behalf of their clients or users they had distributed all the tokens across you know these 52 wallets largely for security purposes and and so you know if you were confiscating funds you weren't actually just confiscating the whales funds you were actually confiscating their users clients funds and they also tried to assuage the you know the the concerns of the community at the time by letting everyone know that you know they they had no intention of threatening you know centralization and they had the best interest of the network at heart and you know in october i think those the arguments that the whale was was putting forth i think the community was buying and so for a period of time they were comfortable with the fact that the whale was a was going to be a positive impact on the you know on the juno ecosystem and was going to throw their weight around like they like they could and a couple of weeks ago the situation changed so what happened that then prompted the community to kind of revisit this idea of taking the whales tokens fast forward six months from october to march now 2022 and up until this point the whale has been has has followed through on their promise to the community to respect decentralization you know and largely be sort of a passive sort of member of the community in march though the behavior starts to change and the community sees that the whale is now starting to sell on a daily basis they're staking rewards now for any other person you know this doesn't raise a red of red flag but because the whale is earning such a large percentage of the daily staking rewards i think their their rewards were half a million dollars a day for a relatively new project like juno that doesn't have you know deep liquidity across the ecosystem this is a lot of cell pressure on the market and you know the the community would have liked to see that the whale continue to restake their their assets right that would be a great signal that they were you know invested in the long-term success of juneau as opposed to just short-term short-term gains right so in a moment we're going to talk about what the community decided to do at this point in time but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 10 million people using crypto.com the easiest place to buy earn and spend over 150

receive 40 usdc that's try d5 dot cc slash unc back to my conversation with andy so we're in this situation where suddenly the community realizes okay the impact of this wheel is a negative one so what do they decide to do at that point so the community quickly mobilizes and all the fears from october come back and they decide to kind of revisit the proposal for this is now called prop 16 so if you're if you're looking for this in the forums or online for more information juno prop 16 is proposed and similar terms to the original proposal except this time they want to not confiscate 90 they want to confiscate all the whales assets except for 50 000 so they want to leave the the whale with the original 50k uh whale cap this is now 98.5 of the whales assets um and the interesting thing about this too is that from october to march the price of juno has gone from you know say an average of seven to ten dollars up to forty to forty five dollars right so the the whale's financial stake in the network is now roughly 140 million dollars so a significant amount of of money now you know this obviously raises the stakes of the of the the community's decision uh here and also for those listening to it it raises some really interesting questions right the first one is just why can't the whale sell immediately if they know that the community is going to vote to confiscate their funds and the answer to that one is that they are currently staking their assets and there's a 28-day unbonding period in juneau and so or unstaking period and so they are locked up for four weeks and so that's the window of opportunity that the tuna community has to issue a proposal vote on it and then remediate the the situation so there's a shot clock component here which is somewhat unique to these situations the other interesting question is can't the whale throw their voting weight around to influence the vote here and get the outcome that they want yes but they don't they don't control enough to push through a vote or in this case you know to um to vote down this proposal by themselves and then the third question is you know practically how does a how does a community seize tokens from you know a an individual wallet you know the obvious way to do it is with a hard fork and we can get into that a little bit later when we talk about what the community is doing to to actually affect this change after five days of you know pretty contentious discussion on um forums prop 16 is approved by the juno community and it interestingly i think this is something that i'd love to talk with you about laura props 16 was just a text proposal so it was it was i it was a the community was sort of agreeing to a concept about what to do but it wasn't it wasn't a software proposal that could be immediately implemented so now that the text proposal is approved now the community needs to decide how do we actually affect this change that the community voted yes for and it's opened the door to a bunch of other discussions and alternative uh proposals so but is a hard fork one of them and why don't you give us a quick overview of what those options would be so there's three sort of implementation proposals uh right now one is is very much in line with sort of the original intention of prop 16 so they want to immediately un-delegate and unstake the whale's assets and then they would burn them they would send them to an address you know with a contract address of zero and and burn them so they the tokens would be effectively out of circulation the second proposal which is actually was put together by the core team at juno is a slight deviation from that plan which would actually put the whale's assets into an escrow account that both the whale and the community would control so you can think about this like a multi-sig and the funds would sit in that escrow account until all parties could agree on what to do with those assets so this is sort of a it's a plan to delay the decision about what to do with the assets do we give them back to the community do we burn them but we want to take them out of the hands of the whale in the meantime put them in a you know a neutral escrow account the third proposal is actually from the the whale themselves and they they actually proposed an amended version of the the core teams that i just went through that had the escrow component because they want to maintain the right to vote in the meantime so while the assets while their confiscated assets sit in an escrow account they want to maintain the ability to vote and the reason they're asking for that right is so that it puts pressure on the community to actually push for a resolution rather than just locking up the s locking up the phones in escrow in perpetuity and just sitting on their hands and not doing anything right which is which is effectively the same thing as burning the tokens right right so at the moment where is the community leaning and also i realized we didn't really go into who this wheel is so can you also give that context without sharing any names then you know the i think the whale has has shared their name online they claim to be a an exchange or a platform that has that you know that holds assets for their users though and if my memory serves me correctly you know they claim to have over 30 000 users and so that's another interesting element to this you know you have to ask yourself the question are you are you confiscating an entity's assets or are you confiscating you know assets that are collectively owned by 30 000 people some of which just may be ordinary retail traders who are expecting these these juno tokens right and really haven't been involved in the process weren't responsible for gaming the airdrop weren't responsible for how you know the original atoms were delegated delegated across wallets right so you don't want to you don't want to unintentionally harm them either and and why wouldn't you just name them if they've named themselves online i don't understand that's public information so we can freely discuss it here are you saying that there's a question about whether or not that's accurate or or what's your concern no no no i'll be honest i can i can i can look it up i don't have the i don't have the name memorized yeah that's all that's all oh okay it's ccn yep okay got it but then um so at the moment which way are people leaning out of the three options so there seems to be a lot of support behind the core team's proposal which is a you know it has both validator support core dev support and you know support from the community this is the escrow account proposal and i think there's acknowledgement that you know this prop 16 was done pretty hastily there was obviously you know a lot of urgency here and so i don't think anyone you know is is angry that it moved as fast as it did but at the same time this is a sensitive issue and you want to you want to come to a sort of thoughtful you know resolution and so if the escrow account model gives the community and the whale more time to you know come to a come to consensus then there's a there's a large part of the juno community that is supportive of that they are not supportive of giving the whale the right to continue voting their stake while it's in escrow right because they still they still can control decisions and then you have your your your purists of the juno community that that want to respect sort of the the letter of the law that was stated in prop 16 which is we're going to confiscate and burn these assets and we only want to consider remediation plans that confiscate and burn these assets so not in favor of the escrow account my prediction is that the the the escrow account model will get approved but um we don't have a formal proposal submitted for a vote just yet and so what are your big takeaways for blockchains facing similar issues in the future you know what do you think juno could have done differently with its airdrop like how do you think this whale ccn could have handled the situation better what are your thoughts on all that it's a good lesson for teams that are considering airdrops and mechanisms for that you know the original sort of justification for the whale distributing their assets across different wallets is a is a reasonable one and one that you see a lot of larger platforms take so you know to the extent that this really is an exchange or a custodian or some other you know trading platform that does have 30 000 users and and are holding assets yeah you know for them expecting those types of investors to pool all their assets into a single wallet obviously um you know isn't isn't reasonable so there's always going to be this there's always going to be the the possibility right that there's a a single entity that controls multiple multiple addresses what you can do and this might not be the most popular approach but you can impose more strict you know kyc processes as part of the claiming process of the the stake drop um so when you're proving who you are and that you have control of the of the wallets you know juno could have asked the the entity that controls the wallet for more information about themselves right and that way you could you could start to piece together okay this particular entity controls 52 wallets that amount to you know two and a half million cosmos in this cop or atoms in this case right that's one way to do it right you can impose some other impose some other requirements in the in the claiming slash kyc process you know you can also think about um you know just your your caps this was a very generous airdrop one to one and you know you can you can obviously play with that amount lowered if you wanted to right to ensure you know that that's it that's that's sort of a that's a fail-safe way of doing it right i expect a lot of teams particularly in the cosmos ecosystem that are very regularly doing these state drop type of airdrops we'll experiment with different mechanics both on like the distribution side and then on the claiming process side and the kyc side to try and prevent this i think it's also interesting to point out too and this is another topic we can chat about this whale was not the only entity that received more than 50 000 they just happened to be the largest recipient of juno and and by by a long shot right so they attracted the majority of the scrutiny but i think there was roughly a dozen addresses that you know received more than the amount for for different reasons and so there is a question you know should corrective action here just be taken against the whale or should we also apply that treatment you know evenly across these other 10 or 12 addresses that received more than their you know more than their fair share yeah yeah i feel like this idea about cheating in blockchains is one that needs to be addressed because clearly if people are you know violating the law in these communities i mean that was one thing when somebody asked me what i thought of this obviously it it seems like a very extreme idea to take such a huge percentage of tokens from somebody and yet at the same time well you know if you flout the rules then like what are you gonna expect so well this has been such a fascinating conversation i mean it just raises so many questions and i think it's something that a lot of dows in the future are going to have to grapple with so i really appreciate that you explained all the ins and outs thank you so much for coming on the show thanks for having me laura i appreciate it don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break there's been a
