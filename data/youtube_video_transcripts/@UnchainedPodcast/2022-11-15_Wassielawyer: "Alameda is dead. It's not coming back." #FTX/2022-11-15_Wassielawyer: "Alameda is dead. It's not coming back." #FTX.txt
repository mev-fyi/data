let's just assume there's five billion dollars that's owing from Alameda to FTX right and what what needs to happen is that that position needs to be Unwound and the Alameda needs to pay five billion dollars back to FDX now the question is whether Alameda has five billion dollars paid back to FTX if it did we wouldn't be in the spot of Border because Alameda would just hand over 5 billion dollars of cash and FTX would hand it back to you know its customers the thing is Alameda is stuck in some very questionable and very illiquid assets which is making it very difficult you know to to to to to pay back on that loan I mean personally my thinking as I sort of shared a couple of times is that at some point a voyager like deal sort of makes sense uh makes makes sense uh um for someone to come and take out FTX and then sort of seek to liquidate Alameda because I think Alameda is dead it's gone it's not coming back
