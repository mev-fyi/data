hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the show that reveals how the marquee names in crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines and gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon i'm your

offsetra and carbon.fyi welcome brendan hey thanks for having me since i run a crypto show it's a bit unusual for me to have a guest from the environmental world so brendan why don't you tell us a bit about yourself the sites you founded and how they intersect with crypto i've actually got kind of a strange background so my my academic backgrounds in environmental studies for my bachelor's got a master's in environmental governance a couple years ago and that's where i actually met some of the co-founders of offsetra but uh in the last couple years i've gotten really heavy into coding web development building tools and products and so that's where all my energy has really been and um this whole crypto thing really took off for us in the last let's say three months we've all been kind of watching the crypto space and uh you know dabbled in trading and some of my colleagues have bought some nfts and we've been excited by it but then we really saw the connection between energy consumption and what we're interested in which is climate change carbon offsetting things like that and so we set out to create to create some tools and see what we could do we made carbon fyi we launched a prototype a couple weeks ago and essentially what it is it's a tool that lets you put in an ethereum address and then see how much carbon emissions are associated with that address and it's been pretty crazy the last couple of weeks we're getting a lot more shares than we ever expected a lot more questions people are reaching out to us and it's been really fun and can i ask how many queries you're getting a day roughly or what the growth has been in that i think yesterday we were pushing like 600 uh page views so i know an internet scale that's small but it's huge for us and we're actually seeing a lot of people offsetting as well which is which we feel feel really good about we could talk more about that later i guess that's interesting i mean to be honest as i watch the crypto community and um their feelings around the environmental issue um it seems you know a lot of people tend to be kind of like more defensive or um you know they they say oh it's using renewable energy and things like that so um it doesn't surprise me frankly that the numbers are small because i i think a lot of them maybe would rather not think about it or they think it's not a problem um but so why don't we talk about the nft issue um i'm sure listeners will know that there's this huge craze around non-fungible tokens or nfts with everyone from kings of leon to grimes to taco bell to the nba minting nfts and selling them to fans but now we're kind of getting a lot of normies who are also interested in nft somebody that i mean non-crypto folks and along with that came this backlash where on monday art station and online art platform announced an nft program but they had to cancel it within hours due to objections over the environmental impact so brendan do you want to maybe describe a little bit more what happened with art station and you know your sense of whether these people were right to object you know what exactly are the what exactly is the environment impact of nfts like just how bad is it the the whole thing happened so quickly um so i think art station heard about off such a through our calculator and they actually reached out to us and they what they they had been working on this prototype for those who don't know our station is like i think they brand themselves as like a portfolio tool or platform for artists to put to publish their art and share it with the world and so they wanted to expand that and offer nft minting on the ethereum blockchain and i assume they've been working on this for a long time but they reached out to us pretty last minute right before their launch and thought we would make a good partner they saw some of the partnerships we've done with other artists and platforms and thought um it's a good way to address the concerns people have with with the carbon footprint thanks to you know calculators like ours so they they and they made their announcement and we were excited but twitter wasn't and there was kind of a pretty heavy backlash um we could talk about where i think that's really coming from um whether or not it's warranted um there's been a lot of discussion going on i mean i would like to hear yeah where is it coming from and do you think it is warranted like yeah i would like to know some numbers around the environmental impacts of nfts there have been there's one other calculator that's been being shared even more than ours if we're getting like 600 hits a day they're probably they must be getting several thousand and especially in the nft community it's cryptoart.wtf made by an artist named uh memo actin pronounce it and his calculators focus specifically on nfts and the thing about nfts is they they consume quite a bit more gas than your average ethereum transaction so the act of minting an nft is pretty expensive in terms of ethereum gas and we derive our carbon footprint from that gas number so the the grand total is actually pretty shocking it's like 10 times more than your average transaction so i think uh people are seeing numbers like 700 kilowatt hours which is equivalent to what i wish i had the numbers written down i want to say we're talking half a ton of carbon okay here's a good a good comparison we're seeing numbers like air miles traveled on the order of hundreds we're seeing some contracts if you put in a contract you'll see it would it would take the average european like several years worth of carbon emissions to reach those numbers so people are shocked by that but there's some kind of misconceptions that i want to clear up i think people when they see those numbers they assume that the act of minting that nft sort of directly burned that energy and directly emitted that carbon but one thing i've been trying to really help people understand is that isn't the case and what the point of our calculators are to assign responsibility for emissions but not it doesn't necessarily um tell us what the solutions are in terms of actually reducing emissions when you say that and that's not actually the case that what the calculator says is being emitted is what is actually emitted why is that is it that there are certain assumptions that are made or is it that you don't know what the kind of renewable energy mix is of the electricity that was used or like what accounts for that i think you have to kind of start from the beginning at how where the emissions come from so they really come from mining um and mining is you know people plugging in their computers and solving the proof-of-work algorithm and that that computation the proof-of-work computation it happens regardless of what is in the block regardless of what transactions are happening in the network and you think of it if you were a miner you know your decision to plug in your computer or not really doesn't have anything to do with who's minting nfts it has to do with the price of ethereum and the speculative future value of ethereum you know do i think this asset is going to increase in value in the next years or whatever so people are forming the connection between you know their share of emissions which we've calculated by dividing the total network emissions and then allocating them to the users you know the people who benefit from the network but they're extrapolating that i think it's an easy mistake to make and they think you know if i don't met this nft then i won't emit these emissions i think this ties back into the backlash that we saw with our station people thought that art station offering the service to to their users was going to you know dramatically increase the amount of carbon emissions being put out for each nft but that really isn't the case and i think that uh we we at at least that at least i would like to distance myself from that sort of narrative that people are pushing you know that especially shaming artists who are publishing nfts on ethereum or other proof-of-work blockchains you know shaming the developers who are building on these blockchains i don't think that's the right approach and i don't think that's going to reduce emissions so in a moment well let's we'll dive a little bit more into what exactly those numbers represent but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible with over 10 million users crypto.com is the easiest place to buy and sell over 90

using the code laura the link is in the description back to my conversation with brendan mcgill so just so i understand what you're saying is that the miners will produce new blocks on the blockchain no matter what um and so the environmental impact will happen no matter what however i think can't the point be made that if the more that you create nfts the more of that block space will be allocated to nfts and the more that will crowd out other transactions that might have happened um that in that sense it is producing emissions right so i i don't know if i fully understand what your what nuance you're making there because there's if there's a finite amount of block space in every block then the more one thing crowns out another like yeah just kind of the more stuff will be filling every single block so yeah absolutely i mean um the big there is a connection i should clarify that there's definitely connection between you the mentor of an nft or or you know the transactor on the ethereum blockchain and the demand for the token which increases its value and then the incentive for mining and the other connection there aside from the value of ethereum is uh the block reward that miners get a portion of that comes straight from gas fees so of course if you have more and more people minting nfts and the blocks are so crowded that gas fees are shooting up which we see which we've been seeing all year then there's yeah there's more incentive to mine and so more miners join the network but again the reason i i i've i'm so focused on these nuances um up front because i don't think that necessarily means we should be attacking artists and developers are using these tools and i especially don't want people to think that that's going to be productive and that's going to reduce emissions and the reason for that is nfts are a really small portion of all transactions even though they're expensive transactions they're a really tiny portion i i don't know several percent at most like three percent most for from the numbers i've seen the demand is coming from trading and speculators and i assume defy the the d5 explosion has something to do with it so this obsession with um maybe again this only exists on twitter or and like a really vocal minority of people but this backlash was really unfair i felt like and i did feel a little bit responsible for that and i've been in a lot of discussions with memo and you know talking about the language he uses on his calculator because we want people to understand that yes this is your share of emissions as a benefactor you know this energy is being burned by miners but that doesn't mean we should assign miners the burden of emissions right um everyone should really pay a fair share if they can especially when you're talking about offsetting emissions or you know offsetting historical emissions so that's sort of the rationale there and there's this distinction i want people to understand you know this we can talk about solutions which is decarbonizing proof of work or moving to proof of stake but i think attacking artists and attacking developers like art stage and projects like our station is not productive so i'm glad i have the chance to uh you know say my piece on that here yeah it's a surprising stance from somebody who created off cetera and carbon.fyi but um i i understand where you're coming from uh given what you've just said so one other thing i was curious about is and and this is something i have been trying to figure out i feel like for quite a while is it possible to calculate how much of the um energy that miners use comes from clean energy versus something like coal or something that's less environmentally friendly it's really difficult to do and so there's big assumptions written into you know any study or any calculator out there including ours we make sure to highlight those in our methodology documents so we don't really you know we see a lot of uh articles on cryptocurrency uh news outlets that are saying that the majority i think the majority of energy use for mining is renewable and we haven't seen any evidence for that i mean the best numbers we've seen are 70 is fossil fuels and one thing we've we've done that no other calculator has done is we've tried to look at every single mining pool and look at their geographic location and then figure out the energy mix of that area so there's still some generalizations in there like i think about 50 percent of mining pools we can't we can't really pin down um or it wouldn't be fair to say they're in a given location so we use global average energy mix for those and then we try to be conservative as well with our assumptions so wait meaning toward the side of using like less clean energy you mean or towards more clear towards towards the assumption that fossil fuels tend to be the cheapest and so we think it's if we're not sure well it's probably fossil fuels okay um i would i would clarify i uh i think people should read our methodology we go into more a lot more depth in that and uh i've only played a small part in that establishing that methodology so i hope i'm not messing up making my colleagues mad right now okay well clearly i think that this is going to be an even bigger issue i would say going forward so um i'm sure there will be plenty more discussion around methodologies and and basically what the facts are this is as i said something i've been trying to figure out for a while there's this movement to um creating kind of like clean nfts what are the methods that people are interested in uh in that community are they mostly just interested in switching away from proof of work blockchains or or do they have other ideas around how to create clean nfts yeah that's been a really fun discussion we've been really involved in that there's been a discord server that popped up i don't i don't know who the original creators were i know an artist named sutu's been heavily involved and a bunch of others and it's blown up to like over a thousand users in just a couple weeks and so that's where we're having these discussions like what what can we actually do as artists as creators as developers and i'm seeing kind of two real paths forward the first is it's for artists who don't who regardless of the actual relationship between them and emissions they don't feel comfortable being associated with that sort of proof-of-work energy consumption so they're saying i don't want to be a part of this you know even if it makes no difference whether i come or go um i don't want that tied to my art and it's not my message and so they're looking for proof of stake platforms and there's been some awesome work memos put together a really nice guide which you can find through his calculator that lists all the kind of options that are out there wait which calculator is this the cryptoart.wtf calculator yeah so he's got a really nice guide that artists have found really helpful and we're seeing more and more artists start to mint on those alternative platforms they were there was some hesitation because ethereum is kind of where it's happening right now and um you know nfts are forever so there's some concern if i'm an artist and i'm publishing on a platform that's unproven or that no one's using but my art's probably not going to sell for his hive of price and you know what happens when ethereum 2 comes out and goes proof of stake now is my nfc going to be worthless well those are a risk that some artists are willing to take and i really respect that so they're sort of paving this path forward and on the other hand there's a lot of people who aren't willing to take those risks and they're staying with ethereum even despite the association that's going on with energy consumption so with them we've been really excited about the opportunity to offset emissions so we've been doing partnerships with artists who are publishing on ethereum and they're making up for their impact but they're also making up like hundreds of times over so really raising serious money for pro climate projects and we've we've offset one artist the guy really started all this sven everyone he offset like a thousand tons embedded in uh nft and sold it just day before yesterday trevor jones offset 600 tons as part of this ongoing project he's been doing and just for for reference that's there i think it's 35 000 ethereum transactions offset so you know really covering uh their impact and more and when you say 35 000 ethereum transactions offset that was all what was contained within that artwork right so 600 tons would cover for the emissions associated with 35 000 transactions well and earlier when you were talking about the proof-of-stake blockchains that some artists are choosing to go to which ones are they tending to pick i've been seeing a lot of i can't even pronounce it's a latin word um hetech nunc i think it's pronounced i'm only going to know this one i'm gonna have to link and i've never heard of it either until recently but um they've been making some sales on there just a quick note to say here that brendan messaged after we recorded to say that he misspoke that hic at nunc is not a blockchain but actually an nft platform on the test blockchain i'm not super into the uh nft art world so i think i'd have to defer you and your listeners to the to the guide that memo has posted okay i will i will link to all that in the show notes and i'll look up this blockchain and i mean i guess you know i know so obviously nba top shot is on flow which is a proof-of-stake network is that something that you know these artists these artists interested in nfts are interested in i couldn't say uh i really couldn't you know i was kind of sucked into this nft world without without wanting to be it's been awesome but uh yeah i don't want to speak on behalf of artists there's some awesome conversations going on and people are really taking it upon themselves to figure out like what's the best path so all right okay well clearly there is more to be mined here excuse the pun yeah um all right well thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed sure thanks for having me don't forget next up is the weekly news recap heads up everyone before we get into the news recap i wanted to mention that when we did the show last month all about crypto taxes for 2020 i asked about taxes on nfts but i asked only about nfts for creators i neglected to ask about taxes on nfts for investors i reached back out to one of our guests shihan chandrasekhra of cointracker who graciously wrote up a quick explanation of how nfts get taxed for nft investors to briefly recap how nft creators get taxed he writes quote creators get taxed at the time they sell nfts say sam created an nft artwork and sold it for two eth valued at two thousand dollars he would report two thousand dollars as ordinary income if he's in the business of creating nfts he can also deduct business related expenses to reduce the tax bill and so as for nft investors this is what she han had to say about how they'll be taxed investors are individuals who buy and sell nfts for speculative purposes most people fall into this category for investors taxes work very similar to crypto trading there's a taxable event whenever you sell an nft into cash or another cryptocurrency profits are subject to capital gains tax rules say sally purchased an nft for two eth worth four thousand dollars in january 2021. if she were to sell this nft for ten thousand dollars in march 2021 with a holding period of less than 12 months she would have a short-term capital gain of six thousand dollars and this six thousand dollars would be subject to her ordinary income tax rate if she were to sell this nft for ten thousand dollars after holding it for more than 12 months say in march 2022 the profit of six thousand dollars would be subject to more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates one interesting item to know is that some nfts could fall under the definition of collectibles under the irs rules the maximum long-term capital gains tax rate for collectibles is 28 the maximum long-term capital gains for crypto non-collectible nfts is 20 all right now time for the news recap first headline christy's auction house sells an nft for 69 million dollars on thursday a digital artwork representing the first 5000 days of digital art created by artist mike winkelmann aka beeple was sold for 60.25 million dollars at christie's in new york with the buyer's premium for purchasing an ethe the total comes out to 69 million dollars in case you missed it be sure to check out the unconfirmed episode with mike last fall when he first made 3.5 million dollars from his digital art crypto twitter was aghast when it first thought that justin sun the founder of tron was the buyer blockchain consultant maya zahavi tweeted why did it have to be justin's son it's way too predictable and in the worst way possible however the story took a turn later when coindesk reported that justin son was actually not the winning bidder when i tweeted about this olie chan tweeted back at me craig wright has entered the chat another good guess was from a twitter user named mike with the handle 4k tv who suggested chamath paula hapatia the billionaire was the buyer i guess we will find out later the bidding for every day is the first 5000 days a mosaic of every image that winkelmann has made since 2013 opened at 100 on february 25th and was pushed to 1 million in under 20 minutes with only three of the bidders previously known to christie's an hour before the sale closed the online bids were sitting at around 14 million dollars until they jumped from 22 million to 35 million before closing at a startling 60.25 million in a sale that is nearly unprecedented in modern auction history every days is now the third most expensive

asset has been accepted in an ethereum network upgrade and will go live in conjunction with the london hard fork this coming july or august the proposal will change blockchain transactions on ethereum so that a portion of the gas fee is burned in each transaction potentially reducing the total supply of eth while eip-1559 may sound exciting for eth holders and application builders a majority of ethereum miners reportedly over 60 of the network's hash power oppose eip-1559 as it effectively reduces minor revenue stream miners however have few options to stop eip-1559 outside of a hostile 51 attack which is a highly unlikely attack vector given the lack of economic incentives now that the proposal is approved the reduction in minor compensation may lead to a rise in the implementation of minor extractable value software which takes advantage of a miner's ability to front run trades and the block it is currently securing given miner's opposition it will be interesting to see how the ethereum community handles the contentious proposal though therapeutic crypto researcher hasu thinks that eip1559 will not be the issue that forces miners to fork the network he tweeted quote miners

has recently published two crypto related shows this week he held on vitalik buterin and vol robicon to discuss ethereum scaling plans nfts and more one of the more interesting moments of the show was when vitalik said he thought there was some chance that some members of the ethereum community such as miners and perhaps some people who don't want to take the risks of moving over to a proof of stake platform will stay on ethereum one instead of moving over to ethereum two also in february tim interviewed catherine hahn general partner at a16z crypto but her time prosecuting crimes involving the dark web and some rogue federal agents plus she discusses nfts in a high highly accessible way to a mainstream audience i very much recommend both shows and think that tim is doing a great job
