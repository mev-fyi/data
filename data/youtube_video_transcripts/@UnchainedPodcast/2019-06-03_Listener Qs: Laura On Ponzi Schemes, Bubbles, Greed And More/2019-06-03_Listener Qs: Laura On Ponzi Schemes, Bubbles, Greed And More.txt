its clients with attractive and persuasive branding websites and marketing materials spark interest in your project generate buzz check out think on-ramp calm for today's episode I'm taking reader questions thank you to all of you for submitting so many fantastic questions I do not have time to get to them all unfortunately some of them would actually take me quite a bit of time to report like the question about applications of blockchain technology in space and CubeSat constellation monitoring like I would need even Google what that is so for certain questions I was not able to do the research beforehand I have been completely swamped with this cover package but I did select a bunch that I can answer easily without without having to do too much research and I'm gonna try to get to as many of as I can today all right so the first one is from Christoph I'm really thinking I should have asked some of these readers how to pronounce their names Christoph Nadel may be from Denmark he asked me what was my motivation to start Unchained okay so when I started it last year roughly a year ago I've been covering it for a year and I could see that there was more demand to learn about blockchain technology generally and about crypto as well I had also seen that a whole bunch of really big companies like you know Microsoft and Deloitte and IBM and you know just like these huge companies were were pursuing blotching and not only even technology companies but you know companies and other industries were realizing that this technology could help them as well you know like speaking of space technology as I mentioned before you know I have seen I think like DARPA put out some kind of RFP regarding stuff like that and you know I saw health companies were starting the interest in it so I started thinking hey you know there's probably employees at these big companies that are going to be interested in learning more about this technology and I had also noticed that in my own articles about Bitcoin people were interested in investing in it and so actually this is another early episode that you guys should check out one of the very first episode they did was with Chris Byrne iski and Adam White of coinbase sorry Chris at that time was at Ark investment management and it was about this new asset class which no versing really really take off by you know back then they had written this white paper that was about the cone representing a new asset class and they analyzed it from all of these different perspectives you know some of them were ways of analyzing that were kind of transferred over from traditional I think that true I'll finance world and then some others were kind of new ways of thinking about this has an asset class and so we actually dived into that pretty deep in this episode that was roughly from a year ago so so anyway all of this goes back to you know my motivation is starting unchanged when I realized that there was probably demand for this type of information I also did a quick study of the existing podcasts and noticed that a whole bunch of them were targeted kind of more at people who were already familiar with a space and I realized that with this type of technology you cannot assume an and given how small the space was at the time I realized that there would be room for a podcast that did not assume people knew a lot of you know kind of the terminology or or even the history so I decided to start a podcast and that time I started it with Forbes which I knew would also kind of bring in more of a general audience and sort of kind of like signal to potential listeners that hey this might be a little bit more user friendly for you then you know something that obviously has kind of more of a technology focus or or is more for technology insiders so he had another question what were the two most defining decisions you took to get to where you are today both pre Forbes in New York and in your career progression F Forbes so I don't know if I can limit it to two but I'll just talk about defining decisions one probably this is what I decided when I was a little kid which was that I wanted to be a writer and it's kind of weird that like that was what I just decided I wanted to be simply because I really stuck to it like it really was what I wanted to be like I just I just always knew that was what I wanted to do and pretty early on like like really early on when I was a kid also I figured out that people tended to think I was also pretty good at it and then I in my professional life as a journalist started kind of do like features you know things like traveled arts yoga we kind of stuff like that and I got to the point where I really wanted to write about something more substantial and so I did this mid-career journalism program at Columbia and I was going to write about climate change but then I graduated an oh wait when when not only did the journalism industry shrink by like 22% fathanah top of that many many many publications got rid of their science desks altogether and because the recession they were like Ratanak we're not really gonna focus on climate change so anyway a few years on I did get back into journalism which was you know which was great because for that period I really honestly I felt this kind of like in her desperation thinking like I know if I got back into journalism I could do it well but you know I there were just basically no opportunities and then in terms of my significant decisions in my career at Forbes I guess you know when I first started writing for Forbes as a freelancer I was covering personal finance and I had already been covering it for a while and I was getting super super super bored and I wanted to write about something different but you know it's it's not the easiest thing to switch like that but the editors basically knew you know that I was kind of hungry to take on something new and so they had this idea to do the Forbes FinTech 50 list and they asked me to lead that list with another reporter Samantha sharp and say no she and I have managed that list for two years running and the first year she and I split up the list in categories and I took digital currencies and and then um you know as everybody knows that's when I or not not everybody knows this but you know everybody in this space knows that people fall down the rabbit hole and that's when I fell down the rabbit hole and I have not emerged since so that that was probably another significant moment and then he also wanted to know what my favorite memory is from my time at unchanged so far that's the only tough question my my favorite memory I guess some of my favorite episodes would be the one with Olaf I again urge you guys all especially if you manage to read the cover story from yesterday I would definitely encourage you to go back and listen to that but said with him it's so fabulous he's just such an interesting person some other ones that I really enjoyed were Michael Casey who is a former reporter from The Wall Street Journal so so it was just fun to talk to somebody else who had been in a similar position to me you know when I launched the the podcast it was from Necker Island and so the the two episodes I recorded there are also really great with Elizabeth Ross yellow from the payza and my Rose ACK of block there for those of you who are interested in the legality of icos I definitely would recommend the coin Center episode with Jerry britto and Peter Van Valkenburg there's so many other ones and I'll recommend some other ones as we go along in this podcast and there's one other probably favorite memory which is that after after the first season Forbes wasn't gonna continue some of the podcast and mine was one of them but I was I was so like I love doing a podcast and so I ain't just really kind of hustled and I got a sponsor and so when I got a sponsor I was like super thrilled so that is just a favorite memory of you know having built something and knowing it was gonna grow even more but not really knowing how I would get it through this period to survive for the long term and then and then you know finally managing to to snag a sponsor all right and then a last question he has from you what is a typical day look like for me okay so there definitely is an occipital day I'm in the very lucky position of mostly working from home which is really nice for a whole host of reasons but I guess like most people I it cannot help myself that I checked my phone especially because my editors on the East Coast so so I really need to check it because usually they already have been singing me before I even wake up and I will read some of these emails that that go out in the space such as like the coin desk email the crypto compare email you know kind of skim the headlines definitely check my Twitter I used to not like Twitter but then after getting involved in crypto and just wanting to spend my whole entire day immersed in crypto I really love Twitter now because I basically have deleted nearly everybody who is not involved in crypto and pretty much my whole feed is just like other players in the crypto space and I like seeing what people are talking about yeah and then I usually have you know a bunch of different interviews but I think the biggest challenge for me a day-to-day is reserving the time to write which you know you need blocks of uninterrupted time so you can focus and think and so you know carving that out for myself is definitely a challenge but the good thing is that because I have so much flexibility with how I manage my workday I you know often can run errands during the day and then maybe I work at night when I'm not getting so many emails or slack messages or whatever and and do that or like maybe I I do some stuff during the weekday for myself but then I take a block during the weekend afternoon to write so there really there's definitely not a typical day the next question from Josh Hayes is what made what made you feel ready to start a podcast on crypto so when I started the podcast this question was not a question for me in terms of me feeling ready to start a podcast like I said because I've been covering it for a year I sort of felt like I I kind of you know how to bead on where things were on this may site already even notice within that year kind of like the different types of people that were coming into the space that were asking questions the different types of readers I was getting what stories were taking off and which stories weren't and like I said before kind of realizing that there was probably going to be demand out there that wasn't currently being met and I would definitely say from my experience with the podcast this year and just watching the numbers grow I would definitely say that I think I was right about the demand the next question is from tamami masa oka he says or I believe it over the year she hopefully it's like he because the vast majority of my reader of my listeners are are male but anyway I hope he says I assume you actively trade or invest in cryptocurrencies yourself if so how do you avoid bias so actually I don't actively trade but I did buy a little bit of Bitcoin and ether so in terms of avoiding bias I would say I actually do have a bias which is that I believe that crypto assets or blockchain based assets are here to stay generally you know whether or not the specific ones are year to say that's like a whole nother question and I think the fact that I've only bought a little bit of these to Bitcoin and ether probably says a lot about sort of where I think we're at so far in in terms of knowing what is really here to stay and then for how do I avoid bias I assume that you meant like between specific coins but but I did want to address that question of like bias as to whether the whole sector will take off or not like I just said I I do think that that is a bias that I have that you know this sector will take off but I don't I don't think that it's really necessarily a bias honestly I just think that you know five years from now or not even that long from now people are going to realize like yeah this is this is a thing but anyway getting back to this question of how do I avoid bias between specific coins I only really invested an amount of money that I'm 100% completely willing to lose and as I've done with the rest of my investments I just kind of parked that money and I don't really look at it so in terms of like thinking about what I've invested when I'm writing anything I actually don't I guess because you know I'm on track with my retirement money even if I you know subtract this money that I put into big and ether so to me it's it's not something really that I think about dating I'm definitely not depending on that money at all in any way like I said if I lose it I lose it it's really not a significant amount but oh and one other thing I wanted to to mention is that I disclosed my investments on all my web pages so whenever you see an article by me it always has this little tagline that explains that I own a little bit of Bitcoin and ether you know these are the ones that I'm pretty sure will be around for the long term I could be totally wrong about that though which is why like I said I'm willing to lose the money at some point I might invest in other protocol layer tokens like pesos or even yose but I don't know as much about them today so it's actually I know a little bit more but yes I'm just only starting to to learn about it like I've been really buried in this cover story but in general I do think that protocol layer tokens probably have the highest chance of surviving and even as speculative as those are the more kind of like a player tokens are even more speculative so I have not really looked into buying any of those if you have piqued my interest but I you kind of need to learn a lot about each a visual one before you would want to like throw any money on it or or I don't know like maybe maybe if I felt like it I could just throw like you know some really small amount of money into a whole bunch of them I don't know it's not something that I've thought about but if I do buy more I will disclose those purchases as well okay next question mark Veneto s' he says I was curious to know what current or not yet created token you see as having the strongest real-world application and web 3.0 for those of you who don't know web 3.0 is the phrase that they're using for the decentralized web which is you know what many of these projects are trying to build such as like decentralized file storage centralized computing etc so he is one of the few people that did read the cover story and managed to submit a question in the in the short time frame offered but he said oh maybe uh maybe after reading my article cuz that cuz we had a sidebar on how tokens work and we used golem as an example he said maybe column can't wait to hear your answer so so in terms of like yeah these application layer well I don't even know if I would call that application layer that's more like infrastructure but I definitely would say these infrastructure coins probably do have a much stronger a chance of surviving long term so those would be G NT which is the golem Network token other ones that fit this bill are the storage tokens like file coins saya saya coin or storage some of the other coins that I think could take off or privacy coins like Z cash and Manero I do think essentially like if you if you just think about how cash is used and how it's been useful you know throughout I could see how having privacy would be something that people would value and find utility for they're already finding utility for it and maybe illicit activity but as we've seen from JP Morgan's JPMorgan Chase's interest in the technology behind Z cash financial institutions also have an interest in that technology so I could see privacy coins also taking off and then when earlier when I was talking about the protocol layer tokens the three ones that I mentioned aetherium pesos and u.s. they're all protocol level tokens so you know those are kind of like base layer tokens and I I do think that those have the biggest chance of of being really widely used so the next question is from Nora ajar and this is a question I love the blockchain looks like a Ponzi scheme why does it have any value so I totally get the Ponzi scheme thing there is something a little bit weird about Krypto in the sense that and if you have not a scene olaf's talk at consensus I highly recommend that you dig up this video online and watch it because he sort of gets at this in his talk this is actually a point that I had made in the original draft of of my cover story but but it got cut by the end but so he the way that he described it was he was like you know people in crypto are really really really into whatever crypto they're into so let's say like Bitcoin people they're really really really into Bitcoin or you know aetherium people they're really really really into aetherium and there's this funny moment and in alas consensus feature where he's like you know people who are into Bitcoin are really into Bitcoin and he was like you know this from talking to people on this conference it's a little bit scary and people started laughing and it's true and it's a little bit scary and you know you do see this like slightly religious aspect to to people's belief and their chosen crypto you also see that when people get into their certain crypto they want to tell others about it and they want others to buy it and I think part of it does have to do with obviously this kind of like financial stake that people have but it but that sounds like a little bit more kind of like mercenary even than it is it's it's like it's so I do think obviously there is kind of this financial motivation but then there's also yeah it is like this belief it's like you know if they if they believe in it enough to invest in it then that that's like a financial way of expressing their enthusiasm and if you talk to them about their crypto then they express that and enthusiasm to you as well and because there's a financial benefit to them you know getting more people to invest in their crypto that is why they try to get their friends and family to buy it as well so moving on to the second point of your question why does it have any value so the only reason that anything has any value as you've seen throughout history is because people believe it has value so that's why you know in other societies like seashells had value or on the island of Yap those massive stones had value and in our society it only makes sense that we would begin to ascribe value to digital things because we're in a phase where everything in our world is becoming digital so in terms of kind of like how we figure out what the actual value is of any of these things but just like a really really simple example for thinking about it is if you look at Bitcoin and early on when I started covering this space there was this analyst ad Wedbush Gill Lauria who would put out these reports and there are other similar ones that have been coming out more recently but his kind of were the first I became familiar with and and they just would sort of break down an analysis of how we might project the future price of Bitcoin and he would basically kind of break it out into the various different ways it might be used and project the demand for all those different uses and then add that all up to come up with a price at some point in the future and the way that he was calculating it was based on existing demand for those services so like an example would be to say that let's say Bitcoin because it is useful as a payment rail could be used for some portion of the existing remittances market so then he would look at the existing reminisces market and say like okay so if in X number of years Bitcoin takes over Y percentage of the remittance market then that means that you know Z dollars worth of Bitcoin will be transacted on Bitcoin in that year and that you know that translates into this amount of demand because also there are other factors like the amount of turnover per year because you know each Bitcoin would be used like multiple times per year and so then you would add that up along with you know maybe demand for a store value or Jimmy if certain fiat currencies fail you know as we've seen we're in countries like Venezuela and Argentina or Greece during the grexit fears you know during all those in in Venezuela Argentina and then in Greece at that time demand for Bitcoin was pretty high because people realize like hey my like my paces are my boulevards or buy my I guess it was the Greek hero the the Euro is held by the Greeks you know they were worried about those the value of that money and so they were turning to Bitcoin to to retain that value so when you project out you just kind of like you know figure out the demand for all these different use cases and sort of add them up at some point in the future and you can basically do the same calculation for something like etherium with you know two begun for ether and then do the same for you know like the decentralized computing or decentralized storage industries and right now probably the values maybe that we're seeing of these tokens are definitely beyond probably what what we're seeing in the actual demand for usage which is because people are speculating on future demand I'm just realizing I really need to move more quickly through these questions but before I do that let's take our important sponsor break with these words from on-ramp with so many companies vying for people's attention now it's important to stand out from the pack if you're starting up a new decentralized project and want to spread the word about it check on on-ramp a full-service creative agency that helps projects maximize awareness gain traction and accelerate growth on-ramp has helped numerous organizations do everything from create their branding an identity to redesign their existing website plus they've helped blocking startups and projects what they're you're launching a new project repositioning an existing organization or just want to freshen your company's look on-ramp can come up with a tailored design project or a strategic marketing plan that ensures your lead in the market learn more and see examples of its work at think on-ramp comm so I am taking reader questions normally I would say I'm talking to so-and-so today but I'm talking to myself with you ask me questions so the next question is from Lauren Charles King has the ico fever created a blockchain greed among sophisticated and powerful investors and fetishism among the community that will destroy the underlying societal advantages of its design so I I love this question because that's just something I actually think about a lot the way that I think about it is here we have this sort of very idealistic or where this very idealistic moment where people are saying hey we're gonna build these big decentralized systems and take money away from these big you know technology companies or you know think central governments whatever it is that they want to take power away from and give it back to people but a lot of that rhetoric is not just similar to what we saw the beginning of the internet like if you go back and you read the cyberpunk manifesto it's all about you know like peer-to-peer everything and and instead now today everybody communicates on the centralized platforms like Google Facebook Twitter so I do wonder how this is all really going to play out some of the really promising things is that I've seen that give me hope in one direction or maybe things like you know the these ideas that we're seeing in projects like tasers where a governance is built in I kind of like this idea that you could have the majority of people kind of dictate what happens in a network because I feel like what I do see a lot online and and in our government is that a small minority can hijack a system because maybe the vast majority of people want things a certain way but are not really motivated to go out and change them because or to manage them because they're not in the minority whereas the minority is sort of motivated to go and change things because things aren't going their way so so sometimes I feel like oh well you know maybe in these decentralized systems we might see that the majority can prevent these systems from being hijacked by these really interested minority groups but then I also wonder especially with kind of like proof of sake systems well these just turn into oligopolies where a few powerful players with a lot of tokens get backers you know maybe because people you know it's like the delegated proof of stake idea where maybe I'm just kind of like yeah you know why I'm not gonna spend all that time learning about all these different decisions so I trust so and so and so and so then starts making all these decisions for you know thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people maybe even millions someday and then we just sort start to see kind of the same same phenomenon happening in these systems so so I really I don't know I feel like that is a big question mark but someone who has also thought a lot about this and who I actually would like to get on the podcast but you might maybe read some of her stuff as Primavera Dave Philippi she is an academic and a lawyer and she I think it's actually even working on a book about this so you might check out some of her writing okay next question is from Mike coots explore the idea that this bubble is the correction the given is exponential growth while the many crashes are pace adjustments so this is an idea that I'm open to when I was reporting the cover story Olaf did say to me that he felt that the space and and the huge run-up with that we've seen in prices in the first half of 2017 is sort of the industry catching up because it has been in the doldrums for so long you know kind of post mount Cox hack and during the whole blockchain not Bitcoin era and I have heard this from other people there was someone who came up to me at ethereal and I'm sorry that I don't remember who you are but I think he was involved with consensus in Brooklyn consensus systems and he said to me oh well maybe these valuations aren't really out of control maybe these are the new valuations that we'll be seeing for decentralized projects and I am open to that idea you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say no that's wrong forever and ever but if you read the cover story I did open it with these questions about for instance the evaluation of gnosis which I do think is a very legitimate question you know if we contrast coinbase which is five years old has millions of customers has made Scouts of money and has a really strong reputation in this industry that has really so far and even still is totally wild west if coinbase is only now just getting a valuation of 1 billion dollars and the idea that gnosis should be worth 3 billion which is the valuation if you take all the the future tokens into account then that valuation it's it's just so questionable and Martin Koppelman who is one of the founders agreed with me actually on this one I interviewed him and at the time that I interviewed him the tokens were a hundred and eighteen dollars that was the price in the day we talked and you know I said things to him like you know are you comfortable with people spending that much on your tokens and he did admit he wasn't comfortable but the thing is that that price did it's two hundred and thirty three dollars today so it's even like basically double however you know he's not here to talk about this in what he did say to defend himself and this did get cut from the story is he talked about how they reserved a huge portion of the tokens in order to foster development on gnosis and to reserve that to make sure that the project succeeds I do think that then gnosis runs the risk of being classified more like a security at least according to the highway test which as I mentioned we went into kind of in depth in the coin Center episode yeah because that is one of the problems that how we test which is you know whether or not you whether or not the value of that asset depends on a small group of people and so you could argue in the case of a project where they have release that many tokens and they've reserved so many that are kind of in their control that you know maybe it's it is more like a security anyway you know that was how he described kind of like why he felt still that the way that they had conducted their auction was was actually a good idea even though he did feel that you know later on with the price that it was trading it on exchanges you know maybe that that wasn't really the best price for people to be buying it at however one less thing I did want to say about Martin is I really think that he's a class act because after we had that really tough interview I got my new position at Forbes and I sent an email to a whole bunch of sources telling them about my new role and he wrote Becca congratulations and said that based on how I grilled him it was well deserved so I thanked him for understanding that my role in this community is to ask people to have questions and I was just doing my job but back to your question about exploring the idea that this bubble is the correction and that the given should be exponential growth and many crashes are well you at pace adjustments but now I'm wondering if that's autocorrect and you might you meant price adjustments so I am open to that idea however as you saw in the cover story we use the word bubble liberally in the tagline and in the story itself and I do still think that many of this these tokens will lose value not all of them will succeed a lot of people are going to lose their shirts many people already have I didn't get to write about some of the stories that I uncovered of people losing quite a bit of money but that has definitely happened okay next question Doug black hi there I'm brand new literally five days to the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology but I'm quickly becoming enamored with it Doug this was exactly my experience I'm sure it's the experience of like every other listener to this podcast so he says I love that I can make money learn new technology and invest in the growing community and he asks for a person new to block chaining crypto where do I start where do I start in investing or mining where do I start in learning to develop for the blockchain and I'm gonna lump this together with another question from Alex clue youth who asks aside from your podcast what are some basic resources beginners for the space should start to learn about the technology the people involved in potential opportunities for entrepreneurs so a few of the good resources for technology I I would say or just kind of to get your bearings would be obviously the Bitcoin white paper that's probably the first place to start he also think the etherium white paper is good there are a whole bunch of other really good resources I know people really like Andreas Antonopoulos who is also another previous podcast guest he's written a few books he also does number of videos he speaks all around the world so you just look for his name on YouTube you will find a whole slew of videos he's done I've also seen that I and I haven't taken any of these so I can't really without for the quality of them but I've seen people also talking about like a Coursera course and results who a course offered by the University of Nicosia I think on Khan Academy there's also something so you guys can also check those things out as for getting to know who the people are in the space Nathanael poppers book digital gold I think is a really good early history that brings the story alive through the characters in in early Bitcoin so even now sometimes because obviously a lot of a lot of them are still working in this place I will pick that up again to just remind myself kind of like you know what this person was doing like five years ago or whatever other places where I would look to get to know the characters our Twitter is a really big one where you know you kind of follow all the right people and you start to get to know them just seeing them regularly in your feed and there is also several different reddit subreddits that are good to follow like Bitcoin or our BTC or our youth trader or our aetherium our cryptocurrency our Bitcoin markets there's there's a whole bunch of those there are some really good slack channels one that I like is coin fund but there's a whole bunch of other ones that are popular like crypto copia and then there was also some telegram channels like I know whale pool is where a bunch of the traders talk I've seen other ones like although some of these you have to pay for like crypto gambit and wolf of Polonius I think just started one so those are some to check out for mining it really depends on which coin you want to mine some of these I'd like in particular I would say probably is gonna be a little bit challenging because of the electricity cost and because of the ASIC costs but I think some of the other coins maybe are a little bit more friendly to kind of like a hobbyist miner maybe they use like GPUs for instance you know I'm not gonna pretend to be a huge expert on mining but as far as I understand I think with the theorem and and Z cash you kind of more everyday people can mine but if I were you I would maybe Google that a little bit because I'm I'm this is not something I've explored in depth and then as forum where you can learn to do some blockchain coding oh actually sorry I I meant to mention earlier that I have also heard about another educational organization called black Maddox but I again haven't checked out anything that they're doing but I think that's another one kind of like the Khan Academy in Coursera that I mentioned earlier but as for coding there's also I think byte Academy be yte is a big one in consensus systems apparently also started a new one and code Academy may have one and then there's also one called benign lab Academy so I will check those out and then as for opportunities for entrepreneurs I would just get in a whole bunch of slack channel see maybe kind of other people that want to work in this space there I think some developer lists like I know there's obviously the Bitcoin talk list I'm sure there are other lists you can get in and talk to other developers in the space but again the developer part of it is something that I'm not incredibly familiar with so hopefully that is enough for you to to get a start alright the next question is from dawn Casey Roe and I'm super excited to have a question here from a woman she says what are the top things beginners do wrong regarding security okay sorry I don't know I don't I don't know what the top things are but the main things I would say about security are that there's a spectrum in the ways that you can handle security and by that I mean that people who are very tech savvy and won a great degree of autonomy and are against kind of like using centralized services those people will probably want to handle the tech themselves and then those who maybe you don't feel quite as tech savvy feel like they would rather have a trusted service that is a professional at handling security might might help them out a little bit better those people can use centralized services but there there are risks involved with that and also really good ways to mitigate those risks so let's actually start talking about that risk because that's actually been a huge huge I guess problem that we've seen in crypto which is that a lot of people hold their crypto on centralized exchanges but then or services like wallets but then if they have two-factor authentication with their phone number on the accounts their crypto has been stolen and by that what I mean is let's say your hacker figures out that you have your phone at like you know Verizon or something the hacker will call up sprint and pretend to be you maybe they've figured out your birthday from online or they you know know your mother's maiden name or whatever I don't know and they convince Sprint that they're you and they say hey I want to port my number which means you know move it to another carrier I want to port my number from Verizon to sprint and then sprint goes rise and it's like hey dawn wants her her phone number over at Sprint now give it to us and Verizon hands it over and sprint now has handed your phone number over to your hacker so your hacker then goes to let's say coinbase comm or google.com or Twitter comm or Facebook now hum or chase or whatever and types in your email address but then hits forgot password then the service will say can we send a code to your phone and then that hacker will get the code sent to their what is their phone it's no longer your because your number is now associated with their phone and then they will proceed to change your passwords on all these accounts and lock you out and then maybe they'll move your Bitcoin and or your atheria or whatever and then you're totally out of that money because as you probably know transfers on block chains are not reversible unless the person who's received the money actually just sends it back so what you would do then is to if you want to use those services because maybe you don't trust yourself with hardware wallet or or a paper wallet or whatever you would instead use Google Authenticator on your phone which is an app that generates codes I think it's like every 30 seconds or so I'm actually not sure what over what span of time but but then instead of having a code texted to you you just pull up the Google Authenticator app and you can create different codes so like you can create one for your Gmail and one for your coinbase and one for your Twitter and you know one for a Dropbox whatever then every time you log into one of those accounts it will ask you for your code from Google Authenticator so that's one option another is to use something like a Yubikey which is a physical device that you can put into the computer that you know tells the computer hey it's really me because I'm the only person that owns this device so that's kind of a way of managing that another way that people do it on centralized services is to do multi-sig where it's kind of like if you maybe are like a CEO or see you know EXO and you want to make sure that checks don't go out for more than ten thousand dollars and less two out of three people in the c-suite have signed off on it that concept is what applies here from four multi-sig so you can also do that and then if you want to managed to check yourself you can get your own hardware wallets like treasure or ledger you can actually even create a paper wallet where you put your address on a piece of paper and send send your coins to it if you do that though then obviously you would want to probably create multiple copies of this and locate them in different geographies and in places where you know they are secure so you could do something like a safety deposit box at a bank or multiple safety deposit boxes but that I would say is probably probably a way of handling it yourself which and one other thing I wanted to say about that is just that some people will make this choice based on whether or not they're actively trading their crypto or not so if you are actively trading it then you probably don't have much of a choice but to keep it on an exchange but if you're not if you're just sort of buying and holding it then managing the tech yourself is is probably you know something that that you might prefer to do so you also asked about security without having to be a career hacker and I just wanted to use this as a jumping off point to talk about the numerous scams that we're seeing in the space I personally have also been targeted by these skins or I've seen them in some of the slack channels you should always always always type in the URL yourself in double check it and make sure that you've typed it in correctly don't click on links that come through like slack channels or you to your email I have received emails from what looked exactly like like an official coinbase email you know I don't remember what it said but you know it was kind of like oh I you know no I think I think it said hey somebody's been trying to steal to access your coin base account like you know make sure they're not and that nobody's got your password and and click here to enter your password and like secure your account or so it was something like that and I was like oh my gosh and I clicked and then I was kind of like wait and indeed I was clicking on coal base Co Ln base and then the other one was it was very I don't remember but so one used oh and the other was sigh on bass cion bass and then I've seen other ones in slack channels like I saw them the other day where it was saying that an icy off or something called pillar PIL lar that there had been a scam going around where you know because the in these are some serif fonts which are the ones that don't have the little serifs on the on the letters and so this scam had put in a capital i in place of the lowercase L you know to get people's ether I guess sent to them and then another one that I saw was some kind of notice went out about how brave attention token was having its second its follow-on ICO something in to be honest my initial reaction was oh my god the forty Vegas 36 million dollars in 24 seconds and now they want more money and I initially was like outraged and then I very quickly realized that it was misspelled and it was a scam so anyway okay next question from Tony who asks what do you think about ripple XRP do you think it will ever get to number two or even number one Oh in the he also wants to know what I think will happen to XRP once ripple initiates escrow so the number one thing I've learned about covering this face is that the predictions are just useless like I feel like the whole space every day is just so impractical so I would never say never about anything but I I highly doubt that ripple would ever get to number one I think there was a brief period when it wasn't number two I did talk with Kris Pearn s key about this who is one if not the smartest people and thinking about the true value of these assets one of the smartest and he said that he felt what we would need to see in order for XRP to really appreciate is that the banks that are using XRP to do correspondent banking meaning to do international wire transfers that we would need to see them made me start to hold some XRP and reserve for that purpose and we're not quite seeing that yet and i agree you know ripple for the last years I have put that company on the FinTech 50 list I do really think that it's chat cold a really smart use case and it's been really smart in its strategy for getting these different partners on and we're already seeing you know it has these huge networks in Asia which I think you know will enable kind of like a lot of volume to happen someday you know I don't I don't know where it is right now I haven't spoken in them in a while but I think the fact that it's not as decentralized to currency as some of these others and is more kind of like this b2b play is going to mean that we're not maybe going to see the same kind of adoption that we will for a more kind of like true public crypto and so you know when you ask what will happen to the price of XRP once rippln desheets escrow which for those of you who don't know ripple the company realize that you know once once the market have started going up they realize that people might be a little bit nervous about the companies influence on the price because they have so many coins and so they said that they were gonna lock up a whole bunch in escrow and just release like I forget the amount a certain amount every month you know I I don't know I think they were just doing that to quell market fears but I don't know if that's really gonna affect the price I do as I said before still think that that sort of demonstrates that this company kind of has a lot of influence over how well it does and so for that reason I have a feeling a lot of people who are kind of more into the decentralized web are going to shy away from it so then the next question is from Phil Ferraro who asks do you think that blockchain can be used in the future for political purposes specifically at the local level would it be possible to replace politicians with a direct vote on blockchain so yes this is something that I have thought about a lot I've written about it a little bit and someone who had some really interesting thoughts about blockchain and governance was a lawyer and coder at coinbase named Jesse Posner who I quoted in a previous article I wrote on this issue so I do think that this is possible and I know that companies like bitfury are working a lot to apply blockchain technology in kind of governmental applications like you know for land titling and stuff like that but I actually think what we're gonna need to see before we let's see this vision that you've outlined here we're blockchain can be used at the local level for direct voting and stuff like that I think we're gonna need a huge huge build-out of this technology particularly in areas around like identity and and also you when just getting voting systems on blockchain which is gonna be a huge undertaking you know oh this is another episode people should listen to Kathryn Hahn talked about this kind of stuff in her episode which was the last episode of season 1 so it was the 12th episode she talked about how I don't remember the exact number it was several thousand i/o maybe like 3,600 or something but if you look at even something as simple as like birth certificates I think she said that there's 36 different 3,600 different ways that municipalities around the country a structure them and so there's all different kinds of standardization that's gonna need to happen before we even get to this vision that you outlined so yes but on a long time scale then you had another question which was he said I have zero background in programming but I would like to start educating myself for taking courses and reading books up a subject I was reading a lot about new color jobs and wanted to know if it's too hard for someone to start at Ground Zero and try and running myself should jobs like that open the future okay definitely yes as I mentioned earlier there's a ton of resources for learning and many of them are free so definitely check out the ones I mentioned earlier and I'll just tell listeners you also didn't mention in your question that you have the kind of job that will ultimately be replaced by automation so for that reason definitely get on it now especially because this you know everything is just at Ground Zero right now it's everything's just starting to take off and it's all new and Pulliam mu gr oh gosh I don't remember at some point I did a story where I used an estimate that he hadn't I think he said it was in the low tens of thousands in terms of the numbers of coders there are but you know I do think that there will be a lot more demand and there really is just not enough there are there are not enough people who know how to do this kind of things so if you want to get started now and start educating yourself I think it's great time okay we're sort of running out of time I'm going to ask one last question which is I'm going to get to one last question which is the media seems to want to create a horse race between Bitcoin and aetherium is this a fair comparison or are the differences only meaningful to enthusiasts so I do agree that this horse race idea between Bitcoin and aetherium it isn't exactly apples to apples comparison in fact for short on apples to apples you know obviously in Bitcoin is more for payments and store of value and aetherium is for running smart contracts so I think that both of them have carved out really smart Nisha's for themselves that don't really compete with each other and so it is kind of silly to to say like hey like these two are competing cuz they're really not you know if anything I would say like Tasos and eos are competing with etherium but not with Bitcoin so whereas maybe something more alike litecoin competes with Bitcoin or you know sea cash or whatever because those are a crypto currencies however I think what is interesting about this you know what you're calling a horse race is that we didn't see that Bitcoin was the dominant crypto asset for so long it was 90% of the whole market cap 80% for just forever and then it just started dropping precipitously so so so quickly and so I actually did write an article about the first day that I saw Bitcoin representing less than 50% of all crypto assets because that for me felt like a significant moment and if we see aetherium at some point overtake it which people have been calling the flipping I do think that will be a major story simply because Bitcoin was the front-runner for so long and so anytime you see that narrative change you know that's a significant moment you know the fact that they're not exact competitors is you know something important for people to understand but just for also getting the big picture of how the space is changing I do think it would mean something if the flipping does happen which at the moment is less likely than it was like a month or so ago oh and and you had one additional question which was which was what does this mean for the consumer you asked from my view on how consumers might be made to value blockchain record and data more than they do via conventional meanings means and your example was that maybe at the supermarket maybe somebody could see the provenance on their organic flour and so you sort of ask kind of like how we might see people really understand the features of blockchain as opposed to a traditional database and what I would say here is that I think we're gonna get people to really see the value of blossoms maybe through these assets as we're seeing now I think people are getting that you can kind of trust digital assets crypto assets you know obviously there's a certain amount of education that goes into that but I do think people are seeing to understand that noticing maybe how quickly they move compared to our fiat currency I know that's something that I still get a thrill from every time I use crypto and just transfer it and it's you know even if I'm just doing things like moving it from wallet a wallet like I find I find all that just so fascinating to see how quickly it all works another one I do think could also kind of bring that home to people is through identity and obviously that's maybe not the sexiest thing for people to be using blockchain for but I do kind of wonder like hey maybe people will like this idea of getting more control over their privacy you know on the flip side as we've seen in this digital era people so easily sign away their privacy you know by clicking on the terms of and agreements for for basically every single web service and kind of like ignoring a little bit even the Snowden revelations they're not ignoring but just sort of like moving on after that so who knows maybe maybe those things actually won't what really gained a lot of traction okay so I had like about 5 million more questions and I would say will I get to I'm already a little bit over time but thank you guys so much for your questions and I'm really sorry I wasn't able to get to all of them but you gave me great ideas for future questions to ask other guests and for future stories so keep checking out my forms
