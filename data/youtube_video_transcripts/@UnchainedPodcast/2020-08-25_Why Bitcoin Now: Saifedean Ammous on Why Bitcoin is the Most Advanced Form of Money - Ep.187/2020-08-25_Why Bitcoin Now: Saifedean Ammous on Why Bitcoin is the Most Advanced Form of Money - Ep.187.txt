fifth installment in the y bitcoin now series which takes a closer look at bitcoin in the context of larger macroeconomic forces such as the pandemic and geopolitical moves happening in crypto my guest for today is sevadine amus an economist and the author of the bitcoin standard the decentralized alternative to central banking welcome sefedeen thank you very much for having me laura it's a pleasure you're an economist and you now specialize in bitcoin and the bitcoin standard has been translated into 20 languages making it one of the more well-known books about bitcoin tell us about your background and how you got into bitcoin well i was a uh university professor in economics um at the lebanese american university and i um i was always interested in monetary economics and in particular in the austrian school of economics which is um uh focuses on understanding the monetary uh the monetary differences between hard money and the easy money and the economic implications of monetary policy and inflationary monetary policy so um bitcoin was a natural fit for these kinds of interests and so i was quite curious about it when i first heard about it even though i was pretty skeptical for quite a while eventually i came around to thinking that yeah this thing is interesting and it might have legs and what are the basic tenets of the austrian school of economics and why do you think that bitcoin is a natural fit for someone interested in that the fundamental idea on which austrian economics is built and the way that it differentiates itself from other schools of economics is the foundational principle which is that value is subjective and from the fact that value is subjective um you know um the the the i would say a fundamental difference is in the understanding that economic calculation takes place in individuals minds and that it and that it's not possible for central planners to impose our preferences on market participants in a way that improves the well-being of the market participants and so the understanding of subjective value the understanding of the importance of economic freedom for markets to function the ability of people to trade with one another makes the austrian school more uh receptive to free market ideas now particularly when it comes to money i think the austrian school is uh specifically um i would say the best school for understanding bitcoin because it is the only school in whose world view bitcoin is possible in whose worldview bitcoin can actually work and that's for two reasons because uh every other school of thought um tacitly or explicitly accepts the accepts the idea that money is a creation of the state that money is whatever the government says it is money is whatever the government uses for tax collection and government can make anything into money by just uh putting its imprint on it this is predominantly accepted i would say well by most schools of economics today whereas from the austrian perspective money is whatever the market says it is and it is governments who had to make their golds are their coins out of gold because the market chose gold governments would have rather made it out of something else and so governments can interfere in the market for money but they can't really um the they they can't completely destroy the market for money and the implications of their interference in it are uh best understood from the austrian perspective so that's the first one money uh control the second one is the fixed supply um bitcoin and that was what really draw me drew me to it because before bitcoin was invented i was i i used to think you know i i would pose this hypothetical question to other economists and i would ask them if we had a form of money whose supply was fixed why would that be a problem and from all other perspectives and all other schools of thought you know there is some importance to the nominal quantity of money the number of units of money that are out there matters and the percentage by which the units of money grow every year also matters and um you know there are all kinds of different perspectives on how these numbers should be controlled and how they should change with time but there's very little uh debate of the fact that the money supply has to increase in order for an economy to work money supply has to continue to increase and so um from the austrian perspective there's a recognition that money is uh uh is a unique good whose entire quantity does not matter um the the number of monetary units does not matter what matters is their purchasing power so people don't prefer 10 yens to one us dollar they'll still rather take one us dollar over 10 yens because the value of one us dollar is more than 10 yen so it's not the number that you get of the units it's the purchasing power and if you think in that way then there's no reason why a fixed um supply monetary asset can't work as money in fact you would argue that this is better money and that's essentially uh the argument of my book this is the most advanced form of money we've ever invented precisely because it's something whose supply is completely resistant to inflation yeah the first part of your book was really interesting because it dives deep into the origins of money and the purpose of money um so why don't we maybe break some of those things down for people you did go through some of the three main functions store value medium of exchange and unit of account why don't you just explain those and then we'll get into some of the other concepts and maybe also do um cover some of the fun historical stories that you had about money sure um i'd say the key concept at the beginning part of my book where i uh discuss uh historical examples of money and how they um lost their monetary status and how new ones came about i make the contention that the most important metric for the success of a money or one of the most important perhaps is the uh what i call the saleability across time or how well money is able to hold on to its value over time and uh you know you can you can think of it as on the one hand people always want to hold the money who that holds uh value more over time but on the other hand there's also another force acting there um irrespective of what people choose to do which is that uh the monies that are harder that hold on to their value better will end up holding on to more value whereas the other monies will lose value and so the net effect will be more and more wealth will remain in the heart of monies and i think the argument i make it it's not an original uh point it's something that is uh that has been made for many years within the gold space what i did was that i applied to bitcoin is the concept using a concept called stock to flow which measures the existing stockpiles of a material or a monetary good and divides it by the new annual supply so you would look at the total existing stockpile of copper or gold or silver and you would divide it by the new annual production that was produced this year and that will give you a ratio now the unique thing about monetary metals is that they are metals whose stock to flow ratio is significantly higher than one uh for all other commodities for all other market commodities that people accept and use daily um for all kinds of various reasons the stock to flow is always within the range of one so if you think about something like oil the entire supply of oil that is out there in storage all over the world today is probably somewhere around one year's production of oil it's somewhere in that range it might be 50 less it might be 50 more uh 200 more maybe maximum but it's not that much because nobody stores oil there's just not that much room for oil storage because people don't use oil to store it they buy oil to burn it and so because it is burned the stockpile is always being decimated it's always burning away quite literally and so the new flow is quite large compared to the stockpile and so this makes oil terrible as a form of money because new production is quite significant compared to existing stockpiles and so if someone were to use money or were to use oil as money they would store value in it it's quite trivial for oil um producers to flood the market with a lot of oil much larger than the existing stockpiles and therefore effectively devalue the oil and take away the savings that the person had put into oil this doesn't happen with gold and to a lesser extent silver because gold is effectively indestructible because gold does not decay doesn't rust it doesn't ruin in any way we've been accumulating gold over thousands and thousands of years and the result of that is the total supply of gold that exists today is many multiples all of the supply that will produce this year in fact the number is more like 60 or 70 which means effectively that every year the new every year every year the supply of gold is increasing by around one and a half to two percent every year which means that gold is a much better monetary good so it has a higher stock flow which means that the stockpile of existing gold is many multiples higher than the annual production so this is why it's um it's difficult for gold miners to dump an enormous amount of gold on the market and devalue the gold and that's what prevents gold from becoming an industrial metal and so applying that framework to currencies across time i think is quite useful so for instance if you look at places like prisons they use cigarettes sometimes as money because there's no easy way to make cigarettes in prison if you look at societies for instance there's the example of the yap island where they didn't have limestone on the island but on a nearby island there was limestone so it was a big deal and it was very difficult to get limestone from that island to this island and so those limestones became money and but they're difficult to get but they're not that difficult to get so over time the supply for limestone started to increase and there's a story about how the supply inflated and eventually the the the yap island like all other islands in the world uh went on to uh more advanced forms of money and can you tell that story because i thought it was interesting yeah there's a uh it was a best-selling book written in the 1950s based on a true story and then it was turned into a movie i think with the bert lancaster and it's called his majesty of keith and apparently it's a true story happened in the 1870s an american irish sailor by the name of o'keefe had been shipwrecked at the island and he went to the island and he found that you know it was an island that had an enormous amount of coconut which he knew that he could uh sell at a significant price and he found that their monetary system was just a bunch of limestones and they used large limestones because they'd been you know producing more and more limestone over time and getting it from the islands nearby and so he thought uh after he was shipwrecked and he left the island he thought well i could buy all of the coconut um that these people produce if i go and get them uh large uh amounts of limestone because that's uh that's their money and so he left the island he went to i think it was hong kong he chartered a modern boat with uh explosives and so you know he could get enormous quantities of uh limestone and uh he took a professional crew and dynamite and so on and went and extracted enormous quantities of limestone and then took them to the island and wanted to buy the coconut with it and then um basically what happened was a civil war broke out of the island because some of the island chiefs said no we can't accept his uh limestones and these are easy cheap limestones that didn't cost them a lot of effort for us it has to have been something that's very hard and very expensive and they understood something that most economists don't understand you know the the the uh money is only useful if it's hard to make if it's an easy thing to make then it's not money it's uh it's uh it's it's not going to do its job as money it's going to lose its value and that's effectively what happened once the limestones came to the island uh the the price of the limestones collapsed and the entire economy of the uh yap island collapsed and a lot of their coconut was taken away from them and all they had left where a whole bunch of useless limestones just like many countries today people all that they have left on a whole bunch of useless pieces of paper yeah so this you know i asked you about the three functions i think all of this explains the first one store of value um i guess a little bit also medium of exchange but do you want to just briefly touch on those and then we can talk a little bit more about um some of the other concepts from the early parts of the book yeah i mean i think these concepts are quite intertwined i don't think they're distinctive functions and as much as they are descriptive properties of what money is so you necessarily have to be a medium of exchange if you're a store of value and vice versa uh functionally speaking you can't exchange something unless you store value into into it um i think the the um the interesting thing which is the topic of the uh you know developing the analysis of the use of bitcoin for payments which is what usually people refer to in terms of medium exchange and that's going to be the topic of my next book the fiat standard which is the sequel to the bitcoin standard i've written most of it so far and in the bitcoin standard i focus on the uh inter-temporal salability of money the ability of money to hold on to its value across time in the fiat standard um because i'm analyzing the fiat system and how it displaced gold and how bitcoin could potentially displace it i focus on um inter spatial uh saleability in other words how much value do you lose from your money as you try and spend it into longer distances and you know in terms of the the further away you want to spend your money the higher you have to pay transaction costs generally as the case is with the national currencies so if i wanted to exchange a dollar with the grocery store around the corner then i could just hand them the dollar and that costs me uh you know three second walk or 20 second walk or whatever but if i wanted to buy something from uh the town from the next down then you know i'm going to be needing to use the domestic payment uh app and then depending on which one there's some kind of transaction cost and if i'm going to another country there's an uh higher transaction cost because i'm going through banks and settlement institutions and so on um so in in a sense i think the the real power of bitcoin which i discussed in in the next book in the fiat standard is in the fact that it allows it has very high interspatial sailability across national borders you send a transaction of bitcoin the bitcoin transaction is completely distance uh independent and so uh you know sending money from one of your wallets to the other wallet that's right next to it costs exactly as much uh as sending that money halfway around the world so that means i think in my mind that bitcoin is going to um you know uh bitcoin offers more of value as a as for in terms of its on-chain transactions it offers a lot of value for international settlements and that's something of course i'd also discuss in the bitcoin standard that it um bitcoin payment network is likely not going to be a network for individual uh retail transactions but more but rather for higher value transactions yeah one thing about the um spatial aspect that you mentioned is i think at least for now i could see so i could see that um point applying further in the future when we have greater adoption but at the moment you would need to find somebody in that far away place who would be willing to accept your bitcoin which at the moment because global adoption is low is um you know a slightly uh difficult thing to do well yeah i i agree of course uh you do need somebody else which is why you know bitcoin's liquidity is limited uh compared to fiat currencies however i think you know the uh if you really think about it uh over the last 12 years how far the liquidity has come i mean it's already much larger than the liquidity of many national currencies that have been around for decades and countries that have been around for uh millennia um i think you know the bitcoin market cap is much larger than the egyptian currency's market cap and egypt's been around for a lot of time so it's it's it's astonishingly impressive in terms of the um size of the market cap and the fact that it is internationally distributed means it's it's not an insignificant pool of liquidity yeah yeah and i'm not disagreeing with that it's just i was more thinking that like even amongst my friends i don't know if i could find anybody who would take money from me in bitcoin so in that regard like it just feels like yeah but i i obviously i agree with you in theory and and down the line i think that will be more the case um but a couple other concepts that i want to cover before we dive even further into bitcoin um in your book you are often talking about sound money so how is that defined and why is that so important the the definition that i follow from the austrian school based on the work of professor joe salerno or based on the work of uh ludwig von mises is sound money is money that is chosen and valued freely by the market and unsound money is money whose acceptance and value is dictated uh through uh violent commands essentially or through government dictate and so um you know if you need to pass laws that say people have to use your money or else then that's not sound money and for me the astonishing thing about bitcoin is that it achieved adoption as money without anybody passing a law for it to do it and so this is really why you know i make the contention here's the definition of sound money and bitcoin fits the bill because you know you may not like it you may not want to use it but there all of this value is out there and people are using it and uh um it works it fulfills the functions of money for the people who uh use it for that and it's um it's uh it's chosen freely on the market yeah and you also call it commodity money in the book and obviously we all know the cftc agrees that bitcoin is a commodity so um i do think that applies another um concept that you talk about a lot in the book is time preference what is time preference and can you walk us through some examples of how that plays out with money yeah time preference is in economics it's the degree to which an individual favors the present over the future so if i were to give you the choice between a hundred dollars today and a hundred dollars one year from today um basically every rational human being will accept will will would prefer to take the hundred dollars today if i wanted to make you wait for a year for the hundred dollars i'm going to have to offer you a price uh through extra dollars so i need to give you 105 or 120 um and that measure of how much extra uh your discount the future in order to um that measure is the measure of time preference and it's perfectly rational that time preference is always positive and the reason for that is that life is um finite we all die we are not immortal and life is uncertain so you want to enjoy things as soon as possible because you never know if you're going to be there tomorrow and also because um you know your life is limited um you want to have the things earlier so you get to experience them for longer so people always prefer how to have things early people always have a positive time preference however the lower your time preference effectively means the more that you think about the future the more that you um provide for the future so the more of a long-term oriented person you are the lower your time preference the lower the discount rate you place on the future you would require a small amount in order to get you to uh give up a hundred dollars today and accept them in a year so for me i think time preference is enormously important concept uh in in in economics in fact i think it's the most important concept in economics when i used to teach at university whatever class whatever topic i was teaching in my 10 years at university i'd always surprise my student with a lecture on time preference and tell them you know if you're going to learn anything from this course just remember this it's the most important concept in economics because the degree to which you discount your future self in my mind is the best predictor of the state of your future self because um and i say this in the book you know you'll conduct trades with other people you'll work with other people you're you will have so many different um interactions with others and yes other people can rip you off and other people can do bad things but you will never have as many interactions with anybody as much as you will with your future self you're always training with your future self so when you decide that you're going to eat junk food um you know you're you're sacrificing tomorrow for the sake of enjoyment today when a college student decides to go party the day before their exam they're sacrificing their uh future and their better grades for the sake of a fun day today so i think you know um once this this is one of those concepts um once you once you learn it it sticks with you and it's hard to unlearn it because you start seeing it everywhere you start seeing it in your personal relationships you start seeing any financial decisions and once you just start looking at all of those things with that lens of me versus future me you start really understanding where present you comes from and you start seeing how your you know your your current problems of present you were caused by all of the hurdles and neglect uh created by uh past you and then you start applying that in all kinds of different matters and i think once once you're aware of it and you're able to see the distinction between applying uh long-term and short-term thinking um it it's quite powerful and i think um a lot of people uh enjoyed this concept in my book and a lot of people told me that it really changed their life just um but by applying this lens of thinking anyways how all of that relates to bitcoin is that um i i contend in my book that time preference in society well i don't contend that from the austrian perspective time preference is what determines interest rates so what determines uh the interest rates on the market is people's time preference the lower people's time preference the more they save the more they save the more savings are available on the market the more savings are available in the market the lower the interest rate so in my mind the opposite process is happening when governments are interfering in capital markets through inflation and through government uh fiat money which is easy money which is increasing at a larger supply they uh end the role of the interest rate as being a signal as a market price and instead replace it with the interest rate as um something that is centrally planned and that in turn affects everybody's time preference so when suddenly your money is expected to lose value you have less of an incentive to hold on to your money and so you have less of an incentive to save and you have more of an incentive to spend and on the flip side because the government is able to create more money because that artificially lowers interest rates so that gives you more of an incentive to borrow and so this basically teaches society high time preference it it it reverses the lowering of time preference and really we have to understand that the process of civilization is effectively the process of human beings lowering their time preference human beings learning to think further and further into the future learning to invest further in accumulating more and more capital which leads to higher productivity so when we start moving and that's why throughout history we're constantly moving to a harder money which allows us to think further into the future and allows us to lower our time preference now we move to an easier money and that process reverses in my opinion in my opinion that starts making people think more and more about the short term and you see it you see it in the differences in saving rates in the 19th century under the gold standard people had much higher saving rates and there was far less indebtedness and today everybody and everything is in debt all corporations and people and governments are up to their eyeballs in debt basically and that's just the way that people live and nobody even thinks that savings is something that needs to be done you know you just you're constantly racking up more debt and you work to pay off the debt rather than spend from your savings well so one thing that i wanted to ask about was um and so did you read sapiens by yuval noah harari no oh okay well so there is a piece in there where he talks about how the creation of credit and um and debt people taking on debt is what fueled growth and um you know in your so in your book you talk about how you know low time preference is what results in saving and less debt and and ultimately like investment um but i actually so the way that you've all known harare uh positions it um it's sort of like taking on the debt is also um a low time preference thing in the sense that you know like maybe you endure pay now to have this gain in the future so is it always that low time preference results you know it causes people to say rather than take on dead or like or maybe i'm just not thinking of it right but somehow the way that he was describing it it sort of seemed he was saying that when people do that it's because they're thinking about you know investing in their future essentially by taking on that debt yeah i mean um it it's unsurprising he'd have these confusions because after all he is a marxist anthropologist so you shouldn't go to him just to be clear that's my interpretation of what he was saying he was talking about how credit leads to growth a lot of people have asked me about this and they share his stuff with me and i've seen a couple of videos um to be honest i have no interest in reading what marxists think about economics in general so i'm not going to read it but uh i i know enough to uh pass judgement on it um and readers are free to disagree i think the the fundamental problem with um the way that marxists view money is that they think of money as just being um and he says that the harare he says it's a social hallucination or it's a collective hallucination or it's a socially constructed uh good that you know we all agree that this thing can be money and then this thing becomes money and if we all agree that uh debt can be money then we all agree that that can be money and then he talks about just how powerful and transformative it was to use debt as money and this is also similar to the work of another marxist anthropologist who also um doesn't understand economics who's david graber who also talks about debt as money and doesn't understand the distinction between the two and of course the the distinction is is really very important because from the market perspective of course from the marxist perspective um uh they're interchangeable because they can both play the role of money and which you know is a little bit like saying that bitcoin and gold and um rye stones and yap island are all the same but of course they're not all the same different things play the role of money differently and so that while the advantage that that plays and this is what i mentioned and what i argue in the fiat standard that the advantage the debt money or government money has is that government can do um interspatial settlement quite effectively you know it it controls all the banks within a jurisdiction and if you pay one bank that bank has to you know i pay you my bank pays you as long as they're both uh running their balance sheets under the supervision of the central bank the central bank can uh make this happen and so for marxist you know there you go this does the job of money the central bank does this and then does the job of money but of course uh you know the economics is not their strong suit so they don't think about the consequences of things and they don't think about what is the consequence of having an entity being able to use its own promises as money and forcing others to accept it and the answer of course is uh catastrophic as is testified as apparent when you look at any place where any marxist ever got anywhere near the central bank or the presidency or the finance ministry the end result of course is that when you tell somebody that their own credit is money they're going to make a lot of that credit and that's going to devalue the money and that's going to destroy the role of money and destroy the market structure of society and cause hyperinflation um so ultimately they miss the aspect of money being easy and and of course they don't understand the issue of saleability and that's that's the fundamental tenant of um the austrian understanding of money as explained by carl menger uh in in the 19th century and it's really the debt is horrible money because that uh is you know your debt is only acceptable to people who trust you and so if i have a piece of paper from you that says i will pay safe 10 bitcoins well that's great but that's not uh that's not a present good i can't exchange it for money today i can't exchange it for goods today if i were to you know if this you're paying me next year 10 bitcoin uh if i wanted to cash it out today if i wanted to exchange it for food today if i needed liquidity today it'd have to have a significant discount and so they completely miss the point between present goods and future goods and so that allows for the introduction of this absurd concept of debt being used as money which is of course why uh it's a very popular of course it's a very popular idea with government finance economist because that's what governments like they like the idea of being able to make their own money um but you know clearly just the the to go back to your question anybody can generate more credit and if the limit on you know generating credit taking on credit doesn't require sacrifice um it's the opposite of sacrifice it's indulging yourself so that you can spend now at the expense of the future so um saving on the other hand is sacrificing now in order to reward yourself in the future so nobody ever got rich by printing debt there's no record of somebody who didn't save no countries in the world got rich without saving uh you have to have capital goods and credit doesn't create capital you have to actually defer consumption that's really i mean it's the basic thing that all creatures understand that if you don't you know if you don't work and if you don't uh defer the consumption then you won't have it you know ants understand it they put food aside they know if they eat it today it won't be there tomorrow and so similarly you know if we have to defer the consumption and delay the consumption of consumption goods in order for them to become uh investment goods or capital goods that we could invest all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about some of these different theories and more about bitcoin as well as the current macro environment but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible how much

end of september back to my conversation with seyfadin amuse and one other thing i wanted to ask you about was the stock to flow theory was seemingly debunked in a recent post by nico cordero the chief investment officer and fund manager at strix leviathan and his essay basically just said that across history there's been no correlation between the stock to flow ratio and the price of gold and the price of gold and i wondered what did you think of that essay and how does that affect your views on how this theory applies to bitcoin no what he was what he was debunking was the mathematical model built around the stock to flow so that's not what i'm uh that's not what is in my book in my book i i introduced the concept and i argue that um the thing with the highest stock to flow will be money and i don't think anybody can uh contend with that on a free market the you know gold and silver had the highest stock to close and they were the only money's chosen on the market um i think what he's done is somewhat somebody else then took my model and tried to find a relationship between the stock to flow and the market capitalization and they seem to be getting significant results uh when including gold um i think what this guy was saying is that the the mathematical model for predicting value based on the stock to flow is not accurate but um i'm i'm i'm a little bit agnostic about it but i think the the model that does not include gold the model that just um tries to model bitcoin's value according to stock flows far more interesting without including gold because we don't really have reliable data on gold um whereas with bitcoin we have very reliable data on the stock to flow and the market value oh i see okay because i think his was historical it's it wasn't a projection but if you're saying that the data wasn't good maybe that's why um because yeah the the historical um you know plotting of the stock to flow ratio of gold versus the price of gold there was no correlation um but okay okay so if the data is not good uh so one other thing i noticed in your book is that you also to emphasize the difficulty adjustment in bitcoin and i wondered you know you talked about how you felt that was quite significant why you know how do you see that as being important for bitcoin as money i think really the difficulty adjustment i i call it the uh the the crowning achievement of bitcoin or it was it was the missing ingredient the magic ingredient that made the uh soup really work um if you think about it the technical ingredients of what was needed to make bitcoin work were all were all already invented before bitcoin was and they all really uh the one thing that bitcoin added was the difficulty adjustment and what the difficulty adjustment is that it does is a it makes the uh difficulty of mining part of the consensus parameters of the network so each node is not out there mining on its own and making its own coins and so the difficulty of the mining is part of the consensus parameters so they're all mining against the same difficulty and uh secondly it's that it made it um it the difficulty adjustment essentially is what ensures that the bitcoin supply sticks to the um schedule that is uh outlined uh by uh [Music] from the beginning of bitcoin because it's it's different from every other liquid asset that we've had and i discussed this in the book with every other liquid acid as i was mentioning whether it was gold or copper or silver or oil if somebody were to use it as a monetary asset the value would rise significantly but then if somebody were to uh but then it's possible for producers to make more and more of it and even with gold with gold they can make the least more but they can still keep making more and every year they can keep digging further and they can keep finding more and more so the higher the value of gold goes up the more people dig for it and more people find it on the other hand with bitcoin bitcoin's uh mining process is more like a sports competition where rather than you know if more people mine gold we get more gold but if more people compete in the 100 meter uh dash and the olympics we don't get more olympic medals being handed out it just gets harder and harder to win the race and so effectively bitcoin hands out a specified number of medals and then no matter how many people compete when more people come and compete that's not going to lead to an increase in the supply instead it's going to make it more difficult to increase the supply in other words what has been happening with bitcoin is that as the number of people trying to mine bitcoin increases it's not they don't increase the supply instead they increase the security of the network we bring more hash rate on the network too and that makes the network harder to attack and for me this is really the only way that we can understand how bitcoin has a been able to rise in price so astonishingly i think it's done something like uh a billion percent in about uh 11 years or so and i think you can't really you know nothing has ever risen this much for this long this has just never happened there's never been an asset that can rise this much for this long and the reason for me is that no other asset has this kind of uh technology the difficulty adjustment or what people on twitter like to call the ngu technology for number go up because instead of you know instead of the supply going up which is how all other monies scale you know central banks just keep printing more money bitcoin just keeps the supply fixed and that necessitates that the value goes up and that's why i think the value has gone up so drastically over the last 11 years and another thing that you talk about is the near zero cost to verifying the validity of a transaction why is that important for bitcoin i think that's really the uh the glue that holds the security of bitcoin together the idea that thousands of uh and uh probably tens of thousands of individual bitcoin nodes exist all over the world and each one of those nodes is appear to every other one not a single one of those nodes has any um specific privileges that um privilege it over the others and so they all have to agree for anything to happen and they all need to agree on every single block on every single transaction every single bitcoin node needs to look at every single block and say all right this is clear this is fine by me nobody's cheating here these are all the correct coins going from the right person to the right person agreed and so in my mind what maintains bitcoin's security and the transactions continue to work on the one hand and also what maintains bitcoin's um monetary policy what can assure us that nobody's going to be able to break bitcoin's ngu technology and figure out a way to make more bitcoins is that this is completely decentralized and there are tens of thousands of nodes out there and no single node controls bitcoin and for that to be the case it needs to stay cheap for people to run their nodes and that's why in in my mind really bitcoin is the only decentralized digital currency because it's the only one that has these many thousands of nodes that are active and economically active nodes you know you can always obviously spin up nodes um on data centers in order to make large numbers but bitcoin has a large number of economically active nodes and it's uh so far as we know it's it's it's been impossible for anybody to find a way to basically take over the nodes and introduce changes to the uh network that are not unanimously agreed upon and um as we mentioned earlier you talk in your book about how the ultimate limited resource is time and something that fascinated me was he wrote quote bitcoin's immutable monetary supply makes it the best medium to store the value produced from the limited human time thus making it arguably the best store of value humanity has ever invented what did you mean by that exactly what it says i think you know your time is fixed you can do your best to extend it but you know you you can never buy back the time that uh was wasted it's it's it's it's gone and um but why is bitcoin the best uh store of value to to capture that because i mean the way to think about it is let's say you work for one hour and you make a uh you make ten dollars uh if you'd like to save that money in say dollars with every new dollar created your ten dollars are being diluted slightly more because the value of each one of those dollars is going down because it's a smaller percentage of the total dollar supply and so uh you know you hold ten dollars for ten years you'll find that their value over time will decline and the you know the the the way that i look at it when we go back to the issue of the hardness of money the the higher the growth rate of the money the lousier it is at holding on uh to its value gold was the best that we'd ever had because it had a reliably very low growth rate in its annual supply but now we figured out something that in 100 years or so is going to have exactly zero growth in its supply and so you can't make more bitcoin just like you can't make more time so if they want something in which to store your scarce times value in store it into bitcoin and then okay well bitcoin might oscillate but in the very long run at least nobody can make more of it just like you can't make more of the time that has passed and so um you know you look at places where people lose their wealth and you know i used to live in lebanon and um the country's just gone through a horrific hybrid inflation and i've seen just how terrible it is and and and um when you think about it you know people worked for years and years and years and put all that wealth into uh currency or into saving accounts and then to watch it all disappear because somebody managed to print more and more of it is is absolutely shocking and bitcoin really fixes this like no technology has ever fixed it yeah another quote that you wrote in your book that stuck out at me was until bitcoin no good was ever finite but actually through this conversation i thought now we have time as well at least for each of our individual human lives so maybe that's another reason why it um is a good way to capture uh the value of our time um and so you um did uh and you know correct me if i'm wrong but the way that i was reading your book it seemed to me that you were saying that bitcoin is uniquely positioned to take the place of gold in the digital realm and on a recent episode of my show the historian neil ferguson said that well actually it was his friend um matthew mclennan uh he said at first eagle who said that bitcoin currently functions as an option on digital gold and i wondered what your thoughts were on that i mean i'm not sure how that is really different uh from saying it is digital gold it's it's already functioning as digital gold but i guess yeah in a sense i guess also holding bitcoin is effectively uh you know you hold it as digital gold but i think at this early stage of bitcoin the way that bitcoin bootstraps is that as opposed to how bitcoin would function if it were uh fully mature you know you would expect that bitcoin at full maturity would be appreciating at a very small percentage every year maybe one percent or five percent or so on if bitcoin was the only money and the money the money supply was fixed then it would only appreciate compared to goods uh based on how much those goods uh supply increases so when we have economic growth uh bitcoin appreciates uh slightly in effectively at this early stage of bitcoin's operation with bitcoin at about 0.1 uh of the global money supply you know holding it and hoping that it becomes point two percent involves a 100 roughly return on your uh holdings and so even though it doesn't pay cash dividends it is to an extent it's it's a little bit like a high growth stock uh or like a high risk investment um and i think my my my good friend pierre richard coined the term it's bitcoin is a growth currency which is a new thing that has never been there so you know there's um it's a category that usually exists for stocks you will buy a growth stock because you think this is a small company that has potential for growing significantly but it doesn't exist for currencies people buy currencies not for growth but bitcoin is a growth currency in that you know you hold it and even though it doesn't offer returns just its own appreciation can end up doing uh much better than uh returns from uh actual companies so um i think yeah in a sense yeah betting on bitcoin right now is betting on it increasing in its uh value over time and becoming more of a digital gold and so here we are in this crazy macro environment now due to the coronavirus pandemic and quantitative easing and low interest rates sometimes negative interest rates how do you imagine all of this will affect bitcoin um i you know astonishingly uh bitcoin well maybe not so much astonishing but bitcoin has done pretty well over the last uh uh eight months really um you know you think about 2020 uh it's it's been a hell of a year for everybody all over the world um with the coronavirus lockdowns and all of that economic disruption i think what was really incredible and um you know i mentioned this previously in my website you can find some research reports i've written about uh that i used to write for subscribers and you can buy them one of them regards how bitcoin would perform in a financial crisis and i in that i thought you know there are two scenarios um and it's hard to be able to tell whether bitcoin is matured enough for it to act as a store of value as a safe haven in a crisis that you'd see things uh get liquidated and bitcoin doesn't get liquidated so we didn't quite see this happen this time in that when um when when the big sell-off was happening in the credit uh markets and in the stock market in uh mid-march bitcoin also sold off so it was a risk on asset however that was expected uh we saw you know i thought i think it's going to be a while before we see it not sell off but i think the interesting thing is that it bounced back or or the really interesting thing was how quick it would take for it to bounce back and um you know in as i say in that paper effectively you could say that the fir for the first few financial crises bitcoin doesn't have to act as a safe haven it just has it it has to take the beating and then come out of the beating not dead basically and the fact that it takes the beating and comes out not dead is going to be for the first couple times is going to be like a championship win because eventually people think well you know even through the worst beating this thing still comes out uh with a pulse on the other side that opens people's eyes so i think i was astonished at how quick bitcoin's recovery was uh really took me by surprise i thought we'd i thought we'd witness a longer deeper more painful crash but it was it was astonishingly quick and what's amazing about it is that um you know the the the central bank had to step in in order to rescue capital and credit markets and so on um bitcoin and they stepped in by printing enormous amounts of money effectively by engaging in quantitative easing effectively converting long maturity finance financial assets into short maturity financial assets in order to improve the liquidity situation of these financial institutions so you know making more mature more liquidity available making more money supply and bitcoin you know the the the contrast with bitcoin which was going through its having around the same time where you know not through the command of anybody and not like anybody could do anything about it bitcoin was going to respond in the exact opposite way we're going to drop by half all the number of new coins that we produce and you know see both of them seem to work uh you know th the the the reduction in the new supply of bitcoins clearly uh reduced the new selling onto the market so probably has helped um keep the price up or prevent it from dropping further um and you know with the central bank's uh quantitative easing and helicopter money policy and giving everybody checks seems to have done the same for the stock market now let's wait and see for the long run effects of the two approaches you know the short term fix of let's just print money at the expense of the future versus the uh you know the the bitcoin we stick to what we were doing anyway well not like we have a choice but you know bitcoin just proceeds and uh fewer coins are out there this is just another test of the um of the austrian contention to the total supply of money doesn't matter and do you have any theory about why because what so after march after black thursday you're right so there was the dip and then it sort of just bounced back to where it was but then in the last few weeks we've seen it tick upward again do you have a theory about why that happened i think i i don't have theories on short-term price flux away fluctuations but i think you know the the long-term trend is just uh ngu technology um it is going to play out you know we for the past four years we had 1 800 new bitcoins being sold on the market at an average price of say i can't remember what it was exactly over the last four years but i think it was about seven or eight thousand dollars over the past four years over the past halving period so 1 800 coins at around 7 000 each so that's around 10 million dollars a day of coins or something like that um roughly 10 to 15 million dollars i think was the value of coins that was being produced every day over the last four years now we have half as many bitcoins so if the price stays the same we have half the amount of new selling coming on to the market so um it's it's shocking that this is controversial in in the bitcoin space because you know people uh people have learned so much bad economics that uh uh this sounds controversial but yeah four years of dropping 1800 coins versus four years of dropping 900 coins a day is likely only to be resolved in one way which is that the average price in the next four years is going to be higher than the average price in the previous four years of course this assumes that demand for bitcoin does not tank it's it's quite possible to demand tanks but um you know demand needs to drop by half in order for the price to stay the same and so as long as demand doesn't drop by half for bitcoin every four years then ngu technology works and um in general like when you're looking at bitcoin and assessing it and trying to figure out where it's going are there any particular metrics that you like to watch i think really they're only well not only but the two most important metrics now well i'll add a third three uh the first one obviously is the price and a lot of people like to pretend you know we're here for the tech and that this is about technology the tech is the price that's it that this is bitcoin does one thing and it's uh the the price itself really the any i mean i think the the way that bitcoin uh grows and the way the bitcoin scales is through appreciation that's just how the system works and i think um you know people like to kind of virtual signal that you know we're not in it for the money we're in for the tech if you think the tech is anything other than the money then i don't think you're getting the tech you know this isn't uh as i argue in my book you know blockchain is is a spectacularly useless technology for pretty much everything uh except if you want to get bitcoin to work and and um the the higher the price goes the larger the value of cash balance is held in bitcoin the larger the opportunities for trade between people who both hold bitcoin and so uh the the higher the price the more bitcoin succeeds the more secure the network so make no mistake about it price is the most important metric the second metric for me is uh the number of nodes which we mentioned earlier um if the cost of running a bitcoin node rises significantly then you get a very big reduction in the number of nodes i would be very worried i would i would advise investors in this case if i'm not an investment advisor but if i were i'd tell people to you know be careful because um if bitcoin operates on 100 computers then it can be pretty straightforward to compromise it well maybe not enough straightforward but it would be much harder to compromise than it is right now and i would uh be far less uh secure about uh the amount of money that i have in it and that's um and then the third one would be uh transaction fees um bitcoin transaction fees which is always interesting to follow because it gives us a good indication about demand for transactions and how many transactions are taking place and i think in the long run um i think i think bitcoin transaction fees are likely to rise a lot and i think you know people uh need to prepare psychologically for the fact that bitcoin transactions you know they're going to be the monetary equivalent of chartering a uh you know a charter cargo ship it's not something you and i do uh you know i don't know how to charge chartered or cargo ship but uh all my clothes and my electronics and my furniture has been on cargo ships at some point and so it it's the underlying um infrastructure of a financial system i think the bitcoin blockchain so it's quite possible that uh transaction fees will continue to rise and where do you think bitcoin's future is going and when i say that i mean including how does it look with the current system of central banks um how do you see people transacting with bitcoin and um one other thing i wanted to ask about was you did say at one point that you thought central banks may buy bitcoin as a reserve currency and i was curious to hear how you thought that would go down i mean i mentioned it in the book as a possibility but i'm um you know with time i'm less and less uh convinced that this could happen i think it it does make sense on an intuitive sense uh in an intuitive way that you'd think well if you're a central bank and you want to settle payments with other central banks then uh you can use bitcoin and then you don't have to go through other central banks there is an element to that but i think you know we've had gold for the past 50 years and central banks still have been using the dollar i think there are the um the economies of scale for central banks and the network effects that uh they all settle with one another for dollars and they all use the same system so they all have to be on it and then it just makes sense to be on it plus of course you know the geopolitical aspect of um the us's geopolitical weight also um helps make people's mind up about wanting to be part of that system in general i think the the main reason i would say that i don't see central banks adopting bitcoin is because it is completely against their mental model of the world i i would not be surprised if central banks are the absolute last people in the world to get bitcoin in fact it might well be the case that you know 100 years from now if bitcoin takes over the world and we look at adoption by profession if somebody collects data on it i think we'll find that central bank is where the absolute last people to get uh bitcoin because you know it's uh it's it's really hard for the central banker whose entire job is predicated on the premise that government and the monopoly entity is needed uh in order to make money work it's very hard for them to take seriously the concept that actually the same thing that you do doesn't need you to be done it can be done with code you know that it's it's it's a it's it's like the taxi commission as coming to terms with uber they'll be the last to install the uber apps and the people in the taxi and limousine commission in new york city but you know uber is still uh yeah i i think that's there's a beautiful poetry uh to it i think it's it's it's great that the people who benefit the most from the current system and who are most heavily invested in the current system are also intellectually handicapped at understanding bitcoin which i think is wonderful because it uh it gives all the rest of us the chance to get a head start on them and um i think it's also you know the flip side of it is that people in places like lebanon and venezuela and zimbabwe are um you know their mental models of watching their national currency implode in front of them will uh put them in a much better place to be able to comprehend bitcoin's value proposition over the coming years and decades as it continues to grow and so this is uh a little bit off topic because we've only been talking about bitcoin but i did want to ask your opinion of something like ethereum um yeah i mean i i generally think uh all the other digital currencies don't uh really compete with bitcoin and are in in no way similar to bitcoin i think uh their real competition is uh if i'm being generous i'll say amazon web services and these kinds of platforms um and i think in in that sense you know the the notion of distributed cloud uh the notion of distributed blockchain uh computing for all kinds of other applications i've spent the last uh what is it now for five years uh basically waiting for somebody to show me a working application that needs blockchain or somebody show me somebody who paid a dime who made a dime of revenue um selling blockchain services so i think there's no scope for any kind of uh uses for blockchain technology other than creating a digital cache and i think the only real value proposition for a digital cash like bitcoin is the fact that nobody controls it the fact that it is immutable the fact that uh we can be very sure of the monetary policy and um i think the uh on the other hand the um the you know and bitcoin won this after many many years of many people trying and doing a lot of things to try and change things about bitcoin and failing miserably and changing it so on the other hand we've seen with all the other coins um you know it's quite trivial for them to organize a hard fork and that makes them more like a private company so essentially you're going with the currency issued by a private company and you're you're having to trust you're having to place trust in a small team of people there there are several single points of failure for uh other digital currencies other than bitcoin uh so you know no no nobody has the monetary policy guarantee and so beyond that to be perfectly honest everything else all the other buzzwords in the space are you know at best interesting high school projects but uh definitely not something that i think a serious investor should be uh there are no working prototypes for anything that has been uh working and but i think ethereum is the uh most amazingly guilty of this uh it's been what now five six years of shifting from one uh buzzword train to another so i'm i'm not quite optimistic that things will be different then incidentally just today on twitter um people have been people have spent about the the last day trying to find out how many tokens of ethereum there are out there and apparently nobody can answer that question nobody runs a node nobody has a code for it they have never even made a code for it so um yeah count me firmly in the camp of the skeptics when it comes to all other currencies all right well because this show really should be about bitcoin why don't we end on a bitcoin note do you want to make any predictions for what you think will happen in the next year in bitcoin i'd say every 10 minutes we're going to get a new block that's a cop-out that's a cop-out but i'll let you have it all right it's the only prediction i make on bitcoin okay all right well it was a good one i'm sure it will bear out where can people learn more about you and your work so i'm now independent i work on my own website safedean.com i've quit my university job and i
