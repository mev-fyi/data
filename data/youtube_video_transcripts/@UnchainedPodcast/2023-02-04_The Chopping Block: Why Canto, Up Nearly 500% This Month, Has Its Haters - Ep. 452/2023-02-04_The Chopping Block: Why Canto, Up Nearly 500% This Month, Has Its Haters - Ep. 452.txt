not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so let's kick it off with intros first we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next up we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound then we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at gauntlet and finally you've got myself I'm Steve the head hype man at dragonfly the four of us are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block.xyz for more disclosures so um we have all decided we've made a New Year's resolution that after the last couple shows we are going to do a moratorium on bankruptcy talk FTX talk we've covered a lot of that stuff this year and looking forward to 2023 we want to talk about something other than that crap for at least a while if you want to hear about bankruptcies I don't know there's other shows that are going to talk to you about bankruptcies but crypto is just so there's so much stuff going on in crypto I was telling these guys that uh so the FED just ended up hiking interest rates 25 basis points which got markets excited but everybody told me they don't want to talk about that because that's like that's going to be a little bit a little bit too boring for our Chase is that right guys yeah if you want to be uh you know macro Trader larper or you can go listen to all in um but this is this is the crypto pod you know all right all right that's fine um well there's been there's been a good slate of crypto news this week uh some of some of it more uh spicy than others maybe the place we can start is that one of the pieces of news that's been going on this week is that there's some drama in crypto Twitter about Bitcoin nfts so I did not know that Bitcoin nfts were a thing apparently they're not super they're kind of a thing um so it comes down to this project called ordinals uh which was launched by Casey Rod armor and uh the tldr is that there are these nfts on bitcoin that basically they are being uh so you you have like a Satoshi which is the smallest unit possible on bitcoin that you can transfer um so you take this one Satoshi and this one Satoshi when you transfer it it has some metadata that you shove into the witness that is like okay here's the here's what the nft is here's what it does here's the color the size or whatever metadata you put with the nft and so all this stuff is is not sort of depending on how you how you qualify the um the witness which is you know it's uh the witnesses can now be larger in Bitcoin thanks to Taproot they don't necessarily have to be persistent on chain but a lot of people do persist these Witnesses so that's where this meditate this nft metadata is going and it is making people in Bitcoin land mad they are mad that there are some people who are shoving this nft data into Bitcoin Witnesses because it's quote-unquote clogging up the chain so now these ordinals in absolute terms they're not super popular there's a ton of volume right now I think going through these Bitcoin nfts but there's a lot of argument about it um let's have a dancing baby one uh these are beautiful amazing absolutely beautiful um wow what are you guys thoughts on the ordinals drama uh and Bitcoin people getting mad about nfts I I just don't understand why any Bitcoin supporter would be mad if people are using the Bitcoin blockchain I think uh one of the most hilarious thing is actually so there's a meme about hitting the witness size limit uh which is like a little around four Megs and we actually just did it an hour ago before this recording so like Wednesday February 1st around five-ish between five and six pm like in the last hour ish uh was the first block and it cost 0.01 BTC it was like basically nothing for filling the whole block so who don't like Big Blocks they're just kind of they're just kind of mad people about everything it's like it's like the Luke Dash Jr the Adam Bach Etc cabal but you know I think like this brings up a very interesting point about blockchain upgrades you know people in hard Forks like you know what ethereum has and you know Solana seems to have unintentionally every few weeks is is like you you make quite drastic changes including to the block size like how many transactions you're allowed to have per block but you do it in a way that people expect people sort of expect those changes ethereum wallets expected EIP 1559 ethereum user is expected changes to transaction fees when hard Fork to add such a change took place in Bitcoin historically people have been quite resistant to it but one interesting thing I would say I observed about the nft move of 2021 is a Bitcoin maximalist loved nfts they may have been like D5 it's just Finance again but they seem to really love nfts and I I had observed a lot of Bitcoin maximalists or self-proclaimed Bitcoin maximalists really going wild on buying nfts and making nft add-ons and stuff like that and so I think this just is a testament to like hey if the community really wants this and you made a mistake with not being very careful about block size then you might never really control your block size in some way there's a social element to that that I think is it's rearing its head here it's it's honestly bizarre to me one that this is such a I mean in a way the story that like the story here is not really that Bitcoin nfts are taking off right that's not actually what's happening it's more that there it's like the story is the story about the story that people are mad that this is happening which is which is kind which very much does speak to the psychology of Bitcoin Maximus but it's also I mean as look as Venture capitalists like you know all of us are investors and we've all seen a kajillion pitches for oh this thing happening on ethereum we're going to put it on bitcoin where people are more virtuous than just and that's where it should really happen right so like oh you should get a roll up and somehow get that into Bitcoin or you should get a game and somehow launch on a Bitcoin or D5 of course there was a whole generation of D5 and Bitcoin that certain investors were just you know there were certain funds that just loved funding Define Bitcoin and now we've got nfts on bitcoin but it's always kind of half-hearted and it's always followed by this trail of people who are just mad that it's happening and then people who are like oh great now that it's here you don't need any other blockchains thank God we have nfts on bitcoin because it we finally invalidated the need for every other blockchain it just seems so angry right I guess that's the one word that I feel like not Bitcoin itself but the Bitcoin sort of community of the Bitcoin Maxi Community it's just they always have something to be angry about and it seems like this is the this is the thing du jour to be angry about yeah I think there's I forget who the quote was from but one of these articles talking about I would a Bitcoin contributor being incensed that people would like use the blockchain for anything than than you know transferring Bitcoin but you know it's like if anything Bitcoin is in such a dire need of more transaction fees and more volume obviously to offset the reduction in emissions I think unfortunately this is not really picked up yet but if anything they should be applauding this right like you should want people to use your blockchain and be willing to pay for it to like you know maintain its security and yet like that hasn't really happened yet I mean I just I just can't see this kind of thing working long term uh I mean like Bitcoin like all these auxiliary uses of Bitcoin or auxiliary uses Bitcoin block space I should say they just don't make sense right like Bitcoin was not designed for this yeah you can do it but why would you do it you know like I I like the community just isn't there the infrastructure isn't there the discovery isn't there the you know the the community is not there the community hates this like look at all these Bitcoin Maxes just like yelling at people to get off their lawn like of course this is not gonna happen yeah it reminds me a little bit of um what was people restoring weather data on bsv that's right I mean but that's I I feel like that's emblematic of the the way in which Bitcoin has just scared off any application Level Innovation you know like it when when people try to use Bitcoin block space and they were using Bitcoin cash or using Bitcoin SV it just becomes the butt of a joke you know and ethereum I mean that's the one thing I will give credit to ethereum and its Brethren is that nobody ever really complains when people do dumb stuff on ethereum I mean they kind they kind of do a little bit if it's like particularly noisy you know I remember back when F coin uh which was this big trade Mining Exchange was taking place in theorem people got mad about that you know funnel 3D people got mad about fun with 3D I remember but for the most part in ethereum land you just kind of Take Your Love he's like yeah this crazy thing's happening on chain you know it is what it is you know there's like Bonk on Solana people were getting mad about that for a little while and then they're like oh yeah I mean I guess it's good for us that people are doing some stupid you know some other stupid meme coin and I feel like that's the right attitude if you don't have that attitude you just can't really engender this kind of innovation I mean Innovation is a strong word for it but you know ultimately it is innovation right like if you don't let an nft Marketplace pop up it's actually very Innovative to have like you know in Bitcoin land they have had this thing called op return which effectively lets you write a piece of data to the Bitcoin blockchain but you as a node operator can decide not to store things held by operator so you can parse the entire blockchain but you can kind of prune or throw away out throw away such data and there's always this this huge fight over whether to make it bigger or not you know um Jeremy Rubin who just actually retired as a Bitcoin developer who's who's kind of been around Bitcoin development for a very long time you know he was trying to get a sort of complicated extension that would have sort of allowed some type of smart contract like covenants to be uh added and some of it relied on op return and that was like voted down after you know years of lobbying that was the years of lobbying and I think it's very creative that someone figured out that hey Taproot actually accidentally allowed you to do things that you thought you would do that way I it's just I think at some level this might actually spur a lot of innovation per se that will maybe not keep the Maxis happy but I do get the feeling that there's like a a large contingent of people who are really excited about this larger than I thought yeah I think Innovation it's more like catch-up growth almost right where it's like you import Innovations from other chains and you try them out and see if they take off in your country and so far the answer is that well the people in this country seem to hate it they seem to Hate Everything But I don't think people seem to hate I don't think like I just think they're not gonna stop loving the meme of spamming the blockchain right now fair enough well I think the the uh the The Village Elders hate it maybe it's a better way to put the politicians but the interesting thing about the Bitcoin politicians is like I actually do feel like one one virtue of Bitcoin is that the politics their thoughts don't matter as much anymore or like it doesn't seem like their thoughts have mattered for uh seriously for a very long time um outside of these kind of like core Dev type of issues and like the thought leader people aren't haven't even really committed much to to development in some sense they may have a long time ago but yeah that's true Robert do you um what is your view on like Bitcoin startups like people who are trying to Launch stuff on bitcoin I mean there's a lot of stuff on bitcoin right every exchange that supports Bitcoin is something on bitcoin right coinbase is on bitcoin right anything that uses Bitcoin is on bitcoin like there's a million startups you know that use Bitcoin in some way as an asset which I consider in some degree a Bitcoin startup right okay okay you know what I mean though you know what I mean like D5 on bitcoin nfts on bitcoin what do you think of that well I don't think it's a fertile ground for defy you know yes any Bitcoin Maxi listening can find some possible way that it could be used right to build anything right um just like you know theoretically like almost any low-level language like assembly like at a certain point you know you can make a turn complete system with it and therefore build anything but it's not the right tool for the job if you're going to build defy or something complicated Bitcoin is not the blockchain to build it on in my opinion I think it's great for the one use case it has which is transferring value between parties and that's the value proposition that's the narrative that's the value of it right I don't think it's going to be using this as the foundation for complex systems Beyond just transferring value so fair enough I I I would think any startup that's like oh we're going to use this you know in this crazy way it's like well why would that be your choice as opposed to all the other choices available yeah yeah I think there's a lot of I saw this a lot in 20 um 2017 2018 and then again a little bit in 2020 and I think it kind of fell off after that I think this idea that a lot of very Earnest Founders who are okay they like okay I'm gonna learn about crypto and of course the first place you start is you learn about Bitcoin because Bitcoin you know it's a granddaddy it's the biggest blockchain uh in terms of market cap and you see that all the people who invented Bitcoin and are talking about Bitcoin and developing Bitcoin they say all this other stuff is bad and you need to you know genuflect and you know come pray at the altar of Bitcoin which means that you know you should you should do what the Bitcoin Maxes tell you to do which is you know don't don't you know uh unnecessarily depend on other blockchains and the the thing about the Trap that I think that they set is that although they sort of tell you there's almost like this Purity ritual of like only use Bitcoin only settle to bitcoin do all this stuff just for Bitcoin there are no users who will go along with it right so people will tell you oh if you do this then everyone will be happy with you and you'll be in the good graces of the Bitcoin high priest but then people will not actually use your product for that that right so all these things I see especially of like really smart PhD guys we're like I should do what the advisors tell me to do it's almost like they see the Bitcoin and Maxes of like their PHD advisors and they're like okay this is a blockchain that settles back to bitcoin or that gains it's there's some root of trust in Bitcoin or there's some other thing in Bitcoin and normal users just don't give a [ __ ] like they don't care they won't use your blockchain because it does XYZ with Bitcoin and so you need to have something actually unique or interesting from a user experience perspective to get people to actually use it otherwise the main thing you're going to get is just arguments like that's most of what you get if you like you know do something in a way that just totally appeases the Bitcoin Community is that people Bitcoin Maxes will argue about it on Twitter and then we'll if it's a big enough argument we'll talk about it on the show and that's pretty much I mean I think you also get a lot of like fake Roll-Ups and like or fake roll-up like things on bitcoin versus like and maybe have bip 300 pass oh wait actually you know developers never you know the Bitcoin core devs don't don't want to add it and instead you get all these like half-assed sort of like bridge-like constructs to other chains that like to herself Proclaim themselves as Bitcoin enabled and then like okay fine they're just running the ethereum virtual machine or they're running some other virtual machine then but they might as well just be their own chain they're just like there's some dogma of like yeah brand Affinity Association Affinity marketing and I mean that not necessarily in a positive context towards such things that gets them off the ground but then never gets them real users exactly exactly well okay so speaking of speaking of D5 one of the big stories this week has been the surge in activity and a price around Kanto let's talk about Kanto what is Kanto so Kanto is a layer one blockchain uh that was that was built uh by these sort of not totally Anon but like kind of you're very vaguely and on it's supposed to be a fair launch the term Fair launch I think has evolved we were just talking about that before the show started that I thought Fair launch meant that there was no pre-mine uh but now Fair my fair launch essentially means that there's no VCS um so it's you know there's like a 13 pre-mine and then you know the whatever standard token L1 launch um so Kanto it's a cosmos SDK basically a fork of evmos uh it's an evm based uh chain on the cosmos SDK and the real Innovation behind Kanto is particularly around governance what Canto does is it has these D5 Primitives that are built into the chain uh that are special they're special because they are uh built directly into the chain and they're subsidized by the protocol rewards themselves so that they never need to turn on fees quote unquote right so you know uniswap on ethereum has a fee switch eventually the fees will get turned on and the protocol has some token that's going to you know capture excess fees over and above what it's paying out to LPS you know same with compound Ave these other Primitives that are maker now these are The Primitives that are on the Chain the idea in Kanto is like well we already know that every blockchain needs a lending protocol every blockchain needs a you know a DEX every blockchain needs some kind of stable coin so we're going to build these directly into the protocol and we're going to subsidize them and not let them take fees so these are going to be quote unquote feeless now you still pay gas for interacting with these contracts but there are no uh there are no sort of there's no token there's no fees for the decks for the lending protocol and for the stablecoin that's the first Innovation the second Innovation is around this thing called contract secured Revenue which is basically this idea that if you launch a contract um when people pay fees interacting with your contract the percentage of those fees go directly to the contract deployer into in this nft and then you can sell the nft they can do whatever they want but basically they get sort of royalties for launching a contract that people want to interact with and the idea is like well some people are creating public goods by deploying these contracts or libraries or whatever it is and Kanto enforces that some percentage of the fees paid to these contracts goes to the contract employer in whatever way they choose to to use it and so Kanto got a bunch of excitement over the last couple weeks uh the the prices rallied like 300 plus percent variant announced that they were purchasing a bunch of Canto and then people have gotten excited there's been a lot of activity around nfts on Kanto that are getting some attention so I I am not actually a fan of Kanto I don't I don't I don't I don't agree with a lot of the innovations that they've made I think we've actually seen some of these Innovations and other forms on other blockchains but before I start [ __ ] on Kanto curious what your guys thoughts are seeing what's been going on in the Kanto ecosystem well I'll be forced to be the Kanto defender in this conversation if you know the rest of the group is anti-canto uh I'll have a can-do attitude instead okay that was like that was the worst dad joke I've heard on this show period yeah yeah I'm trying to you know break new grounds here I I think fundamentally it's interesting you know from the two differentiators that you pointed out and you know I think at scale I think potentially you know the latter one is actually the most interesting which is you know royalties for contract deployers I think you know on ethereum everyone is sort of forced into this like launch a token mindset for everything that gets built just at some point it has to have a token right even though certain things get used constantly recycled adapted whatever like a great example is there's a lot of effort that's gone into weth just like a simple wrapper around ether over the years there's nine versions of web in existence historically because we're on wet nine right there's other people making their own versions of it and the hard works that has gone into it has not been rewarded would there be more innovation in like simple generic contracts like weth if you got paid for it yes there'd probably be you know for like these basic things that like wind up being Super Hyper composable right like Fierce competition to build the best version of it possible right there might be significant strides made there and so you know I kind of squint and say like well what would exist that doesn't exist in that framework and it's like yeah like there might be like going back to what makes defy on ethereum originally Specialists like this composability and like if there was more things that were just built for free and put out there and you got paid you know based on their usage without having to go through like any token process like I think there'd be just a lot more creative ideation development and you know building um so I I think that one's actually super positive I think the there's three D5 Primitives that all run off of one token is pretty crazy in a I don't think that will actually work long-term way but I do like that the contract secured Revenue yeah okay so here's my here's my here's my here's my counter to that okay so actually uh uh there was a blockchain that did that before which is near so near actually does this contract secured Revenue thing and um I was actually quite firmly against it you know I love nier but this particular concept I don't like the reason why I don't like it um they're sort of kind of broad economic reasons why I don't think this is to be fair let's see you you have uh previously not you have defended against Creator royalties so I'm imagining there's some correlation in these arguments it's quite different I think it's quite different than creative royalties great royalties are more about like a bunch of marketplaces you know forcibly basically like you know coercing a certain type of Market structure together I think I think the reason why I don't like creative royalties are different the in the case of these sort of critical contract royalties really what's happening here is that the uh the blockchain is enforcing subsidies it's basically saying like you know it's kind of like farmer subsidies right it's like saying hey these people who are doing this this work are not being sufficiently rewarded by the market and I can tell because I am the government right I am the layer one blockchain I can tell that contract employers aren't getting paid enough normally in a free market what we assume is that people who are generating value are getting paid for it in one way or another right and so here there's this conviction that well people who deploy contracts aren't getting paid enough so we are going to force people to pay the the folks take money away from the miners right so miners normally be getting this money or validators um we're taking money away from the validators and saying no no instead we are going to pay this extra money to the contract employers and we can tell how much they should get paid right so the protocol sets a split between the validators and the contract employers now what should that split be and how do you know what that split should be right so right now I think it's like 20 uh I think it's like 80 20 but obviously it's configurable by the protocol and so it's like okay how do you know that it's supposed to be 80 20 and it wasn't supposed to be 2080. how do you know it was supposed to be 50 50. how do you know maybe 100 of it should have gone to the contracted players and none of it should gone to validators now the validators at the end of the day right the validators they will charge because validators are commodified like block space is commodified on blockchains so validators especially when blocks are not full they are going to charge whatever their opportunity cost is right so if their opportunity cost is let's say a penny they will charge each transaction a penny and they don't care if you're also paying for the contract deploy right if if you're paying a penny if the if the sorry if the validator is charging you a penny and you're like well 20 of it has to go to the the the the contract uh deployer then the value would say okay well your fees are you know 1.2 pennies because I don't give a [ __ ] where else you're sending money so really what you're doing is you're taxing the user in order to say like oh well the contract employer needs to also get 20 cents okay now now you're right okay that this allows people who deploy public goods to get paid in a world where they otherwise weren't getting paid what does that do though I mean to my mind there's always competition competition never goes away because you introduce a subsidy but the competition now occurs at a different level what is the competition going to be now now the competition is okay we know for example that there are a lot of people who use shared libraries something like safe math right I mean we don't need safe math anymore but you know imagine safe not safe math at one point was like one of the most used libraries on ethereum a lot of people now are competing to be safe math and there's no innovation in safe math right like it's it's a very very simple library that almost like you said almost everybody uses but to be the person who deploys the safe math there's a lot of competition because that person is going to make a lot of fees and so now you're gonna have people campaigning hey use my safe math don't use this other person safe math if you use my safe math I'm going to kick you back you know five percent of the fees that I make because my safe math is better than theirs or you get people you know fighting to have their safe math included in the most attractive uh developer libraries basically you get a lot of competition around basically rent seeking right this is not useful for anyone to have people competing over this and second now you have interest or if you have incentives to uh politic over the fee split because the fee split is pure subsidy right so in the same way as you have you know Farmers fighting over hey there should be a farmer subsidy you're going to have more and more developers fighting over this the CSR subsidy increasing so they can capture more revenue and the point is like what what problem was this solving why is this good for overall economic efficiency in a blockchain for people to be fighting over this stuff right at the end of the day I think there's we should have a very strong reason to overcome the assumption that a free market doesn't solve these public goods incentives in reality we see public goods totally being provisioned on ethereum I've never heard anyone say you know the problem with ethereum is that people aren't writing enough smart contract libraries you know that that doesn't seem to be a problem that needs solving and so I think you should have very strong burden of proof to overcome to say hey this problem is not being solved by the free market we need to introduce subsidies and we have good information about how those subsidies should be structured and I think that's just not the case which is why I don't like this CSR concept I guess uh my maybe a simpler version of that is just more it's very hard to design incentives for any of these programs without just encouraging wash trading effectively right where you're like oh like it imagine you you gave developers some fraction of transaction fees of like function calls then people are incentivized to make like many nested function calls uselessly so that they get and and like drive volume to that it kind of kind of similar to what you're saying with in terms of politicking but to be fair the politicking thing happens already even without blockchains in open source software you know if you look at a lot of like big companies libraries that they make there's effectively a politicking that goes on within package managers and within developer tools to kind of get theirs featured or get theirs put up front so that stuff is almost the same as what you see I'm more worried about these like draw fee distribution things that end up just like incentivizing really bad or parasitic contracts in some ways and like no one's ever come up with the Intensive compatible version of that I'm a very a very funny uh note is um there's a famous paper by Susan Athey and Glenn Ellison who's the father of Caroline Ellison even though I know this is a banned topic of Alameda watch where you're going through who who who which is about how open source software like Revenue splitting should like end as an equilibrium so it's like actually kind of ironic that her dad sort of oh interesting what is it what is the claim of the paper I think the claim is just more this type of thing you're talking about which is like it you have unlike closed Source software you have this like extra cost for having to figure out which library is best and like the market has to figure out how to converge to like oh these particular libraries are really good these ones aren't good and that extra cost gets it passed on as an inefficiency cost but it sort of reaches a fairer outcome so they're sort it's sort of like a blockchain right where it's like you are paying a lot more to operate the system but you get and and you know that's just the cost of sort of decentralization or having many participants but you get this extra benefit in terms of fairness and then there's kind of this trade-off between like how much are you willing to pay per unit civil resistance or fairness like in their case I have some notion of that so the reason I bring this up is like even in their paper they're like from 2013 they're like it's very hard to make these things incentive compatible and none of the programs I've seen have even heard of this heard that people have tried to study this a lot before which makes me even more negative because there are some lessons to learn there have been some companies have sponsored different types of Grants and open source especially Google and a lot of them didn't work very well because they were gamed for the incentive and so yeah Google summer of code I think in particular was one that was pointed out in this paper is having some like the years that they gave some Financial incentives were sort of gamed but the the main point being like I don't I think like if we even if you had such a mechanism I think it would be hard the thing I find a little more annoying is that there's this like ethos that's portrayed and I I think I drunkenly rant it at one of the cabal founders of Kanto in person uh a few months ago about this where their whole ethos is like hey we have no extractive fee tokens in our chain and initially they were actually like oh we're gonna like have no fees at all which that part made no sense and it lasted about all of one day because they were getting ddosed on day one and two there were literally no fees was in like no gas fees no no no no like uniswap fees like like there was this vision of this idea of like oh like liquidity providers would come because they're Kanto stakers and Kanto stakers are already earning Canto fees so like they would add liquidity for free because it would they would be earning more in fees so basically saying like hey we want to just only reward Mev and like not application users at all which didn't yeah so at the office you can go look at the early days of the block Explorer and see who the liquidity providers are it was only the stakers but yeah they they moved away from that but there's like no extractive token thing I find to be a bit of a farce because in some ways all they're doing is putting all the extraction back into the Kanto token again via this minor extractable value instead of in the application then you get into this sort of incentive Loop where now the developers of applications are basically getting nothing and unless they're also Kanto validators and the Canto validators are taking like 99 of that always and so I I find this this kind of ethos weird I also am just like okay so you're saying you don't need another extractive token but your network is living on an extractive token because all of its revenue is coming from like Mev because you're not allowing the applications to really take much more so so I to me it's always been this like contradiction where the people who are sponsoring it I think they have a very Kumbaya happy-go-lucky ethos about it but if you squint a little bit it's very much not that and I don't you know I don't know what to say other than that your uh your your comment on the open source thing kind of reminded me of um have you ever seen like the npm uh tipping functionality uh do you know what I'm talking about yeah yeah yeah we we need to we need to start that but for for crypto you know it's like you do a uniswap trade and you know you give a little throw a little tip in and you know send it over the protocol and they can uh do whatever they want which is a way to say thanks for using this great piece of Open Source software well you know there's not even open source things that do that so like public.com is like a Robin Hood competitor they make their money by saying like after every trade they're like do you want to donate money to us really yeah after every single trade they're like we gave you that trade for free like you have to uncheck Little Boxes like donate like as a thank you and it's like it winds up being like way more than you would ever pay on any other brokerage if you like oh wow that's fascinating so yeah so so I think uh uh two things about the the Tipping functionality sorry so so what Tom was talking about is npm is this package manager for JavaScript where if you're going to use someone else's open source code it kind of handles standardizing and what version you're using and making sure you're using the one you're saying you're using kind of a lot of like administrative details and they have this function that allows you to tip and I I think like there's there's also some like lightning specific version of this that allows you to send lightning tips because lightning has decided the Tipping is its number one use case but an interesting thing is that in ethereum at some point I actually think there is a sort of somewhat valid way of Designing one of these systems in that ethereum is going to have fee structures that are going to get much more complicated in the sense that there's going to have they're going to have many dimensions so right now gas prices are there's a a base fee which is sort of like the minimum fee you pay and then there's a tip so you can to accelerate your transaction you can pay a tip but you're doing that uniformly across all usage so you're paying the same base fee and tip for storage compute whatever it sort of gets homogenized into one number as gas but um I think a lot of the designs are actually moving to separating you know the cost for storage the cost for compute the cost for other resources like generating certain types of proofs certain types of aggregations and in that world you could imagine reward you know having different rates of tipping for the different components and that would would sort of end up flowing through to the applications that are the most efficient at using the blockchain like if you want to disincentivize storage you basically make tipping much higher go up higher for storage uh like the amount you need and so I I think there is a weird sort of way in which we are moving towards this reality but the accelerationism without thinking using your brain seems a little bit too too much right now yeah I um yeah I just feel like yeah it sort of comes back to this like uh uh you know uh price versus value kind of kind of idea and it's like charging or summarizing People based on like gas usage for for Kanto effectively is like just almost totally orthogonal to like value creation and like how much of that should be captured and so you know it's like you look at the top gas burners on like ethereum like I would not necessarily say those are always like the best applications or like things that should be incentivized but that is kind of where you're bringing that out but the thing that I feel like we sort of skipped over when we started talking about Kanto is actually kind of the the loser of the story which is evos which you know has been in development you know since like 2017 2018 and then I'm kind of like they they like [ __ ] up their airdrop or something or there was some there's some drama around like the district their drop caused their consensus to fail and then they had to like shut down the network yeah and now I'm looking and Kanto is actually approaching uh atmos's fdv so it's it's kind of a sad story that like this fork with some like tweets basically is like kind of kind of you know coasting off of a lot of hard work to get you have those working yeah ironically the public good that actually needs to be rewarded is outside the blockchain so unfortunately it was just you know like Atmos did most the development work and Innovation I mean look I I do I do respect having some governance level Innovation I think that's something that has been underexplored but I just think like all these ideas are not where it's at um like I I don't want to go into much of a rant about the the last piece which is the uh the uh as you were mentioning the sort of the tokens all being under Kanto as opposed to having their own kind of native applications but to me it's just sort of the the blockchain playing favorites and deciding that these applications are enshrined in the blockchain they're sort of nationalized quote unquote it's kind of like this blockchain level industrial policy and which implies that it's like okay we're done we're done with dexes we found the right one it's this and nobody better try out innovating us because we're going to support this at the protocol level same thing with the lending protocols right if anybody comes up with any more Innovation around lending protocols [ __ ] you we already figured it out we know this is the one that we want and you know what else is there to do like we already have the end result and by the way it's a company which exactly like like which is exactly the problem right because now there's there's zero incentive to go launch a new uh lending protocol or any Improvement on a lending protocol because the freaking government already decided no this is the one that's won and there's a reason why economists are like hey industrial policy is a very scary term you should be very careful to engage in industrial policy unless you're very sophisticated about it Kanto is really like the USSR plus the cultural revolution [Laughter] uh yes I I think that's a very Stark way to analogize it I don't know it's quite that bad but it's it's I think it's not ideal right because ultimately look blockchains are not that old like there's so much more Innovation that's going to take place at the base layer like why would you decide that hey we figured it out we know what they're like the entrepreneurs go away there's nothing no if you want to build a landing protocol go somewhere else I think the the analogy again to like this this like the how the economics and some of these blockchains is changing uh to base layer is that you know governments can streamline policy by doing things like let's say the chips act and incentivizing people who are improving semiconductors so like so they they get a lower gas cost right but they still you know anyone can try to join that race but there's you know the governments decide they get a lower gas cost and in some ways I think that's the only incentive thing you can do is like adjust how much you're allowing like certain parts of the blockchain to be cheaper and certain parts would be more expensive and governance and frequently update says without making any judgment on exactly the thing you're doing with those changes in costs versus like you know the heavy-handed like Deng xiaopeng trying to like you know walk the tightrope between capitalism and communism it's a good way to put it yeah that that is what I feel like Kanto is it's like this tightrope between capitalism and and redistribution and I think one should be very very careful especially this early and especially in that level where you're directly interceding into like core protocol Primitives and saying these we know what should happen this is very Sim it's very Central planningy and I just think that's it's fraud right like as you mentioned tarun initially they were like oh no no fees on the whole are bad we should just remove all fees in terms of like oh wait that totally breaks the economy never mind never mind never mind we're gonna we're gonna walk that back and you know kind of introduce some fees but not quite this one and you're just gonna very clumsily end up you know kind of breaking things at the margin without without being able to tell to be fair like I do like the idea of experimenting more with like baking more stuff in um at the base layer like I think ethereum has been very conservative with this with respect to like what is a sort of trying primitive like West being a great example like it is so [ __ ] annoying that like you can't you know transfer either like you have to like rap ether and then you obviously can't do multiple like transactions or multiple calls within a single transaction so you use a proxy and like and they used to set the like it's just like so many things break because like we don't have this concept of like you know approvals and transfers natively and granted there are trade-offs to that I don't I'm not saying it's you know absolutely should have been made or like liquid staking being another example of this where like every other blockchain that has either mistake has liquid staking built in you know pretty much at the base layer not everyone but most I need has not which creates this whole sort of liquid staking Market but like you know there's it's it's not sort of either or like there's there's more room in the Spectrum I think so you're saying the liquid staking Market is is analogy analysis August to the US doesn't necessarily provide health care so now there's a health care Market but it doesn't necessarily mean that its outcome is better yeah yeah I mean it's like um you know I I don't know where like what heuristic you want to use to think about you know what should be uh uh in a layer one and what shouldn't but like it feels like there's probably room for more exploration there um I don't think they can't delete it okay so the equivalent on ethereum of this kind of industrial policy is pre-compiles right so pre-compiles are basically when so normally when you have some application code it runs in the evm the evm is slow and clunky and whatever um sometimes ethereum decides hey this piece of code is so important that we are going to write a special version of this code that actually doesn't normally run on the evm it sort of is uh we just kind of give it a fast path so that it runs faster in native code without having to actually execute on the evm as it normally would and that allows certain things to become much cheaper than they would otherwise be if they were implemented in evm and then there's a lot of arguments in politicking in ethereum about what should be pre-compiled and what should not be that you know it is a little bit fraud it is in some sense it is a subsidy on certain kinds of code over others right but that feels me like the right level of saying hey this thing is really important we should make it faster or make it better but we should not enshrine these things directly into the protocol so I remember there was this big debate on the eth Research Forum like this was a few years ago maybe a couple years ago where Justin Drake was proposing putting oracles directly into the beacon chain right do you guys remember this and there was this big argument between vitalik and Dustin Drake but this idea that the protocol itself should not enshrine any particular application because for precisely the reason that I just stated which is that if it does it's impossible for private actors to innovate right if you put oracles directly into the beacon chain so that you know all the validators are reporting you know the price of gold the price of the US dollar the price of ether blah blah blah then like there's no chain link there's no way you can have a chain link there's no way you can have any other private actors getting better oracles than what is built into the base layer and the principle of ethereum from the beginning and maybe this is you know I think I can take the argument that maybe okay ethereum shouldn't do this but maybe other change should do this but in ethereum's case the philosophy has always been that ethereum should be neutral it should be as neutral as possible among applications and let the best application win it makes sense that there's some application Civic chains that don't do that obviously you know if you're building a maker dial chain okay well that's going to have maker dab built into the base layer um or if you have a roll up that's dedicated to an application okay that's going to have its own customized VM but if you're building a generalized blockchain like what Kanto presumably is trying to be then it should be generalized it should not enshrine certain applications directly into the base layer yeah I agree I think the application Level is is probably too deep um I think you know you talk about pre-compiles I think frankly like uh op code gas costs are like another one that feels kind of random frankly in terms of how these get priced and yet those are also effectively sort of subsidies or encouraged certain terms of activity that that's exactly what I'm saying I think the the the fiscal policy of a blockchain is choosing those adjusting those optimizing those making them you know more flexible and that's sort of the few clearly the easiest way of incentivizing certain behaviors I think eip4844 for adding blobs is a great example of this right it's incentivizing a particular type of use case that doesn't cause certain types of externalities on validators who are validating Kanto on the other hand feels like it wants to internalize all of those and I don't really see how that is a very good long-term decision but you know it's crypto people will try anything yeah if you look if you're doing fiscal policy you want to Define long-term goals which is that we want to move toward Roll-Ups right that's what eip4844 ultimately does it makes Roll-Ups cheaper um and it's with the understanding of that broad kind of policy goal that ethereum sort of does these small nudges at you know okay let's reprice this op code let's add this you know particular change what a fume does not do which would be something that I can imagine other blockchain doing is saying look one of the most used contracts on ethereum is uniswap let's just make uniswap a pre-compile right and so that unit swap so effectively nobody can compete with uniswap because the gas fees for you to swap will be so much lower than anybody who innovates on it which basically is the equivalent of what Kanto is doing is building into the [ __ ] base layer or C Port right C Port they're an ad they've nationalized all industry exactly exactly that's exactly what they're doing and look when you do that you pick winners and you distort incentives to innovate and ethereum has been very wise I think in not doing that and of course if you did it it would be more efficient right now at this moment it would be more efficient but two years from now three years from now when the next unit swap the next Seaport the next big idea in blockchains when when that new idea comes along and there's no pre-compile for that all of a sudden these things are not competing on a Level Playing Field and the best idea doesn't win and that I think is what you should be afraid of when you're engaging in this kind of industrial policy in an area like blockchain that's moving so fast and innovating so quickly you know to get back to to the Bitcoin nft thing the idea of like these like user chosen soft Forks uh I think ethereum will probably end up in this world where like like staking derivatives they're in some ways a user chosen soft fork and so something like eigenlayer and in general if if valuers want to opt in to participating in to enshrining certain applications that pay them it makes sense but it should never kind of be forced and I think at least that's my personal view is like if you're doing that then like why do you need a blockchain like you might as well just go back to to postgres there you go just do it all in Excel sheets um okay well speaking of opting in uh another one of the controversies this week was around our good old pal layer zero so layer zero for uh those of you who are unaware their zero is an interoperability protocol it was backed very famously by Sequoia and by you know the the now defunct FTX but uh layer zero there was a there was an exploit that was um or sorry exploit maybe is is a wrong word but whatever there was a controversy around this exploit that was revealed by by James prestwich who was previously at uh or I think currently still at Nomad and uh James pointed out so it's well known that the security model of layer 0 is that layer zero separates out these concept between an Oracle and a relayer and uh the Oracle is somebody who is so in Crossroad interactions right the Oracle needs to tell you what is the state of what's going on inside the blockchain and the relayer sends the actual message right it says okay here's the you know I'm sending the message from A to B from you know ethereum to Avalanche or whatever it is and these two people as long as the two of them are not colluding with each other the security model of layer zero is supposed to be that okay you're protected as long as one of the two the relayer or the Oracle are being honest then you you are good and um what what press which revealed there is another element of layer zero that is trusted which is uh this Library known as the proof library and this proof Library basically what it does it decodes messages and this proof library is effectively you can think of it as a as a pointer to a proof library that is configurable by anybody who's integrating layer 0. so when you integrate layer 0 there are actually three important parameters there's a bunch of other ones but three important ones one is which relayer you're using second is which Oracle you're using and the third is which proof Library you're using and there's only one proof library that anybody uses which is designated by the layer0 team and has its own they have admin keys that can control it and they have swapped this proof library in place multiple times to basically edit messages on the fly in order to basically you know do a protocol upgrade change the way that certain things work or something like that that's my understanding of roughly what what he revealed here and so the the the the the bombshell supposedly is that lizard was doing this without uh notifying anybody of it I mean nobody really was able to look that deeply into what layer 0 was doing in terms of you know the individual libraries and their Protocols of course they're the ones working on it nobody else is and uh the claim is that this was not disclosed this was not in their security model this was not stated anywhere but layer zero has been using this kind of underneath the hood in order to basically do protocol upgrades on the fly now Zero's defense is that well this was known this is actually one of the things that's in the config if you want to change it you can you can use your own proof library or you can like hard code a proof library at a certain version if you want to but this is just the default because most people want us to handle their security and not themselves handle their security so the the story from the layer zero side is that this is not a problem this is a totally standard usage of the protocol and and this is totally you know this is very explicitly what our security model has been you guys are just sharing stirring up [ __ ] because you're a competitor so I was trying to read up to understand the details around this because it's a little bit opaque if you're not in layer zero land but um one of the there was there was a great tweet thread uh by this guy a bartek where he basically um did a little bit of on-chain data analytics to see how many people are using layer zero and what are they doing for their defaults and according to him there are I believe 185 applications that are using layer zero and of them like only five of them have changed any of the defaults meaning that basically they're using the default relayer and the default Oracle I believe both of which are run by layer 0 Labs uh sorry they're 10 apps out of 185 that have changed the defaults in any way four of them are Boba Network a few of them are basically like tests they're sort of test applications that are not actually running in production uh which basically means that pretty much everything that's in production is using the defaults which effectively implies that this is the layer 0 security model so anyway it's a little bit inside baseball I think this whole back and forth I'm like not totally clear how much of a bombshell this actually is this also sounds like what almost every application is doing which is that they have these defaults and if people really looked underneath the hood they realize that okay it's putting quite a lot of trust in the admin Keys um but I don't know what what has your guys take been on this layer zero kerfuffle I did not vote on the uh uniswap poll because I thought there was a lot of things happening on both sides that I thought uh Robert you want to give some background in this unit swap poll yes well this is directly related to you know layer zero uh so the unit swap poll is that just closed there was this death match so to speak between Wormhole and layer zero both trying to be selected to provide the bridging services for uniswap to be able to launch on financing because Finance chain is a new zone for uniswap to operate in pancake Swap and other dexes are the du jour you know trading venues on binance chain you know swap has never had a presence there and they have to bridge their governance process over to binance chain because there is no native uni token on there that you can vote with you know they're gonna have to vote on ethereum where the uni token lives using their governance contracts and have that process passed over to finance chain and so who does that bridging has been this Fierce debate and layer zero and Wormhole and a couple others including seller have been like violently competing to be selected and they've all been basically saying the same thing you know we're the best we're the safest and our solution will work and it's basically ready and the community has been having to sort through those statements to then select which technology should be selected to provide that service and layer zero for a little while looked like it was going to win that poll um before it failed you know towards the end of it um with Wormhole pulling ahead and part of this part of the drama behind that story was that the VCS were getting in there kind of socking away at each other so I think jump was backing Wormhole and then as you can see was backing their zero and so the part of the drama of course is the big Brands kind of getting into this and you know a day before voting ended is when a lot of these disclosures around layer zero came out yeah what's your what's your take on these disclosures do you think they're [ __ ] do you think this is like a real problem you know I I actually yeah and this this is why I have a hard time voting on something like this and why anyone should to sort through this is a technical matter that requires both time and expertise and can't really be evaluated like in an instant with the lack of information like these are very hard critiques and analyzes that have to occur and that the community has enough people who are brilliant and capable of sorting this out and you know truth will win out you know at some point but I think it takes a while to sort through what's right what's wrong what's accurate what's inaccurate and just like allow the whole world to understand what's actually happening where and why so I definitely think that there was you know some vaguely suspicious timing um with a lot of this most likely directly related to it extremely contentious vote that was happening so we'll see through do you have a take on this layer zero drama bridges are hard that's yours everyone has Secrets everyone has secrets in their code base you know I I I think in general these votes probably I don't I probably need a lot more process and structure around them I talk to a lot of people involved in voting in one of the reasons for abstention on the part of a lot of people was the process was kind of rushed and then there was like this news and then people had to react to it and I think in general um it's sort of worth thinking about this I I do find it also weird that the Dao has to vote and trying a particular bridge in some ways it always seemed to me like you could support multiple and I agree the ux is worse but it it did seem a little bit odd to me that there was that aspect of like the in this vote but yeah it's there's too much involved and I I don't really yeah there's not two well one of the proposals on the forums uh which was actually really interesting to me was to actually make a meta Bridge which was like hey why are we selecting Wormhole or layer zero why don't we have a contract that listens and if both of them transmit the same thing it's valid why not just support them both huh okay well this is pure message passing this is not like asset bridging yeah yeah this is not asset bridging it's just pure message passing for the use case that there was this bake sale in uniswapov which was like who's going to pass governance messages from ethereum to finance wait if it's just governance messages why are they competing so much like this I thought they were gonna Bridge a bunch of assets no this is just bridging I think you you end up in the ux in a lot of ways in these things right like you end up directly in the DAP front end yeah and the one that uniswap picks other people are gonna probably adopt too sure okay yeah yeah all right it's a great it's a great brand to affiliate yourself with yeah because by the way like uniswap uses compound governance contracts right and like a lot of other teams do as well so like once there's like a format and a standard by which compound governance contracts and ethereum broadcast messages to like other chains it's going to be you know open source reusable components you may as well just copy click deploy the same thing yourself are you are you salty you're not getting a cut of all those compound governance gas fees well this goes back to you know our earlier conversation you know Tinto it's just like I'm a little salty that like a lot of the compound governance contracts and systems and like time locks and voting tools and like all these things are like extremely widely used I'll tip you next time it doesn't bring you some warm fuzzies to your heart get you you can't you just take like all the good you've built for the world and you know take that home and you know eat it with your kids yeah but if you could actually get paid to develop things that were public goods I bet like other people would have spent more time improving those contracts as opposed to like we had to write them all you know years ago and like everyone just no one's really improving them like if everyone else got paid to improve them as well you know they might have advanced even further even faster so that is fair that is very fair all right well um I think we are at the end of time a bit of a strange note to end on I think next week we're going to try to do another Deep dive because we got some we got some great feedback on the Mev episode so we're gonna we're gonna find some topics so if you have ideas of particular things you're excited to learn more about hit us up send us ideas uh we're we're looking for uh more ideas for new shows that are not related to bankruptcies or to uh you know interest rates so we'll try to keep the show more crypto native going forward at least for a little while until uh the next big exchange blows up which hopefully doesn't happen anytime soon that's it hopefully never obviously never I mean this industry is so legit it's not gonna happen again uh all right thanks everybody see you all next week so yeah [Music]
