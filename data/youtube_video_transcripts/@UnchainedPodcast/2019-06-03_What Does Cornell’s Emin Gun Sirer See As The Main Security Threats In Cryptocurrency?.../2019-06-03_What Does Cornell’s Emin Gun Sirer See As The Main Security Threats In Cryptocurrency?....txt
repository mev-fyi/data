welcome to forbs podcasts hi everyone and welcome to Unchained a forbs podcast produced by fractal recording I'm your host Lauren a Forbes contributor are covering blockchain and cryptocurrencies and FinTech thanks for tuning in if you've been listening to the show and like what you've been hearing please review rate and subscribe to the show on your preferred platform it helps get the word out about Unchained for today's episode I'm speaking with Emin goon seer associate professor of computer science at Cornell University who works on operating systems networking and distributed systems he is extremely active in the cryptocurrency community he and his team have written several influential white papers and even blog posts that have changed the trajectory of cryptocurrencies they've also been behind some improvements to the code in Bitcoin and etherium he's also co-director of the initiative for cryptocurrencies and contracts an initiative put together by professors at Cornell Cornell Tech Berkeley and other universities to help advance the adoption of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts he also writes a popular blog at hacking distributed hi Gooden and welcome to the show Thank You Laura thank you very much for having me on so tell me about your work and how you became involved in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space sure so my involvement in this space goes back to I guess my graduate student years when I was working on operating systems but I had an eye towards you know I always was fascinated by systems that that that can self configure that are sort of living things in and of themselves if you will and and they also was exposed early on to millie scent which was one of the early microcurrent and so that was back in the 90s early in 2000's my research when I became a professor my research took a turn towards peer-to-peer systems and I did a bunch of things in that space that I won't bore you with but but in almost every system we built there was a problem of incentivization it's very difficult in a peer-to-peer setting to make sure that everybody behaves well your listeners probably have heard of leechers in torrents right so there are people who contribute who participates in sort of taking you know whatever it is sharing resources but don't put up any reason resources themselves they just leech on the system this is an undesirable situation you want to incentivize them to do the right thing for the community and to that end I built one of the earliest systems that uses a proof-of-work it was a currency a single currency a real currency called karma and so it was widely cited it's academically very well known but I did not sort of proselytize it beyond academics so it wasn't adopted this is back in 2002 2003 and so then I just kind of sat on that work for a while that my interest veered off to other topics I went back to my roots on operating systems so looked back and forth and so you know and meanwhile Satoshi came up and came up with a very cool idea and and a breakthrough and how he uses proof of work and combines it with a bunch of other things and not only those technical things but he also built a community and with any currency system that is really key that is what gives it its value and so that's got me and my interest back in in cryptocurrencies I took a closer look at Bitcoin and we did the work on selfish mining where we discovered that you could misbehave and end up making more money than your fair share we came up with a fix for selfish mining to the extent that it could be fixed there are regions where you cannot fix it and from there it's just sort of history then you know I got pulled into more and more into into blockchain and in crypto currencies and have been working on this topic since it's a fertile space and there's a lot of excitement in it and rightfully so there's so much to do and so many exciting computer science problems so that's my that's how I got involved and that's that's sort of what's shaped my view coming into the system and I'm so interested to know you know as somebody who I kind of develop you know a prior version of Bitcoin I guess he could say how did you first learn about it and what were your thoughts when you learned about it and also when was that so I heard the first I first heard about Bitcoin around 2010 2011 and one of the first things you do when you hear about something like this is you download the whitepaper and you look at sort of what the core idea is and the core idea seemed really interesting it had been previously discussed and in some depth by some other people you know Arvind Krishnamurti and James asked nice had done some work on sort of continually solving proof-of-work puzzles and so it immediately made me think of related work and you know and then the other thing you do is you check to see if if you were cited right she didn't know about my work so though she ends up citing some other work related to to spam deterrence and so the work that Satoshi cites it's you know it uses proof of work as well but it's not a currency so so if you read that white paper there's a bunch of stuff that's missing so anyway so you think about the kind of person that he might be you of course get pulled into the human story a pseudonymous person is it a single person is it multiple people is it is there something more behind it how that the currency get started how much money did one put up to prop up the currency in its initial days and so forth so there's a lot that draws you in and so that was my first reaction to it and and then of course you know can I game it yeah are there security holes and so forth and so so the kenai game in question sort of got really serious for me with with its high all's appearance at Cornell its high al is a postdoc here he's about to become a professor at the Technion he's about to go to Israel and it's I came here as a postdoc and you know and in his spare time he was interested in in Bitcoin his main task was something else related to consensus protocols of traditional consensus protocols but in his spare time he was interested in Bitcoin and he came by one day and he said you know I think there there some issues with the the the consensus further called in Bitcoin and we I think we can game it and make more money than we should make and so so that got me going again and that led to the work known as selfish mining and that sort of leads us to the work that you guys are doing with ic3 what what does ic3 do and how did it come to be ah so I see three is a much much greater bigger effort so so so far I described to you sort of how I got into this and that's my group that's a group of I don't know maybe eight people total IC 3 is an initiative at Cornell that we started I'm one of the co-directors there are three co directors the other two are Elaine she and Ari Jules and so what essentially happened is is that a number of all the three of us got together and we all were supremely excited about cryptocurrencies and we could see certain trends in in action one big trend of course is the financial industry needs some help that's just there's no way to sugarcoat this they got caught you know with they just got caught way behind the main game their their systems are aging they haven't really done any investment in their infrastructure for I would say about 16 years and the last time they did any investment was for the y2k bug right so so they are way behind the times they're struggling with simple things like auditability with being able to reconcile ledger is keeping Ledger's in sync being able to transparently prove to regulators that they did not misbehave and so forth there there are lots of issues facing them and so it was clear to us that the finance industry had to take a close look at the way they did things it was also clear to us that there's a big social movement saying hey you know we need other systems for managing money and and of course there's the whole issue of smart contracts one of the next big steps to come after Bitcoin there are all sorts of fancy things you can build new instruments you can build new systems you can build that manage money and the excitement around this is immense so maybe I'm veering off topic a little bit but I'm so excited about it so you know all my colleagues they write programs that let's leave aside the roboticists they write programs that actually move things but everybody else they just manipulate pixels on a screen right you give them input and you know the program some input that generates some output you print it maybe you know that's the extent of what you do but with smart contracts you've got programs that manage money flows that's an amazing new capability and nobody knows how to write these things it's really easy to get things wrong so we thought hey we have to do something to provide structure to this space to provide some you know some some entity that will organize the efforts in this space and we got some of our friends together we wrote a proposal to NSF and NSF very kindly funded us to you know quite a good level and so now we have a fairly strong initiative with industry support so once you have something that creates the backbone of an organization then you have industry start to take notes start to pay attention so we now have a number of sponsors some of them are fairly well known others very well known smaller startups that are well known within their communities so so it's a wonderful situation the sum total number of people I think is somewhere between 50 to 60 maybe more at IC 3 I would say that well ok so at least 14 or 15 have PhDs so this I think is the largest concentration of academics under one roof not literal roof look because some of us are in Berkeley some of us are at in New York City some of us are in Ithaca but but it's a large concentration of people who work together on timely interesting topics on on blockchains and who are some of the sponsors the spawn so let's see so iBM is one of them Intel is one of them let's see chain is obviously one of them and there are a bunch of others in the works that we're working on so those are the three that are the the three public ones and there they are at the EP our sponsoring of the the Gold level sponsors of IC 3 one of the big themes I see in your work is around the security of public block chains certainly security has been a big issue this summer both with the BitFenix hack and then also the security of smart contracts with the dow hack and so i'm curious what do you see is the main security threats in the cryptocurrency space and what are some of your proposals for resolving them so that's such a great question where to start so what is the main security threat everything when you have so much value everything you've got is is is is essentially a bounty right Bitcoin has become the universal bug bounty in the good old days we used to sort of you know you'd find a flaw and I don't know when I was a grad student I found the flaw in in Java Virtual Machine suppose Microsoft and Netscape and then you disclose and then they deny that they had the vulnerability and then you know if they're good they finally admit and they give you you know like a few thousand dollars or something and but that's not how it works anymore right so there are a bunch of people who are constantly looking for bugs and the moment they find one they infiltrate your system they take your Bitcoin they become rich you know your cash is their bounty and this is clearly no firm infrastructure to base the race the rest of our financial infrastructure it's just not this is not how we build things now imagine that you know that you you've got this cool technology it's called a brick and except you know the Ukrainian hackers can come in and make your entire you know skyscraper collapse by digging underneath it it's just you know we can't have this happen so the security issues facing Bitcoin I would divide into two different categories at the very highest level I would say client-side security is a real issue it has always been and the flip side of it is of course server-side Security's the security of the bitcoins that you place necessarily placed in the hands of other people although you shouldn't but there are many many many legitimate circumstances where you kind of have to and and and in those circumstances sadly you typically end up giving up all control and currently end up becoming vulnerable to sorts of attacks from the server side and so the scientific challenge facing us is can we do something better than the current state of affairs and the current state of affairs is really dismal right so you'll lose your private keys all your bitcoins are gone and how often do you lose them well it depends right there is the guy who tossed out his disk and it could happen to me all right I kind of think of myself as a semi sophisticated user but yeah i mislaid disks all the time I'd misplaced stuff and you know and there there are some very well-known people I think a lot of your viewers might have heard of Christian Decker he was I think he was adopter number seven or so of Bitcoin it was very very early on he was a grad student in Switzerland I was on his ph.d committee and he just became a he just got his doctorate about six months ago now incredibly bright fellow and had incredible foresight I mind a lot of coins and early on and had about 10,000 bitcoins and guess what happened one day he discovered that his bitcoins had gone missing and it wasn't an unsophisticated said of it was behind - two firewalls and somehow people had traced him back trace this machine back to because because it took his corns so question here is can we do better and I believe we can so I can expand on that later on if you like we've done a bunch of work on something called vaults and covenants and those can help people recover their own coins and only their own coins if in the case of a hack yeah I actually wanted you to describe those for the listeners sure so okay so recently last February we published a paper called covenants and the core idea with covenants is to to enable people to put riders on how certain coins can be spent and what's a writer essentially restrictions and what does this allow you to do well it allows you to implement all sorts of things in general but I want to focus on on one thing which is this idea called vaults so what you can do with Volks based on covenants is essentially designate some of your money as cold storage essentially what you do is you say look I have my wallet right now and I normally would spend out of it and everything would be in it and life would be fine but I know that most of it I'm not going to need so I'm going to take you know whatever some percent of it 90% say I'm going to move it into a special vault well vault is just like every other Bitcoin address except it has two keys associated with it you can use one key to unbolt the money so any money that's in your vault you would use the regular unbolting key to turn back and move back into your hot wallet okay so suppose I decide for whatever reason I'm going to spend all my bitcoins well I'm gonna have to take my money out of my fault so I use my unbolting key and that unbolting process takes some time it necessarily takes a certain designated amount of time you decide what that time ought to be yourself so for my use cases I think that would be typically say 24 hours maybe 72 hours I don't have any urgent purchases that I do with Bitcoin so so during that time frame what you can do is you can actually override a nun vaulting operation with the second key we call that the recovery key so what does that mean in the usual use case it means that you just put your money in the vault you can take it out you have to wait a little bit however you know amount of time however much you designated it to be and then after that time you just use it out of your hearts wallet and everything's great but much more importantly suppose you know I'm at the beach or whatever and I'm hanging out and somebody hacks into my machine and they start moving my funds then I have the duration of that on vaulting period to say no no no this wasn't me even though this person has the unbolting key just like I do even though to the system he looks you're indistinguishable from me it's actually not me and I can prove that by producing this every key with which I override his transaction and so that recovery key which I keep in out in a separates safer place if I were to produce it I would be able to say no no you don't get to take this money out I get to revert this money back into my hot wallet so this I think is a very simple idea it takes a while to describe how it works but you know deep down it's all it is is a second key that says no no no stop this with some restrictions that's why these covenants are there these riders in place so that nobody no merchants can be fooled about these transactions volts are volts and they're separate from hot wallets so it's not the case that I would be able to buy something from you and I would use the recovery key to get my money back that's that's not how it works at all and how do you keep the recovery key safe ah so you would keep it you don't need it for any day-to-day operation you would just print it out and put it wherever you put incredibly safe things if you were to have your recovery key also compromised that's a the worst possible scenario then you're in this deep bind there is absolutely nothing distinguishing you from the Teta of the thief then what the vaults allow you to do in that terrible sinner is the disaster case scenario is you can burn the money you essentially get to say look you know that person says move the money unbolt the money to that location I'm telling you to burn the money and then the money is burned and what that does is it takes away from the thief any potential for a positive outcome we can hack all is all he wants into your systems but if your money is in a vault it's really safe he's not gonna get any of it if you actually intervene in a timely fashion so we envision that there will be services that actually watch the blockchain for you and and can intervene so this I think is a pretty cool idea because all of a sudden you've taken away the universal bug bounty these people can come in and hack all they want but they're not gonna get anything and that can drastically shift the the sort of the gameplay here because at the moment every Bitcoin user is just a juicy target like every Ukrainian kid why aren't they going in and attack everybody else and in fact you know we see these I picked on on Ukraine here because the story of Christi and Decker involves a hack from Ukraine but you know especially you've got hackers everywhere and you've got all these juicy targets everywhere else and so you're constantly seeing these attacks and why shouldn't you the expected outcome is positive you try every hacker has a you know a portfolio of tricks they no they just throw them at you and with some probability you know they will get in and they will make money with vaults even if they get in they make no money so now they're gonna have to move to a different target and that's a great outcome yeah so I love how um you know this system that you just described changes the incentive mechanisms and that's another big theme that I see in your work you know you often look at kind of how perverse incentives can arise where they're not intended and I'm so curious how do you work out these different scenarios and you know how how can you be sure that you've covered them all and how do you think creators of smart contracts can write code that creates the incentives that they actually intend yeah that's a good question I thought a little bit about this and you know there is no there is no structured answer I can give you there is no sort of playbook it helps to have grown up in an environment where I saw a lot of scams so that's essentially what you do is you kind of eyeball the situation and you're like you know um if I were if I were malicious what would I do and and then you know things usually fall apart fairly rapidly I don't know but it takes a certain kind of adversarial thinking some people some people have this in spades and some others you know are different they're they're more constructive thinkers I tend to think of myself mostly as a constructive person actually so most of my work is about building new systems on occasion though on that one occasion but in many cases it's actually the new systems we build are motivated by problems adversarial problems that we've identified so so yeah so there's an interplay between between the two and there are two hats I weigh and you know when I wear my adversarial hat you're essentially just probing every single thing you can about about the protocols essentially you're doing a big search the search space is immensely big right at this point in the protocol what if I were now I'm expected to send a message X but what if I don't what if i delay it what if I send message Y what if I change a field and so forth yes so you have to think through those circumstances and and when you're doing so there so so so many that it's it's not always feasible to do it automatically with the help of a computer so so verification of these systems is difficult so a trained eye I can typically sort of navigate that space and you know and find the cases that are going to lead to a compromise and so what suggestions would you give to creators of smart contracts so that way their programs end up really executing what they intend them to execute oh that's this is the the big big question right so I think this before we tackle this let's talk a little bit about the doubt because I think it's a good running example so what happened with the Dow was as I think many of your your listeners know about the collapse there but before the collapse me and my colleagues Vlad Zamfir and Dena mark looked into the code of the Dow and we issued them a call for a moratorium saying look this is a fascinating contract it's amassed an enormous amount of money 220 million dollars success beyond anybody dreamed of but it's vulnerable it is not adequate for you know doing the task it set out to do in particular it's set out to sort of make funding decisions on behalf of its investors and and to make those decisions with the help of a voting scheme well the voting scheme is gain about you know they're like umpteen different ways I think we ended up counting nine separate issues with it by which the Dow could be supported and not carry out its task of finding the optimal optimal asset allocation so let's see so what are some general techniques for for writing correct programs is one question and and I think this is an open research issue it's one of the grand challenges facing computer science today so if you think about your desktop you know programs right they're supposed to carry out functions and they're supposed to not crash and I don't know about you guys but you know I see mine crash fairly often right blue screen of death everyone's had it at least once in their lifetime and some of us many many many times so when it comes to smart contracts is much more dire like there's real money at stake sometimes a lot of money at stake and the bugs can be subtle so in this whole game or war really there are a couple of tools that that are useful so generically speaking it's incredibly useful to have a spec if you don't have a specification of what you want to do then you're just navigating blind you're gonna get to wherever you get to and that's gonna be your destination if code is law then then there is no greater truth than what you've got and if it's got bugs in it then you're screwed and and and essentially it's kind of odd right it's a lot of people think it's like they kind of view themselves as as that famous justice who said you know pornography I know it when I see it well you know a bug when you see it but if you don't have aspected know how is anybody else going to agree with you so the very first thing is to have a speck not only to prove to others that this was unintended but also document for yourself what it is that you want to do the second level up from a speck is a formal proof that the code you have matches the spec you you you've got and a lot of people think that that's the end all that this is sort of the golden standard it is by no means a golden standard it is it's it's it's it can in fact be misleading to have a formal proof because there can easily be flaws in the spec and there can easily be properties of your code that you want it to have but are not embodied in your spec so if we were to go back to the dow case the current technology we have for specifying things formally can specify basic what we call safety properties so what's a safety property well the code will not divide by zero okay so that's an easy thing to check relatively speaking I can go through the code and prove to myself that all the divisions will be made by numbers greater than zero or I can put checks in it to ensure that that doesn't happen etc but but but the actual spec for the Dow is much more high-level right the spec in English is that thou shalt reflect the the voting preferences of its constituents now I don't know how to write that in in logic in in first order logic or in any amended logic that I'm aware of it's it's very difficult to specify what that means especially when you've got concurrent votes and and so forth that are happening in the doubt the complexity of the system is really high and as of now I don't know of anybody now who has the core science the fundamentals to even be able to express the spec let alone prove it so there is a very long road ahead of us with a lot of core science that's needed to make sure that smart contracts are trustworthy so but basic stuff of the kind that the hacker initially exploited to break into the dark contract those we can hope to sort of keep under control so he ended up taking advantage of a recursive call error and essentially that stemmed from the entire community not understanding that these recursive calls were there and could be problematic and and what is can you define recursive call for the listeners oh sure okay so what happened is the the DAO hacker ended up I was actually the the hacker or hackers were very sophisticated so they ended up using multiple exploits the initial exploit that they used took advantage of a little-known feature in solidity the language that is used smart contracts on a theorem so the Dow on occasion allows allows the the call okay so here's what you can do with the death you can invoke a Dow function to transfer some funds to subdue a child Dow or that you control and in that process of transferring funds the Dow invokes a function that you provide so if in that function you call the doubt back then you can get the doubt to go into into a loop it's like it's like Inception right so you call the Dow it calls your code to transfer the funds for your code to receive them in essence and when you're receiving them you call the Dow again and because of the way the the Dow code was structured it's sort of oblivious about what it's doing what's in the middle of doing and it ended up saying okay you want to transfer some funds okay I'll call you again and so it calls you again and you call it again and so forth and instead of making one call you you could or the hacker did end up making a gazillion calls some total of which ended up transferring about fifty to sixty million dollars out of the Dow to a child of the Dow and so that was an enormous enormous hack heist whatever you want to call it or some people would call it just use and not abuse even but whatever it was it ended up transferring a lot of money out of the day making everyone poor and teaching the entire aetherium community about this one feature that everybody had forgotten about whereby you know Excel contracts could be exploited so so this is a problematic issue but these kinds of issues we can make headway towards towards towards eliminating them so aetherium is very young and you know there were differences of opinion on how to resolve this issue and obviously we have the one side of the community that believes that immutability is an extremely important characteristic and they were against kind of rolling back the network to to be able to return the funds to the people who had lost them but that is what the majority of the community ended up doing and tell us what your stance was on that and how you came to that decision um so let's see I was mostly neutral in the beginning but but looking at what was happening at this it seemed like the dow investors were were essentially consisted of a lot of people who had sort of committed to a theorem as a platform they wanted to see aetherium succeed they saw the dow as it as an investment vehicle that was going to make the community richer that would invest in things that benefited a theorem as a whole and sinking so much money into this hole in the ground where the hacker stood and burning it seemed at odds with what the community wanted so the the situation then was actually quite dire if you look look at what happened the day of the hack you look forward at your options and you've got two options you can burn the cash and say the hacker earns earns this money or you can say well we're going to claw it back and we're gonna make the the hacker poorer and we're going to revert the this one transaction that was unintended and took advantage of one feature that essentially was forgotten by the community and this is both options are pretty bad in fact both options are pretty terrible but given these two terrible options it seemed like the the fork option was was better in the sense that it led to greater utility greater happiness for the community you have to remember that cryptocurrencies and block chains do not stand on their own they all serve a function distribute system is only prosper to the extent that they serve a societal need and Anna currency system can only do that which its community wants right if it's not doing that then it's something else it's a fetish it's not the case that I am you know there are people out there who just love a blockchain they just love a bunch of you know proofs of work a bunch of crypto puzzles that depend on each other I call these people blockchain fetishists and blockchain fetishism is not going to get us to to a good community I think what is important is at the end of the day where does the value go what what does the community wanted to do and in the case of aetherium the community clearly wanted it to forecast like it was 86 percent or more I think at the last poll that I looked at that wanted the the the hack to be undone and and revert the funds from the hacker and so then there was an issue of whether to fork it soft or fork it's hard and and then there was of course the fork itself and the aftermath involving etherium classic so before we get into that and I actually just wanted to ask you about the soft fork because you had written a blog post that outlined a way that in this soft fork could be attacked and as a result of that blog post the etherium community changed its mind so can you tell the story of what happened and how in general you see your role in in these public blockchains sure um so that was interesting so once the community decided to fork the initial idea was well let's do a soft fork and what's a soft pork in this case let's have the miners evaluate smart contracts and if the smart contract ends up touching the Dow then let's not add it to the ethereum blockchain let's freeze the Dow everything related to the Dow we freeze to buy ourselves time this is an incredibly sensible idea now that feels like it would be my first reaction to and it was my first reaction and initially when I thought about it I thought well okay that's that's not so bad you can implement this but I received a message an email from a student with whom I had actually interacted nine months prior or six months prior he was when I first interacted with him he was a high school student and he'd written to me out of the blue and he said I'm very excited about blockchain uh and I encourage them to apply to Cornell and he had applied to Cornell in the meantime he'd been accepted to Cornell but he was still in high school and he was well like he'd just finished high school and he was doing an internship at consensus in New York City and he said well professor Sarah wouldn't it be the case that if we were to do a soft fork then the network would be vulnerable to an enormous attack wouldn't it be the case that somebody could flood it with transactions that cost almost nothing to generate and and are very expensive to to evaluate for the miners the miners would have to execute them for potentially a long time only to discover at the very end that this thing touches the Dow and then they have to toss it out so normally a big invariant in systems like etherium is the transactions have to pay gas for their operations that the more computation you do the more gas you pay and in this case you could get the miners to do enormous computations and pay nothing and you could do this all day long forever 7:24 just bogging the entire thing down and and therefore this was an enormous denial of service vulnerability so we wrote our blog post it ended up it would it ended up coming out maybe two and a half days before the soft work was scheduled to go out and everyone was slated to do it and suddenly it got the the opinion changed and everyone was like no of course we don't want a denial of service attack of course we do not want the soft work if it's going to end up hurting aetherium more and and I think it was you know I thought it was an enormous success story by these well I should have mentioned it wasn't just the student the one student Jaden Hess but also his of his friend River and River Kiefer so River and Jaden were the ones who came up with this essentially and they did it in a you know they just got in right this it's kind like in the movies right before the clocks about to expire and I think they did an enormous service by keeping aetherium from getting bogged down by attacks had the soft work gone forward we would have been looking at this Astor scenario we would have seen attackers come out full force attack the system it would have you know III it would have easily crashed and burned to zero as it is with our announcement theorems valuation went from 1 billion to nine hundred million and you know for a second or so I was like wow he that wasn't so good we lost you know ten percent there but I kind of view our work as having preserved ninety percent of the of the value of the coin and it really would have gone down to zero had it been open to such a such a blatant vulnerability so on so I think calling off the soft pork was was was a very good outcome and I'm glad we got it done in the nick of time so in terms of outcomes that maybe didn't go or it didn't happen in such an ideal manner let's talk about the hard fork you had written a blog posts that laid out several of your fears around the hard fork and one was that the minority fork might survive and that of course happens so um a theorem split into what is aetherium which is the part of the network that did roll back so as to return the funds invested in the in the doubt and then there's ether classic which did not so what do you think it will happen to either classic going forward so that's a good question let's let's maybe talk a little bit about what happened with that split right so before the split as you pointed out I had written this blog post saying look you know the game theory says there will be one dominant fork but there will be a minority fork if if it's subsidized so if there is somebody throwing money at it to succeed then it can linger on and so at a high level did there is a you know there's a lot of noise that came out in fact the trolls were out in full force Twitter was full of everybody and their brother is saying all sorts of things about how the fork went but from my perspective the fork actually was a huge success it ended up doing what it intended to do it ended up reverting the funds everybody who put their ether into the Dow got their ether back that is a huge hugely awesome outcome right much better than having to fight it out with some hacker playing core Wars you know hacker on hacker kind of like they write some code you write some code you try to keep them from transferring their funds and that game would have been an unending source of strife and a huge loss of value for everybody who participated the community would have turned away a lot of the early adopters so I think aetherium would have would have really really really taken a huge hit if not just died in in if the money had not been reverted so as far as ether is concerned the the fork was a huge success now the fork gave rise to an opportunity for people who were not vested in etherium to step in and and behind the scenes I saw some of this there were some people trying to buy up old coins and and I know exactly who they are and and it was interesting the initial people who started this process and and they it was a malicious malicious effort it was essentially money that that wanted etherium to die that falsely saw it theorem as a competitor with other cryptocurrencies particularly with Bitcoin I think this is a false view I don't think these two currencies compete and I have a very simple litmus test for it if you think about Bitcoin and Bitcoin and if you look at what they do they typically worry about merchants and if you think about etherion people they think about applications it's just night and day it's water and oil these two things are very very very different sure there's the same kinds of consensus protocols going on but it's it's kind of like it's kinda like a file system person getting upset at that I don't know at distributed naming service or something yes like this the protocols used under the covers are very similar they're completely different functions and yes there are tokens and yes there are people who speculate in them you know but that's the speculation is that what we want to do that's not what we want to do that is not what what's a society a good outcome is not to enable speculators so but I think converging slightly in the sense what may be converging isn't the word but there are ways in which they're becoming more similar for instance we have rootstock being developed on Bitcoin which you know intends to bring kind of like the smart contract capability of a cerium to Bitcoin and so you know maybe now Bitcoin ethereum seem rather different but there is a way where you could look down the line and say well they could be more somewhere in the future potentially that's true but what's what you see happening there it is Bitcoin deciding to branch out of its actual actual function bitcoins function currently is value transfer and the theorems function right now is computation these are two separate domains the fact that Bitcoin wants now to go into the etherium space that's fine that's nice but but you know that's going to take a bunch of years and I don't know that it will happen in the same form as etherium etherium already as do this the established dominant player there and and and so you know to to sort of look at a competitive perceived competitor down the line and to get sort of obsessive about it that's kinda weird I that is not at least how I work and and I don't know that that's good that is in fighting between you know we've seen the infighting between Bitcoin factions it's not been good for Bitcoin and infighting between Bitcoin and aetherium and other cryptocurrencies is also not gonna be good for the entire space so I think that's uh that's a terrible terrible mine terrible line of reasoning to say well multiple years down the line I might be in the same space as you so I'm now going to to take an adversarial position I'm going to try to hamper your your you know whatever it is your progress there's gonna be strife you know though these are not good things I think I don't think we should engage in them so speaking of infighting I also did want to ask you about the scaling of public blockchains which has been as you mentioned a bigger point of contention Bitcoin how do you think developers can best accomplish this so you know particularly for these public blockchains where you know have these sort of grand visions of what they would be able to do for the world so there are lots of issues on the table when it comes to scaling Bitcoin so if we were to look at it narrowly which is how do we scale Bitcoin well there's only one answer you scale it on chain that's the only answer I know of because of the way the question is phrased framed and I just for listeners so how do you define scaling on chain scaling on chain to me means the chain must must grow in some fashion to accommodate more than three and a half transactions per second so currently the chain works by issuing about one block every ten minutes and that block is one megabytes big so that comes out to three and a half transactions per second and that's the max Bitcoin can do and so if you want me going to to sort of be Bitcoin and and scale up well you gotta improve that number somehow now and that when I say on chain I mean without changing the fundamental structure of Bitcoin itself and that fundamental structure to me and in my worldview and I think almost all of your listeners will share this is one based on Satoshi's initial vision outlined in the white paper it's a bunch of blocks that reference each other and build a blockchain so so that's the only way forward now the the way the chain is generated will need to change for us to be able to do that so we might have to have bigger blocks but there is a limit to how big you can make the blocks and you can get scale so you can't make them a thousand times bigger than that would cause all sorts of problems but we want to make the number of transactions about at least a thousand times if not a hundred thousand times larger so how do we get there so my group has done some work on on protocols that are that retained the entire Bitcoin structure just change some mechanistic issues on the wire about how the blocks are generated the protocol here is called Bitcoin ng Bitcoin next generation and it essentially is is a way to generate the exact same blockchain as outlined white paper but in a slightly different fashion and is showing it in a slightly different manner so as to so as to keep the pipeline full and to generate many more transactions per second than would be allowed by one megabyte blocks every ten minutes so that's one way there is there are other techniques you know x10 blocks is one compact blocks is another etc and they're also sort of layer two solutions I'm a little skeptical about layer two solutions so layer two solutions are solutions one of the most famous ones is called the Lightning Network essentially what these do is they build a credit Network on top of Bitcoin so for example Laura you know I know you at least a little bit and I know you sufficiently to you know front say $100 on your behalf to someone around here so if you ever wanted to transfer some money and I happen to know that person you could ask me and I'll give that person some money out of my own pocket and you and I will settle later and perhaps I want to transfer some money to somebody who happens to live near you and this can go back and forth and we can sort of without having to hit the main blockchain the underlying blockchain the Bitcoin blockchain the two of us can have a back and forth of money transfers and thus get some scale but the problem there there are a bunch of problems with this the main one of course is we're not doing Bitcoin at this point the Lightning Network even though it uses the same syntax for transactions as Bitcoin even though it uses a similar sort of style of addressing it is not the Bitcoin network that we're transferring the funds over we're now transferring the funds over a credit network and doing so has a whole lot of issues of its own so first of all you might say well what are these issues well first of all we don't know what the performance of this network is because we don't know what this network looks like I happen to know you and there's an edge between us but I don't know you know a bunch of other people and the people yeah I know that you want to transfer money to who are they etcetera can we really create these these paths and and what is their capacity so that's an open question and and so the performance and the scale you're going to get with a level two so the layer 2 solution is unclear nobody knows what that's going to look like anybody who tells you they know the answer to this is flat-out lying we don't know the human interaction patterns we don't know you know I know I know I have a lot of friends on Facebook I don't know how much of how many of them I'd actually front money for by the way and how much that would be so that particular credit network hasn't emerged in any form or any medium that I know of so so that is an is an enormous ly big problem it's a big unknown and we're not going to settle this until it emerges and anybody who says that this is going to solve our problems is essentially making a blind faith assumption that that when this thing arrives it's going to solve this problem the second issue of course is the protocols haven't been developed yet so finding these routes is difficult and finding these routes in a privacy-preserving manner it's new territory I don't know if I haven't seen any any protocols I would put my faith in and and I certainly don't want in some random Joe to discover that I happen to know you that you and I have a credit relationship why should they now I have a bunch of credit relationships with a lot of people merchants and nobody should know who those merchants are right why should you know whom I you know who my best friends are what their credit limits are so it's going to be fairly difficult to design a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that's going to preserve privacy and guarantee anonymity to participants and and it's just you know I haven't seen it yet so so we're going blind into into into the Lightning Network assuming that these challenges can be solved and I haven't seen them solved yet so these are two problems the third one and also a major problem is the user experience so it's hard enough with Bitcoin to get somebody else to use it right it's like I said some transaction where is it going it got stuck the the failure scenarios are really complicated everybody understands credit cards right you sort of give somebody your credential it's just just a terrible idea right so you know you can get a lot access to a lot of my money if you know my credit card number so credit cards are bad but at least they're simple and that's a key feature so Bitcoin sadly is not simple very hard try explaining to an audience how Bitcoin works I've done this too many general audiences by now I've briefed all sorts of people in government on Bitcoin and it takes at least 20 minutes to describe how Bitcoin works now you add on top of this how lightning works it's just gonna be at least an hour and and then the user experience of what can go wrong you know my transaction is lost well where do I look for it where is it where could it be well you know what state is the payment channel in you know this is kind of it'll just explode and get very very very complicated so I think these three fundamental issues are currently unsolved and the first one of course is unsolvable until deployment so putting ones blind faith into layer 2 solutions I currently see as it's quite optimistic and not the the path of a prudent technologists well when you look at this space and not just Bitcoin but you know I just the whole space of cryptocurrencies smart contracts you know all of this stuff that's enabled by this type of technology what do you think is the most cutting edge or promising technology your project that you're seeing right now so there is a lot of work going on in all sorts of well all sorts of fronts it's hard to sort of it's very difficult to answer that question so there's a lot of work happening at the forefront of consensus consensus protocols and I want to put aside Bitcoin for a second so the Bitcoin use case is special and it requires its own special treatment but there's a lot of exciting work on on on deploying blockchain protocols for different scenarios these are not competing with Bitcoin in any shape or form but but oh and with aetherium for that matter but essentially providing to financial institutions new tools and techniques and there's a lot of exciting exciting work on that front my group is doing some of it Joba now at Stanford Arvind Narayana at Princeton and Brian Ford in at EPFL so these are the sort of the groups that are looking at new consensus protocols and/or new techniques and I think there is quite fascinating work happening in the FinTech space that is independent of of anything that might happen with Bitcoin and as essentially nothing to do that you could you could apply these techniques to all sorts of things that have nothing to do with money actually and I think the exciting some of the exciting use cases are very little to do with money so there is that on the Bitcoin front there is interesting or Bitcoin like value transfer systems front there's interesting work happening on confidentiality so in the early days of Bitcoin it was billed as a as an anonymous system that narrative got reverted to pseudonymous as people figured out that you know these addresses were leaking information and and I think as of today very few people would would actually advise you to use Bitcoin as it is you know if you're doing so if you want to actually retain some privacy you would need to do at least something like coin joint or something of that kind to to hide what's going on otherwise your employer can easily see where your money is going and that is not a good outcome so Z cash is a promising protocol I think in in providing confidentiality there are other competing protocols that are that people are pushing and there are bazillion other efforts as well there are lots and lots of alt coins as you all know and most of them offer no value whatsoever so so but some of them are you know they have interesting features here and there well this has been such a fascinating discussion thank you so much where can our listeners find more of your work or contact you in the future um so they can see me rant about various different topics at hacking distributed calm and that's where I do most of my sort of quantification about things related to cryptocurrencies and and I also have a Twitter account it's hard to - well I'll spell it out this le tax or e l33t h4x o r so so they're they're welcome to come and follow me there it's it's ingest by the way the name and so so that's where I do my quantification we also have the ic3 webpage that's where we do our serious academic work and that is in it
