crypto space Oh Laura my apologies I forgot to mention one thing this panel is being audio recorded for Laura's podcasts so just wanted to let the audience be aware of that hi everyone thanks for joining us so to my left I have Marcos and Tory who is the two title general counsel or president and chief legal officer oh very fancy president and chief legal officer of blockchain Don info which is a crypto wallet and we've got Michael Sun and shine of greyscale investments title their managing director managing director and Barbara Mann oopsie hello Barbara who's of Awesome ventures in your title is general partner yeah do you kind of go found it great alright so we're gonna be discussing crypto trends and why don't you actually just have you each go through and sort of describe your background what your company does I can want to start sure I'm Marco Santori as Laura said I'm the president and CEO of blockchain were the most popular digital currency wallet in the world over 24 million wallets and we also have an API and of course the data tools that blockchain Explorer which we've all seen if you've seen any charts on on crypto over the last I guess six or seven years before blockchain I was a partner at coulee I led the the FinTech team at cooling of course our blockchain technology efforts and most recently I was an author of the shaft project white paper hi I'm Michael sunshine a managing director at grayscale investments grayscale is a wholly owned subsidiary of a company called digital currency group BCG is the largest conglomerate digital currency organization globally we have a venture capital arm a large balance sheet that holds digital currencies and several subsidiary businesses one of them being grayscale grayscale is purely focused on digital currency as an asset manager and so our business model looks similar to that of AI shares or Vanguard or WisdomTree and to date we've launched eight distinct investment funds we now manage about 1.6 1.7 billion dollars across the eight different funds that we run and I think for us we're really trying to bridge that gap between the global investment community and making digital currencies accessible for different types of investors looking to speculate on and participate in the digital currency asset class I'm the co-founder and managing director of Awesome ventures I have been an investment boat for almost a decade first very traditional fine and then equity in real estate I finally started to manage my own funds on venture has been five years now biotech fund of funds in emerging managers and then awesome with a hybrid venture and hedge fund great so let's start talking about that 2017 year in crypto which I think we can all say was sort of the year that put crypto on the map in a mainstream way what do you make of that year what were the important developments and sort of where do you place it in the broader pic our brothers story of mainstream adoption of crypto oh sure so I've been working in the digital currency space since the beginning of 2014 I've spent time with CEOs of publicly traded companies heads of banks heads of insurance companies family offices every geography Under the Sun you can think of I can't tell you for how long this was a you know a taboo topic investors thought that digital currencies were for drug dealers in human trafficking they thought that digital currencies were a farce or a joke and they were gonna go away Laura I know you're previously from the press so I'm not gonna blame all of this on the press but the press yes you are so from the press right okay so I'm gonna say the press hasn't done the best job of actually explaining demystifying making it clear what digital currencies are how they can be transformative and that narrative started to change during 2017 that changed because some fantastic companies in this space we're doing very you know successful rounds from some very prominent investors that changed because the price of digital asset started to take off and suddenly the narrative you know around digital currencies and in popular press outlets became about you know digital currencies creating the springboard to financial inclusion starting to disrupt payment systems starting to create entirely new business models or create jobs globally and this is one of those weird phenomenon where a asset class came along for the first time that was never around before and somehow retail investors got into it before institutions did and that's because of fantastic companies like blockchain like coinbase and others that have really made this a place where investors can actually participate and so there's been a lot of volatility but I don't think I've ever been more excited about who has gotten drawn into the space over the past year in kind of where we are turning from maybe that first inning to second inning of kind of where digital assets are in their lifecycle yeah and actually Samarco I know you weren't at blockchain at that time but I am kind of curious to know you're you know in the u.s. we were all very aware of like everybody from mom-and-pop investors to teenagers to people who had mortgages to pay in loans that were thinking about taking out even more debt to to buy crypto we know that all those people were getting in but what was pilate not enforcing in terms of adoption like i also were in the world i think like everybody else we saw an enormous uptick so to get a sense of blockchain sumit print word we have a lot of wallets right if if you were to combine all of swabs customers and TD banks customers and each rates customers you still don't get the number of wallets that we have and it's very much a global phenomenon the u.s. is not our largest market the u.s. is our third largest market and we saw abroad around the world really the same thing that people saw in the United States was a tremendous uptick in volume and user activity an exchange volume in payment volume you know actual transfer volume and in one day we added the entire population of Berkeley it's our wallet count I mean it was it was unprecedented but you know as to why it happened I think there a lot of factors but really I think we all really know why it happened right it happened because people discovered you could pre-cell tokens I mean it's not a lot of magic to this in my mind that's what separates 2017 from 2016 is that there were for 2016 in the years before there were a few different entrepreneurs a few different examples of people taking risks and pre selling their tokens but it was still kind of frowned upon by by the community it hadn't really reached its reached its its pinnacle in 2017 people started doing this with with abandon in some cases reckless abandon but that's clearly what validated the multi-chain framework that people think about crypto and now it was 2017 people were people never really I think took heart around the world that this crypto thing was going to happen and there were going to be a great variety of tokens a great variety of block chains at any stage in the process and then 2017 happened people discovered you could bootstrap these networks by selling the tokens and that worldview was validated and it so you're saying that it was actually the speculative fervor that also drove adoption in these developing markets I wouldn't call it speculative forever I think that's I think that's a loaded term I think that it really the the the click happened on the issuer side and not on the not on the purchaser side development teams who had grand plans and grand ideas for new networks figured out a way to actually get these things bootstrap to get them launched and that was by selling those tokens but I mean in terms of the number of wallets we saw being open on blockchain mm-hmm yeah so in terms of block chains wallets so people don't come to blockchain to speculate if you want to speculate it's a it's a poor tool for that we're not we're not what you use to speculate we are what you use to use crypto currencies in fact it's it difficult to draw a line between speculative use and consumptive and functional use for most people I actually think this is another simple idea and once you've moved your crypto off of the exchange that you bought them on in fact off of exchange is entirely that's use that's using them as a store of value something more than just a speculative tool to sell for a dollar and time the market or sorry to buy for a dollar and sell for two you bring your crypto to blockchain when you want to use it no interesting okay so you're saying in those developing markets people well I guess you don't know but do you have a guess as to what kind of the the main uses were for them yeah I mean looking in the United States even after the events of 2007 we still trust our banks you guys do I I'm sorry it doesn't sound good to say but you do because you go back to the bank and you give them your money and they hold onto it for you in most of the world that's not the way people think people don't trust banks in most of the world and we provide a tool for people we provide a software tool so that people can hold their own crypto we are the best in the business at it we have 24 million validations of that happening so you know it's it's a remarkably different perspective on things we give people the tools to store these things themselves to use these things themselves because we are not in exchange and so you actually referenced this earlier sort of like what the difference was in 2017 that we saw on the industry side Michael and Barbara do you also want to add kind of like you know obviously we did talk about what was going on in the in the market side but then where are we as an industry like what needs to be built what has been built so far what's been proven what hasn't things like that yes sure you want to start young yes so I think you know there's a lack of certain tools that need to become available that will further validate crypto as an asset class this is everything from quotation systems order management systems seeing further validation on the custodial side portfolio aggregation tools the the market around crypto assets at the moment is entirely outside of the existing framework around which assets that are used for investment currently flow through digital currencies Bitcoin are not sent through DVP accounts or through your prime brokerage at Goldman Sachs they are not necessarily yet held by custodial solutions that would be yes deemed to be qualified custodians and so I'm very much of the belief and certainly on the front lines of witnessing that there is a lot of institutional capital that wants to move into this space and a lot of the aforementioned things that are missing are being worked on some of the entrepreneurs that were investing in on the venture side of our business are building those very types of tools that are necessary to bring those types of institutions into the space but again to Marco's point you have a lot of different things going on in the space whether it's token issuance or speculation or financial inclusion it's very difficult to see which of these is going to emerge the fastest or if there's other use cases we're not even thinking of yet and as more and more folks come into the space and that begins to solidify you're going to see massive movement of capital but at the moment there's a lot of things kind of representative of a nascent market around crypto assets that are not allowing a lot of people to participate yes I think we are moving away from the early days of crypto that was extremely expectative and in fact if I would name 2017 in the crypto space it would be speculation the word that I would use I think everyone was speculating and trying to get what was going on we are still trying to get it but in a way that is a way more solid and we can understand what's going on you know so I think now 2018 we see exactly what he's saying like we have a lot of Custody companies coming in just a few that will deliver a real solution for funds venture funds hedge crypto funds and then for that you have more trust you can see institutional you can see real money coming into this market and that's how I say things becoming more solid the ethereal summit posted by consensus is anything but your average blockchain conference join builders philosophers policymakers artists and humanitarians from around the globe on May 11th and 12th

coming in obviously we've had this big downturn but we've also seen there have been some big announcements from Soros Venrock that they plan to get in who's leaving who's coming in like what is the assessment of this massive downturn I think you know things went down at one point to like I don't know two thirds by two thirds from the highs of late 2017 I think now it's maybe more like 50% or something I'm not totally up on the numbers but you know what what do you see happening right now um so you spend a lot of time with hedge funds around the world in fact I don't think there's a city in the world I can go to where I can't fill up a day or five days worth of meetings and I think what I'm seeing and experiencing that was not the case six or 12 months ago is no longer needing to do any Bitcoin or digital currency 101 or 201 with any of these investors which is great it's it's a time suck and quite frankly there's so many good resources out there for people to be doing that on their own that it's not a great use of our time I think that there's no one theme though what the types of investors willing to deploy capital into the space and so I think we're fortunate to call as clients of ours and our products everyone from global macro funds to tech focus funds to devalue funds it really runs the gamut I think a lot of these folks are looking at a couple of different narratives as to why they're getting involved one is certainly around digital gold a digital store of value and that's a narrative that I think has has you know been pretty well covered in the press and actually positively Laura and I think people get it that that Bitcoin and perhaps some other digital assets can be a Gold 2.0 or a digital store of value I think there's a lot of investors that are also looking at the riskiest end of their portfolio allocation in recognizing the merits of digital currency investing in the context of a diversified portfolio and that they probably can't find other risk assets with the risk reward profile that digital currencies have and again because there's now that backdrop that allows them to invest in this that allows them to write in their quarterly newsletter to their LPS hey we made an allocation to Bitcoin or we made an allocation to aetherium or whatever it may be without getting backlash I think the investors are recognizing they can't afford to not be there I don't think we're seeing traditional hedge funds betting everything they have on the space and I certainly hate to use the word even bet what they're doing is making an allocation of anywhere from fifty to a hundred and fifty basis points that makes them participate in this and that forces them to pay attention to it they recognize that it's early days and that they're going to need to be patient on it but if this goes to zero it's not going to be a material drag on performance and if it does some of the things that we think it can do well it becomes a really meaningful driver of returns for traditional investors and so I think many in the investment community look at it is almost like a call option so we're seeing more and more these institutions coming into the space and I think the only other thing I'd add to that Laura is that you know Bitcoin continues to be that kind of gateway into other assets but I'm also starting to see now probably since the beginning of the year interest and involvement beyond Bitcoin and people looking at creating diversified portfolios amongst crypto assets and how are they also deciding whether or not to invest in things like you know the different crypto hedge funds that have popped up so which are already going under and also some of the few VC firms and then you know investing with something like greyscale what what's the difference in them and how are people making those decisions yes so I think there's different types of investors different risk tolerance different time horizon you know the greyscale family of products is for people that can make at least a one-year hold period on the investment that they're making that's what all of our products statutorily have and we're not for people looking to make a quick buck or you know make a quick trade I think people are either pursuing one of several strategies they make a targeted allocation and they stick with it they'll maybe put 80% of the dollars they want to deploy into a target allocation like that and then maybe keep you know the other 20% in actual coins themselves there are a lot of investors who are increasingly interested in the venture side of the business and deploying capital into private companies the only issue there is that unless you're truly a VC and you can build a pretty diversified portfolio of different companies attacking different vectors of the space you're making exceedingly targeted bets that have very very long time lines before they'll pay off and so I think investors are recognizing that the proliferation of the asset class as a whole the best and probably more most liquid way to play it is to get exposure to the coins directly be it through a product like grayscale or buying coins directly if they have the mandate and Beegle you can do so and is the distinction between whether or not they would choose to go with grayscale versus just buying the coins just what you mentioned about the legal ramifications or custody or like what are all the different factors that would you know push them to buy the Bitcoin investment trusts as opposed to just Bitcoin sure yes so what we're offering our products that have q-tips that are DTC eligible and so when it goes in front of the risk committee and the chief compliance officer and the attorneys and the accountants and the auditors it's something they can wrap their head around it's no different than someone buying GLD instead of buying physical gold directly and so a lot of the funds that were interacting with by mandate can't self custody and so it's an issue for them to even think about buying digital currency directly I think another thing that a lot of these firms are taking into account are they look at what they do their invest they're smart they're strategic but then they rely on prime brokers and banks to handle all the assets that they're invested in why would they suddenly depart from that and start self custody a'somethin and burden themselves with that it's just a departure from their their comfort zone I wonder if in a few years these won't be the same these factors won't have the same level of significance would you say so it depends I think some of that will come through increased guidance from you know the IRS the SEC around the treatment and taxation of these assets I think it'll also come through seeing more qualified custodians popping up in the space that will allow people to do a little bit more of that on their own right which I think we're gonna start seeing yeah pretty soon so let's actually talk about that those trends what are you seeing there in terms of the infrastructure that needs to be built out and what is being built out yes so I think there are no shortage of companies coming up in the world certainly around custody custody is this big black dark cloud that hangs over the entire industry everyone wants to have the best technology the safest security option etc I unfortunately think that the banks who are bleeding in terms of seeing their deposits going to places like coinbase or into grayscale products or wherever else people are buying digital assets as much as they may eventually attempt to build their own custodial solutions all of the custodial companies and wallet providers I think they're all acquisition targets I don't think that banks are gonna be able to do any of this on the timeframe for which customers are gonna want to see it happen and so I think you have leaders in the industry like blockchain like Zappo but Zappo is only doing custody for Bitcoin there's another firm called Ledger that's based in Paris that's doing a phenomenal job and working on a vault solution as well so I think there are some really fantastic entrepreneurs that are building world-class companies that are going to become the BNY Mellon x' of the digital currency ecosystem and once that happens you have any prediction for how that will affect the space like once we start to see a lot more of these solutions come online more access points safer solutions less reasons not to get involved great so since you referenced dark black cloud think you have an industry let's talk about regulation what what is the you want to talk about regulation yeah all right where do you want to start which government agency okay so I think what the industry is looking for is further guidance from the IRS Marco you were in the space at the time when the initial IRS guidance came out we were all jumping for joy that there was Eddie any at all statement from the IRS on the taxation of digital assets but nothing has come out since then so would love to see more around that validation around how like-kind exchanges are going to or not going to be treated you know mining there's a whole slew of things we'd like to see on the tax front but to Marco's point 2017 was largely characterized by a lot of token sales and icos and what I'm seeing from my interactions with regulators and I spend a decent amount of time in DC is they continue to throw these warning shots across the bow that are trying to establish for people what constitutes a security what does not what is illegal and what is not and I think it's starting to take shape I think people are starting to hear and starting to listen but there are what 4,000 enforcement attorneys at the SEC and a lot of icos that occurred over the last year and I think you're going to see further crackdown in that space over the coming months but Marco what do you think I I haven't been a big firm securities lawyer for literally weeks [Laughter] yeah I'm kind of curious to know what what 2017 looked like from your end because as far as I understand I think a lot of teams came to you and they had certain ideas and you had other ideas around what they could and couldn't do so you can talk a little bit about how you gotta steer them or you know what people thought was okay and what they eventually realized wasn't yeah maybe maybe I can says there's a lot to say here so maybe I can I can do this by way of telling a little bit of a story so in early 2017 there was a I was interviewed by The Wall Street Journal for toking sales and I see as if it was still kind of gaining momentum and at that part of the year and I was like one quote that made it into the article and that happened on a Sunday and I was quoted as someone who was advising people who wanted to do token sales the following Monday it started at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time and picked up a for the entire day the the email started coming in the phone started ringing and we had received there was a point where we started to receive one inbound per business minute well and so you have to think about like who wants to talk to a lawyer that badly it just it's just baffling you know and you know we started picking up the phones but at a certain point we had to stop and just sit back and think about what was going on here and so we did we stopped him and and and we sat back and we started to collect and organize the inbound and to do the analysis of what potential clients what what what they wanted and the results were startling results were really shocking the first third were well was not all that shocking the first third were people who wanted to sell tokens that would eventually power cutting-edge decentralized networks which is of course our bread and butter it's what we're very familiar with it's why we get why we got up in the morning as a team and we took those calls and we did a lot of work there it was great second third well the second third was just people who wanted to sell securities people who thought they could access liquidity by selling a token that they wouldn't have otherwise been able to access had they just sold a piece of paper or a PDF document and those people well we didn't call them back because you can't access liquidity that you couldn't otherwise access just in virtue of inscribing the contract into a blockchain instead of into Microsoft Word security is a security is a security it doesn't matter what the what what form it takes there's nothing special about tokens that make them securities the last third though was absolutely fascinating a lot of people wanted to sell securities not people who are building decentralized networks it was and I'm changing the names to protect the innocent Folgers Nike Gillette people who sold real world goods that didn't have anything to do with block chains but what they wanted to do was combine a lot of different parts of their business into one into one thing into one token what they wanted to do was well sell a token that stood for a pair of Nikes and again I'm making this up this is not one of the enquiries we got one token one pair of Nikes simple what is it it's a it's a coupon it's a it's a gift certificate right but they wanted to sell a billion of them at a time and they wanted to sell them all in one day probably to investors at 80 cents on the dollar and those investors taking on very little risk aren't gonna make a 10x return but they may make you know a few percent well don't turn around and act as underwriters and sell those to the market because they are after all just coupons they are Nikes they're redeemable for two Nikes and then Alice and Bob and Johnny on the street get 10% off their Nikes who doesn't want that consumers do shown over and over again they do that's fine that's interesting but but what was really fascinating about they wanted to layer a loyalty model on top of it because you can track and you can visualize and you can trace the movement of tokens on a blockchain which you can really do with coupons and the secondary market for them which there was really for coupons so I wanted to layer a loyalty program on top of it whereby if you held 5,000 Nike coins consistently between the the dates of October 1st and December 31st of 2017 on December 31st you were invited to the Nike VIP VIP party with LeBron James and Tiger Woods and you could party all night with your favorite sports stars and then for the rest of the year you were a Nike ambassador and at the end and for that entire year not only do you get 10% off your shoes in addition to the 10% you would have gotten with a token their additional loyalty elements lay it on top of it fascinating stuff but what does it do it incentivizes people not like securities incentivize people to make money when the company makes money but to tie incentives to the growth of a brand which is just fascinating stuff it means you're financially incentivized with financially incentivized in the growth of the brand so that if I wear Nikes I'm not just talking about how fly my Nikes are I'm also talking about how nobody wears that deed us anymore and Reebok is played out because I'm financially incentivized so that's a very long explanation of where I think the market could go I think that the world of tokenized securities is enormous it will be a 14 trillion dollar market but it will be tiny compared to the world of tokenized literally everything else that's interesting that's a trend that I don't feel like I really seen in real life is that something that's coming on the market or how did you advise those teams are they working like are these corporates working on this stuff right well I think there's still a tremendous amount of regulatory uncertainty that's that great cloud right that you're talking about this is still tremendous regulatory amount of regulatory uncertainty around how those things can be issued did anybody come here to make 10% I mean no right you all came here to to lambo on altcoins right and make 10,000 percent and because you missed the area more maybe you made it but should have made more that there's a there's no robust set of investors right who are here looking for a stable return that that first of all I'm like the only crazy person talking about this stuff there are some other folks out there but we're few and far between I think this is a very long-term perspective I think that everything out there that can be tokenized will be tokenized at one point in its life if if our policymakers can take a long-term perspective on it but as far as you understood last year like that's kind of loyalty points on a blockchain thing that you described that's but like what are the legal issues they're like what would be the I think all of the legal issues all of them all of them are there I mean you've got consumer protection issues you've got anything money-laundering issues but I'll tell you one of the reasons the debt this is this is powerful is because right now if you look at a coupon I can tell you people don't look at coupons but if you if you do look at a coupon find one turn it on the back what does it say no cash value not redeemable all the money transmission lawyers know this stuff the payments lawyers know the stuff you have to do that because if the coupon itself can you can go to the issuer with a coupon and redeem it for money or non-transferable right if you can transfer it to somebody else then you enter into a regulated regime and Nikes not going to do that right the Gillette's the Folgers of the world are not going to do that what tokens do and we're struggling with the the penumbra of this now the outline of this whatever the silhouette of us right now but we're tokens do is they shift regulatory burdens hopefully to the people who are best equipped to exchange to to support them and that is exchanges right it's the exchanges about to be regulated it's the exchanges that do the high-risk activity that is potentially prone to money laundering it's not Nike Nike make shoes but they can't do this unless you can offload that risk offload that regulatory burden to the folks who have anti-money laundering policies compliance officers and all the rest so that's one of the really our Philemon --tz-- of this vision which we still haven't seen much of the beginnings of but I think is out there Laura I just want to add to that so in 2017 for about as many of those proposals that Marco had in his inbox for calling his office I probably had about 10% of them in my inbox or LinkedIn account every morning I did every single person in my organization I think I also had about three or four people a day offering to write a white paper for me in 24 hours so that I could tokenize something and do an ICO and and I mean it like that actually happened and so we saw certainly a digital currency group at the parent company level a plethora of icos throughout 2017 now as probably the most prominent venture capitalists in the space and a long-term VC investor I think we very much take the view that we want to see the capital formation process become easier right we don't want it to only be reserved for the who's who of the VC community we want to see other people be able to get involved who maybe don't work for you no injuries and Horowitz or Union Square Ventures and be able to participate in and support other entrepreneurs but as we saw so many of these icos I think there were kind of three big things that stood out to us that caused us to not participate I think one was the team behind a lot of these projects these were people that had no real track record of success so it would be very difficult to put money into something for someone who has you know no track record of doing anything let alone kind of giving you a token in exchange for some future promise of some great project I think we also often questioned the legality around this so spending a lot of time with the SEC my interactions with them were very much of the school of thought that there's 80 plus years of regulation as to how assets are raised and in the United States and by American investors and by and large this was a pretty big you know misstep and on a lot of people's parts and how they were structuring their projects and then I think the third thing was was valuation you know why should you know Michael and Marco two great entrepreneurs be able to do a traditional venture deal raise three million dollars X valuation but somehow if we were to tokenize and do an ICO we'd be able to raise 300 million dollars at an insane valuation right for the exact same project at the exact same stage of its life cycle and kind of where it was and so kind of looking at those three things you know caused us to stay meaningfully on on the sidelines on the ICO front throughout 2017 and now because of the you know news that the SEC is kind of looking into the ICO issuers and their legal teams and their advisors and how is that affecting the entrepreneurs in this space like what different decisions are they choosing to make I mean I think we're like so DCG now is probably about a hundred and thirty portfolio companies and a lot of them have done.i cos I think any of them that haven't already done so to the best of my knowledge for the most part have tabled any plans that they had to do and ICO generally speaking you know how to put out naming any particular company within our portfolio a lot of people could just do it because the market was frothy and people were willing to give them money and people felt that they wanted to participate in their vision or whatever it was that they were building but these days I think we're still seeing a tremendous you know an amazing shift of human capital of people leaving banks or established companies to pursue projects in the digital currency ecosystem and so I don't think that a slowdown in ICO is as by any means stopping talent from coming into the space or building projects one other issue I wanted to bring up as each and lady tokens I think for a while there was a question of whether or not that was actually going to be a thing I think we got some indication that actually that probably would be I'm finally chairman and Jake Layton of the sec did make some comments that indicate that he did think that there might be something where you could issue with uh security and that later in its lifecycle it may not be security Marco do you want to give me a high-five or yes I've okay but I mean that's I don't think that's what yeah I don't think that makes sense first oh yeah interesting well but I thought but that was my interpretation of your soft white paper no it's a common misconception and I was delighted and simultaneously horrified to hear the chairman make that comment but it was it was obviously an offhand like remark at a in a public setting it wasn't you know the official position of the SEC or anything no the no that's not no so I there really aren't there's there's no real precedent of any asset out there transforming from a non security or from a security into a non security really there's nothing really in history as someone who by by no means has done exhaustive research on this issue but man a lot of it there's there's really a lot of history there know if people use the shaft framework then what they did was actually something that there's abundant precedents for in history you Seles aft which is a security this piece of paper and that thing is a security you file your Form D you you comply with the rules of 506 B or 506 C whatever it might be in for a private placement and that thing is always in forever from beginning to end the security and the issuers take that money they use the money to build this thing this this is good this this thing that has a use in commerce that's token and they give the token in exchange the token never was a security and at no point in its look lifetime would be a security there's no transformation in fact there's a lot of history for this but you don't need to read the books you know it intuitively if bob has a whole bunch of expertise and tools and wants to go pull gold out of the mountain maybe he has to go to Alice who doesn't have the expertise and the tools but doesn't have the money says Alice I need a million dollars to pull the gold out of the mountain okay I'll write you I'll write you a check but you got to write me a security in exchange for that check so I get a percentage of the goal okay fine that is a even of course to complete the thought Bob goes and uses the money to mine the gold and gives the goal to Alice this is a this is a relationship that is existed since time immemorial so know that in the sap framework there's no transformation between a non-security to a security the saft piece of paper is a security the token if you do it in the way that the white paper lays out should not be a security so hopefully that's helpful to teach that apart okay so you're viewing them as separate things well that's how we think a court would view it - regardless of what SEC says we're clueless of what the Press says that's you know that that's that's the framework that's that's how this stuff is is treated by issuers by investors by purchasers so we did see my oming he's new blockchain laws that were implemented and one of them basically carved out what we would recognize as a utility token as a class that is not a security and they're sort of like requirements where our one is that the network is live do you think that that is going to be something we'll see coming out of sec as well that tokens that run on a live network are not considered secure in that following utility a sign of things that they're not securities yes I mean you know you mean you mentioned Wyoming but they're not the only people to take that position obviously that's the position we took in the white paper that functional securities that are goods in commerce shouldn't be securities but fin mud the Swiss regulator recently can also took the same position they said look functional functional tokens things that work things when you buy them you're not relying on the efforts of the issuer to give you something that works anymore once they're functional these things shouldn't be shouldn't be treated as securities the Wyoming amendments take the same position I I can't imagine that somehow the whole world is going to adopt our reasoning in the soft white paper I think it's going to be a very uneven framework across the globe it is right now with securities right but I think that we're gonna see more and more people hopefully if they look at this right whatever the complexities are once a token is actually functional and does what its creators said it was going to do it might be speculative but that doesn't make it a security well a lot of teams now are showing away from issuing saps what do you think about their concerns do you agree with them do you disagree you know why do you think there's concern out about this aft I think there's a lot of reasons to be concerned about the saft I don't think they're legal I think their prime early policy-based we did some we did extensive legal research and analysis on this I still haven't heard solid legal objections to the saft framework but every every issuance is different and so that you you you can't be for or against the saft that's like saying I'm saying I believe the blockchain is moral it just there's so much wrong with the statement right but I also haven't seen people shying away from saft either with the last three big raises I think we're done using staffs but I mean we didn't invent the thing right it the saft existed long before my team got a hold of it and looked under the hood and see could this be used for good instead of evil and so I think the objections is what you asked about like are there you know what are the objections to using this a framework I think they're really good objections to it frankly and and the largest ones is that it keeps I'm pointing the crowd again but it keeps the wealthy at the table which isn't really what this is all about it demands compliance with the securities laws of demands that pre functional tokens be sold only to accredited investors and that keeps keeps keeps the wealthy at the table it gives them an upper hand it gives them an advantage over those who aren't over those who are not accredited in fact as an accredited investor you can participate in a rule 506 B or 506 C offering of a shaft or whatever it is to buy tokens prior to their functionality but then once they're functional well you've probably got them at a discount and you can sell them to the people who didn't it's a built in it's a built-in advantage and that's that's that's not fair and I don't like that I think it's more an objection to the securities laws that require that kind of framework that is an objection to the saft framework but it's still there and it's it's it's it's it's unfortunate I think that's a credible objection I'm curious to know and now I don't know if any of you would know at the table but I'm curious to know if anybody's made that argument of SEC you know I could just sort of put myself put myself in their shoes and say that oh you know our mission is to protect investors and so what we're doing is we're protecting every day people who don't know what they're doing from losing their shirts on these speculative investments you know but I don't know do they recognize that by by their own actions there may be also perpetuating inequality like I really don't know what they think and I don't know if anybody said those things to them I'm kind of curious to know if there's been a discussion like that or what you guys think about that debate I think it's a political question I think that you know you either believe that only those who can bear the risks ought to take the risks which is the reasoning behind accredited investor rules right you have to be rich in order to make risky investments in the United States that's a that is a political issue and either you agree with it or you don't it doesn't have a lot to do with tokens or saft even though that's somehow become you know the focus of this of this of this global conversation but you know I again I think those are political sort of questions of philosophy I mean no no doubt investor protection is one of the core tenants and core missions of the SEC but when I think you try and compare the size of the market that we're talking about to the market that the SEC has long been regulating monitoring and watching perhaps they just have bigger fish to fry for the moment and maybe that's why our industry is waiting so impatiently for more guidance so maybe too little too late like most things when regulators are trying to catch up with trends and innovations one thing someone told me about at a conference was that there are some people that are thinking they should switch it to some sort of knowledge-based test rather you know rather than like accredited versus not accredited I think would be very difficult to implement we probably need like blockchain identities or something before and some way to ensure people wouldn't be able to cheat on the test but I don't know what do you think of that this is like really futuristic but I just kind of wanted to float that I actually that's the first time I'm hearing of it you're catching little off guarding to think about that for a minute I mean with our products we're making use of general cetacean under 506 C so that's something that we have historically and continue to rely on that we're dealing with sophisticated investor who are very much knowledgeable and aware of suitability requirements and that this is extremely risky and an asset that's very volatile to invest in and so I think the idea around investor protection in that sense is that you know should someone lose their shirt on an investment or it goes belly-up that they had sufficient you know net worth or sufficient income that this is not going to put them out on the street doing this around something around knowledge hard to say we are disabled right it's it's it's not hard to say it just it just doesn't it doesn't I don't think it works I look again II it's it's a political issue the the law as it stands today is what it is it says you have to be rich to make speculative investments in the US the knowledge requirement I guess is interesting but it has nothing to do with tokens that's nothing to do with crypto it's not a crypto issue it's a political issue around investor protection that it's it's existed much longer than token has so well much longer than tokens have and block chains have so is it a good idea well I mean it's it's it would take literally an act of Congress I mean this is also the SE is a disclosure regulator right and so provided that the proper disclosures are made about any given investment regardless if it's a paragraph long or it's as long as worn piece you know is that long enough or is that sufficient enough to warn investors about the risks of what they're what they're touching regardless of their net worth yeah well I guess we'll see how that plays out as something else I wanted to bring up was that these ICS were billed as a way to kind of seed a network and get a lot of users on the network and yet you know we had all these ICS last year and I don't know if we could really say that any of these networks have a lot of adoption other than Bitcoin and aetherium which you know that was the case even before so that we now are seeing these ecosystem funds pop up and I saw some people making fun of this idea on Twitter but I wanted to get your opinion on that maybe for the benefit of the audience so an ecosystem fund is where the issuers of the token want to incentivize more development in that Network and so they that create this fun to basically you know give I guess give Brants or something to other developers that might want to create apps for on their platform well I believe the name say it all like echo system fund we were talking about this new wave that talks about the centralization and empowerment and when you're talking about an ecosystem fund you're really talking about really building together building in a way that if it's well structured if it's well managed you have the right governance and right incentives you you do pretty well I think echo system funds it's one of the trends and if they're well done they will help a lot the echo system has the names it seems to me like a symptom of having too much capital too early right I mean they're they're other and I don't I don't I don't judge any any any particular project but what else are you gonna do with the money when you have it all up front you have to put it to work somehow and if you can't deploy to capital to you know hire the developers and all the things you need to do to achieve the goals you set forth in your white paper if you just cannot deploy the capital that quickly you can't let it sit there you want to put it to work and an ecosystem fund is seems like a great way to do that Michael any thoughts no I just think the unfortunate part to marco's point is that when a lot of these funds have so much capital often time in experience how entrepreneurs are not converting that capital back to something more stable and often taking a lot of price risk and things like aetherium or you know whatever it may be so if you raise your eyes CEO last year and you know are sitting on a hundred million dollars of aetherium and that's now you know down 50 percent from there well that's a really bad place to be in not only for just your project but god forbid the sec invokes rescission rights around your IC o---- and you have to return a bunch of money to investors so you know i think the idea of an ecosystem is is really is an interesting concept I think again nothing to your point about governance you know you're trying to create a decentralized platform for innovation and trying to draw in talent there's nothing wrong with trying to draw people into your ecosystem or create the proper incentive structures so long that you know philosophically and the governance doesn't deteriorate but again kind of new and not all that time-tested you know some folks that are doing that in a new way is like Zee cash for example kind of with the founders reward and kind of giving tokens back to a lot of the folks that are contributing or our data scientists there but again super early for a lot of these types of projects and they'll be interesting to monitor them one other trend I wanted to bring us we're sort of running out of time is that as we saw at the end of 2017 crypto kitties took off in a big way and after that a lot of people were talking about non fungible tokens and then we saw the ERC 7:21 standard developed which is the standard for basically it's it's the non fungible version of of icos I guess you could call it a very simple way to create a non fungible token and then on top of that cryptic kiddies itself got investment from usb and others what do you think is on the horizon for that do you think that's going to be a big market and if so in what ways will it take off and who do you think will be buying these collectible crypto collectibles yeah so our our parent company invested in crypto kiddies along with a couple of other really well-known VC's like injuries in US v you know the crypto kiddies project itself Laura's house telling you before kind of reminds me a little bit of Tamagotchis and people kind of taking care of you know this this little thing whatever it may be but I think it's a good use case and a good example of how the tokenization of an asset being tangible or intangible and the uniquely identifiable very well does belong on a blockchain another place where I'm seeing this which i think is super interesting is in a project called decentraland where there's a new virtual reality platform with different parcels of land that are being bought and sold by different developers to build out various types of projects and there's an of currency associated with it called mana and so again you have this other kind of non fungible asset that people are assigning value to and different plots of land in different jurisdictions you know I have varying degrees of interest by the community and there's a thriving secondary market for them the way there was for crypto cuties towards towards the end of 2017 yeah one of the things that I wondered always as far as I understand I think the crypto kiddies market sort of like took off like a rocket and then like kind of went down fairly quickly as well so I just sort of wonder if this is gonna be like where there's like a lot of fads that happen but like you know that fizzle out pretty quickly I don't know what you think about that too early to say really too early to say yeah okay well any last thoughts from all of you on trends and innovations in crypto oh look these guys been talking their books on o all day so I'm just gonna do something just be super direct about something there's a serious lack of talent in the crypto space available talent to the extent that you are interested in this space and you want to get involved building blockchain the most popular wallet out there is hiring so please feel free to come by and say hello I'm gonna say something that I hope resonates well with this crowd which is driving myself and my team nuts at the moment there is an unfortunate narrative that because digital currencies are on the front page of The Wall Street Journal every day CNBC has a Bitcoin price watch in the lower left hand corner which was not there six months ago that somehow because of the frequency with which you are all interacting with this that somehow it means that every single person under the Sun has gotten involved in the space and I will be the first to tell you that it couldn't be further from the truth I think it's great that this is becoming more normal people are understanding this better but don't mistake the frequency with which you're interacting with something or how well a a certain story and the press is is picked up or the fact that journalists love to write about interesting things be it hacks or thefts or you know acid raises whatever it may be suddenly means that every single person is involved it's it couldn't be further from the truth and if we're talking about talking books how many people did you guys sign up like in the first quarter of this year right like millions of new wallets and you know my team is is raising millions and millions of dollars every week from new investors into our products so it's still early days and there's plenty of opportunities out there yeah I think there's a lot of information also out there so the more exposure you get and not just reading the news I think the news can be really nice and there's miscommunicated and then if you just like go for like real information that talks about the technology and how the investment work in this field it's really worth going deep and understanding it's the future it's happening now it's early but the more you get into the better will be for your future in general especially as an investor speaking of talking of books I'll say if you don't like the other press out there then you should follow my to podcasts Unchained and unconfirmed unchain is the long one unconfirmed is the short like slightly new zr1 and that's where we get into the the weeds and talk of details and and it's not all like about packs and about how bitcoin is like many PayPal and stuff like the hutt so anyway thank you all this was great and thank you all as well you [Music]
