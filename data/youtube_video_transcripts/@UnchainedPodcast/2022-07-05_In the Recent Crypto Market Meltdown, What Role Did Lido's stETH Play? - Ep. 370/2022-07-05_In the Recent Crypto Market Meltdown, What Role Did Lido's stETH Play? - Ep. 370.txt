hasu strategy lead at flashbots and strategic advisor to lido and tyrone chitra founder of gauntlet welcome hassu and tyrone hey laura and tyrone nice to meet you thanks for having me hey great to be back this is actually going to be the first and two-part series on staked eath or steath slash lido since there are a couple of big issues regarding it that i felt should be separated out into their own shows today's show mostly focuses on steath's role in recent events such as those involving celsius and three arrows that we also get into issues with lydo's power and proposals to address that tyron and hassu before we dive into some of these recent issues around steve let's make sure people understand what it even is and why people have been wanting it meaning what it is they do with it so hasu why don't you start with a description sure so staking in its native hormone ethereum has a few problems right so for one there's operational complexity users want to stake the if but not run the hardware missed their attestations get slashed etc then there's the cost stacking is only possible in multiples of 32 eve and even even in the bear market that's still a lot of money for a lot of people that they might not have lying around and the third problem is liquidity so if you stake you have to lock up your capital and cannot use it in d5 at the same time and this is a problem especially because the beacon chain right now is a one-way street so people can only stake but they cannot unstake and unstaking is only becoming available in the update after the merge which is called capella and that's expected to be around eight to nine months out so lido is a decentralized liquid staking protocol and it works the following way so users give the eve to lido and then lido gives it to one of 29 professional node operators who stake it on their behalf the idle issues they use as a token that represents the stake on the beacon chain and this token is called stake eve after withdrawals from the beacon chain are enabled from that point on users can take one staked eve and redeem it for one heave and the reason that this token is so useful and plaidou has been very popular to date is that this staked eve is like somewhat a sort of inferior form of eve itself which is like a token that people can use to represent their stake and you can use it in d5 they can trade out of it which wouldn't be possible otherwise and they can collateralize it in landing markets uh like ave or maker dao so in many ways users have found this to be better than running their own hardware and staking directly yeah and just to be clear oftentimes when they get the snake teeth they deposit to ave in order to borrow more eth stake that and then get more steath etc so one question that i wanted to ask here is you know we were talking about how part of the reason for this is because people want to be able to have liquidity on the ether that they stake and i was just wondering also because there are other systems that use delegated proof of stake does ethereum's lack of delegated proof-of-stake contribute to the need for stakeh or is that not the case yeah i mean i think um one important piece to remember about this is that there's sort of a philosophical bias in the ethereum two community against any form of delegation i think the long-term goal of that research community was to have sort of a one-person one-node type of version of the world where everyone was running their own validator they had their own keys of course i think in practice things got much more complicated and we started to observe basically exchanges offering sort of staked products like centralized exchanges like finance and coinbase where basically if you left ethereum on exchange then they would delegate it and run a validator and give you some or most of the yield and i i think effectively lido wanted to make a decentralized version of that possible and of course there's there's multiple versions of staking derivatives now but lido has sort of the dominant market share um if we look right now it's like a little over 90 of staking derivatives are in lido but i think one of the main things was exchanges started to aggregate this power and it became clear that there needed to be some sort of decentralized alternative and the decentralized alternative's main value proposition over the centralized version was that you could use it in d5 in different ways and so i think that the genesis does sort of stem from that and that that is sort of you know i think one of the reasons it is effectively in indirect form of delegation it boils down to the sort of philosophical divide amongst ethereum two researchers uh towards whether to have delegation or not yeah and i guess since ethereum doesn't really have governance maybe even delegated proof of stake wouldn't even make sense let's now talk about the reason why steve has been in the news so much one of the main issues is that people feel that steve has been mispriced for much of its life's lifetime the price of steath has basically been the same as the price of eve sometimes maybe a little bit less like 0.99 or 0.988 but once the issues with tara began a little over a month ago then it began falling a little bit and then once the problems with celsius and three arrows kicked off it really took a dive and it now it's at more kind of like 0.94 or 0.95 youth why do you think that is for one i think we can say that state eve has not been mispriced to date and um i can give an explanation for that so one state div as we said can be redeemed for one if when the withdrawals become available and sort of this is what we would call the primary market exchange rate and then what you described sort of is the secondary market exchange rate the price at which stake defolders can can sell it before withdrawals become enabled and so stake if is a rebasing asset that's something we should also mention so meaning its balance goes up over time so if the staking yield were five percent then after one year of holding stake eve then you would have in your account 1.05 staked eve and then you can use it and redeem it for 1.05 eve so if withdrawals were enabled today then i think we could straightforwardly say that one stack eve must always be worth one eve right because there's like a no arbitrage condition like if if it were like more valuable then people would sort of create more stake even sell it and if it were less valuable then people would withdraw the even and say that instead right so but they would always be arbitraged to towards the price of one so now but this is not yet possible to to withdraw right so instead we have several market forces acting on this exchange rate between stake even eve and the biggest one is sort of the fact that it is a yield bearing asset so and this is sort of a market force that pushes state eve to trade above eve why because if you stake it today then you can redeem it for more in the future so that's one reason like for steak eve to trade above one eve and then you have a couple reasons why it should trade below one eve and that's sort of there's risk inherent to lido mainly technical risk and governance risk and then you have risk inherent to ethereum and the merge so whether they can execute it on the timeline that we all expect and finally you have liquidity risk so that sort of you need to sell your stake if at any time before withdrawals become available but sort of the price is somewhere where you have to sell it at a discount right and depending on the current market conditions sort of these market forces are stronger or weaker than one another so before sort of the recent market downturn stack eve has indeed be trading at one eve why because investors were sort of favoring this yield that they could get from staking more than the risks and especially sort of this cost of liquidity and then the market turns and all of a sudden this is what always happens when in every market sort of when there's a downturn investors and market participants really start to favor liquidity right they want to be in the most liquid assets where they can be the safest and they can sort of sit out the storm and react to any market conditions and so i would say this paired with you already alluded to it but a lot of forced selling from parties that were also owning state event got liquidated so this then sort of caused yeah basically uh selling uh from stick if into even sort of pushed the price downward but that doesn't mean that it was mispriced before in fact you can sort of easily say easily see why that's not the case because if stake eve and this is what some people argue should always trade below one if then anyone who would want to join the beacon chain and start staking should always buy steak eve on the market and stake that way and never stake directly but if they did that then they would just arbitrage the price of stake eve until it is one eve again so we can see basically whenever there's axis demand to join the beaten chain then the two should be exactly priced one to one and when then there's sort of a drop in demand to stake and people for example favor liquidity or the risk goes up of e2 or of lido then you have these other market forces that push it down and there's no way to arbitrage it back up because withdrawals are not yet enabled so in a nutshell that would be my explanation for how stake eave trades against eve in various market conditions do you agree with that i think that's sort of like the correct maybe like zeroth order first order model there's some second order effects which actually knock were kind of the scary part slash why i didn't sleep for a lot of days and was pushing all these you know we at gauntlet were pushing a lot of governance proposals to try to like scare people into reducing their leverage but basically i think while that is true and sort of this idealized case of like really high liquidity this indirect way of kind of closing the arbitrage loop a lot of people who were participating in this market were mainly participating in a quite over levered way so there were certainly a few sort of people who offered vaults where you could deposit eath and they would go basically mint steak teeth borrow eat against a steak teeth and recurse that a certain amount of times and they sort of hard coded a lot of their assumptions about like how much leverage is okay so if you think the price is is always at one or very close to one then you could basically say hey i can like take a lot of leverage if you think it actually has some volatility and might actually go down to 0.94 you might say okay maybe i'll only take 2x leverage now the problem with some of these vaults and the one that was the scariest and was the closest to having the most cascading liquidation failures of when three arrows made that thirty thousand stake teeth sale was instadap and so instadap has this fault that basically was a little bit reckless with how it provided how much leverage it allowed people to take because it really basically made this assumption that steak teeth to eat would like never go below 0.97 and i mean there was this moment right after the steak teeth to the three arrow stick teeth trade where the the net liquidity for uh selling steak teeth so if there's like a liquidation someone will basically buy the steak to eat collateral from ave and then sell it somewhere and stated's dominant uh liquidity is on chain and it's mainly in curve there is a bit in unislop most of that comes due to a combination of like how incentives are constructed and you know where the lido governance token and the curve governance tokens are sort of provided as incentives and there was a really crazy point where like basically there wasn't enough liquidity in the curve pool to handle all of the liquidations if you had this thing where instadap got liquidated and right below instadap that basically if you assume the liquid it immediately sells all the instant up positions they basically trigger sort of a cascade of like some other positions now like the price goes down say it was at 0.94 the instant app gets liquidated when it gets liquidated they sell it on curve and the price goes down to 0.93 and then when it's at 0.93 there's some other loans in ave that get liquidated and there was there was definitely a huge contagion risk there and most of that had to do with the fact that the market's belief in this kind of low volatility of this price meant that people over leverage themselves and some of the reason this liquidity risk got priced incorrectly to some extent was basically because people were people weren't accounting for the fact that like the amount of leverage being used was was really high and i think that impact you know obviously is has stuck with the minds of people who are purchasing safeties which is why it's not kind of has not been i mean there's a lot of bids now at from 0.93 up nowadays but it doesn't seem like there's there's there's definitely people realize that they're these like extremely scary automated vault strategies that basically are quite reckless and the end users i think don't realize that they're kind of in this sort of precarious position yeah yeah i would imagine that plus the general macro environment all together just suddenly has everybody sort of you know pulling up the draw averages and being like oh you know i'm not going to do these risky things jr on twitter asked was stable swap or steath slash eth curve eth curve pool a good automated marker maker choice for an asset that quote unquote shouldn't trade one-to-one so i'm not sure how this curve full how it was set up but like was it something where the assumptions were that it would always be one-to-one or so i mean it it does assume you're sort of mean reverting around some point so it's an it's an automated market maker that so curve is sort of i think the simplest way to think about it is there's the two most simple types of automated market makers are one which is sort of a constant price so people put in reserves of asset a and asset b and um you say hey asset b always costs five units of asset a and then basically people can can buy until you know there's only asset a left or only asset b left and that's sort of a linear uh automated market maker it's not it it gives you a fixed price you have no price impact um and it's good for things that should be kept at roughly a constant price on the other hand you have something like uniswap where you you have this sort of constant product type of formula and a constant product formula the price is based on the ratio of the amount of reserves in the pool so like on each trade the reserves are going you know one one side of the reserves are gaining the one that's sort of more less in demand and the one that's depleting is one that's more in demand and curve is sort of an average of the two of them it combines this this very flat doesn't move the price at least within some range piece and then moves the price a lot when you're outside effectively i think that there is to some extent some bias and curve towards kind of staying near the the center point however some of the trade sizes we saw were large enough that i i think we got outside of the kind of flat region so there's a parameter in the curve system called an amplification factor which controls effectively how big does a trade have to be until it until the price starts moving really fast and i think that was actually being monitored and to some extent adjusted not not probably not as frequently as it should have been long story short i i i think you could imagine if curve's amplification factor was adjusted more frequently and the incentives were adjusted it could it would have could have been um fine i think it just things sort of happened quite fast and i'm not i wouldn't make the argument that uniswap v3 would be better for sure because you would have to still have people constantly adjusting the ranges in unislop v3 and in a kind of crisis time if if no one actually does that in time then like someone makes a trade and then there's no liquidity on the other side so i i think like there's the the dialectic here is there's not really one best design here it's better to actually have many different amms being providing liquidity and it's just that in the case of wider mainly this curve yeah i yeah so i think i would like to connect a few dots here so from tyrone's previous answer so you make you made a very good point which is that sort of the pricing model that sort of i laid out for like stake d versus eve is correct but it wasn't the pricing model that the whole market used and it's very important that sort of people understand why a certain asset should like trades a certain way and how it should trade under certain market conditions right because otherwise they just make financial decisions that could be bad for them or in the case of cascading liquidations be bad for the entire ecosystem that's the first start and the second is sort of lido has been incentivizing liquidity around certain price points or like putting incentives on certain pools why they did this in order to provide this service for stake efforts to you know have the liquidity and sell their eve when they want to right so they want to ensure that there's a liquid market and then the second dot is the right curve design so the goal of the perfect pricing curve is basically to predict where the market maker in that case should be deploying the liquidity right at what price points they should sort of reserve and put their inventory and sort of make it available for sale and so i think what uh what how all of this fits together is basically that the curve pool hasn't been you know as good as sort of reacting to when the market conditions changed according to the pricing model and um the fair price for stake eve was starting to be sort of below one and and so i think a different like using a more flexible amm like such as unisoft e3 i think would have made it easier to sort of just shift where prices should be coded because what lido should in fact do is not incentivize liquidity at the pack they should incentivize liquidity at whatever is the fair market price at the time at least that's my view because i think that's where they get sort of the most yeah liquidity for their value right because if they were deploying it below the market price then it wouldn't be very effective for anyone who needs that liquidity right now and if they were deploying it above the fare point then it could be arbitrage down to what the fair price is so i think they are always incentivized to maximize liquidity around what the current fair prices and in order for that using the right amm and the right curve design is very important earlier we were talking about how we had all these cascading liquidations especially exacerbated by some of these automated vaults like my insta depth and stuff and i just you know sort of need to address uh one of the elephants in the room which is that ha so you host a podcast with suzhou one of the partners behind three arrows capital so i don't know if there's anything you can either reveal about that situation and its effect on the market or your relationship to 3ac or anything like that so like everyone else i i learned about the three errors situation from the media i haven't talked to sue since yeah so um i think if i had to guess like the connection to this is that both three arrows and census were both large owners of stake if like as well many others but i don't think it contributed in any way so the the stake if eve price uh deviating from one contributed in any way to you know how all of this played out if anything i think sort of the causality here is reversed because both celsius and three arrows became large sellers of staked eve and as soon was pointing out earlier they had to sell several hundred thousand staked eve into the market so that would be my take on the situation but i don't understand i thought wouldn't that then lower the price of steve so why is it that you don't think that that contributed to not being oh so i'm saying that i'm saying that the reason that the price declined was in part due to their first selling oh you're right right yeah okay for some reason i misheard you and i thought you said it the opposite way so obviously we don't really quite know the full state of everything now with either of those companies but assuming that they both still have some staked eath then do you imagine it's more likely that they might be forced to sell even more of it to try to recover some liquidity for their users or lps and then you know are being are we basically looking at another potential depression of the price in the near future i don't know if they have any more stake thief i haven't been following the situation children do you know um i think some of their wallets have a little bit but nowhere near as much as the sunday june 12th that was like the kind of crazy like in 4 a.m roughly eastern time that was like when that huge sale happened and then there was just a ton of bots trading right after that what i heard about three hours as well is that they are entirely out of liquid assets and so steak leaf would be a liquid asset and sort of illiquid assets would be investments that they made that are somehow locked up or subject to vesting schedules right so i don't think um stick leaf would be affected by that and what about celsius uh they do still have some stake thief but mainly because a lot of it is locked up as collateral their strategies at least the ones that we've spent time analyzing don't they don't just lever on lever up on state teeth directly they borrow stable coins and they borrow other assets and that was why they were quite close to being liquidated actually because the eath price drop was more deadly to them than than the staked eath ratio because they borrowed a lot of stable coins and farmed in other places so celsius was a little more ironically probably less systemic risk to stake teeth itself but like more systemic risk to the overall like all d5 protocols uh whereas i think the three arrows and sort of instadap vaults were very like concentrated in the steak teeth type of thing but yeah i mean i mean celsius was really farming anything and everything that had i i had not heard of some of these protocols that they were they were putting their capital putting their users capitalist i guess oh dear oh dear okay so in a moment we're going

chrome's app store today back to my conversation with hasu and tyrone okay so as we were discussing earlier once the merge happens that's actually not going to you know immediately affect the liquidity of steath i think you said it will still be locked up for like eight or nine months yeah so i think that the um hard fork that would enable withdrawals is scheduled to be around uh six months after the merge so basically it's time to the merge plus six months and you know most people are estimating that to be around eight to nine months okay so let's talk a little bit about how uncertainty about the merge has also been affecting either the the price of state or just some of these issues that that we're seeing these are this is like a quick lightning run what's your level of confidence that the merge will happen in the next few months um i would say like 70 that it happens by october i'm perhaps more pessimistic i actually think it'll be early next year not not not this year okay and for both of you what's the level of confidence that you have that the merge will go smoothly i think pretty high if they do decide to go through with it then i think the amount of testing that we're seeing and the amount of preparation will um make me pretty confident that i think it can get the light as tune is saying but i think if they do go through that then it'll most likely go smoothly and so on a range of one to ten ten being extremely confident one being not confident how confident are you that it will go smoothly seven to eight i'm somewhat more pessimistic also uh one thing i i do think is maybe being underweighted probability wise is just like the fact that miners really enjoy keeping the pow fork alive like keeping the current chain alive removing the difficulty bomb and just continue mining on the existing chain i i know that's not it it might not be the the most likely scenario but i don't think it's as low a probability as um you know if i were to read kind of twitter sentiment you know i i have a i have a counter take on that which is i think the more that miners uh do something adversarial around the merge the sooner the merge will happen not the later wait i'm sorry the more that miners do what the more the more miners uh engage in adversarial behavior around the merge i think um the more likely are the human core developers to pull the merge ahead instead of pushing it out that would be my take based on conversations with them right i just i'm not sure how easy it is to gauge the whether they'd actually be doing that i mean obviously they'd have to collude to do it to some extent and make a new client upgrade and stuff on their own but i just think like the probability of that happening is like weighted way too low to me but i think i think like testing wise i mean the fact that they already got one of the test nets converted is actually a good sign i'm just still a little more i i just think like yeah the the the minor adversarial behavior i think is maybe being somewhat underestimated so i think my conscience is probably like a little less than hasu but like six or seven yeah after reporting on my book and how the ether classic thing went down i would definitely say it does not take a big group of people yeah because back at that time you know most people in ethereum really did support the hard fork actually it's at least as far as i can tell and i definitely think because we've seen that it was certainly a minority but that's all you need really so after their after stickers are able to withdraw their their stake teeth after the merch how do you expect them to behave in terms of the withdrawing do you expect to see that everybody will want to withdraw or do you think it'll be kind of a slower type of withdrawal or how do you see that yeah i quite the opposite i think so not after the choice i named it but i think first of all like after the merge i think the demand to stake will go up why because right now steakhouse on the beacon chain only earn uh the beacon chain block subsidy but after the merge the beacon chain will be responsible for ordering ethereum itself right so it will earn transaction fees and mev on top so you can expect the staking gear to go up quite a bit from where it is today so i think that will i mean also sort of reducing this entire uncertainty around will the merge happen and what timeline would it happen i think sort of confidence in ethereum's ability to execute on major upgrades will go way up sort of making investors more optimistic about the longevity of the project so i would expect sort of actually like much more stake to come in after the merge and then um yeah it doesn't really make sense that there would be large withdrawals unless in fact staked if at the time is then trading like below one eve as we said there are market conditions where it can trade below one even if that happens then the arbitrage will ensure that stake eve is being bought up on the market at the discount and then withdrawn and then the state the the eve is pulled out and sold uh in order to make a profit so that's when you should expect with droids to happen but if the eve is trading anywhere near to one eve then i don't see any reason why there should be any withdrawals i think one sort of important thing that will be true is just like how liquidity incentivization works around the the withdrawal event so if you know there's a multiple amms with you know greater than 20 plus percent of the overall liquidity so that you know you have one that's maybe like a curve pool that's good for when you're in kind of the mean reverting phase and you have something that's more like you can swap v3 for that phase and you have incentivized liquidity accurately between the two of those i think you could actually be quite fine even if people are unlevering because there is one other impact which is upon the merge people who were really levered may actually want to lower their leverage in stake the terms and increase it in raw eth terms depending on what yield opportunities exist post post merge which they might might be there might be yield opportunities that are specialized to east 2 at launch that basically you know you can't access with stake teeth so that would be a condition i would say like provided the liquidity incentivization is diffuse enough and can cover sort of these sort of automated rebalancing strategies i think it it should be relatively safe i don't yeah to to kind of the same as hostage point i don't really expect people to just like rush to the exit all at the same time unless yeah unless there's really some some real reason to redeem for your raw eth immediately um i think there'll be a lot of people who do it just to test it and see just you know look imagine you've had you you minted staked up genesis like of course you're going to redeem some to see if it's working correctly right like at the end of the day that that there's there's certainly going to be some amount of that but i would the only people i'd be worried about are people who are like automated vault strategies that have you know significant amount of tbl and they they try to redeem because there's some new uh yield form and so what do you guys expect to happen to the price of steath after people can withdraw their eth well i mean after that point the the prices are sort of tethered at one to one due to arbitrage right so as we already touched on earlier so if stake d for trading above one eve then people should mint more of it and sell it bringing the price back down and if staked either trading below one eve then people should buy it on the market and um withdraw the eve and sell it bringing the price up so sort of leaving out sort of more nuanced um sort of points like that being like a withdrawal q then i would say that the price is like absent sort of this nuance the prices are tethered one to one same as you would expect with something like usdc or tether or wbtc where arbitragers are basically always keeping you know the price of these in line with the underlying so another potential issue with state teeth is how dominant lido is in particular and as terune mentioned earlier lido's market share of all staked eth on the beacon chain is about 91 of all of the state teeth derivatives so why do you think that level of dominance has happened well first of all i would say sort of the 91 number is sort of a bit misleading i think what i would look at is sort of the overall chair of lido on the beacon chain right um which is around 32 percent uh the time of recording i believe so so first of all i would think there's like two two lenses basically two to look at this from the first is ligo's impact on ethereum security and the second is then looking at the counter factor so what if lido didn't exist and so starting with the first one i think there are some arguments that you can make that lido is in fact very good for ethereum security why because lido dramatically lowers the cost of staking by making it more accessible and by making it more liquid and so and so on so in equilibrium uh with lido in existence staking is much cheaper and as a result the total amount of steak that secures ethereum in proof of stake is going to be much higher so any outside attacker to ethereum you know has a much higher cost basically to to bring the system down and then you can also uh argue with that sort of if lido is bad for ethereum security in other ways mainly that it introduces one more layer of sort of principle agent relationship right because these stakeholders they give laito the and lido then distributes it to different node operators so if you compare this to a word without lido then stackers would directly choose the node operator so there's like one more layer basically of intermediation between that and so you could say and i think the popular argument goes like this lyro can exert soft power on these node operators in order to do certain things that can be bad for ethereum so that is sort of the first lens that i look at it from and then the second lens is what if lighter didn't exist so almost from the start i have been operating under this assumption that sort of the winner in liquid staking so first of all that liquid staking is superior to any other form of staking and the users like all things equal will always prefer it because they want the the lowest cost of staking and liquid second providers can provide that and then between liquid staking providers and this includes large exchanges there's going to be a large winner take most effect because as a user why should you ever not stake with the largest provider that is sort of the most secure the most liquid the most accepted in d5 protocols has the best tv sort of the best loan to value ratios and so on right so basically the the market leader always has the most chance to attract the next deposit that comes into the beacon chain and so going from this assumption i was thinking okay so there is going to be one big winner from this so what do we do like we really have to make sure that like a group of centralized exchanges or would work even more is like a usdc version of liquid staking that is sort of custodied and highly regulated so same as like we saw this in in stable coins right then tether had a big start but then usdc just started to crowd it out completely and i was worried that the exact same thing would happen to liquid staking so my approach was okay so we really need to need to make sure if there's going to be one large winner and i found this outcome to be like exceedingly likely that we ensure that this winner is the most decentralized that it can be and this sort of really motivated me to choose lido and support them very actively so both that lido can win this market but also that i and other sort of exert pressure on lido and really do the necessary research in order to make it as decentralized as possible so it sounds like you are not super concerned about its dominance amongst the liquid sticking providers to roon are you at all um so like actually before lido existed i wrote this paper with alex evans from well now bane i guess um who about staking derivatives because you know like everything in crypto people in in proof of stake land cosmos came up with all the ideas first but never implemented them first and taking derivatives actually like originated in the cosmos ecosystem far before ethereum it sort of showed up in ethereum and the main result of this paper is just that staking derivatives do one thing they democratize access to opportunities but they also have these leveraged deleveraging spirals so there's like this trade-off you kind of like want to balance the two of like hey small stakers or smaller participants can get like equal access to yield but also like hey there's a ton of leverage weird leverage games that happen in the system and you want to kind of like tune this system via a combination of incentives and sort of amm fees and other things to to make it stable from that lens i think having a dominant provider that has the most liquidity does actually make sense i would say the thing i'm more someone more worried about is that the it's it's not and and hosuh of course can can probably talk a little bit more about the the dual governance structure that's being thought of but i do think lido as a governance token does seem somewhat a bit scary if you believe that ethereum should effectively not have like on-chain governance for for its uh existence now i'm not saying that i'm not even sure that's a universally accepted truth in ethereum land but certainly of course if you asked vitalik you would say it shouldn't have that and so i think that that's sort of where i think some of the weirdness comes in i think the centralized entities and centralized uh sort of stakeh narrative is definitely true i mean it's pretty clear that a lot like you know hey it's only 35 percent of the market that's in stake and growth so the rest is somewhere and the rat that the rest of that is not at like hey i'm in my basement like running a running validation node like that's that's definitely not making up 64 most of that is at like finance and other places that offer this already although of course binances is not the uscc it's more the usdt of this analogy the interesting thing was that the the binance staking derivative crashed price wise significantly far before the stake death uh price change and there was this there was a while i think probably like january through march where people really thought there would basically be like some sort of parody trade between the centralized staked derivatives and the sort of real ones and it turned out that was not totally true and people people were sort of a little more reckless on centralized exchanges so i think it's actually quite good to have a dominant source of liquidity i actually think the liquidity fragmentation even that paper from from march 2020 does show that if you have liquid defragmentation you have way more of these sort of like tail events that kind of can blow the system up and we already see liquid defragmentation not causing these different assets that theoretically should be sort of like par to be anywhere near each other oh that's interesting having more liquidity fragmentation causes more scenarios where the system blows up that's so counter-intuitive it's like if you think about people who are taking one way of being a staking derivative is also as like basically sort of a collateralized loan and in from that lens there's sort of some liquidation condition whether it's getting slashed or whether it's you know something that causes causes the thing to to go under and in that case it the idea is like you have it it's exactly what we saw of it like you you have these cascades and you know if there's not enough liquidity the cascades happen faster because like the price is changing faster right so there's sort of this natural again trade-off and then this is why it's quite important to incentivize liquidity in multiple venues but for the same asset so i i just generally think like we've these are the vignettes that we've seen in practice that represent this thing that like you know theoretically existed so like you know two years later you could say that like hey a lot of those kind of predictions uh came true but yeah i i'm not so worried about the dominance as much as the um as much as like the governance aspect of lido okay yeah so let's talk about that because you know as you mentioned people have been pointing out that the owners of the lido token ldo may not always have the same incentives either as uh stakers do or even just normal ethereum holders or even the same interests as ethereum itself and so lido did recently float a proposal to reduce the power of governance over lido and one of the ways that's proposing to do this is through a process called ossification you guys i tried reading this proposal and i was like granted i was falling asleep so maybe that didn't help but please explain this this i mean it just sort of feels like you're limiting the amount that people can do via governance but that was as far as i got so maybe you want to talk about it more especially yuhasu you got it exactly right ossification means limiting the amount that people can do via governance but let me start at an earlier point so stekas give eve to lido and then lido gives it to node operators we covered this and this is a principal agent problem because sort of you have this one intermediary you might not be at all times incentivized to act in the best interest of the agent which is steakhouse and you have this both even if lighter were just on ethereum you would have this problem but it's sort of further excavated by the fact that lido also is on other blockchains and they share the same governance token so right now i think lido sorry ethereum is like 95 percent or more of lido's revenue so really like all of lido's focus is on ethereum but there's no guarantee that this is always going to be the case so we need to make sure that sort of ldo holders sort of that they don't sort of mix incentives across different chains right what's best for lido if lido's on many chains might not be the best for ethereum that is just its own chain so i think it's important for one to sort of disentangle the governance of lido on ethereum from lido on solana and from lido on polka dot and so on and there are generally two solutions to that problem to that principal agent problem and the first is the one that you mentioned is ossification so if the agent uh doesn't like they cannot do anything wrong like they literally cannot make a proposal that would hurt stakers then that's of course way preferable right so we can see in this whole debate that lido may not want to do anything or the orders may not want to do anything that's bad for stakers but just the fact that they cannot prove it to them and to the ethereum developers is sort of a problem that currently hinders you know them growing further right so we can see that sort of this ability for governance to do something bad is a major problem for the customers but also for lighter itself and so they are really aligned in removing the ability to do anything bad and the way that they want to do this is first remove any levers that would allow them to do something bad and where that is not possible yet for example because ethereum itself ethereum's taking contract itself the merge hasn't happened withdrawals aren't finalized so here it seems contracts themselves are not yet ossified so what leiden wants to do in the meantime is introduce a dual governance model and what this dual governance model does is it allows the same as today ldo holders to make proposals in governance and vote for them but then the staked if holders can veto any decision that the ldo holders want to make and so this way if there were a decision that is about to pass on chain then stacy folders can say wait a minute this is not in our best interest and so we are going to block this proposal and then it doesn't get enacted on chain and so yeah this uh what this basically does is it prevents sort of the the most adversarial outcomes against sticky folders at least that's our hope um because they can always just prevent the proposal from going on chain and to tyrone's point i'm i'm not sure if this is on-chain governance i mean it's it's not like sort of we are making any proposals to how ethereum should be changed right it's it's more like ethereum holders can have a say in what lido is not to do so i think i would like delineate a veto right from launching governance in that case i'm curious to me what you think yeah i mean i think the interesting thing about this sort of bear market like if we if we take like the first bear market of ethereum it was like the dow hack happened if we take the second sort of big bear market it was like hey we had the ico boom but like no one could figure out what to do with it but then over that bear market we kind of developed dows that actually worked a lot of the improvements that have been made were to like the structure of how dao contracts work and like what types of proposals were allowed and like how execution of things on chain worked obviously some of this happened on other chains but in ethereum land i think some of the standards and norms were codified things things were able to operate and what i think we're seeing now is a lot of these like dual class dao type structures like optimism has this sort of dual class where they effectively have something that's like a house of representatives in the senate in some ways and i kind of feel like the adding this veto is effectively doing the same thing it's like it's it's a different form of like how do we have like dual class governance it's still sort of a form of on-chain governance i just think it like has more more checks and balances i suppose that's interesting one other thing that i wanted to ask about here was so at the time that we're recording i should reveal to people friday june 28th lido just released a proposal on whether or not it should limit the amount of stacked eth that it should account for like the percentage of staked eth by the way it's a typo in my script by the time that this episode comes out this vote will have been decided so um since you know the vote will be over by then it might be interesting as a historical artifact to hear how each of you kind of think about this proposal you know do you guys think that lido should self-limit how do you determine determine what the limit should be et cetera well i think so for one it's not uh guaranteed i don't think the proposal is necessarily over because it's a two-stage proposal i believe there's one week of voting whether leider should serve limit and if the answer to that is yes then there's another week of voting how it should self-limit oh got it oh god yeah i just looked at the first the first deadline okay so maybe part of the vote will have been decided but not the rest yeah so i mean i i definitely i have laid out my case why i think um lido should definitely not self-limit i think the market for uh liquid stacking is is winner take most and there are outcomes for ethereum that are much worse like a usdc of liquid staking taking the market i think and also saying fragmentation if if it were to exist also has way more edge case so i think what we so my approach from the start has been to support the most decentralized and liquid second provider you know that's what i will continue to do and so i'm voting not to self-limit but instead to ossify leiden as much as possible and enact this dual governance model i don't know if self-limiting actually will work because um one other thing that's quite important is that lido steak teeth actually can be used in in other protocols and i don't think we've even gotten to confidence in any of the other providers i mean so there's a very famous incident with celsius where they had a lot of ether the stake teeth provider called steakhound and then they had this i wouldn't even call it a hack i would call it a little more like incompetence because of the way they they published their bls sort of uh file but there hasn't been a lot of like faith in other staking providers yet and i'm not saying that can't happen but i feel like if you impose a cap you will probably move most of that eth to centralize exchanges and not to other staking providers simply because of the track record so far and because people are skittish so i just don't think the caps are that like necessarily i think they have these kind of second order effects that might not mean that they kind of end up being useless or like don't help that much so it sounds like you also think that this proposal is a bad idea i don't think it's necessarily a bad idea fully i just kind of am not i i'm not i'm kind of 50 50 on it i'm like i could see why you would do it from a social scalability point of view perhaps but i could also see second order effects being bad and i'm i i have no clue how you would choose what percent you want to make it do you make it the bft threshold of one-third do you make it like somewhere below that because of like flashing communication limits like there's like all sorts of both theoretical numbers of thresholds where you would you would maybe cut it off versus like practical ones like how much liquidity can you actually incentivize if you only have x percent of the market share and i think like that type of analysis hasn't also been done so i i i'm sort of indifferent um i i kind of i agree with hospital ossification seems better i just think it it we have to find some protocols that have been able to successfully do that and maybe this will be the first that can can really ossify itself yeah i have to say the one thing about that is that i just think about so many of the kind of different emergency situations that can come up and as new developments happen like there wouldn't there just naturally be changes that would need to be incorporated so maybe i just didn't understand the proposal like i said earlier uh does it account for that it's so yeah so yes basically i mean it's a it's a two two step two steps for like a new proposal to go and change after this dual governance system has been put in place for one if ldo governors want to change lido then they have to make a proposal and and then there is a time lock so i don't know what is the current proposal is like one month i think so plenty of time for the community to review the proposal and then before it goes on chain staked e folders have the ability to veto the proposal and prevent it from going on chain so but if they don't veto then it just passes like it normally would so lido can still be upgraded it just cannot be upgraded in ways that would be clearly bad for sticky photos yeah i just wonder like i said if there's some kind of emergency whatever some kind of bug oh you mean for light or the light if lighter needs basically the ability to react quickly to upgrades protocol to protect stakers yeah yeah then how do they handle that that is basically sort of the the trade-off that you always have whenever you have a time lock right so a time lock protects the users of the protocol from the operator going rogue but sort of a time lock that is too long sort of fails to protect them from sort of forces of nature basically where where the operator could protect them so i think we have seen some ideas around that where um for example what if sufficiently many stakers voted in favor of the proposal then you know it would pass immediately so i i'd have to look up what is the current thinking around this in the proposal and then get back to you another aspect of this that i think hasn't been totally deviated is there some sort of like off-chain logic that theoretically i don't governance controls that that is not really sort of true for stakeh in the sense that there's sort of the assignment mechanism which assigns which validator is getting which block sort of like a pool like this sort of threshold signature thing there's sort of the queuing model of like how do you do withdrawals how do you rebalance withdrawals like what if one validator has a million eighth and one has a hundred each how do you like divide up and and someone wants to withdraw a thousand do you take it all from the million do you take some from the millions some from the 100 like there's all these like nuance things those things are not core to ethereum right those things are core to how lido coordinates validators those things can be voted on sort of separately from things that are core to ethereum and so that somehow i i don't know exactly what the correct abstraction line is but i suspect that lido the token will be allowed to respond to these sort of like a welcome off chain but like these coordination mechanisms for the people who are participating in lido's operators that might still have a sort of like not ossified state or like a less ossified state like and i i suspect that will be one of the things that kind of either emergently happens due to some you know as the validator set grows or something like that happens or not yeah i i think that makes uh a lot of sense not just the light up but just in general i think whenever you have on-chin governance on-chain governance is basically a liability to your protocol and so you want to limit it as much as you can that's what we meant with ossification so if you can for example say that only a certain parameter in your protocol can be subject to governance but for example not replacing the entire contract or not changing any parameters that don't need changing then that's always preferable so i think yeah these are like two efforts that are going in parallel so ossifying as much as possible and then for what cannot be ossified just provide checks and balances for the users of the protocol okay so for final question of the show why don't we just have each of you talk about what you think are kind of the main takeaways that people can learn from kind of all the recent events involving snake teeth especially in terms of users who were trying to figure out should i use one of these liquid sticking protocols if so what should i do with the state eath you know etc yeah if you could just talk about how you think about these things that'd be great so i think i think like the main lessons we learned are a liquidity optimization for derivatives is like quite important it needs to adjust with both the leverage in the system and sort of the types of users in the system and i think like obviously that's that's improving over time and but you know of course you know these tail cases are the times you learn where you're caught naked the most i think the other thing that's important to to to reason about is sort of the fact that a there's so much uncertainty in the merge time i i i think like you know i i think it would be irresponsible to say hey like the merge is definitely happening by x like some people like to to say i just basically say if there's some variance in that time expected time to merge then there's also some variance in your yield because your your your notion of when you realize that yield is is now has some variance in it right so that has to get priced in somehow and i think that because of that these derivatives at least offer you some way of earning some income you know via like providing liquidity to these curve pools or lending a navi that it kind of at least partially compensates for this like time risk this variance in time risk and so i i think that is a reason they're from a financial standpoint just strictly better than the centralized versions because the centralized versions can't really escape the exchange like maybe binance will make it so that you can use it in bsc or something but like i i just don't i just don't see it i just don't see this compensation factor coming from the centralized entities and if that can be the most for the decentralized ones that's probably the like best long-term outcome but i i also just think sometimes especially ethereum developers are a little irresponsible with their like statements because there's just a lot of investors who i they don't read the ethereum two roadmap they're not like reading the the github issues they're not reading the pull requests they're just like oh like this guy on twitter said it's happening in march i'm gonna go buy it yeah and then like you saw that with sue like i mean he was like he would just like tweet this stuff and like i was like you know somehow like people there needs to be some form of like structured pr about things with uncertain timelines that isn't just like yeah it'll be done by august yeah exactly i mean it's it's not the statements that they make it's the lack of statements right so you have this huge demand from the community from media and from investors to sort of get confidence uh levels on when the merge is going to happen how is it going what are the remaining roadblocks but there's just esther ruins says no structured pr around this i mean they could just put something on the website and you know update it occasionally when new information comes up and have some kind of official stance but so the absence of an official stance is sort of what creates this you know confusion i think and yeah so i think that's that's one takeaway i think there are some takeaways for different participants so i think if you're a holder of staked eve then i think i mean this was a reminder to be careful uh with your use of leverage i mean crypto is so volatile that every cycle just a ton of people get just blown out from using leverage irresponsibly and i mean i would argue that you don't need to use leverage at all unless you like really know what you're doing then you need a good pricing model so that's sort of the the next takeaway that it turns out like a lot of people actually don't understand where state eve should trade in relation to eve and so what are the what are the sort of the forces that push it there then if you're a holder of eve then i think now sort of the discount is like at less than three percent at the time of of recording um but it used to be at like six seven percent so if you're a holder of eve and you have been looking to stake and maybe you haven't made the jump then i think for many this has just represented like an opportunity to buy eve practically at a discount right because if you're an e folder and you're willing to you don't need to sell for one year and you can just sit out the price volatility then at some point this was like a 10 15 percent free yield for you basically right because you were buying it at a discount but then you also get the staking gear on top so the staking gear were five percent and then the discount was seven percent and you would get twelve percent in if dominated for waiting one year right so cleaned up for any risks that you incur in the meantime and then the final takeaway for me is and this is like oh like this is like one of my favorite topics at all in crypto which is governance is a liability to any protocol especially d5 protocols because it makes it more expensive for customers to trust you and so you want to reduce it as much as possible right and so to me this just validates like in a massive way sort of the whole you know reasons why we use blockchains in the first place because in the real world companies are spending so much money in creating trust with their customers because they cannot prove to them that they cannot misbehave right but blockchains allow you and smart contracts allow you to to prove in an incredibly cheap way that like your business is going to do exactly what it says it's going to do and to me this is just i mean the soil saga to me is just like just further validation that blockchains are incredible technology all right well this has been an incredibly fascinating discussion thank you both so much where can people learn more about each of you and your work um i would say um come follow me on twitter i'm hasoo fl and yeah you can check out my articles everything's on twitter and yeah also make sure to check out my podcast it's called uncommon core um yeah and i think twitter is also probably the best place uh it's tyrone t-a-r-u-n chitra c-h-i-t-r-a um and yeah a lot of my work and research is also online and um yeah so happy to but i try to talk about it on twitter a lot so it's pretty easiest place to find it okay yeah and you can also listen to tyrone on the chopping block here at unchained um all right you guys it has been such a pleasure having you thank you so much yeah thank you so much laura and thanks to roon thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about hassou tyrone and all these issues around snake teeth
