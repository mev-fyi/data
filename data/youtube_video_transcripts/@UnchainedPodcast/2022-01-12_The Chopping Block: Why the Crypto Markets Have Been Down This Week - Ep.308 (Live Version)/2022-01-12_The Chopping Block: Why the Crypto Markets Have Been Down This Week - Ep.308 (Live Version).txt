every time that i click on this i always hear the hi welcome blah blah blah oh it's on okay hello it's working oh it is it is but it's it's so simple entering to roon you're you're watching yourself or ourselves i think it's working all right i think we're good all right laura let's get it oh wait is it is it it tells me when i go to the it's when i go to when i go to the unchained ah it's playing the old one it's it's i think we have to make a new yes it is i it was it was i'm watching it right now i'm watching it right now it is uh there's seven people watching us and they're like what are you talking about all right yes uh although the description is the same as the old description it's correct it's correct it's good it's good okay let's start the show shall we all right um people as i'm sure you can tell thank you for bearing with us it's 6 17 and we only figured out what was going on technologically and why we could not get the live stream going so if you stuck it out all this time to watch this thank you for doing so um all right so i am laura i am generally the host of unchained but we have introduced a new show here called the chopping block where insiders chop it up about the latest in crypto and this show does not feature me but it features four really interesting crypto investors who are hasive qureshi managing partner at dragonfly capital tom schmidt partner at dragonfly robert lushner who unfortunately is not here today founder and ceo of compound labs and managing partner at robot ventures and tyron tricha sorry tyrone chetra co-founder of gauntlet and managing partner at robot ventures in each episode haseeb tom robert and tyrone although not robert today will discuss recent events in crypto we will also be releasing these conversations on the podcast so you can always tune in later but the live streams will always be the earliest you can catch the shows and in general the videos will also have the visual content whereas the podcast will be audio only we launched with a 2021 recap with a bunch of superlatives and i think people really loved it my favorite category was best mechanism nominated by tyrone and i am just here now to introduce these people and to explain why it is that there is a live stream on the channel and why i am not a part of it with that all said i will turn things over to your moderator too sorry to see i'm this is turning out to be a great episode it's amazing is amazing so far okay catch you later good luck all right thanks laura okay i'm taking over moderating duties from tyrone because uh i'm supposed to be the moderator so i'll just take that uh hey everybody welcome to the chopping block uh every couple weeks the usually four but currently three of us get together and give an industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros for everybody on the team tom is the d5 maven and master of memes taroun is the gigabrain and gran puba at gauntlet and myself haseeb i am the humble hype man at dragonfly all four of us are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice so with that being said uh we are this is now currently just you know a little behind the scenes this is the second time of us recording this intro so we started bantering a bunch about omicron and um i i'll save you i'll summarize the previous discussion which is basically that omicron very bad lots of people are sick so for those of you who uh who have not had a run-in with uh with the with the with the ome um please stay safe although at this point most people we know uh you know including possibly ourselves have gotten overcrowded actually have either of you do you think you guys have gotten an icon yeah you have for christmas yeah oh shoot it was fine it was honestly i was just more annoyed about having to stay at home i'm fine yeah that's fine i'm just staying at home anyway yeah i got on a flight uh and i i think i mentioned this already my last call uh when i was on when i was on a flight i was like i'm pretty sure i'm gonna get omicron from this i suspect i mean the omicron uh rates of asymptomatic infections look quite high right isn't it something like 50 percent i want to guess that a lot of the people i know more more than half seem asymptomatic they just happen to test because like someone made them test and that like to go to something and they're like we're positive like didn't know so yeah i strongly suspect that i'm probably asymptomatic because i given how contagious this thing is there's just no way that i haven't gotten at this point but it's good hopefully this is how it ends or ends whatever i wanted to find out that the definition of end yeah it does seem like at this point covet is just gonna be endemic but you know i've said that enough times now that it does seem like this is the one saga that never wants to end but okay well let's let's move on given that we are running a little bit behind today so the big news of the week uh has naturally been the market drawdown and it's been pretty brutal it's not just been constrained to crypto a lot of asset classes are getting hammered right now but the broad drawdown in crypto has really been accelerated by well it was kind of kicked off by the fomc meeting the basically the fed getting together and kind of signaling that they're going to be engaging in rate hikes earlier than originally anticipated in large part due to the surprisingly large inflation that's been hitting consumer price indexes as of the last couple months so it seems like markets across the board are pricing in faster rate hikes and faster rate hikes generally what that means for those who don't pay much attention to macro a rate hike basically means that interest rates are going up which means that the opportunity cost of capital you know what you could be making if you're in a safe asset is higher and if it's if it's more attractive now to invest in safe assets that means that risky assets growth assets like you know growth stocks and like crypto tend to go down in value because the relative value of holding their portfolio goes down so it's kind of unsurprising i've been i've been chatting with a lot of folks about this for a while that inflation in many ways is actually not going to be long-term great for crypto it's in some sense it's kind of good for bitcoin because it's like okay bitcoin blah blah inflation hedge but in the other sense look if people raise rates crypto is a growth asset and it's very risky and the demand for growth assets goes down when when rates are higher can we also empirically bitcoin does not look like an inflation hedge in the last 12 months at all bitcoin doesn't really look like anything it doesn't look like gold it doesn't look like inflation it is petrox it is pet rock this year it truly is i mean it doesn't look like anything that sounds like an uncorrelated asset to me and that's something you want in your portfolio you know it is funny how those are the two memes right there one meme is that oh it's like gold it's like an inflation hedge which like gold is not that great of inflation hedge either but it's like an inflation hedge but then also it's uncorrelated to other things in your portfolio and obviously those two things cannot both be true but um i bet you could make it uncorrelated is the best bet i bet you can make a community out of like a like brownie emotion randomly moving like asset and and just like you know it's uh you're gonna be priced a different you know thing every day and i bet people would love that you know it's people love to sort of uh you know read the tea leaves and assign meaning to to different assets and this this is this won't run out of meaning right randomness will never run out of meaning for people i i like that i like sun tzu of the casino me i'm yeah trying to yeah i think i think the general consensus is yeah macro um as i was noting on one of our many takes here uh there is you know some you know secular outperformance like nfts have actually done really well i think um openc is like breaking all-time high volumes and like um a lot of the floor prices and some of these mps keep moving up so it almost sort of says that like the people have sort of suspected this for a long time and you see this a little bit in the data when looking at um addresses of people who are engaging with nfts and crypto and people who are you know trading other types of assets it's like the nft community is almost sort of it's overlapping a little bit separate from the people who are uh you know uh doing yield farming and buying bitcoin and stuff like that so um pretty frequency like that market which people have always said is is very representative of you know crazy froth and frenzy the markets actually do well as these other growth assets are sort of drying down well i also think the emerging growth assets like the assets that like didn't that maybe uh didn't track beta relative to their sort of like they didn't track like the market expectation of the growth assets last year but they are still growth some of those have done really well in crypto i mean i think the biggest examples of those are like everything in the cosmos ecosystem like 10xing um like in the last two weeks like has been kind of wild relative to ethan bitcoin and then near uh so like osmosis near adam those are like all three insane winners and like i've seen a lot of people talk about this like near short solana trade based on open interest and it does seem like the growth winners of last year are sort of like rolling into the growth winners of this year which seem to be different later ones so i think you know within the drawdown you'll find these kind of like separate things and of course ken griffin today which i think like honestly move the crypto market everyone everyone you want yeah so um citadel security uh hft firm prop shop not a hedge fund like citadel like they're two separate entities but citadel securities is the one that i would say most people who are uh gamestop connoisseurs are angry at uh because the dell securities is the market maker designated market maker on a bunch of different exchanges but also uh powers um and sort of when people couldn't get their orders in they blame robin hood sort of was like citadel didn't take our orders and so people kind of hate them for that but civil security full uh market makers of the last 30 years the dell optiver probably are all in that echelon and citadel securities is most market makers are proprietary trading companies they trade their own capital they don't raise money from outside investors like a hedge fund or a mutual fund and the interesting thing today was that citadel securities decided to sell some of itself to sequoia and paradigm uh sort of probably the most prominent crypto uh and i think it's kind of interesting that because it signaled a lot to the market that citadel which you know is famous can group is for uh for lack of a better phrase on crypto uh repeatedly uh in very in many public settings okay okay okay i saw everyone at jump get really rich so now i'm finally fomo again uh if i were to give you my my rough that happened yeah it's hard it's hard to know exactly what it means it was a very strange headline because there was very little in there about crypto like there was i think i saw one vague illusion that matt from paradigm basically said like yeah they're going to get into other asset classes including crypto and that was it um and so there wasn't i mean the other thing of course they're a market maker right they're not a directional investor and so it doesn't to me it kind of seemed a little strange obviously i clearly don't know what the broader story is behind this that makes it attractive because there's a pretty big financing it was like a billion plus that uh total between sequoyah and paradigm um so i don't know what what what do you think is behind it well a couple interesting things one is i feel rate of venture funds has so there there's kind of been compression between public market funds and venture funds over the last uh i'd say two to three years where there's a there's starting to be blends of investment styles of people who are supposed to be doing these private investments for longer times versus people doing public investment so they're rotating their portfolios consistently and that's come from the rise of crossover funds so crossover funds usually trade public equity books so they trade stocks at you know billions but they also have private um style investing and they are much more aggressive in their venture style investing um both on the valuation level uh so higher prices than sort of traditional venture capitalists who are always trying to get a 10x tax return um but like it started beating venture capitalists at their own game in a very large upswing bull market uh and so what you've seen is like the biggest funds have just started raising even more money to deploy even fast try to keep up with these crossover funds and i feel like this has got to be a big deployment for these funds even at their size i think this is a quite extreme amount of management fees being earned tell how many take from your side yeah i think um a lot of people are obviously reading the crypto element here um is as you know we have a crypto circle and people read you know paradigm doing this deal but i'm curious why sequoia is doing this deal i mean they seem to be getting more into crypto so i don't actually know how much crypto flavoring there there is it seems like um as you said maybe a testament to like you know capital markets sort of sort of merging across stages across sectors um and like uh you know i already was there was the increase in restructuring last year um to be able to you know uh uh trade like liquid assets as well as uh sequoia looking to you know hold assets or post ipo so everything is everything as they say and um maybe that's kind of what we're seeing in capital markets as well yeah i mean i'm entirely speculating but i can imagine that now that sequoia has entered into this evergreen structure so people don't remember you know i think it was earlier late last year sequoia announced that they were moving away from the traditional fund lp model into one gigantic vehicle that every investor into sequoia is just in the vehicle and they don't get you know any um specific liquidity based on individual investments but you're just like along for the ride for everything that sequoia does or something like that i i don't know the exact details uh but i can imagine that look if you're basically playing every single stage of the market beyond ipo even then having a relationship with a market maker especially you know one of the most dominant ones like like citadel uh is is going to be very strategic to you now for paradigm i'm not again i'm not entirely sure clearly there's some crypto component that's larger than what's being intimated in the uh press release which was just you know one line about a getting into other asset classes um but i guess it'll be i guess we'll know soon enough once we start seeing how citadel gets into the fray so interesting story one worth tracking um i'm curious you guys know what were the biggest drawdowns and we mentioned you know some of the assets that didn't draw down like near and cosmo's ecosystem what what what got the brunt of it i don't have the uh i guess uh actual rankings but i think you know qualitatively it seems like the assets that really depended on uh sort of a lot of leverage or yield farming either implicitly or explicitly um and so to mine that kind of looks like ohm and spell um so olympus dow and abracadabra um which you know basically you know relied on their communities or in the protocol to uh buy more assets at a discount in order to buy more of their own assets and sort of you know prop up these these uh uh communities and sort of this spiral naturally when there's a large market drawdown um there are not a lot of buyers we saw like a lot of you know liquidations on the uh fuse olympus dow uh lending pools where a lot of people were you know again again getting getting leverage on their own um and so naturally i think you know those started to unwind and i think uh you know om is down uh quite a bit like like 50 60 from from from the peak but um i don't know actually with the with the specifically the most uh uh damage assets were yeah i was i was just looking at coin gecko's um like uh category based um capitalization losses like yeah a rebase tokens and om forks for the um but things that were kind of high up there were like game five markets play to earn so i feel like a lot of the like ver and metaverse tokens so a lot of the things that were really really hyped um over the last six months is like hey like people are buying land in decentraland i think a lot of those that's really took a big whopping yeah i did see some big gameplay drawdowns but yeah it makes sense to tom's point is that a lot of these assets are implicitly leveraged from the way that they're uh structured and so if you basically have like a leveraged system then of course when markets draw down it's gonna it's gonna lose much more than everything else um okay so moving on in news uh one interesting piece that got a lot of attention and conversation going was uh moxie marlon spike's blog post about web3 it was entitled web3 first impressions and for those who did not read it i can give you a very brief kind of tl dr basically you know moxie um so moxie was the creator of sigma protocol he's a very famous cryptographer and he's been kind of roughly associated with a lot of the um uh kind of it's an early cypherpunk movement uh but has not been very involved in crypto except for his involvement into mobilecoin which is a private cryptocurrency built on top of uh not built on top of but integrated into signal the the application and so he was sort of reflecting on you know hey i haven't spent a lot of time really using nfts and uh what is now called web3 i'm going to try it out he did and a lot of what he reflects on is the two two main ideas i felt like in his post one was that the notion of trying to create a totally decentralized web is maybe a flawed enterprise and the original web tried to be fully decentralized and they realized over time that this wasn't realistic one because people don't run their own servers and two because there's a natural uh centralizing force to creating quality platforms that people want to spend time on and then second is basically his critique that most of quote unquote web 3 and nfts aren't even that decentralized to begin with because there are a lot of you know servers there aren't really even you know hash uh uh hash pointers to content that's supposed to be embedded in these nfts basically there's a lot of uh reliance on centralized parties like infira like you know like the you know ipfs nodes that are kind of freely running and for a lot of these they aren't even hosted on inferior or ipfs they're just hosted on regular websites and so that was the overall critique as i summarize it tom taroon you guys have thoughts i have many thoughts uh yeah this was very annoying for me this week i think i had maybe six or seven different people who are sort of crypto adjacent send this to me and ask me my thoughts on it and it's sort of similar like when those tether truther articles come out and they're like hey have you have you heard about this and it's like yes i have heard about this actually um yeah i i feel conflicted uh where i think obviously for someone of you know with moxie's background he understands i think a lot of the sort of you know concepts that are important to understand in crypto um which such as the difference between interface and an implementation and a client and a protocol that uh uh and the client that might divide that protocol and so i think a lot of his critiques of web3 a are not new to anybody who works in crypto um i think we all know these these things are are happening um but in my mind it's sort of a straw man argument where i don't think anybody in crypto actually thinks that every single layer of the stack is maximally decentralized um i think we've sort of said you know over the past years like what the meme has been decentralization is a spectrum and that gets reflected uh not just in protocols but in every layer of the stack so um of course when we say something like oh yeah well of course you know metamask is using inferior to look something up or people are looking at openc to like as a shortcut to get the nft data um you know sure those are choices that you know this particular client is making but doesn't actually you know impact the the underlying protocol choices like the image might still be stored in ipfs or like you know ethereum is still going to be running um no one thinks that you know this thing is going to be decentralized at every single layer of course there's benefits to centralization um but i think it's sort of this weird critique where it's like hey um crypto is not maximally decentralized look at all these points of centralization we know and that's fine but that doesn't really erode the value prop um i think the other element here is critiquing specific client implementation choices right um i don't like the way that you know metamask is implemented i don't like the way that openc is implemented that's that's fine i think not everybody's in love with the way these these things are built and hey maybe this could be more decentralized maybe this could be more centralized like there's a spectrum of choices and and we already see you know different types of uh uh websites and different types of wallets um choosing different points along that path but i think to sort of say that you know because people are looking at their nft data on openc that's like an indictment of nfts as a concept it's just it's just kind of ridiculous the same way i could say well i could build a really shitty signal implementation that uh you know uh maybe he doesn't actually do the end of encryption correctly or maybe like does stuff in clear text and therefore signal the protocol is crappy like clearly that's a bad argument um so i thought it was kind of absurd a lot of it also kind of felt a little bit sour grapeseed to me where um mobile coin is you know this project that he's associated with has not really been caught up in any of the web 3 hype it's just sort of this i think it's just very recently been integrated into signal and sort of you're taking baby steps but um it it feels obviously a they will have to make some centralization choices at some point around you know building a block explorer or maybe building other wallets um but it also feels like it's been kind of left a little bit out of the conversation so i don't know i overall was not a very big fan and felt like there's not a lot of new information and the arguments were overall uh pretty bad in my opinion to ruin your impressions yeah so you know i honestly i think most of this criticism comes from the fact that developer is nascent and also like a lot of the things that people really focus on i guess you know have some warts but the one thing i took a lot of offense with especially mobile coin in signal was this claim that um hey like there's barely any cryptography used which i agree for nfts no offense the developers of nfts are significantly sh than those of d fire their ones they're just not as good of developers so like they're not going to hard cryptography right this is not in their veins and he was kind of oranges i felt like with that but the other thing is a lot photography that has been created in the last 10 to 15 years the way it went from academic research to production was via cryptocurrency and that's you know a lot of those systems are still at the phase where the us out such that the average user can take advantage of things where you don't have to store all your data and you can also do sort of private computations um and i think a lot of that stuff was implemented in in in this space just slower to kind of get to adoption sort of in the same way that like rsa and ecdsa were instant they were created right it took like almost 10 years for e-commerce sites to actually kind of force https to modify itself and have this kind of ssl which is like this is to take advantage of this cryptography that something on amazon encrypt your password encrypts your credit card number um and i think that component is and and you know to one of the the comments uh in the chat uh with regard to kind of this idea that like most of the metadata is not on a decentralized file system or it's on a file system that requires pinning is that a lot of the stuff for actual data availability and uh which is the access to data like in it uh is still kind of a lot of the cryptographer for making that actually feasible is still just getting to production right now and so i think things like celestia which is this really awesome data availability you know effectively you can kind of get some of the effect of a normal file system while also having you know thousands of validators uh things like these are into production this year um and i think a lot of the other uh oh i'm breaking up sorry about that a lot of the other um sort of come from the fact that people are not writing smart contracts when they're uh shoot my audio is really bad um your audio sounds okay it does okay people on that are saying it's bad but um so basically i think a lot of the things come down to the fact that there are a lot of quote unquote web 2 developers to start with uh but who like they're like oh i see an api i'm just gonna like make a little website and connect the api and you know obviously people who've been in crypto want new users so they put out these apis but a lot of the new developers don't try to go run their own go do a lot of this stuff and i think i think a lot of his frustr he didn't even go one layer deeper into how these systems work some of the newest systems what kind of things are kind of on the frontier he instead went to kind of like oh like that's almost like saying oh coinbase so centralized i don't believe this unisopting exists and i i it did remind me a little uh when sbf kind of was like dexes and whatever you know in 2019 in case anyone so i i had a somewhat different reaction to the piece um i mean i i see the points that you guys are making the central thrust of his piece as far as i saw it were kind of two points that he was making um so one i think it was kind of like okay look i don't know much about nfts i'm gonna figure out how they work and like yeah he's right you know you sort of pull back the mask and like yeah there's a lot of kind of bad design decisions and a lot of entities today yeah okay cool good point well taken um the the the second and broader point i think is more about the web3 meme than it is about any specific indictment of a specific protocol right so there are kind of two points i think that are important that he's making one is that look the web3 story is this broad story that we're going to remake the internet to become this new decentralized version of itself and he basically claims that like look this meta narrative about the internet is is poorly founded and and it's just not going to work and to be honest i kind of agree with him i i don't believe in this kind of broader web 3 thesis that everything on the web is going to become re-decentralized or whatever whatever whatever i think a lot of things on the web just actually work they actually work quite well and we figured out ways to make them work and putting everything within the context of a decentralized blockchain doesn't really make sense and i don't think it's economical and i don't think that's how the internet's gonna evolve so now that's okay uh then he further goes on to indict you know a lot of the services that people use and say look this thing is not really decentralized and you guys are making a lot of centralizing um a lot of assumptions of trust that reintroduce centralization and this is the natural way that things go it's just like the it's the sort of the lowest energy level state that a system is always going to fall back to is this going to find centralized actors and rely on them and i think about that he's also right um and i think his indictment of saying look if openc apis stop showing a particular nft it's almost like having that ft not exist anymore and it's true i think it is the case that we do overly rely on openc within the nft world which does um which does weaken the value proposition for nfts as being these sort of like well look it's only on the blockchain as long as on the blockchain still exists well for all you know practical purposes it's like saying look uh just because i deleted your bank account and like say you're blacklisted from holding a bank account doesn't mean that you can't have money anymore you can still hold around cash and you know buy things at grocery stores um but for all practical purposes it does efface a lot of the value proposition so i think he has good points but i also think that they don't go quite as far as actually indicting the entire enterprise of like okay are nft is valuable do they make sense are they a kind of unique innovation one thing he never talks to is like okay what is the point of nfts and to my mind i think the point of nfts is to have a digital system of property rights for non-fungible assets right that's the point of nfts it's not anything more magical than that it's just like a titling system for assets that we think should be titled in a neutral credibly credibly neutral global permissionless enforceable way and i think it's a good idea i think i think we've we've found at least a small set of use cases so far for which that makes sense um and i feel like this piece doesn't really tackle that which i feel like is the core of why nfts matter not because their metadata is decentralized i agree um i also think he obviously didn't talk about any of the you know financial stuff which in my mind is what makes this way more interesting than like you know slinging nfts around or making like decentralized twitter maybe that will happen maybe it won't i also agree there's a lot of issues with i think that sort of sort of concept but clearly there's like product market fit for decentralized financial services that are in many ways superior to the centralized versions that we have today i agree i don't think he was trying to talk about that right like specifically and i think that's so on the argument a little weird was that you know i i web 3 does feel like a little bit of this marketing thing meant to ensnare fang engineers to work encrypted engineers to work at crypto companies which is fine that that's it's fair it's a pin but uh i i do think like if you ignore stable coins and you're talking crypto then like what are you doing like that's the biggest use and somehow that his whole thing about writing this derivatives exchange ignored the existence of stable coins which is why he could do it in the first place and there was a lot of i felt like there was a lot of kind of half truths sitting there and that was like oh well maybe maybe you should have actually gone like one step further you have signal integrating like a lot of very no i think uh all good points okay let's move on there was uh a really interesting a couple interesting pieces of drama this week uh otherwise relatively snow news slow news week so i think is worth uh throwing into the mix crypto land so crypto land uh for those who are not familiar it kind of popped up on the scene uh in the last week basically uh i'm gonna butcher this so tom please correct me if i'm wrong a bunch of guys got together and it's definitely guys got together and decided that they were going to crowdsource buying an island and i think it's like in fiji or something near fiji uh they're going to buy an island and um it's going to be all crypto people and they made a video so they made a video it's like apparently you spent a lot of money to finance this video do you have do you i feel like you know the details of the story better than i do yeah the video's not loading unfortunately but um yes uh so they have spent 500 000 of their own money to acquire the rights or the permits or something to build this sort of crypto themed um island uh in fiji um and people are obviously comparing it to to fire festival in the sense that it seems like they have this insane idea for building some over-the-top island paradise but they really do not have the the background or it seems the logistics to make this happen so um there's this insane video which which is not loading which apparently spent a million dollars in a year on um which i i i think people have their own different objections um to the video the animation is is super creepy um i think the main thing is that it's almost like an alien landed and uh you know sucked up all like the top 50 memes about about cryptocurrency like you know buying lambos and going to the moon and satoshi or whatever and tried to stick them into this video with with no context and so it's just jam-packed with a lot of very cringy uh cryptocurrency references um and frankly it does not look like any place um i would like to visit um but um oh here we go it's finally loading um excellent thanks for having me yeah it's great just a bit disturbing um i would say overall um and so uh now money to actually build this thing out uh they're selling these homes which are uh being represented as nfts again kind of questionable uh for these like 1.2 million dollars so um overall it feels very fire effectively of uh having this big promise and raising a lot of money kind of unclear to be able to deliver on it but i think really the the video and the crunchiness of it and the musical number um kind of kind of threw people off so to be clear that is really where the story begins uh is with this crazy uh crowdfunding video and whatever then my understanding is that um they got into some twitter tussles with people who did not respond as positively as they were hoping they would to this entire uh enterprise so apparently there's one person on twitter who they hit with a cease and desist letter and they started sending out a bunch of these cease and desist letters to people for making fun of them on twitter and supposedly for spreading misinformation about the about the island so it the whole thing just it seems like just a complete show and overall uh nobody ends up looking good at the end of this especially not crypto as a culture i only have one thing to comment about this which is my mom sent me that video and said is this what the metaverse is [Laughter] so i would prefer going there in the metaverse rather than trying to fly out to this yeah most likely doomed doomed island you know i think going there for kicks would be kind of funny but it was very 2017 in my mind which was like kind of crypto adjacent but not like really and people raising money on these big promises and there's like no accountability and i just had kind of 2017 flashbacks when i was watching the video yeah there was something i think tom you were telling me something about um like trying to get plumbing onto the island or something yes yes in the discord people were asking very simple questions such as how are you going to get utilities on the island and apparently they've planned to route all of the water and sewage electricity in a pipe under the ocean to the mainland of fiji and that's going to be uh their the utility solution so you know it's you kind of want to vet the team's background when you're when you're backing someone and make sure it's the right team for the right unit project so um yeah good luck to crypto land packers i guess no good for them well um you know obviously we don't give investment advice on the show but um i would encourage you to do your own research before you invest into a crypto land parcel because there there may not be uh utilities when you get there i i mean i do love the hot spot of doing like you know what fire festival didn't do it because they didn't own the island you know let's like try to own the uh like that's like basically the attitude it does seem like look that's the other thing is these investment dials are getting bigger and bigger there's kind of an extension of an investment now effectively and you know we started with constitution then we're moving on to blockbuster uh pretty soon i mean now effectively we're trying to buy an island and it doesn't seem like the end is in sight for what these uh investment houses are going to try to go for yeah i actually love this whole investment now thing there's links out now which is trying to buy a golf course um there's kraft's house which shouldn't buy an nba team um i'm trying what else there's a couple other like let's pull together money and then go buy a real world asset and it's very sort of sloppy it's sort of like early icos like no one really knows how to do it or like what the oversight should be but i love the energy and uh hopefully we'll see like you know kickstarter or indiegogo on steroids um in the next year but um yeah not holding my breath yeah interesting none of these are very close though to actually purchasing their targets right i don't believe so they can raise a lot of money uh as you sort of saw with constitution dow but i think the actual execution of how do we buy this thing who owns it how does the dow actually interact with it how do we make sure we're not creating a security i think is uh kind of the tricky bit now that all three of us are in but pleaser dow has successfully been able to purchase off-chain items like from the so it is possible to avoid kind of these things it just takes a long time and i feel like right now there are a lot of people who make an nfts and they're like well i want to do something with it and i don't necessarily want to and i want to keep it on chain also a dal is a natural place to park that capital of course you know figuring out how to get the dow have to go to the real world and i think a lot of people are learning once they cut then it's actually the hard part collecting the money is the easy part the hard part is actually like the you know i feel like the lesson people have learned is that spectacle pays and the bigger spectacle and the more outlandish and the more crazy the more eyeballs it's going to get and therefore the better it's going to do and that that feels like in a way a kind of broad lesson that crypto teaches you which i don't know is the right lesson to take away but it's like look if elon musk like just tweets out a bunch of crazy stuff about dogecoin it's like oh okay that's how that's how you win is you just go bigger and louder and more crazy and you know constitutional was a perfect example of that but i think it i think you're right is that like the the logic of it just keeps ratcheting up until eventually it hits a wall so strange times that we are living in speaking of other controversial in it yes speaking of other controversial nfts so there's been some drama in the last week about a pudgy penguin nft which those of you who are not familiar it's one of the top nft collections on ethereum and openc as you can imagine there are these kind of fat chubby penguins it's just a general profile picture so you know there's 10 000 20 whatever some number of them and basically what has happened so the one thing i noticed about this story so essentially what happened was that the the nft project has not been doing amazingly since it initially launched and the community has gotten very frustrated at the initial founder and founding team of the pudgy penguins and there's been a takeover bid an attempt to basically cut out the original founding team from the future transaction fees that are generated so in a lot of these nfts not all of them but certain nfts when a transaction is made a transfer is made of the of the nft part of the purchase price goes to the original founding team as like a tax on future transactions so a group of uh creators have decided to go in and wrap the pudgy penguins in a proxy contract that basically makes it that when you transfer the pudgy penguins via this proxy contract uh the creators don't get a cut anymore so they basically cut out the creators of this uh of this nft project from any future revenue as essentially like a kind of revolt against the original creators and they're now there's now all these talks about how to redo the okay it's called the huddle uh how the huddle can sort of redo and kind of reformulate how the penguin community is going to be put together and the other thing i will say i saw is a lot of great puns in the headlines for this so one of them was uh the what is it pudgy penguins cools off as the community gets upset another one is uh what what was the one that i saw in the ft uh oh no it was coindesk uh coindesk's headline was uh pudgy penguins nft project house founders as mood turns icy the mood did turn icy i uh it's i think that the part that you missed which i kind of like the most is um it's not just wrapping and sticking the penguins in this proxy contract to get rid of the fees but in theory it's to introduce their own fee which is going to go like this like nft govern dow which they can use to do their fund the things that they wanted from the original debt so it's sort of like a like a unionization where it's like you know they're overthrowing the penguin overlords and all the penguins are are you know coming together to uh start their own dao that isn't isn't you know responsible to uh the creators royalties so pretty interesting i mean i think it's like there's a lot of nfts that have been started where the idea is hey um you know we're gonna have our own treasury from the start and we're gonna use that to fund things for these nfts going forward like like nouns now for example and they have sort of their own you know community and culture around it um and then there's obviously energies in the other end of the spectrum like board apes or crypto punks where it's like no there's no dow there's no like there's no fees it's just like you guys do it whatever and we'll make some stuff and it's almost sort of like separate i haven't i think this is the first like um like grassroots nft dao um as far as i know of where it's like um there's been a revolt of the initial um sort of royalty and initial tao and the community sort of formed their own so i actually like the pangus i think they're like uh they take themselves very not seriously which i appreciate in the nft in the nft world people just like the penguins and think that they're cute and so um yeah it's been pretty interesting to see yeah i it reminds me actually of what happened with a lot of the uh sort of justin sun and eos communities in that we're starting to see some of these like you know revolt against the original creator founder where basically it's like look you haven't held up your end of the bargain you have some kind of block reward or some kind of perpetual reward i mean we just talked about this a couple weeks ago with uh with eos when eos basically ousted block one for their blocker award and said look you guys made plenty of money screw off you guys aren't supporting us we're gonna go our own way and take those funds that we're otherwise paying you and actually use it to further the protocol and it seems like this is the first time that we're seeing the same thing happen in nfts and i guess the the thing that is interesting about this as a meta phenomenon is are we going to see more of this is this like now suddenly we're normalizing this idea that you can start kicking out the founder it's almost like the analogy of you know in in traditional companies when a founder stops doing their job you kick them out and you hire professional ceo and you like say look you're you got us to where we are but we're not going to take us the distance and we might start seeing that as the equivalent of a community going and you know basically kicking a founder out and saying look yeah you started this but we don't owe you anything anymore you already got paid screw off we're gonna find the right kind of leadership to take over this project in a way it's almost a sign of governance growing up yeah i think the issue has always been with g5 protocols were like hey isn't the labs team or the foundation team really just developing everything how much of this dependent on third-party developers and like you know this is kind of what people always want to see right which is like competing teams you know competing for some sort of you know treasury grants to develop stuff and it's like i guess it's happening in nfts instead of in d5 first forked based democracy at the application layer exactly well nfts are a weird place for it to happen given that there's not supposed to be any more development from there but i guess you know licensing and creating partnerships and all that stuff i guess that is still work and um if no one's doing the work then the community isn't going to succeed so it's an interesting development and i'm curious what's going to come from that so last piece of news and then we'll we'll wrap things up so poly market which uh i believe uh tyrone you're you're an investor in if i'm correct so i don't know i don't know how much you can spend i don't know how much you can speak to it so maybe tom and i can do some of the topic talking if you uh if you prefer but poly market which is a prediction market that i believe is built on matic or polygon poly market got hit with a fine by the cftc for basically running an unlicensed prediction market you're not allowed to run protection markets generally in the u.s uh they had to pay a 1.4 million dollar fine and then cease and desist offering these products any further in places where they're not allowed to so the word on the street is that probably market so supposedly they need to shut down by january 14th in offering these products to us customers i assume um and uh you know go elsewhere word on the street is that their plan is to potentially go overseas and continue offering the product but just geoblock uh american customers um overall thoughts on this tarou i don't know if you can say anything if not just wink twice and then last time the only thing i will say is uh they are alive and kicking their f was quite de minimis um you know i think this form previously scared protocols and i don't know if you remember there was this kind of somewhat more similar to poly market like somewhat more centralized prediction market that was built on top of auger um of course pre so it was much more complicated uh and vale folded at and because they were worried about and um and then perhaps would have actually been uh alive gotten a similar deal as poly market so i think they'll be they'll be alive and kicking figuring out a new way of moving on yeah i think um this the spirit and the strategy for a lot of different defect protocols has been um start be start somewhat centralized um move really fast and then decentralize over time as you get big um and that way by the time you have a target on your back you know there's nothing really for regulators to go after and we see a number of different d5 protocols you know pursue this pretty well i think poly market was trying to do the same thing where starting out okay you know we're going to be the ones resolving markets and we're going to be selecting the markets and we're going to sort of be providing liquidity and just use that to sort of get the wheels turning and then decentralize over time and i think but unfortunately you know you do have to decentralize uh over time and like there is a bit of a ticking time bomb there and so it sounds like that is the pen going forward is just like move up that part of the road map and you know decentralize uh the resolver for these different prediction markets um decentralize uh you know the actual liquidity provision et cetera uh but you're just a reminder that even if you take the strategy you know there are people uh watching especially if you go around you know advertising at brooklyn and stuff like that yeah poly market was always on the aggressive side especially seeing advertising campaigns in new york of all places where you know it's some of the most restrictive places to be building a decentralized product so i i do think that as you said tom it's a good reminder that obviously regulators are watching but it's also in some sense like there are some cases that are easier than others so the question of like okay what is uniswap is uniswap liable for this or that is it an unregistered exchange blah blah blah it's a really hard question to answer and i imagine the sec or even the cftc they're probably fairly averse to entering into that fight because it's going to be a really hard one to establish what exactly is the nature of d5 and how does it fall under a regulatory regime something like poly market was just a slam dunk right obviously these guys are running a you know kind of semi-centralized prediction market offering it to people in the u.s advertising in the u.s that's not kosher and so they got slapped on the wrist um the big story really in my mind is that like look the fine is so small you know it's it's it's a it's almost a reminder to people who are building in d5 they're like look obviously follow the law and build things that are um build things that are ultimately good for the world and kind of you know follow the the uh the guidelines that regulators have set out for you but um you know at the end of the day we're not trying to punish innovators we're trying to help them to you know you know sort of hue more closely to the regulatory frameworks as they currently exist but it's very clear that crypto's trying to build something new they're trying to create new kinds of things and so if you're building in a way that you're trying to move towards the right direction of saying look i'm i'm building for the right reasons i really want to make something truly decentralized but i'm not there yet there's probably going to be a lot more leniency for you then for somebody who says like look i'm just going gonna go you know pocket a bunch of ico money you're gonna have a very different outcome so uh it's it's a good sign that the cftc kind of approached it with that level of finesse and i hope that we're gonna see the same thing through the end of the cycle with other regulators as well so with that being said i think we're at the end of the we're still slightly past the end of the hour but we started a little bit late um so that's it for this week we'll be back again two weeks from now to chop it up again on the news of the day thanks everybody for listening and we'll see you see you all soon
