I got good news for crypto holders prices are up and as of this morning the whole Market is back to almost one trillion dollars which is prompting some people to ask if it's a bull market or a bear Market a distinction that was clearly created by someone who had never seen a bear full Market or sheet Market would be more accurate it coins at almost 21 000 relative to its all-time high of well no reason to kill a good mood what's behind the price rally well one reason might be that inflation is down like Larry Summers himself has said that the feds fight against inflation is almost over which does Mark the first time in history that Larry Summers said anything that made anybody happy part of it also could be the industry's recovery from the FTX debacle moving towards the rear view and it does seem like before long SPF is just going to be another 30 year old dude who lives with his mom not to say it's good news for everyone though many were speculating that Bitcoin would fall below 11 000 and they're now being punished for being short just like on dating apps question now is whether or not prices will continue to rise to be fair that's always the question I had the answer I would be rich
