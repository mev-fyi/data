provides the security and compliance tools to leverage blockchain technology and enter new markets with confidence visit us at token soft dot IO or on Twitter at token soft egg my guests today are Eric Larsen beque co founder and CEO of leisure & Demetrios Calcutta's global head of ledger vault welcome Eric and Demetrios hi hi thank you Eric tell me how you got into Bitcoin and came to start ledger yeah of course so I have been an entrepreneur most of my life and in 2013 I sold my last startup which was the price comparison engine and I was looking for the next thing to do I just had my third trial so at the time I had a lot of a free time to browse the Internet and I was reading everything I call about startup new technology and I stumbled upon it and I really wanted to understand what was this magic internet money and so I spent basically two weeks reading everything I could about Bitcoin the blockchain technology mining and I was struck by lightning for me what the the technology of the blockchain and Bitcoin was really extremely interesting it was a true revolution and I was sure that I had to do something in the field so beginning of 2014 I opened a Bitcoin Center in Paris because initially I did not know what to do exactly you know so like my names like exchange languages or that so I say okay let's have a very broad horizontal approach and so the first idea was to to open a physical Center name masonry bit covering the house of Bitcoin in the center of Paris where I spend my time explaining about Bitcoin and about mining about blockchain and so I have talked about Bitcoin to to hundreds of people how did you come to launch ledger also you've mentioned to me before that for a long time people told you that users didn't want hardware devices so how did you grow the company so thanks to lemons only bitcoins orbit concentr we had the opportunity to meet a lot of developers and and other startups and there was one guy one company coming from the smart card industry who developed first prototype of the hardware wallets so using the smart card technology the chip-and-pin technology to secure private keys and another company was sending Bitcoin through postal services and they needed a media to send the private keys so basically what happened is that we started to work together to build the first real usable usable Hardware wallet it was end of 2014 and this is how we went to create ledger and at the big for the first two years where we had our first version of the nature and nano which didn't had to scream it was really bare-bones it was quite a tough sell because as you said no one really wanted to have a hardware device because it was it's the cloud as you are supposed to be completely free of everything and have everything in the cloud and when you think about Bitcoin and private Keys you really need to have a security or local security and so it means you need to have a hardware wallet and at the beginning it was not something that user were ready to accept and everywhere everybody told us that basically nature couldn't scale it wouldn't be anything about about adoption about massive adoption because of the fact that you need a hardware wallet but when we introduced a legend an OS which had better usability multiple currencies and also when we had the big boom of of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies where basically there was a lot of realization that the security of private Keys was paramount and there was a lot of world what of mouse for nature and if in 2017 basically we were hoping to sell maybe thirty thousand units of the Nano s and we ended selling 1 million units so it has been a massive success quite impressive if we were the first surprise because we had to scale the company like crazy and and now I think for for most of the users the people really know about blockchain and cryptocurrencies having a hardware well that is something completely normal so I think that now having a piece of hardware is something that is accepted and is not regarded at completely alien as it was maybe a few years ago so in the last three years have been a lot of evolution regarding the security and how people are perceiving the use of cryptocurrencies and Demetrios what was your background prior to start to joining ledger my background has been primarily within the financial services exchange space I spent considerable time at both US exchanges working and running software businesses and managing P&L for them over the past years and so how did you come to join ledger I was doing some consulting in the space around Bitcoin similar to Eric I was exiting from one of the exchanges and spent a little bit of time doing some research myself and had some key influencers suggest that I really look at this space pretty strongly and I did and felt that my skill sets from the financial services arena an exchange space and running software SAS businesses and managing piell's that I could provide my skill sets in leading and growing a business and just happened to come across the opportunity a ledger and it it came to fruition which is fantastic let's do an overview of Ledger's products and services let's start with the consumer products can you describe those for me yes of course so the basic technology the core technology of ledger is an operating system for a secure chip so it's very horizontal and with that you can do a lot of things but the first application the first product that we put on the market was hardware wallets so the idea is to keep the private keys in installation to make sure that they can never be exposed to the Internet so that's the basic idea of a hardware wallets and if the private keys stay secure they let's say offline or cold then you are sure that it cannot get hacked and hardware wallets are basically used by end users consumers and that's the first let's say approach the first product approach of of ledger as we were just saying it has been a massive success in 2017 but what we are seen also is that a lot of professionals have been hardware wallets we have some customers who have bought hundreds of the Nano s and they are using it to keep the ferns of their customers on each different devices and they have like rien physical volts where they keep the Nano s so not only we have seen that these hardware wallets are really having success on the consumer electronic markets but also on the enterprise but the hardware wallet is really for individuals I mean it's like one device one person and by discussing with our customers we have seen a real need from the institution's from enterprises basically to keep crypto safe crypto funds secure but they were lacking something very specific which is governance and this is what put us on the on the path to build an enterprise solutions to really bring what we call governance or rules or multi signature into action to build what we call today the ledger vault and which is really a product dedicated for enterprises and professionals who want to keep funds secure within the use of rules having teams managing different accounts etc and so that has been the second let's say party second offering of a Fletcher so the first one is hardware wallets for accounts for individuals we have the nos and we also have the nano X that we have announced recently and the vault believe for enterprises and professionals and we are also providing solutions for what we call IOT Internet of Things where our technology can secure communications usage or even transactions because we see more and more applications of the blockchain technology in real-life environments through the need of tokenization where basically you need to attach physical assets to a token and just to keep to give a concrete example you have energy where you need to attach certificates of origin of renewable energy to tokens so you can trade the tokens and our technology can really ensure that the issuance of tokens are really backed by the energy which is put into the grid so basically today we have these three offerings consumer electronics with Hardware wallet enterprises with the letter O font and all the offering for back-office and finally everything related to IOT and connected objects super interesting for the first bucket when you were talking about how you had built this device that was mainly for consumers but that different firms were using them to hold the funds of their customers what are some examples would that be like a crypto fund that is using pleasure to hold its investments yeah absolutely there are a few crypto funds that have the needs to keep the fans of their customers secure and basically they use segregation of the ferns by having has many hardware wallets as they have accounts or customers so from a physical point of view it's really a vault which is full of nano s so it's a it's a first good step to put to bring solution to the problem of security in custodianship but obviously it's it's not enough because you want to have a real process of how you handle the funds and here you still have the risk that someone is going to open the vault take the physical device take the pin code and run with it so that's why we needed to have let's say a more complex solution involving all yeah I've had one of the crypto funds on my show talking about how they do use I actually don't know which hardware device it is but how they do use that to hold their customer funds it sorry Paul by the way of lock tower and he was saying that they then wrap it in a chute it's something like tamper-evident plastic and then they will put glitter nail polish on it and take a photo of it because it's very difficult to replicate the pattern so anyway it was it was pretty an elaborate setup I guess in order to protect their funds but you know as you were describing for your institutional offering now that is one where instead of needing this kind of like physical protection it's governed by rules so what what do you mean by that like how does that work exactly so we created we sought to create you know a multi authorization governance solution to eliminate the single points of failure and make sure that we're still securing the endpoints so we came out with for governance levels for the enterprise vault solution you have the shared owners which are three people that create one third of the master seed and then our software once those each individuals create their own one third of the seed we combine that into the master the master seed we also have three other individuals that create a third of the wrapping key custodian which is really encrypting the environment within the ledger vault infrastructure so further securing that no one has access to the private keys that are sitting within our are on the vote then we have administrators and operators the administrators are the folks within the forum that's set up each individual wallet so though the vault can have multiple wallets and each wallet can have its own governance protocols so you could have what we'd like to say the vault is very temperature agnostic so if you want to design a particular Woollett that needs to be extremely that replicates something that's very cold you can have eight of 8mm event approvers you could also have a time limiter on there for further folks to evaluate that particular order and approve or you can have the vault have two or three M event approvers to have something that's much more warm and a hot wallet and then the operators are the fourth component of governance which are the ones that are submitting the the the orders to place within within the infrastructure so you've got that four layers of governance protocols within the ledger vault infrastructure so you're securing the endpoints and you're providing multiple approvers in order for transaction to be completed Wow okay and do you approve this set up that each company just because what if they do it in such a way like I think you may recall with the BitFenix hack that Vicco was involved in some way but but Bickel later said that it was the way BitFenix had implemented their setup I think that was the issue so what we're doing is we're ledger vault is doing something a little bit different we're providing the technology infrastructure for firms to completely manage and control a hundred percent of their cryptocurrencies the firm's that we are providing this infrastructure for are the ones that are setting up their governance principles and policies and procedures for each wallet and each security so they manage a hundred percent of their private keys ledger has nothing to do with that particular process or approval process at all we're not a custodian we're providing the technology infrastructure for them to self manage their assets or provide a custodial services to their customers in the marketplace okay so essentially if there is some sort of breach or something it's entirely on them because then it indicates that there was some I guess laps in the way that they set up their procedure is that it in essence yes yeah we're not providing them the infrastructure to manage their entire assets we have no view into managing their private keys what we provide is really with the security of the private keys we make sure that the governance cannot be broken but it is true that if the set rules that they do not follow or if they give away the hardware wallets to access the the funds to anyone or if they do like obvious procedural mistakes it serves that it defeats the purpose however when we talk to our customers we can give them and we discuss about best practice and and when they set up the vault it's quite a complex solution the of course make sure to have a governance that cannot be easily breached so I also want to ask you about another one of your offerings which is the ledger operating system the bol OS the blockchain openledger operating system what is that and why did you make it possible to use that with any hardware not just letter so balance is an operating system which has been designed to run on secure hardware so if you have Android for smartphone or is so Bulow's is basically the same thing but for embedded secure devices and operating system usually are designed to run on different kind of hardware so we have the hardware wallets that we built obviously like to an an OS guru they know X about you we also provide solutions for secure Enclave in smartphones so basically in some smartphones such as Samsung phones for instance you have what we call secure Enclave which is secure hardware inside the phone so you can basically run a hardware wallet or anything else on top of our operating system which is not Android so even if Android is brave then the hardware wallet stays safe and the private keys cannot be exposed we do the same on hardware security modules which basically are ultra secure computers that run inside of the computer so it's little bit like computer inception and we build a little vault on top of that we also have a version of operating system for Intel aesthetics so we really want to make sure that any platform insecure platform can run 6 your hardware wallet or set your applications and why we design our protein system to be open is because our vision is ready to provide the ecosystem with a global global open platform that can basically be used to have Hardware wallet everywhere we were talking about the importance of having a hardware device it may be a solution acceptable for the first maybe 100 millions of people or tens of millions of people are interested in to cryptocurrencies but if we want to go to real mass adoption to billions of people then of course it's not really possible to have specific hardware that we have to give to to anyone so we have to make sure that smartphones can run hardware wallets securely we have to make sure that PCs can run hardware wallet securely and our objective is really to have Bulow's deployed in all this kind of platforms and that we can have in three years in five years it's hard to see exactly when but to have the possibility to have secure hardware wallets on any kind of consumer electronic computer device so that's really the vision so alright there's like a whole new wave of smartphones that have secured unclips inside to store crypto do you think that those are our three two Ledger's business model no no that's all there are more like an extension so we have launched the first Hardware wallet running on Samsung phones on secure Enclave in 2016 so almost three years ago and so we have the technology for for a while and we believe that in the future when the secure Enclave will be ready because right now there is a lot of fragmentation it is quite complex to use it constant consistently on different kind of platform or smartphones but when it will be ready and I think it can be in three years then we will have the opportunity to deploy our hardware wallet technology to deploy our technology directly on the phones so in three years I believe that we will continue of course to sell hardware wallets because it will still be needed but we will have a new market where we can address billions of smartphones and deploy our technology through some kind of licensing deals so it's more like big opportunities that lettre have in the future and I also want to zoom back out you know we've been talking about storing your crypto on a hardware device but obviously there are so many other ways that somebody could store their crypto they could have it on you know a company like coin base or or you know write on an exchange where they might be trading or obviously there's the other end of the spectrum you could even create a paper wallet so what can you just describe for me sort of all the different ways and then amongst all those like why it is that somebody should choose either ledger or any Hardware wallet as their preferred method like you know who who is that the right choice for well there is a saying in Bitcoin which is in crypto like not your keys not your bitcoins so the first question that you have to ask yourself is do you wish to all your crypto or do you want you to give it to a third party and really do not care about it so it's a little bit the same approach that when you want to buy gold physical gold are you really to buy physical gold and keep it yourself in your safe at home or in the bank or are you going to buy paper gold are you interested in to really owning the product the asset or do you want just to speculate so that's the first philosophical approach and I think that a lot of the crypto enthusiasts are interested into crypto because they can really own it and so if you are in crypto because you really want to own these alternative assets then it's not to have them on an exchange I mean you can do some speculation to buy to sell on exchange but for long-term storage it's not recommended because you are putting all the security of the ownership in the hands of the third party and basically it's limited to the capacity that you have to protect your password of your email and also if you have a second factor of authentication to make sure that your phone is not hacked we have seen countless or horror stories and also the exchange can also decide to phrase your account to to not allow you to to to take your bitcoins or cryptos with you beginning of January they have been proof of keys movements where basically everyone was invited to put out their crypto into their own wallets to make sure that the exchanges are not running on fractional reserves because as well there are no third party audits so are you sure that when you give your crypto to a third parties that they are really only need sub they are not lending it to a third party etc so I mean either you do not care about ownership and then maybe it's fine to give a third party but one thing is for sure in that if you decide to own yourself your crypto then using a hardware wallet whatever it is is really the best solution why because obviously your software wallets on a computer or a smartphone it's just a question of time before you lose everything it's like buying physical gold and keep it on your chimney I mean it works but it doesn't scale and if you can use paper wallet it's more like for experts and also a paper wallet because you can make mistakes you want to make sure that when you print the paper wallets your computer your printer is not connected that you do not have the information cache etc and at some point if you want to use your crypto if you want to spend your paper while that you have to scan it and put it online and then you are back to square one and I think that's of course you can also buy your computer install Linux remove all the connections and really basically build the hardware wallet yourself but such works only if you know exactly what you are doing because cybersecurity is not an easy task so that's why hardware wallets are very convenient and our today recognized as the best solution for keeping keeping you assets yeah except I mean I think that it's like the other methods there is some sort of security procedure that you must undertake on your own and take responsibility for keeping your wallet your hardware wallet safe and your C safe because you know I I personally can think of a lot of place where if I'm keeping this at home on my own that I could mess up as well so I think like there's a lot of Education that needs to happen in order for customers of hardware wallets to to make sure that they as well I completely agree I think education is one of the big challenge for ledger and other let's say crypto companies because you are completely right being your own bank is not easy I mean if you have a lot you have a lot of responsibilities and you need to make sure that you have to keep safe shore and you'll see your recovery phrase etc so it is sure that it's only if you want to take the time to understand what you do if only if you want to take the time to understand what are the right steps because you can make mistakes and it's true as of today that mass adoption is maybe not for tomorrow regarding that because it's not effortless you have to stop think of your minutes about what you are doing because if you make a mistake no one is going to give you back your crypto so ensure that education is really really important for the time to come yeah so I'm gonna ask you a few quick questions before we turn to our ad break but the first one is how many crypto assets do you support so we support about 1,100 crypto assets okay and how do you decide which I mean it sounds like it's a very low bar how do you decide which ones to support so we do support basically we have third party developers we can build the support so it's not later with developing everything we have an open platform and so this developers can support the the coins themselves so it's true that it's quite open and easy as long as the developers do the right job of putting the support for the coins and later is going to publish it it's little bit like an app store so that's the beauty of an open ecosystem is that you can have a lot of developers working to add support for four cryptos and who are your customers and let's do the full range in terms of the everyday consumer and then if you can name any of the institutions that have started to use your and prized offerings that would be great the customers for the vault are pretty much asset managers hedge funds crypto funds family offices and and everything in between also exchanges are our possible customers for us as well we have a few exchanges using the ledger vault in our in testing out our enterprise capabilities also a lot of the folks that are supplying the trading technologies and infrastructures to the exchanges are also logical opportunities for us as well as the folks at providing you know data center infrastructure and services and cloud based services into into the marketplace could be also other opportunities for the enterprise ledger vault to provide a full range of customer support for the for the FinTech community and also folks that are managing assets and crypto assets so and obviously the banks and the trust companies that are specifically focused on crypto or the traditional ones that are contemplating and hearing from their customers that they want them to support crypto moving forward we're providing that infrastructure to them in essence where the digital plumbing for them to provide this capability in this service to their customer base an Eric for the everyday consumers like what demographic do they fit so it's a good question because by design we do not want to know who are our customers we do not ask them anything about what they do why is it aura however we do have some guesstimates regarding the type so we have once an estimation of one third of our customers who are really traders because they are they want you to use the device all the time and then they have a lot of different crypto so they are like traders or people who really like to jungle different between different cryptos and we more than half that are what we could call hot lers I mean to just buy the device they put the crypto on it and then they are not going to use it for months or maybe for four years and then the rest is a kind of mixed up to after usage and our customers are really distributed globally we are selling in 165 countries and basically it's one third Americas one third Europe and one third Asia we're gonna discuss more about ledger security and how it's scaled but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors issuing a digital security on the blockchain can be a significant undertaking particularly to

slash unchained or follow them on twitter at MSFT blockchain back to my conversation with ledger so how many units have you sold overall so since the beginning of later in 2014 we have sold about 1.5 million units and you mentioned how 2017 was a crazy year that you projected you would sell 30,000 and sold a million instead describe what happened at ledger during that time and how you managed to scale so quickly well in one word cows when we I mean we we always knew and we always believed that one day crypto were going to scale and that we it would be like nice times but the speed at which crypto has been growing at the speed at which the demand of our for our devices has been growing has been completely crazy and we were doing all the assembly of were devices in the France and we had to scale a production in China in a matter of weeks so it has been a lot of work for the operation and production guys and also we had to build from like real customer support solution we were like one in half to do the customer support now we are more than ten we had to build a legal department because we had to export in all the countries it happened a lot of questions a lot of works and so basically what we had to do is to hire a lot of people we were 20 before the trace of the crypto began and now we are about to hundreds in five locations globally so the company has really had to grow we also have raised a lot of capital closed Series B round last year in January 2007 18 of 61 million years 75 million dollars so it helped us give HUD all the visibility to really scale the company because not only we had to scale on the consumer electronics and scale the infrastructure and the production and everything but also we had to build new SAS product with the vault and also to answer all the demand and the growth that we are having on the IOT so it has become very and it still is a very busy day every day at nature yeah and I was curious because the markets are down this year so or nowhere in 2019 but obviously there was the downturn that started in 2018 how have sales changed from 2017 to 2018 so for sure there was an impact we are roughly if last year we have sold 1 million device this year we have sold half a million device and we have sold a lot of these devices in the first quarter of 2009 t because when the when the price is going down the interest in crypto is going down and also the media coverage is going down and so generally speaking the traffic is going down and so we sell less so there is a lot of impact of the Bitcoin price and crypto price to our listen to to to our sales but what is funny is also when we have a major crash like we had in basically in November there was a lot of mention in the media of Bitcoin Bitcoin is dead and etcetera etcetera and and we had more traffic and it generated also more sales a good indicator of the health of the of the market is the Black Friday and the Black Friday of 2018 was very good compared to 17 so it showed that despite the fact that we we have seen a lot of let's say the price has been plunging and there was a lot of bad titles in the press regarding cryptocurrencies the general interest and the dynamism of the market has been still still good so let's now talk about security last spring Salim Rashid a hacker from the UK who said he was 15 which is pretty amazing he published a blog post showing how he was able to hack Ledger's in a few different ways and from what I understand the crux of the issue seems to be that you have the secure element but then I think that I doesn't really communicate outside so then you have this other thing called the microcontroller which is what enables the user to communicate with a secure element and get information from it and from what I understand it looks like maybe that is the part of the ledger that can be subject to attack whether through the supply chain Amenia the device can be compromised before the customer even even receives it or through a so-called evil made attack in which someone could temporarily gain access to the bite to the device such as a maid in a hotel room and compromise it in that time period or through malware that's put on the victims computer do you plan on changing the architecture of your devices to address this issue why or why not so so you are correct we had sell him it's really fifteen years old and he discovered a vulnerability in turn an OS which indeed a low to change the non-sexual micro controller firmware and to do some kind of man-in-the-middle attack of the device and open the way for a supply chain attack so thanks to the discovering of Salim we have been we have patched the thread and corrected the issue but security is always a game of cat and mouse and that's why we have a bounty program with responsibility disclosure solutions and we have all the time let's say security researchers who are publishing and serving with those findings and so we are always trying to to have hands meant of the security what we have done regarding the architecture is to go to the to the next level and this is what we are done with the nano X that we have recently announced the nano X has it's a secured chip which is a much more powerful secured ship and with more let's say capacity to connect to the two screens and buttons and so in this new architecture the secure element is driving directly the buttons and the display and so all this kind of attack is now impossible because we have changed architecture so to answer your question yes we have hands and evolved our architecture and now we have a solution which is let's say at a higher level of security and this kind of attack threat under nano X won't be possible in zoom but you still sell there then you know s yeah but the nano ace has been patched it's all the threats that has been depicted to us by Salim has been corrected and as of today there is no known attack that can change the unsecured microcontroller but of course in the future security researcher could always discover something because nothing is an e cable but as of today we do not know any let's say threats on the other than us and our own security team we have 10 people at ledger every day on attacking our solutions making sure that such threats are not existing so we stand behind the 9 OS and there is as of today there is no known attack vector to do subtraction attacks it is right because we have patch it through thanks to new him where updates that anyway when we have decided to work on the new device we have upped the security architecture to add something that provide with let's say better architecture a better security architecture so even though the Nano is still a dual chip architecture we stand we stand behind it and we are going to continue to sell the nano ass and continue to support the noise and there was also a different conference recently the 35c 3 conference where some researchers presented the different ways they attacked some Ledger's and treasures and again they were sort of like supply chain but another one was even taking control remotely of the ledger to perform a transaction do you find those issues that they raised to be credible threats for consumers who owned the nano s so they are more like Tom Cruise impossible mission threats so they are quite fun and interesting but what they are doing basically is opening to an NOS installing some kind of remote device on it and then observing observing you with a camera or something when you want to let's improve the traditions since they have put a malware on your computer that going to send a wrong transaction and then they are going to manually press a button on the side which is going to press a pattern on the 9 OS and activate the transaction so we believe that it's not really a credible solution because most probably it's much easier to put a camera to see you put the pin code and then steal the device I mean a second side it's easier to do that and the author attacks that is shown on the letter blue is basically to record all the electromagnetic signals that you have when you press your pin code on the device and then to be able to extract the pin code from this emanation of electromagnetic sino and again even though it's quite fun and we like this kind of attack which are concise sudden attacks it's not really practical because if you move the device let's say by one inch or a quarter of an inch then it will change everything so it's not something that you can really exploit in the wild but still we appreciate to have this kind of attacks and to more security researchers are going to to get some interest into hardware wallet and crypto security in general the best it will be because we will always have to say to come with even better solutions and as for the Nano x weight if you enable bluetooth connections on that does that introduce any other vulnerabilities no not at all so the private keys are never going out of the secure chip so they are never on transmission it's exactly the same than USB cable and worse what can happen is if you break the Bluetooth encryption because it's a with end to end quite strong encryption but let's say that if you manage to break the encryption then the worst is a privacy it means that you can see the transaction that you want to cite like the amount and destination address these kind of things so from the security of the private key it doesn't change at all the model and having a Bluetooth doesn't expose the user to more or less security threat and then I also wanted to ask about the ledger blue because some of the attacks that these hackers performed were on the ledger blue which is the device being used in the ledger vault so what does that do any of those attacks have any implication for the security of ledger vault from the vaults perspective it is configured differently than the retail as your blue device it's configured for the enterprise use it's only for the authorization and putting your pin code in to authorize a transaction so and authorize the user itself and also the user has to have have a digital certificate on their laptop that will authenticate that blue device and authenticate that user to communicate to the hsm to initiate a transaction so there's no keys stored on the ledger blue device in the enterprise model it's just for authentication of a transaction and again depending upon the use case and depending upon the users and the wallets there's multiple approvers that would need to authenticate that person's initiation of a transaction and nevertheless what we plan to do as an easy fix to that even though the the threat is not really practical and easy fix is just to scramble the pin code so instead of having one two three four to try each time that you press pin then it's going to scramble the position of the numbers and then it will render completely inoperative the the side channel attack and then the other thing I was curious about and I think this is an issue for even like an online wallet like blockchain or something how do you protect against rogue employees installing something in the hardware or in the operating system that could compromise customers coins so first you cannot compromise the operating system because it's on the six your chip but let's say that you could compromise as you said before is the supply chain attack of Salim and unsecured boy if you want to enter to put inside some kind of remote device then if you think that you can get subject to this kind of attack then you have to be maybe a little bit more paranoid because first probably what exactly is going to happen is that someone is going to observe your pin code because they work with you and at some point maybe they will steal the device and and so it's a question of process and that's why when you have a lot of funds it's been especially if you are in a company especially if you are professional environment you have co-workers and then that while you should use the natural world because with the Latrobe world such attack is not possible because there is a governance and it's not about compromising one person at what time sorry but I'm asking about Ledger's employees like if I'm just a consumer ordering then yeah how do I know that there isn't some ledger employee who's compromised it in some way yes yes of course sorry so internally we have processes basically if you if you want if we want to sign a new firmware and to flash the device with a new firmware version it has to design using a protocol using governance basically we are using ourself jamort not to keep cryptocurrencies but to authorize the signature of a new firmware of a new application and thought there is a god review and it has to be signed by a quorum of different key people at nature so of course you could say but what if everyone Pledger wants to release it's a few more with a backdoor which is a fair question then the answer is that we believe there is more value at later being a global leader in hardware wallet and cryptocurrencies rather than trying to get a few millions of tens of billions or even hundreds of millions by stealing them by using a few more a back door so we have this internal processes and after it's a question of reputation and thinking that we have much more to lose by stealing our customers rather than building a multi-billion dollar company in the future and you've you have a pretty interesting way of shipping out the devices which is to not put tamper proof packaging on the devices claiming that the hardware itself has tamper proof do you plan to continue not not doing that yes of course what I need to have seen the CCC wallet dot fail presentation it started to say they started to sell that temper proof stickers are irrevelant now what we call security theater and so what we use is a cryptographic attestation of the genuineness of the VMware and we believe it's a superior solution compared to using stickers so for sure the nano X doesn't have any anti tampering sticker because it's a security theater and there have been these instances of people being held at gunpoint or kidnapped and forced to send their coins to their assailants addresses I saw in a blog post that you wrote that you said that ledger uses a distributed governance or multi signature process to make that infeasible so how does that work so that's something that has been put into the vault this is go like delayed opening not for consumers that's not for consumers however we plan to introduce such solutions in the future using external Oracle's well you can have accounts that are going to sign only if the external Oracle is going to say yes but of course it means that you still have to make sure that you 24 words the backup is not accessible because if anyone at gunpoint access your 24 words then it came over that's why being your own bank has a lot of responsibilities yeah and I also wanted to ask you about this ledger dungeon team I don't know if I'm seeing that right yeah who are they and what do they do so the dungeon the dungeon team is the security team of fletcher there are like 10 professionals who are coming from various security practice doing security evaluation so they have a lot of tools like lasers like your scope like a lot of bands and tests and the mission is to evaluate the security of our products by attacking them violently on the hardware on the software at any levels and also doing the security evaluation of of the competition because we have to make sure that we stay ahead so the dungeon is is really the guys that later make sure that everything that we do is secure all right so I actually also want to ask about this new trend that will probably see emerging over the next a couple years which is a shift from proof of work to proof of stake or delegated proof of stake so how would staking work if I have my coins on a ledger or in the ledger vault so if you have the coins and on the hardware wallets you will have the possibility to stake your coins so we are working with a few crypto such as Tasers to start implementing the baking order this taking and we want to make sure to have the same functionalities as well into the vault because for sure that's a big feature that is requested by let's say custodians or hedge funds who have a lot of assets and electro is going to deliver this year in the ledger life the first solutions to do the delegated proof of stake we believe it's a is part of the future of crypto and we want to make sure that we will provide with the best interface to be able to do that when the vault provides you know the companies the opportunity because again you have instant access to your funds based upon the governance principles that each firm sets up for the wallet so it provides a great entry point for this next development of proof of staking with our technology and something else that I was curious about was for decentralized exchange if I have my coins on a ledger then the way that that would work is I would need to connect it to my computer whenever I wanted to do a trade is that hell yeah users versus yes that's correct and you will be able to verify on the later device on the screen on the secure screen what trade you you do so that's correct you can use basically when you are using the decentralized exchange you are taking all the responsibilities of the security and that's why hardware wallet compatibility is really critical and letterer has been as put some supports already for it some decentralized exchanges and we want to continue to do so and also do some deep integrations in the ledger line which is that the wallet interface used by our devices so I want to leave the listeners with a piece with some advice from you because I know that you guys must be experts on security and protecting your encrypted that's so what advice would you give to listeners on how to make sure that they don't lose their coins well I think one of the biggest advice is to take time and try to understand what you do later is bringing a lot of documentation of blog post about best practice about what you should do what you should not do and when you buy something new like any device or anything you always want to open and start to use it immediately you know you take the documentation you talked with it and you you just wanted to go with it and in crypto you have to be very careful so my my big advice would be take your time read the documentation understand what you are doing and if you are following the best practice then there is very little chance that you will do a mistake do not panic just take your time read understand and move forward so I think that's the the biggest advice I could give to to anyone well one another question that I have is you know when you record your seed phrase I can think of different places where I might hide it good but I can't think of a place where I might hide it and then like not forget that I put it there so how do you recommend people figure that part out you know what I mean or like where it wouldn't get lost or where it wouldn't be seen by somebody else so it's a very interesting question which has a lot of ramifications because maybe the next question is how do you make sure that if you have an accident or if you die it's transmitted to your next of kin but I would say that the best probably the most secure approach is to rent a safe physical safe at your bank and to put it there because one you are not going to forget that it there because you have physical safe too if you are going to have let's say an assault a physical assault at home at gunpoint or anything it would be much more difficult to go into the bank safe and three I mean if you dies or if you are hit by a bus logically the access to the bank safe will go to your next of kin and if you give all the documentation inside to explain what to do with the twenty four words it can also solve how you can transmit your quick tool to to your loved ones okay and I suppose you should seal that because otherwise what if a bank employee goes in there and is like cannot access the safe you know usually you need two keys so yeah you have to take a reputable bank and make sure that it's not possible to append a safe without you which normally should be the case okay okay all right well this has been an incredibly fascinating discussion where can people learn more about you and letter
