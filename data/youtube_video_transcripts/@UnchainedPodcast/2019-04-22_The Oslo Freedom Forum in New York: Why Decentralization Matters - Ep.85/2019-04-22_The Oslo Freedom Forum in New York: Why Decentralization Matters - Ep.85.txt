[Music] hi everyone welcome to Unchained I'm your host Laura this is a special episode of Unchained from the Oslo Freedom Forum in New York there I spoke with Alejandro Machado a researcher at sea cash amber Baldy founder and CEO of clover a decentralized software and developer tools company andy Bromberg co-founder and president at point list a compliant token offering platform and mega rajagopal a correspondent for BuzzFeed and former China bureau chief the topic of our panel was why decentralisation matters in this discussion we cover what is happening in authoritarian regimes like China and Venezuela that highlight the importance of decentralized technologies how people in those countries are using crypto assets and how people in authority and regimes can even get access to these technologies plus we also look at how bad state actors are using the same technology to oppress people or evade sanctions it's a fantastic discussion what some looks at the on-the-ground usage of decentralized technologies enjoy start engine is a regulated ico platform with a community of a hundred and fifty five thousand plus registered users that's focused on issuing tokenized securities

Unchained and unconfirmed hi everyone welcome to today's working lunch here at the Oslo Freedom Forum in New York apparently this monitor in front of me says that the topic is actually wide to criminalization matters but just just want to let you know there's been no change to the to the program it's why decentralisation matters my name is Lauren and I'm a journalist covering the crypto space and I host two podcasts in crypto called Unchained and unconfirmed and I've been covering this space for about three and a half years now and often times when people find out that I cover crypto they say things to me like oh it's only good for speculation and they don't see the use of it blah blah blah and I find myself having to explain that of course you know here in the US and other kind of more developed countries we have really well-functioning money we have good financial services and so for us we have money we can trust and services we can trust and so of course you know if you live in a society like ours it sort of does feel like what is the use of this but in today's discussion we'll be diving into how more authoritarian societies actually highlight the need for technologies like this for technologies that governments cannot shut down or censor or otherwise control I'm here to discuss this topic our Hollande ro Machado who is a researcher at ZK she's on the Whammy and there and next Alejandro is amber Baldy who's the co-founder and CEO of clover which is a decentralized software and developers tool developer tools company Andy Bromberg is next to Amber and he is the co-founder and president of coin list which is a compliant token offering platform and next to me here is mint mega rajagopal incur correspondent for BuzzFeed and the former China bureau chief so I figured the way we would structured the discussion is kind of like some of the on-the-ground details of what's going on in some of these more repressive regimes so why don't all honza why don't you start with kind of like what's been going on in Venezuela and how those trends there highlight the need for decentralized and censorship resistant technologies yeah so can you all hear me hi my name's Alejandro I'm born and raised in Venezuela I lived there until 2015 I am now traveling and I well I started computer science and then I did a probe design I have design background as well I stumbled upon crypto last year and I realized the potential that it has in society is like like my own and I've never really liked ever since I left and I said I left because it's very difficult to do work there the internet speeds are really slow and I mean there's no community there's like there's very little to do if you just work there and then focus there especially if you are working towards freedom or towards living in a society that resembles more like yeah like a free-market state so I think that one of the big problems that we have today in Venezuela is alter terrorism and censorship we have a lot of newspapers that have been closed if you tweet there's a law that you'd like you can go to jail for tweeting against the President or you know any anyone in government they apply this very selectively but it happens and it's just like that way to scare people into like submission and besides that there is horrible economic mismanagement which I think we're going to talk more about and the centralization matters in Venezuela because of censorship because like like control of information but I think even more so for control of money the government of Venezuela has debase the currency incredibly and we are now experiencing hyperinflation that has been going on since December of last year so we have like a couple million percent inflation this like for for a year like from from last year to this year it's just unimaginable in the United States I think three four percent inflation is like already too much we have in the order of millions of percent I actually just to jump in here I copied some stats from this article that came out on PC Mag if anyone is interested in learning more about this but they were saying that Bloomberg apparently has this Cafe con Leche Index and it tracks the fluctuating price of a cup of coffee at a bakery in in the capital Caracas and in August 2016 a coffee cost 450 bolivars and this past July a cup of coffee cost one point four million bolivars so yeah it's insane so the problem with this is the government has no idea how to have a responsible monetary policy and so we are locked into a system where we depend on very bad bureaucrats and very bad people that don't know what they're doing and well maybe they know what they're doing and they they are they are fine with making us all poorer and you have no access to a currency like the US dollar or the euro or other like national currencies but you do have access to Bitcoin and you do have access to other open money systems and that is where the game changes and I think that states like ours they have not realized how much of like a disruption this could be and you know that like they became famous last year because they run the right I CEO of the petrol which was a complete disaster but I think that we what we would like to focus on more is the potential benefits of cryptocurrency for the average citizen for for accessing a money system that is open and that anyone can can opt into and can you actually dive into more detail on how everyday people in Venezuela are trying to use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and then on the flip side give a little bit more details on what happened with the petrol I see oh sure thing so I have a few friends I'm you know as I said I grew up there so I have many friends who were still there and for example there's this friend who's a doctor's medical doctors as a postgraduate and everything he earns about ten dollars a month being a doctor at you know performing you know like arguably the best service that you could do for society ten dollars a month and that's obviously not enough to to eat and to have like a normal life so he stumble upon cryptocurrency mining about two years ago or so so he started mining theorem and that's how he makes a living like a more proper living he earns about one hundred and fifty dollars a month by mining theorem and he recently told me that he is so Venezuela is a very complicated place like infrastructurally it's also very violent and you know like this just complete chaos going on right now so they told me that is like the wires of it's like wire connection we're stolen because they they weren't like the dogs weren't to sell the copper in the black market because they it's just like something that is easy to steal and and resell so he's without internet but he's still mining through his 3G connection so he's it's 60% efficiency so he's not earning quite 150 he's torn but still quiet enough to sustain a living and then go into more details on that petrol I see oh yeah the petrol I see oh so Maduro like what were like various scamming people trying to do last year like it like a easy way to get money I think like the trendiest thing to do was to run an ICO right not to say that were not legitimate CEO there were absolutely absolutely fantastic projects that I think run very responsible i SEOs but I think was also like if you look at the space just the numbers they were rife with like very bad projects I just wanted to make a quick buck and exit so the government saw that and since they're con artists lay there like dealing narco traffic they deal in like you know lots of shady businesses kidnappings and like they make it a living with all of these like very like questionable activities for society they were also got into I cos and because they didn't so it is a quick way to make money and they tried to raise they say they wanted to raise like six billion dollars they have not specified how much they actually raised and I'm very skeptical of any claims that they make I think it was a complete disaster like technically like the website didn't work the the time that it was supposed to be launching I pretended to be a buyer and I uploaded like a blank image as my passport to kyc and they took it so you could imagine like the the level of sophistication in flight and like you know the way that they're been they've been running things I don't think that they actually were successful yeah and for people who don't know what an ICU is just in case it stands for initial point offering which is basically a way to crowd fund in cryptocurrency and you the product that you give to people is another cryptocurrency so I think like what's really really interesting about what's going on in Venezuela is that you seen kind of like both sides of you know the potential in this technology obviously there is a lot of positive that can come out of it that you know you can use it to circumvent maybe like what oppressive regimes are trying to do however then on the flip side of course you know they can use these technologies as well which is what you know has been going on as well I was just so interesting so let's find out more about what's going on the ground in China I think you know the focus there or or at least kind of the the things that the government is doing highlights but you know what other areas of technology we need to centralization for or censorship resistance for so what are some of the things you're seeing on the ground in China yeah I think one of the big things that I've written about in China over my six or seven years there is the kind of rising tide of government surveillance and that touches on a lot of different aspects of the way people communicate um you know including things like travel and spending money and stuff like that I guess one of the biggest kind of life shaping things that has changed in China over the past couple of years is the rise of a payment and EPA IPE Minh ter is just like very very widely accepted like everybody from you know homeless people on the street using QR codes to my like 95 year-old Shanghainese landlady is like accepting a payment in lieu of cash a lot of people think that cash in China's is just not going to be used you know in a couple of years people have looked at the culture around cash has changed so dramatically like to the point where people find cash to be like dirty and like kind of inconvenient like just don't even want to have it around anymore and if you think about that from a privacy standpoint it's actually really damaging so we taught is owned by 10 cent office Li one of the biggest Internet companies in the world 10 cent is obligated by law to hand over information about users to various authorities within the Chinese government when asked if you know for an Internet company here there's sort of a legal process for that there's a subpoena that has to be filed there's you there's a level of evidence there's a threshold that has to be met in China that's not necessarily the case so you can see this in practice in terms of these kind of algorithmic or big data policing programs that are being rolled out across the country this is particularly egregious in places like Tibet and Xinjiang which are home to ethnic minorities these are like big big regions in the country's West but it applies to really you know police departments all over the country and one of the things that these police departments are doing is using a predictive policing system called the police cloud which factors in lots of data from different areas of people's lives you know it includes things like medical records you know whether you're taking birth control your academic history or performance reviews at work but it also includes things like stuff that you pay for things like train tickets your stay at a hotel room as well as things like social media your online purchases all of that sort of stuff and a lot of the information is gleaned from tech companies right and there are documents in chinese state media and in official reports that state that even the police in addition to people like petty criminals and stuff like that they're specifically targeting dissidents and ethnic minorities so from that point point of view the kind of the aggregation of a lot of these kind of information into the hands of law enforcement and state security authorities can be really really problematic from a freedom of expression and privacy standpoint yeah I think I don't know if you know but here even in the u.s. like a first if a person goes missing or has been thought to commit a crime one of the first things that they do is look at what their recent financial transactions were and stuff so having kind of like all this taking place on these centralized systems that work with the Chinese government is actually hugely problematic in terms of privacy mm-hmm yeah and there were a few other things that you also mentioned like or well actually this one was a big one that's been in the media which is credit scoring in China but you said you didn't think it was such a big problem can you talk a little bit more about what's going on there it's not so much that I don't think it's such a big problem but like basically what Laura is talking about is something called the social credit system just gotten a lot of press basically social credit system is like this collection of government programs at the kind of all levels of government from like local governments to like provincial level and and so on that basically uses a system of like rewards and incentives as well as punishments to get people to engage in desirable behavior right so like you know there's stuff like like the most kind of benign example is jaywalking okay so we don't want jaywalking so we're gonna install a big camera at that intersection and just look literally shame you by showing footage of you jaywalking and um the kind of vision of some of these programs is that a lot of these kinds of behaviors like everything from like jaywalking and like turnstile jumping to the subway on the subway to like stuff like things that you say online is going to be kind of compiled and aggregated in some fashion and used in a way that assesses you and if you do well on some of these metrics you can get certain advantages things like getting discounts on air fares or making it easier for you to get a loan at a bank for instance to buy your house to punishments like being put on a blacklist where you can't buy you know luxurious train tickets and flights to certain places and and things like that so all these programs it's kind of confusing because they all work in different ways depending on where you're where you are there's also private versions of these programs by like at financial which is the financial services wing of Vallejo Poli Baba and a few other companies like that and right now it's really really unclear how these programs are gonna fit together at a national level but the reason that I brought that up with Lara is that I actually think the these are these programs like while they're really important from a privacy standpoint they're actually less troubling than some of the other programs that are used by law enforcement that specifically target people that are thought to be problematic for the state people like racial minorities dissidents and political opponents etc yeah and one other thing that I wanted to highlight here was just in the days leading up to this event we learned a little bit more about a new program that Google is working on called Google dragonfly which is the service I think that maybe they're looking to offer in China and just for me as somebody who remembers Google as having been founded on the you know not being evil I was a little bit surprised by what I was reading so Megha can you summarize what what they're thinking about doing yeah so to be clear Google has basically said almost nothing about this except that there this is like a very early stage program but um this was the story is broken by the intercept a few weeks ago and basically it's that Google is building kind of a censored version if it's search engine I think it's a censored app to UM use in China so the history of this is that Google was in China until about 2010 and then for a combination of factors one was that I think there were sort of suspicions of like a state-sponsored hacking attempt on them there were kind of like anti-competitive practices that were being used against Google and you know they had about a third only about a third of the search market at the time they made this decision to pull out of China and in interviews around that time Sergey Brin you know sort of alluded to his own personal history you know as as someone who spent some formative years in his childhood in the Soviet Union and how that kind of made him feel about his company being party to like one of the world's most sophisticated internet censorship systems and Google being Google they sort of drew a line in the sand and everybody since has had to live up to that standard right that they're not going to be complicit in this kind of authoritarianism but that is really the subject of a lot of controversy within Google I think especially considering that China as though as is the world's largest market for Internet users you know quickly growing an intensely powerful consumer class it's sort of let other people within the company to sort of question whether that's the right decision and you know in my opinion I do think that other tech companies are going to be looking at this and saying well if China is going to or cycle if goal is going to go along with Chinese government censorship then like what you know why are we staying out of this market so these are companies like Twitter Facebook etc who could probably get back into the Chinese market if they agreed to censor on the Chinese government terms but you know haven't been successful in doing that so far and then just to to get into dragonfly like what what are they going to be doing um dragon so dragonfly would be the censored search basically and I think they're tying it to like people's individual phone numbers and stuff so it is pretty yeah yeah I mean although like like you said this isn't officially from Google it's right very sensor they're also collaborating with the Chinese authorities like they're giving information to the Chinese authorities which could end up in deaths right correct so so one of the big problems with us is that basically by Chinese law they have to under this project they would have to serve or they would have to store user information on store servers in the PRC which essentially makes like information about Chinese users like it makes it possible for government authorities to collect that information on demand which is really really problematic if you think about like the surveillance are already carrying out on at ethnic minorities and dissidents so just to give you an idea like I've written a lot about this region called shinjang which is in the west of China and which has been in the news quite a lot recently basically people in Shin Jang like Muslim ethnic minorities there are being sent to re-education camps for like very very small things like things like having a photograph of a mosque right on your phone sending a text message to a relative that lives in Egypt or Turkey all of these things are like reason enough for you to be sent to re-education camp so if you think about that in the context of Google right if a police department in some town and Shin John says I want information on what this person is searching for and they search for something that has some some like a arabic pop song or a photo of the highest of fear like whatever that could be used as evidence against them to effectively incarcerate them for four months or more Wow so this has been like hugely hugely interesting especially for somebody who's always thinking about just blockchain and crypto and not kind of you know I guess more are these political issues but Andy and amber I'm sure all the things that they were saying have sparked some ideas in your mind and I'm just sort of curious as the two technologists here you know what it is that you see people are building in that world of decentralized projects that could address some of these actions being taken by these governments sure yeah I mean building tools to thwart authoritarianism isn't something that started with blockchain or crypto right I mean this is something that's been going back decades and if you trace back the evolution of Internet protocols as well there's a lot of geopolitics baked into how they're designed we take for granted that much of the the software that we use today was developed in the West and that it has been generalized conduit for things like Wikipedia around the world and soft power projection is something that all governments care about and that's something that we achieve by getting ideas beyond things like the Great Firewall so how you build software absolutely matters and it it's not just about well we're seeing this kind of odd dematerialization of speech and money and code where these used to be discrete different things and now they're kind of all conflated and it's causing a lot of really interesting challenges and problems so as you're speaking as Alejandra speaking about Venezuela it's interesting because as a government releasing the petrol I mean maybe they're naive and silly and trying to make a quick buck but they're also trying to circumvent global capital control systems and most other governments like if you look at well several other governments are looking at how to digitize their version their own sovereign currency but they want to do that in line with existing monetary policy they want to make sure that you can do quantitative easing they want to make sure that you don't disrupt interest rate controls but if your currency is failing then you want to create something that has a completely separate fluctuation as a hedge against that and you know China as well has proudly is backing neo as a separate project and you see master chained and in Russia as well there's there they're all over the place but what these different countries are doing so some of the things that that I am concerned about as we move forward I guess is how the very complex geopolitical cyber threat landscape is now evolving to embrace and simply see not decentralized technology necessarily but when you start looking at cryptocurrencies them is simply a new landscape to enact the exact same policies we really take or there's this illusion of choice that we have right now where it feels like you can choose you know Visa or MasterCard or Amex or what have you but really it's all the same banking system when you get these tech providers that then collude behind the scenes where you can't necessarily consent to opt out because there is no longer a way to get off the grid then the the software comes to kind of define the entirety of your life through these credit programs or otherwise yeah and I know Andy has some thoughts about like kind of different levels of censorship resistance or decentralization and I'm kind of curious to know about that because I'm also yeah well let's just start there yeah sure yeah just to tack on to what amber was saying there I think the the Venezuela and China examples are really interesting because they demonstrate that decentralization if we're gonna talk about how it can solve these problems can solve wildly different problems talking about Venezuela we were talking about currency issues and instability and not talking about things like censorship and surveillance and then talking about China we're talking about censorship and surveillance and not talking about issues with the currency those are totally separate categories of issues and what's so interesting about this technology this decentralized technologies that can solve both of them it's the analogy I think a lot of people use might be a little bit overused is that it's a lot like this internet revolution that happened where the internet itself doesn't do anything specific for end-users other than convey information but that can be used to build a news website it can be used to build a shopping website it could be used to build a search engine be used with a whole bunch of things and in the exact same way this decentralized technology can build a number of different applications on top of it that are used for wildly different purposes to solve wildly different problems so when we think about these they have different requirements if we're aiming to solve currency shoes it doesn't necessarily have to be a totally massively decentralized system that is resistant to intervention by massive governments what you need is the globalization aspect of it so these decentralized technologies can be built anywhere in the world and can be used anywhere in the world that has access to protocols to interact with them and that's all you need for that now the more decentralized it is you might argue it's better it's harder for governments to interfere but you you might just need what people often call kind of platform grade censorship resistance a censorship resistance and decentralization that just avoids single parties controlling it which is the issue with most centralized services today but controlled by a smaller set of people so then if we're talking about things like censorship resistance and surveillance we need these things to be massively perfectly decentralized so that even if a nation like China said we're gonna try and attack this and get into it and get access to it they wouldn't be able to those are very different technologies so you look at the rise of stable coins for example which is a class of crypto currencies that are intended to be pegged to some sort of stable value whether that's the US dollar or the CPI or some other sort of basket of goods that is really useful for a country with massive currency instability but that is still pegged to something real and semi centralized and that might be okay for that specific use case but then you look at something where you're trying to prevent China a nation with unimaginable resources both in terms of people and money and computing power everything you can imagine from accessing that Network you really can't rely on anyone or anything and so that's where this concept of kind of pure decentralization comes in where you need a massive network of people around the world driving this forward driving this network forward without relying on any specific party so that that just to draw on the difference that the Laura was alluding to is often called in in the crypto world and of platform grade censorship resistance and then sovereign grade censorship resistance and there are there are trade-offs neither is objectively better than the other but it depends on you know what you're looking for and what problem you're actually trying to solve one of the problems there for a lot of people is identifying which you need requires understanding what your threat model is and most humans do have never heard that phrase let alone had thoughts about it so these decisions are then made for them and they choose based on usability they choose based on where their friends are they choose based on which chat messenger has in line gifts rather than which one has end end encryption and people make poor choices not because they don't care but because they don't they don't know and they don't understand what they're they're necessarily giving up yeah that's a I'm interested in raising capital through a

this ad spot could be yours got a great product or service for Unchained or unconfirmed listeners reach out to raylene at Laura Shin podcast at gmail.com to find out about sponsorship opportunities on Unchained and unconfirmed again that's Laura Shin podcast at gmail.com la you are a Shi n podcast at gmail.com one comment about actually something earlier that amber said was she talked about this help previously there was a separation between money and free speech and I actually wanted to just flag for people that this was actually a moment in an interview I did with neva Brava conte on my podcast Unchained where he talked about this how this was breaking down and it was like easily one of the most tweeted parts of any interview I've ever done so you guys should go back and check that out but actually amber you also raised usability which is actually where I wanted to go next because I'm just curious to know well so two things so I want to hear and mega talked about what it is that has made certain alternatives usable by people and what people have actually been using on the ground but then also you know kind of try to analyze like why do you think those things worked and who was using them was it just limited kind of like to a certain subset of people or did it kind of you know gain wider adoption and if not what were the challenges and stuff so does one of you want to start yes so I I have spent the summer working at Z cash Z cash company for those that you don't know as a cryptocurrency that has been developed here in the US led by Zucco Wilcox from an cryptographer and got a great team really big fan of the team they got there and they care a lot about privacy they care a lot about censorship persistence and zuko particularly cares about what's going on in Venezuela so he set up this group which said Jill Carlson and I have been working over the summer to research how cryptocurrencies could help in in Venezuela and we have found that usability is a big issue because the people who are able to access cryptocurrency are tech savvy they they have a way to access a computer they have a way to access and most people in - oh don't have computers most most people there are like about 45 % of population has phones which is pretty significant but there there hasn't been anyone who's developed like a phone app that is very easy to use that I could point to my grandma or to my mom even and and they could like get it and start accessing at like an open money system and that's not good news for the majority of people because you need someone that really leads you into it and the lucky few are getting the benefits of cryptocurrency so if you have someone who taught you how to use local bitcoins and like work out the whole thing about the reputation system and how to buy and how to sell like where the Commission's are and so on or if you have someone that is using air TM which is another service that lets people access like digital US dollars in Venezuela those have been recently blocked by the government and now you need a VPN to access its spirit still pretty easy for someone that's tech savvy to install a VPN and sit but I couldn't tell my mom to like she you know it's it's it's difficult for most people that aren't in tech so yes we it's definitely clear that the top problem is the lack of a product so I I like to use this example a lot whatsapp popularized the use of end-to-end encryption and we had suddenly billions of people who were able to troop to communicate with each other securely and since they focus on usability since they focused on being available on every platform possible and they later incorporate encryption they did a great service to the world and we feel like I feel like we need to do that for money and as a very small subtle point on that it's the same exact encryption that Facebook implemented at the same time all of which are originated from signal messenger the only difference there is that if you use it via whatsapp it is turned on by default you do not need to opt in to using that end-to-end encryption if you use it in facebook you have to click three different menus for every individual bilateral chat then it's encrypted that's the kind of software design decisions that really matter to billions of people yeah Megan do you want to dive into usability and yeah I mean I would totally agree with that I think the reason that we chat is so widely used including WeChat pay is that it is like so easily accessible you mentioned like inline emojis and gifts like that's a big part of why people use it like everybody loves that stuff that's man it's always just gonna come back to the cat gets all about cats and bunnies like seriously like yeah I remember when we chat first became popular in China like a big part of it was like sending all this like kind of cutesy stuff to your boyfriend or girlfriend and um in terms in terms of like a payment um I think one of the reasons that it's it's sort of like one of those things that it's sort of like a snowball fetch like um it started just being available everywhere you could use it for every transaction the cost to the both a payer and the pay that the the recipient was like either zero or negligible so even some who runs a fruit stand on the side of the road you know they can use WeChat pay to accept payment right so that kind of convenience factor I think trumped any kind of considerations about privacy the other thing I would point out is like you know when it comes to China like I think adoption of these kind of kinds of like native platforms for you know communications and services it's it's mirrored the development of Seoul of domestically created social media in a lot of ways like the reason that these services have become so popular and so widely used so quickly is not just the third user friendly it's because the any kind of competition from outside of China has effectively been cut out so if we talk about encrypted apps for instance there are a lot of people in China are tech savvy they wanna probably like a more private alternative and those people were using stuff like whatsapp signal and and telegram um you know until probably about a year and a half ago when basically I guess it probably what happened as a critical mass of people started using it and the government just sort of put a kibosh on it so some these the thing about these apps is like sometimes they work and sometimes they don't but what's clear is that they're not reliable because you can't predict when they're gonna work and when they're gonna not wait how did they do that like I'm using on my phone and how do they know that I'm using it like I don't understand that so it's not personal it's just like you know it's it's different in different parts of the country but if you think think about how that works so like if I send you we're both in Beijing right if I send you a whatsapp saying like hey let's meet up at 6 p.m. for dinner I don't know if you got it or not right so it's like even if it works that day I don't know that it's gonna work and you might not get my message which you know which means I didn't accomplish my goal right and so somehow the government makes it viral the traffic was rerouted basically so there when it came to signal they simply disallowed all service that was coming through from the signal servers and signal attempted to domain front via Amazon so that would look like all of your traffic was coming from Amazon Amazon actually shut that down and was able to send them like a cease and desist and that's when it comes to decentralization of code itself it's something that when you have a specific company that owns a specific code base and you can call somebody and say stop it that's how something gets gets shut down and there's really no alternative because you need that network adoption right to have a community that can connect it's you can't have a decentralized app that does that necessarily until you start talking about you know I co actually just to make one point on the usability piece I really think it's this is crucial I think it's important that we don't underrate the usability discussion around this there's been such a myopic focus for the last few years in decentralization technology on just the technology which is incredibly important we have to get the technology right to make it work and be effective but technology alone is not enough it is like developing a new medicine that cures a disease and not thinking about how to lower the cost of that medicine or distribute it to people that need it just having it isn't enough in a lab somewhere what we need is the technology and then think about usability how do you make that technology actually usable for people how do you make that medicine accessible for people and the distribution how do you then get that into people's hands even if you built a beautiful easy-to-use app that had the best of decentralized technology to solve a currency problem or surveillance problem or whatever it may be and you didn't have a way to actually get that in people's hands and make them want to use it that is a useless thing to have and so I think we're now in this kind of wave of decentralized technology getting to this place of the professionalization of the space and increasingly seeing people think about usability and user adoption things all Hondros talking about in venezuela that are so critical now that we've developed a basis for that technology you got to work on how to get it to people and make sure that people keep using it because otherwise it'll sit there in lab and never have any effect on the actual real issues in the world like currency destabilization or surveillance or censorship yeah and just getting exactly to that point with the China and the firewall is there any way around that or like you know can just centralized technologies get around that kind of firewall or no yes and no I think it's worth it depends kind of what we're talking about metadata analysis resistant protocols are a completely different area of study that has to do with making it through and past that those kind of firewalls are making it at least difficult to find out what's going on so you know when people are doing stuff that you would want a sensor and certainly there are a lot of projects you've probably heard of the Tor project as well there have been several other projects over the last several decades that people have worked on to either further decentralize or further you know remove those single points of failure for people that are just trying to navigate the internet it's not you can't just throw a VPN VPN in there and necessarily a call it a day yeah and just to build on what amber saying there one of the promises of decentralized technology I'll explain what this means is that decentralized technology moves the advantage from the attacker to the defender in a system with centralized technology it's always a cat-and-mouse game for trying to get around the Great Firewall or whatever you're trying to avoid always a captain Metis game of you know technology and proving that makes it easier to get around and then then you know kind of the attackers China for example catching up and figuring out how to you know invade that and get back into the protocol and then it develops again develops again and what I think is so powerful with this technology is that it moves that advantage from the attacker to the defender in a centralized system model nation-states if that's we're talking about have an advantage because they can walk into Facebook's headquarters with Google's headquarters like we're talking about and say hey this is the deal if you want to operate in our country you put your servers here we have access to them and that's the way it's gonna be advantage attacker right but in this decentralized world it's not that it's a magic wand that we can wave and say well now the Great Firewall doesn't work anymore China has no chance of ever defending against this what it does say is that the defender the people that are using it now have the advantage and that people developing the technology can build it knowing that it's their turn to make things better and more attack avoidant more resistant to threats and then China may come up with a way to block that somehow the signal example we're gonna take down these servers signal can then say well we're gonna distribute this a little bit further trying to figure out a way to attack that they can distribute a little bit further and that advantage shift is what we're going for and eventually the hope is that with some of the C centralized technology the advantage become so big that it becomes functionally impossible to broadly attack these things in a you know highly surveyed or censored way yeah it gets it can get very complicated you know I mean I think and we haven't really seen a functional functioning decentralized autonomous sort of application I think the the etherium Dow was the the first one and it blew up relatively quickly but the problem is besides just cat gifts but on the internet no one knows you're a cat on the internet no one knows whether or not you're an intelligence operative so when you don't actually have a specific company that has a jurisdiction and has said you know as Google did previously we're not going to do this this is our line in the sand maybe maybe they change that the way that they're going to operate but it's in the news and we know about it the best defense that we have against that in a in a decentralized software sense would be just be that it's open source which requires that qualified people with the right eyeballs look at it at the right time and then raise some sort of alarm bells but as you decentralize that control you are giving away that trust that we have placed trusts every app that is on your phone you are implicitly trusting the people that have written that software to not just be completely doing something that they is disingenuous and malicious to you yeah I actually also want to circle back to something that you mentioned earlier which is that so far for most of this conversation we've been talking about two centralized technologies as being kind of the solution to these problems kind of being perpetrated by these other Authority ring regimes but Hambrick did allude to earlier how obviously some of them are also trying to use this for their own ends and all 100 mention that as well and so even though this is like a slightly negative note although I think this gonna be our last official question then we might have one more question from an audience remember um but I'm just curious to know kind of like how you guys think authoritarian regimes are actually trying to use these technologies you know and why like is it to avoid sanctions or to oppress their people in other ways or like how are they using them yeah we just going down yeah well I think that you could argue that the petrol if well executed could effectively skirt sanctions and not just the petrol but like other cryptocurrencies right because they weren't receiving payments in petrol as they were they wanted to get money in Bitcoin or ether on what have you and I think that there's there's some evidence that North Korea has hackers that target computers in the West that have and then they request like payment Bitcoin or an ether so they they are definitely interested in money that is able to flow freely across borders and that's the way that they they can get like an advantage of this but I think that wanna cry hacker yes was North Korea and that's where they weren't like locking your computer and then requesting Bitcoin be paid for the rental meant I think the other thing is that there were some really big crypto hacks in crypto exchange hacks in Korea South Korea and at least a theory is that North Korea was behind those yes yes so I think there's definitely a concern there that we should all be aware of and that we should try to mitigate but I I would refer back to your point that this is supposed to give the advantage to the defender and not to the attacker and like there's supposed to be give the power the shift of power back to the individual rather than the state so it shouldn't matter that much if a state is able to do this like as an individual actor because there's many many other individual actors who will overwhelm the state with their good intentions were that with their good behavior yeah although the problem in North Korea is that of course the over a person is not have access to the Internet so yes only the government does all right so does anybody else want to add anything tipis I would just just add quickly about North Korea yeah I mean the the reason that North Korea is interested in cryptocurrency is because they literally do not have access to global financial markets because of like the encroachment of international sanctions so I mean if you think about North Korea's government is essentially an international criminal enterprise like they will use lots of different ways to smuggle money in and out of their country like everything from putting it in their diplomats suitcases to selling drugs to like you know just all manner of illicit commerce and I think they see cryptocurrency is one more vehicle for that and I think that's interesting because it shows that like you know a currency that sort of promotes privacy and it's sort of outside the norms of the global financial system has all of the kind of benefits and pitfalls of that so for somebody who is engaging in something that we would consider legitimate right like something like you know advocacy or or something like that that that can be a very positive thing but it also empowers people who are seeking to use that privacy to do something that would ultimately be harmful I think yeah at the end of the day technology doesn't have morals exactly technology can be used by good actors are bad and and it's up to the those actors you can develop a utopian or a dystopian world for any technology where medicine or genetic testing or anything is used in certain ways and it can be selected people are bad people and I think it's up to us as people that are building these applications and building the usage patterns building the distribution to make sure that this new set of Technology around decentralized technologies is used by good people for good purposes and not by bad people for bad purposes alright so I think we have time for one maybe two questions there's one right up front and I have to give up my mic so I can easily walk it over okay thanks thank you all I know it's the point of a working lunch but it feels very rude to eat while you're a so so sorry about that Lauriston I obviously listen to your podcasting career content mega is how you speak on Thursday at the block's tech event my name is Faye I recently joined with sorry which is which is a start-up bringing transparency to the crypto economy and I joined as head of design so I'm really interested in the direction of usability in the conversation from today I mean obviously it's kind of under my charge in the design industry in general to bring usability and accessibility to - to this world but I think there's a two pronged approach to that one is making the products usable and accessible and legible and the other is making the landscape at large usable and accessible and decipherable and I really think that speaks to what you're saying about you know most people not knowing their threat model so I feel like the branch number one easy enough designers you know there's their best practices to do that but the number two of the mission here is harder harder to think about how to approach and I'm curious what your thoughts are about bringing usability to the ecosystem at large and helping people understand the need for this technology I feel like I don't know I feel like that's a gimme since I'm working on building software development tools that drive usability but yeah I think that it's it's it's maybe not just as easy to make a bad an application that does bad things as usable as an application that does good things but the application that is more usable is the one that people will probably choose and historically there there is generally a trade-off between security and privacy or convenience and a lot of I think a sentiment that kind of runs through people the communities of people who care is like well other people should just care enough to get over it and if they understood the world that we the way that we do then they would see the value in making clicking this extra button or understanding these different settings or only using these three hops to get to that your final destination using long passwords and stuff like that right because it takes work it does take a lot of work to be secure on the internet and that that's there's little anywhere around it like right like that you could make certain things more usable but ultimately you need to like everything is in crypto and like in cryptography it's is protected by randomness and you're like hiding in the randomness and you need to be able to remember like a passphrase or you mean like there's I feel like there's just little recourse against you know very like fundamental things we should try to make it better or easier but at the end of the day it does take a little bit of adjustment I think and this is a very very real problem because if if you don't make it usable for people that are not trying to do malicious things like just buy drugs with Bitcoin if you can't get people to pay for stuff at Starbucks then you have no noise around your signal and then it's very easy to make the claim that governments should say well we we don't want this within our borders because we don't see the legitimate use ability yeah I'd also just it's about communicating people what the core idea of the technology isn't gets it's been true for every technological revolution any of the internet people didn't understand why this thing needed to exist and just needed to be bludgeoned over the head by people saying this gets something you type anywhere else in the world instantly in front of that person and that then leads to websites that then leads to everything that we have today same thing with radio telephone every piece of technology and the core idea behind the see centralization is that this does the things you already do but without relying on anyone to do it and that ideas have to be communicated over and over again to people until they've realized what applications could be built with that idea okay I think we have time just for one more question and there's a woman in the back who's been signaling to me that she has a question for a little while so I will hand the mic off to you yes hi I'm Marisol I came at the lift in Norway so I do work with blockchain and I also have evangelist of a yacht as well so I go around really thinking and I work with digitalization I'm leader of a digitalization in a key no rest at all so my latest adventures is enterprise data and in that I really from being entrepreneur trying to do solar energy and everything I really change my mentality on how we just look at commodities and everything that we have in the wrong way right so is things that we have data and everything is is ours right but but we are moving to our system of the centralization with a tactless a function as a service right and then that's when we start creating these things so when we talk about a block chain or a yachtie it is literally a technology anything that it comes it's just the back end of the architecture right but at the a we are trying to create here is businesses of people data by also insurance that they get the service they want at the moment they want right with the cell server and the traceability they accountability because they have to be accounted right now we are not constable for what Google does for us right or anything so I want to ask you all what do you think of greenie the disruption of Industry 6.0 will be because I'm a lunch in my company actually I had distributed something and this is actually a platform for integrated so integrate blockchain integrator your integrity everybody like a Netflix of data right so it is that integration what do you think of the integration of the data as a function right where people actually say hey I can do this for you right or I can have an artificial intelligence or a GT half and then everybody just plug in the same place is that difficult I know that the security of all China and the firewalls right I mean is I don't see it as a really difficult team because when you just distributed this you make it incredible triple in critical like anything I think that there is there is a way around it the problem is customers and people getting in power yeah I can I can jump in on that I think the the what has to happen here is the simplest applications have to be built first for people to use I think a lot of those will be around ownership of data exactly what you're talking about that that is a core benefit that there is so much fear right now and uncertainty around who owns my data is that these organizations that the government who is it and so there will be simple applications built first that encourage people to take over ownership of their own data and once people have their own data that's what everything is built off of every single service we use in our lives centralized or decentralized relies on our data relies on us in putting it it having it and so we'll build these simple versions and then from there everything gets integrated and I think up here and and speaking on this panel I think we're probably all dreaming of a world where most if not all the technology we use is decentralized in some way and so you have to start with the simple pieces and that'll get more and more integrated into your life as more services begin to use those decentralized data providers instead of the centralized hubs that we use today and it's just a long path together I think we've got a long way to we're very early in the ecosystem but it's working on things like that that are so critical to get us to that next stage where all of these services can be decentralized we don't need to rely on the central parties anymore also there are companies working hard on the problem of how to aggregate data that is private and how to perform analytics on stuff that is an anonymized so Apple has been doing some work in differential privacy you can look that up it's it's an area of research that is active in the company because Apple really does care but like unlike Google and Facebook about this and you know they're there like many projects and maybe amber could talk a bit more about that that is the most important next step in all of this is that it's it's not just about decentralization for decentralization sake but I soon a lot of people have seen wall-e where like everybody gets kind of like fat just staring at their monitors and like loves kind of the you know robots giving them food or whatever that's kind of how we are with surveillance capitalism today you got a wonderful customer experience where Netflix tells you everything you might ever want to see in a predictive way and you never have to leave the couch right so why on earth are how are we supposed to convince people to take back their data if all of a sudden nothing knows anything about them anymore it's not a better user experience it's not a compelling reason for people to change so unless we can provide the same kind of business value and the same experiences over that decentralized data that it's private it's it's I don't know how we're gonna make these applications take off and that's a decade away from being pragmatically usable probably yeah at least okay well I think we're gonna have to take this as a as an optimistic note a versa it's like always a ray of sunshine right ten years out you know where we're aiming for that an optimistic note to end on so thank you so much for a fabulous panelists thank you for the fabulous cautions and I hope you enjoyed our panel
