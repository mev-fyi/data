the SEC and former commissioner at the cfdc and Colin Lloyd partner at Sullivan and Cromwell welcome Dan and Colin thank you Lord it's a pleasure to be here again very happy to join you today Laura this podcast idea grew out of a discussion that occurred at a satellite event during consensus this was at grit house daily and Dan and I were on a panel together and crypto regulation obviously was a big topic then as it is generally in the industry and Dan said something that I ended up questioning him about he said that when cftc chair rosston Benham says that eth is a commodity and SEC chair Gary Gensler says that it's a security that those two statements don't contradict each other and as far as I understand I guess this is because Securities are a type of commodity so from like a lawyer's perspective his statement seems accurate but obviously from the way that non-lawyers like real people I would say think obviously that those two statements do seem contradictory so um we will start with this question for Dan so we can I kind of use this as the jumping off point um so why don't we just go into your explanation of why it is that you think that those two statements don't contradict each other right well thank you Laura first let me just clarify it's correct uh chair Benham has said that ether is a commodity in fact this goes back a number of years this is uh when chair Benham talks about ether being a commodity this is not really a new position of the cfdc this is a position of the cftc going back all the way to 2015 that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are Commodities it's been upheld in uh one um one court case as well so for cftc's position that virtual currencies like Bitcoin or ether are Commodities is a long-standing position of the cftc SEC has not taken actually a position on whether ether is a commodity uh the chair was uh testified before Congress and and did not say a position either way on ether so technically the SEC hasn't declared what ether is but nonetheless the the two statements that ether's a commodity and it may or may not be a security or if any of virtual currency is a security the fact that something may be a commodity and something as a security are not contradictory something can actually be both the commodity and the security the confusion in this area the law is clear the law is clear between the difference between Commodities and security something that can be a commodity can also be a security but the confusion arises because people think of the term commodity in a colloquial sense meaning a good or an article something like oil or pork bellies and they think of Commodities as tangible things in the layperson sense that's um that's how we use that word and every day but the word commodity in the commodity exchange act which gives the cftc regulatory jurisdiction as a technical meaning that is encompasses the ordinary meeting but it's it's slightly different and the meaning in the commodity exchange Act is the basis for the cftc's jurisdiction so in the commodity exchange act a commodity is defined as it lists a number of agricultural Goods like wheat oat barley eggs butter things like that cotton and then it says and anything else that can be the subject of a Futures Contract so a commodity really in the commodity exchange Act is a functional definition it means something that can be the subject of a Futures Contract the security on the other hand as I'm sure listeners are no sub is is defined as Securities act and and the exchange act and it includes things like notes evidence of indebtedness and investment contracts and what's an investment contract is subject to the Howie test so really in both statutes you have a security and yeah that's defined in a functional way and then in the commodity exchange act you have a commodity which is defined in a functional way as something that can be the subject of a Futures Contract now the cftc's jurisdiction over Commodities really is is two different types of jurisdiction what we think of as regulatory jurisdiction to regulate a market is that regulatory jurisdiction really only goes to derivatives of Commodities like Futures and swaps so the cftc as the name commodity Futures Trading commission this Laura I think this is the way maybe that cuts through the confusion when you think of cftc jurisdiction you shouldn't really be thinking commodity it's not the commodity commission the commodity trading commission it's the commodity Futures Trading commission what it really regulates is the trading of Futures contracts and the word commodity in that context is actually Superfluous because a commodity is something that can be subject to the Futures Contract so it's those two words commodity and Futures complement each other in that way so the cfdc's regulatory jurisdiction is over commodity the trading of commodity Futures not just playing Commodities and now since Dodd-Frank that also includes swap so looking at cftc jurisdiction you say is it a derivative and if it's a derivative like a Futures Contract then the cftc has jurisdiction if it's a security though the SEC has jurisdiction so Set uh chairs Venom's statement that either is a commodity well a commodity if it's a derivative on a commodity a cftc has jurisdiction but if if it's a security then the SEC would have jurisdiction then there's the special case yes you can have something can be both it can be a commodity under the cea and a security and that would be like a Futures Contract on a security which be like a Futures Contract on Apple stock and that is a security future and both agencies have jurisdiction on it so yes it's it's it's a little more detailed than the average person on the street who thinks of a commodity as something like a good or an article and the cfdc would have jurisdiction over that but it's really the derivatives that they have regulatory jurisdiction and one final point that the cftc can bring anti-fraud and anti-manipulation for manipulation of a commodity it's not regulatory jurisdiction it's enforcement jurisdiction if there's fraud or manipulation on a commodity then the cftc has jurisdiction over that so that's the basic jurisdictional divide but when you think of cftc jurisdiction you really need to be thinking uh in terms of Regulation regulating markets of Futures and swaps trading that was a super helpful description of yeah the different uh purviews that the that the two agencies have um I do want to press you a little bit on you know chair gensler's position and um I'm opening this question up actually also to Colin so in a February interview with New York Magazine SEC chair Gary Gensler said quote everything other than Bitcoin you can find a website you can find a group of entrepreneurs they might set up their legal entities in a tax Haven offshore they might have a foundation they might lawyer it up to try to Arbitrage and make it hard jurisdictionally or so forth but at the core these tokens are securities because there's a group in the middle and the public is the anticipating profits based on that group so you know at the beginning he says everything other than Bitcoin and then he concludes these tokens are securities even though he famously danced around the question of whether ether is a security in front of um Congress from that statement you can deduce that he would classify ether as a security and then in a recent episode of Odd Lot cftc chair Benham he talked about the process for establishing the Bitcoin in either Futures contracts and he described it this way quote there's legal analysis done by The Exchange they have to conform with the laws and the regulations of the cftc there's open dialogue over sometimes many months to make sure that the contract conforms with our legal requirements and in the context of the question because he's responding to the moderator is it a security or commodity there's no doubt we within the agency and at the staff level examine the characteristics of a financial asset to ensure that it complies with the law and that falls within the definition of a commodity and more importantly is not a security so that would lead me at least to conclude that he believes that ether is not a security since they launched an ether's Futures Contract so you know now hearing that do you still think that they don't disagree and Colin I'm curious for your thoughts on whether um it seems like the SEC and the cftc are disagreeing about ether status let me jump in there a little bit one one thing that Dan mentioned which is really uh important here is that you can have security Futures contracts which is a special class of Futures Contract that is based on a single non-exempt security and then you have all the other types of Futures contracts the other types of Futures contracts are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the cftc and all the regulations that you know apply to them are various cftc regulations were regulated in a particular way we're not subject to the Securities Law offering and disclosure requirements for example you don't have to have a broker dealer or a national Securities Exchange involved to trade or clear them nothing like that it's all subject to cftc rules um security Futures are different um they are subject to dual regulation but 502 agencies as as Dan mentioned uh Bitcoin Futures and ethereum Futures were both listed by the CME as non-security Futures is what I'll just colloquially call commodity Futures they're subject traded cleared executed subject to exclusive cftc jurisdiction the SEC today does not regulate them um at all now this there's a long tradition going back many many years where the agencies would sometimes disagree about the status of different products that the different exchanges whether Securities exchanges or Futures exchanges have listed and typically in those instances if you know the SEC you know thought that a commodity Futures exchange was listing a Securities product made even litigate you know against the exchange we have not seen that here right ethereum Futures continue to be listed and traded every day on the CME as subject to exclusive cftc jurisdictions I think when chair Benham is talking about how the cftc has looked at those Futures contracts he's talking about concluding that that of a cftc including including at CME that those contracts are properly subject to exclusive uh cftc jurisdiction and of course um I mean Dan is right that the SEC at the commission level you know has not weighed in on the status of ethereum but we do of course have um statements at the staff level the senior staff level there's a very famous speech from Corporation Finance director Bill Henman uh explaining that at that time um uh I believe it was 2018 that he did not believe uh that ethereum was a security uh based off the decentralization of the operation of the asset and the relevant Network and there have been no you know statements um by the commission itself sort of overruling that view now I think if you want to unpack what Sarah Gensler was saying in that uh in that New York Magazine interview you referenced I think the question there is something that that people have been looking at which is you know have the changes that have taken place with respect to eth in the intervening years you know but switched from proof of work to proof of stake the um uh you know the so-called merge uh and the other changes that have taken place should that change the analysis I think most of the community including it would appear chair Benham at the cftc think no um that continues to be the case that uh the extent of decentralization with respect to Heath is sufficiently wide that it continues to be a commodity that even though there is yes an ethereum Foundation of our other developers that they are not acting as I think you said charigans war was middlemen you know they're not they're not a group of people acting as a middleman for the asset uh rather it's you know a group of people who are promoting the utility and use of the asset much like you have you know groups of you know many companies promoting the use of gold or diamonds or other types of Commodities that wherever is certainly various bodies that contribute to the utility of those assets but that doesn't make the asset a security now I I think a couple of points that uh that Colin mentioned are significant first is that the determination if there were to be a determination um that ether we're a security it would have to be by the full SEC as a commission no no single commissioner could make that determination so until and I I don't I do not know whether it will or will not but until the SEC were to make such a determination based upon you know factors that that colonists mentioned the recent recent characteristics of ether than the current situation as it has existed and as the cftc has found that ether continues to be traded under cftc's exclusive jurisdiction under the CME contract and it's a perfectly legal and valid contract under cfdc jurisdiction if circumstances change in any commodity such that it loses the the initial characteristics that make it such then circumstances change but that has not that has not happened yet the SEC chair counselor has made a number of statements regarding his belief regarding tokens generally but until the SEC itself is a commission weighs in um the current situation where uh ether is a commodity Futures Contract traded under cftc jurisdiction continues I want to jump in on one thing that you just said there Dan is that this concept that you can have an asset that you know begins its life as a security even becomes a non-security commodity and then can flip flop I mean I I just think it's a practical matter that is a very difficult and tenuous thing for her to be you to be the foundation for for a market for utility just from a policy perspective that creates a high degree of uncertainty and I think it's it's interesting because we haven't really seen the courts in other instances you know view assets as you know moving back and forth you can have uh real world uh assets physical assets as well as intangible assets that are sold as part of an investment contract you know I I could say I'm going to uh you know even in the famous Howie case right that is the origin of all this you had oranges that were being sold as part of an investment contract but as I think a lot of people in the community like to say if it doesn't make oranges you know into uh into Securities right and so I think that's kind of at the heart of what's uh at issue here which is you know whoever you can have an asset with which is at all times just you know just an asset it's just a mutable you know just computer code that performs certain functionalities and can that asset embody itself an investment contract or is it merely its own thing that depending on the fact and circumstances might be sold in a transaction that's an investment contract for example to raise money but that does not make the asset you know itself a security subject to SEC jurisdiction it's a two it go it's a two-way street I mean I think there's people who would like to believe that something can start out as a security you could start out as for example an orange might start out as a Howie contract part of how we contract in an orange group but that doesn't necessarily mean that all the Howie oranges grown on the Howie Farm eventually find their way into Whole Foods or wherever they find their way in that the person who buys an orange that was grown on a Howie Farm is purchasing a security from the supermarket I mean those types of uh hypotheticals and scenarios or something could possibly start out as something that's within an investment contract or part of the scheme might be at some later point a not so so these things can go back back and forth I don't know if if everything is immutable for all time when it starts out at the beginning of its uh a creation either way yeah I think the point you're making is a a really good one which is that you know it's one thing thing if you're buying you know the oranges from from Howie and his farm and you know giving him money to promote his uh his scheme it's another thing if you just happen to buy oranges in the supermarket that the supermarket bought right and I think that's kind of that issue of a lot of what's been going on lately is a distinction you know between what people would refer to as kind of primary Market transactions when you're buying the digital asset from someone who is promoting or developing it versus secondary Market transactions with people who might want to use the asset to pay gas fees or to govern a smart contract or what have you but are not buying it from the developer promoter in some sort of capitalizing transaction yeah I have a couple of um quick sort of yes no questions for each of you um so the first one would be based on the two quotes I gave the one from the New York Magazine interview and the other from the odd Lots episode do you think that chair Gensler and chair Benham agree with each other on this question of whether ether is a security or do they disagree I I don't think chair gassler has said whether it uh is is or is not he hasn't stated whether it is or isn't and so I can't say that he disagrees with the chair with chair Banner because he hasn't he hasn't he's neither agreeing or disagreeing so uh but so you don't feel that you can deduce from his statement everything other than Bitcoin I'll answer that question no I don't think there is a disagreement at this point between the two chairs interesting I guess I guess I would say that um they certainly have not said things that lead me to think that they agree with each other on this I think it would have been very easy for Joe Gensler to make a statement along the lines that chair Benham made you know in the testimony that you mentioned uh Laura or in the uh in the the magazine interview and he has not done so okay and then the next quick question is what do you guys think is ether security or not a security well my I I have to rely on the Regulatory Agencies until the until the SEC were to say it's a security I can't make a determination that it is a security so at this point it is not because the agency has not says it is well but if so you used to work there so if you were still working there now and there was an internal discussion and you were asked your opinion what would you well even even when I was working there I uh it's a facts and circumstances a determination and I was not in the part of the agency I I was not I was not involved in effects and circumstances determination so I I didn't get up to that that point but but you've never looked into this yourself like you are extremely I I do not have sufficient knowledge of all this putting my Regulators hat on I do not have sufficient knowledge as a regulator to make a determination I I it just wasn't it would be a very specific determination based on facts and circumstances which is what I want the regulator to do I go back to what I was saying earlier like I I don't see anything and the case law that tells me that you know some string of uh of uh of digits that you know operates on a blockchain can natively just be a security right you can have a transaction an arrangement a scheme as Dan says where you can sell something you could sell anything you can sell you know whiskey barrels you can sell oranges you can sell minks or whatever as part of an investment contract but that doesn't make the underlying asset itself uh an investment contract so if I you know if I create a digital asset um and I and I sell it to people to try to raise money to promote the network um that could be an investment contract transaction but when someone else goes and uses the asset to do you know whatever they want to do whatever it's utility case is or to sell it in a secondary Market that's not necessarily part you know of my uh investment contract transaction and so I think it's kind of a a weird question in some sense to be asking you know is this digital asset a security or not I think you should be asking is the digital asset being sold as part of a Securities transaction that depends on the facts and circumstances but I think it doesn't necessarily mean that every time the asset is sold even if it was once sold as part of an investment contract but it's always in Forever subject to that status until there's some mystical event of of decentralization okay so um we're gonna kind of keep playing out the weird scenario um so I was curious like if it someday is determined that ether is a security that the SEC comes out and says this or or somebody does then what would that look like in terms of registering eth with the security like who do you think would do that and then what would that registration process look like this actually goes to a great Point Laura which is let's say the uh whether it's e for or some other digital asset and despite what I just said someone concludes that they you know the asset itself is a security what would be the consequences okay so if that asset is going to be you know offered and sold uh to the uh to the general public then there would need to be some sort of registration of those offers uh and sales uh that would require you know completion of a disclosure uh document uh probably a form S1 with the SEC which presupposes that there is some some issuer for the asset that raises a very good question you know who who would be the issuer uh uh for something uh for something like this the SEC has not provided guidance uh about who that would be second you know what would they have to disclose well they would have to disclose a number of things on that form some of which are probably not very material to uh to investors things like you know audited financial statements of this issue or which we haven't identified which party would be that is sure and wouldn't necessarily include things that are material about you know the code and and how it operates in so-called tokenomics uh and the like and so you have kind of this Disclosure document that um you know what what needs to be in there is not really tailored to the asset and then you have okay well how's it how's it going to be traded well it uh if it's going to be traded on some sort of exchange at least under existing uh SEC rules that exchange will need to register there's either a national Securities Exchange or as a broker dealer if it's also registered is what's called an alternative training system now I say under current SEC rules because cheric ensler and some of his uh public statements has indicated that he does not believe that the alternative trading system framework is suitable for a digital asset exchanges that have a retail customers which I I find to be a curious statement because you have a traditional equities uh Securities trading platforms better registered as ats's who have retail subscribers but nonetheless he said they need to be on a national Securities Exchange which would require that the um about the token issue or be subject to your periodic public disclosures 10ks 10 Qs and again there's no clear guidance about what they would have to do in that context and how long was disclosure obligations would you know would continue and many of all kinds of questions about you know who how can retail investors get access to it would they have to trade for a broker dealer if it's on a national Securities Exchange they would uh but so far there's not been a clear guidance about how a broker dealers can trade and custody assets that are on a uh on a blockchain and whoever they can do that would seem under current guidance they can't even do that while also facilitating non-securities digital asset transactions or facilitating Securities transactions that are not digital assets which raises a whole host of of issues and questions that have been put before the SEC and that that's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg in terms of as you can go through all the different aspects of the Securities laws and the different registration categories for different parties where there have been questions raised to the agency over many years um and most of these questions continue not to have answers well the process the process is is um as Colin has outlined uh somebody will seek to registration there there's current regulations established now um admittedly the current regulations were drafted with other types of asset classes in mind this is a new asset class with new new types of issues but this is not the first time the agency has faced new asset classes with new types of issues when we moved into uh basically electronic trading for the first time moving off the floor there was electronic commission communication networks and computerized trading back and forth and and how do you how how is that new technology work under the current under the then existing regulations when when for many years all we had was Floor Traders and floor Brokers and it took it took a while it took the industry working with the uh sec to develop the types of trading networks that colonists mentioned alternative trading systems and eventually leading to the National Market System that was actually took a long time to develop probably longer than we would want for for this system to develop the process is that registrants come come in work with the agency see okay here's what we can do here's what we can't do the agency can grant what's called no action letters to Grant no action relief here's how you can meet the intent of the regulations and that process can go forward on a case-by-case basis whereby the agency can can if there's a certain particular technology that can't comply with a particular regulation but there's an alternative way that can meet the same standard for investor protection for Market Integrity for whatever that can be worked out between the agency and the registrant on a process going forward but Dan you don't have in mind kind of the who of who would come in and register I don't know who would be the the person to come in for for a disclosure statement if you have an exchange trading either you know the exchange uh or broker dealer and people performing functions of intermediaries in the market those could be readily identifiable who would come in and have to submit registration forms for for their functions so there's a basic disclosure statement I don't know I can't sit here today and say who is the responsible entity uh uh for a particular cryptocurrency for for a disclosure statement all right so in a moment we're going

description back to my conversation with Dan and Colin so in that same Odd Lot to interview with chair Benham he said in response to a question about defy quote I think it's easy to suggest oh there's no institution there's no individual it's just code you can't regulate it it's and then he said it's sort of self-effectuating but that's really the wrong set of questions it's really about what are US customers being offered and exposed to and who is either the individual or the group of individuals who set up that entity that code to offer those products and then he said that he wasn't offering legal advice but he finished quote it really is incumbent on individuals to understand and appreciate that if you're going to offer derivatives to U.S customers there is a very well-developed and mature legal base and requirements for complying with the law so again I'm not a lawyer but to me this sounds like he's saying there's going to be some kind of Regulation around defy in the US that is based on existing laws and I was curious um you know for both of you what you thought uh regulation of D5 should look like well the the the question really both from the SEC I believe and the cftc perspective is chair Venom articulate there are regulations that regarding when certain functions are performed in public markets then the question becomes who is performing those functions who is accountable and I think chair Benham is accurately stated these functions just don't spring out of nowhere without human initiative and development and and and capital to make things work in this manner so the question really is like who's who's doing it who's writing the code what are what how involved are they and who where is the point of accountability uh going to lie it some of these questions are actually difficult questions exactly where that point of accountability is but there has to be I think what chair Venom is saying is there is at some point uh an accountable person um in terms of developing the capital to put the network together the interface with the public organizing the code governance tokens things like that there's a number of of use the word indicia of of of control or organization that that both agencies have been using in these types of cases and it went so just the different entities that you listed could Encompass for instance the developers node operators on the blockchain people who I guess are deploying maybe interfaces to access that protocol so are you saying that all of them would need to be regulated in some fashion no I'm saying you need to you you need to look at and see who's doing what in in this and and is there a is there an organizing person is there a control person is there a person who's supplying Capital there's a number of these factors that who's making decisions on how this operates um things like those are factors that you would need to consider I'm not saying any one of them is particularly necessarily just positive in any circumstance or that all who perform those functions are necessarily liable but it but there is human endeavor and human initiative in bringing these systems forth um and so that's I think the what the regulatory agencies are struggling to determine or looking to determine and we've seen some enforcement actions along those lines I think this is um it's very interesting and and a little surprising honestly that we're kind of people are discussing it in this way and I want to talk a little bit about how these things kind of come up you know in traditional sort of non-crypto markets and and why I sort of feel like we're operating a little bit through a Looking Glass because I think the some of the legal issues here are actually pretty pretty clear right so the Securities and commodities laws you do differ from each other in the sense that although both of them have a concept as Dan said if you're performing if a person is performing certain regulated functions that it needs to register so if you're you're acting as some sort of intermediary if you've got a trading facility or platform uh you need to register as you know a broker or an exchange or a Futures commission Merchant or a swap execution facility that that part is is relatively obvious uh you also have the fact that under the Commodities laws but not the Securities laws there is a separate requirement that all Futures transactions uh done in the United States must be done on a cftc registered exchange called a designated contract market so you know Laura if you and I wanted to to enter into a a corn Futures Contract just negotiate it here on this podcast but couldn't do that would be illegal um and so that that that's very clear and similarly what things better regulated is swaps can only be traded by retail investors someone who's not a quote-unquote eligible contract participant on one of those designated contract markets so the Commodities laws have this additional point that there's an exchange trading uh requirements I think chair Venom is correct that to the extent that you know people in the United States particularly retail uh investors are looking to transact in derivatives but generally have to do that uh if it's cftc regulated derivatives on a cftc registered Exchange um but that does not necessarily mean that for things that our Securities transactions you know the cftc doesn't regulate or for transactions that uh have um a veteran of institutional counterparties that are not Futures contracts that votes have to be on on an exchange those can be negotiated you know on a peer-to-peer basis there's no requirement uh in the Securities laws that says that you have to execute a Securities transaction on an exchange and in fact there are quite active you know over-the-counter Securities markets uh that exist you know it's not even a requirement that you have to go for a broker dealer you know if Dan and I wanted to uh uh sell uh Securities to each other we wouldn't have to necessarily go through a broker dealer and that still raises the question about if I come up with some uh technology that allows Dan and I to to uh sell Securities uh to each other does that technology result in a registration obligation for a person who creates the technology but I would submit that this is again not a terribly new question there are certain technologies that the SEC has had to evaluate over the years um about whether they give rise to broker dealer or exchange uh registration but they've never suggested that the mere development of like a programming language messaging protocol um a um way for people to communicate with each other over the Internet about uh Securities transactions until recently I guess that they've got a proposal out there right now that might change this but they haven't ever suggested that results in a registration obligation so there are things like the fixed protocol which is the financial information exchange protocol which very commonly used in the Securities and derivatives markets as a common means for people to send messages to each other about trading Securities and settling Securities and derivatives transactions in the derivatives market for something called fpml Financial programming markup language which is a has a similar function there those have been kind of developed on a non-profit kind of Open Source basis no one has suggested that the developers of these messaging protocols and languages that allow people to trade Securities or derivatives needs to needs to go out and register now if I set up a a network a system where um you have to send your fixed message or fpml uh message uh to my system and then my system will match your message with Dan's message and form a transaction that would have to register right but where that's happening just on the open uh internet on a peer-to-peer basis there's never been a suggestion that triggers a registration obligation for someone who has invented the language that allows that peer-repair transaction to take place now what we do do is we regulate the intermediary so if someone if you don't know how to craft a fixed a message and instead you're on some computer screen and you are typing in what you want to trade and you know how you want to trade it and that computer uh uh program is transforming that into a fixed message and sending it along and taking a commission for doing that the SEC has been very clear that if that's in the connection of a serious transaction a person who is providing you that software and taking that commission you know needs to register as a broker dealer again I don't think this is all all that new um I think what's new is the suggestion that the creation of kind of Open Source technology protocols that can facilitate peer-to-peer Trading now uniquely when it involves blockchain technology you know results in a registration obligation I think that is a very new New Concept so Colin it seems like you don't think that that makes sense if I'm understanding your statements correctly so if so then how do you think that these laws should be adjusted by Def adjusted for defy or um or how do you think D5 kind of needs to restructure to kind of fit into these laws yeah I mean I think that um you know there are some out of a community that um have raised a prospect of you regulate apps not protocols um and I think that that what that stands for is the idea is that if someone is developing a protocol that enables people to communicate with each other okay um you don't develop you don't regulate the software development process but if someone is deploying that protocol and intermediating the ability for people to interact with each other providing the mechanism people to to access that protocol depending on the way they're doing that then you regulate that person you kind of regulate the Gateway into the system and that can be done uh to uh ensure things like where appropriate if there's you know compliance of sanctions laws AML kyc customer protection disclosure and the like now I do think it is I go back to what I said earlier it is under current law certainly different and in terms of how you treat the Securities markets versus the cftc regulated derivatives markets because you do have that extra exchange trading requirement that I mentioned which would I think need to be modified if people wanted to be able to use D5 protocols to transact in derivatives particularly retail uh derivatives but I think that that and this is consistent with I think how the internet has been treated for you know a long time we made a decision I think in this country with the development of the internet not to regulate the kind of backbone the the way that people could communicate on the web and the protocols but we do do have various types of consumer uh protection Financial Protection whether it's FTC or or cfpb or other or or money transmitter or other regulations or Securities or Commodities regulations when people are accessing the internet through some Gateway some intermediary uh that is performing that important function and needs to be regulated in a manner protect investors and consumers so that was actually the proposal of the dccpa the additional Commodities consumer protection act that Sam bankman freed was pushing through and it generated a a lot of backlash in the crypto Community but you believe that that actually is the what the most reasonable way to go about it I think it's very difficult to say that we should have um particularly in the retail context you know completely unregulated um a transaction activity particularly where there are still people acting as uh intermediaries uh uh who are providing those important um gateways into accessing uh D5 protocols especially if they're doing that for profit um I think that that raises you know conflicts of interest questions customer protection issues um that you know we you know in the financial regulatory of financial services context there's historically been a a desire to address uh to address those issues oh and but when you say for profit I think it's like the liquidity providers uh not the the company that's putting up the interface that like I don't think they're making money I think it's right it depends okay right it depends yeah it depends on how people set up their uh set up their Arrangements but certainly you know to the extent that people are again it needs to be with respect to something under current law needs to be respect of something that is a is a security or is a you know cftc regulated uh derivative as Dan said earlier for the non-derivatives uh non-securities Commodities markets today there is no federal uh regulatory uh requirement as you said that was something that if it was going to come about was going to come about through you know through legislation but I do think to the extent that someone's stepping into a role as a broker and taking a uh taking a fee to facilitate the transaction or possibly if they're acting as you said as a as a market maker and I want to you know be careful because the market maker is a that's sort of a term of art here but I do think that there there can be a role but I don't think that role should necessarily foreclose the ability for people to develop you know open source software protocols for to allow peer-to-peer interactions yeah I just want to emphasize that point it's really a functional analysis it's like what is the function that the person is doing it's is it a function of a broker dealer is it a function of an exchange and that that's really the that really should be the focus of the question not simply writing code but how are they actually performing or the code that they're writing actually performing that function and Dan what do you think how do you think D5 should be regulated do you think laws need to be adjusted in any fashion well I think that the law the laws right now and it's interesting having this discussion now this we we talked about this uh last time I was previously on the show The the commodity exchange Act is it's it's unlike and I call it accurately uh described it it actually prohibits the transaction if it's not on a regulated exchange it doesn't really it so retail people can't do it it's not just regulating the intermediaries um both statutes both the commodity exchange Act and the Securities laws are technology neutral they have things about investor protection Market Integrity um all these have just been tried and true principles over over many Lessons Learned unfortunately for many people over many decades that really fundamental tenets of our Capital uh formation and our risk management um the processes and and and and they've worked I think through the tech through over time we've developed uh extremely robust uh protections for our markets this is why our markets in the US are the strongest markets in the world we have the strongest Capital formation markets we have the most robust and strongest risk management markets on the cfdc side the capital formation markets on the SEC side and we it's they have developed new technologies they have um uh dealt with innovation in the markets the financial markets today don't look like anything the financial markets when I grew up certainly when I used to go to the bank and get you know take money in and they used to stamp my back book and I couldn't get any interest on my checking accounts and there were no money market funds and all those and none of them actually many of those Innovations not as now they seem as simple and obvious as roll on luggage we're actually really Innovative at the time and difficult to get through the system I mean not so they were all they were entrenched interests that opposed many of those reforms so I mean defy should be regulated uh there's no exception for any particular technology and it needs to meet the same principles now it's a different technology and there may be specific specific issues that need to be addressed and those can be addressed within the current within the current regulatory system I do believe there is a gap right now not so much on D5 but this area we were talking about legislatively with the non-security commodity uh uh a market like Bitcoin for example that there is for an exchange in the U.S trading Bitcoin there is no regulatory uh oversight on that there's the cftc's anti-fraud and anti-manipulation Authority but just a Bitcoin exchange spot Market Bitcoin uh there's not a regulatory agency in charge of that so I believe that that's a gap right there are there are pretty comprehensive and extensive state regulatory uh regimes that exist you know a lot a lot of the you know we have spot uh you know Bitcoin exchanges for example in this country that are very heavily regulated by New York State and other I regulated for for certain purposes but we don't have the same type of national regulatory system with Market Integrity anti-manipulation we we have state regulation which gets to um certain issues but it's it's not uh overall comprehensive Federal regulatory scheme and I think uh it could be helpful to have that well I would think you know the the two they're two candidate agencies the SEC or the cfdc to do that I think that either agency could do it I think that the cfdc um in terms of adapting it's uh its regulatory regime to cover that it it could work well within the cftc regime cftc has Bitcoin Futures as we've talked about ether Futures they've got the Futures on on these leading uh certainly leading uh Commodities right now so to have that spot Market Authority uh would complement that Authority and and I think it could close a significant significant regulatory Gap if the CF to see where to get that Authority it would need resources to do it and so I would urge uh if that's going to happen that there be a dedicated funding source to give the cfdc the additional resources to do that because the last thing you'd want is uh cfdc to have to divert the resources now that are overlooking that wheat and cotton and oil and gas markets all moving over so they need the additional resources and you you could the other thing I would add is the the initial gating issue there's initial gating issue on a product that will still arise is this a security or is it a commodity is it now now that question would actually be very relevant is it a security or is it is it a commodity it would if it's a commodity like Bitcoin it goes to the cfdc if it's a security it would go to the SEC so there's a gating issue and I think the gating issue of whether the instrument is a security would have to be decided by the SEC so somebody would want to trade an instrument on on cftc Exchange a that they assert is a non-security commodity they file an application a product certification traditional cfdc process would be file product certification with the cftc I think in this instance you would have a bifurcated uh process where the cfdc would get the certification for meeting cftc requirements but the SEC would have to make an additional determination of that it is not a security in order to get it on the cftc exchange because the last thing you'd want is for the cftc to put it on and say oh it's a commodity and the SEC saying it's a security the way the Securities laws works now is the SEC says whether something is a security or not they've got the expertise the cftc deals with things in its face very well the SEC is deals with its space so I would keep the two separate I would have a of the gating is it a security if not then it goes over to the cftc facility and actually I think that would solve one of the current problems is or could potentially is what is it right you would have actually a gating decision made under that process and people would know okay it goes here or it goes over here so I I think that that would that would be a process that could answer some of the uh current current uncertainties over what these products are you send it to the cftc the SEC would say what whether it's a security or not if it's not it goes on the cfdc facility end of uncertainty um so I also you know wanted to ask uh we were kind of talking about different types of decentralized finance and I brought up an example that you know basically was a decentralized exchange and as we know the SEC is proposing to change the definition of an exchange and it's implied that it believes that decentralized exchanges fit the definition of an exchange simply because the assets they trade are securities um if I you know got that wrong feel free to correct that um but my question is so if that you know is the case then it seems like decentralized exchanges would also need to register either as National Securities exchanges or as alternative trading systems or ats's and do you agree that that's what the SEC is trying to do and do you think that makes sense for defy yeah I mean I guess what I'll I'll jump in first um so you know this proposal that Laura was mentioning it's actually a re-proposal so the SEC put out a proposal uh last year got a lot of comments people raising questions about whether the proposal you know data cannot apply to D5 for example because it was expanding the scc's definition will Constitution exchange to pick up things that called uh communication protocol systems which was an undefined uh term and the SEC you know recently decided to reopen the common process to get more comments and and so doing mentioned a lot of the points that Laura stated and I think most surprisingly essentially said uh and I'm I'm heavily paraphrasing here to summarize you know but if you've got a a protocol communication protocol a means for people to kind of exchange information uh in order to form the terms of and execute you know a Securities transaction you're quite right that there has to be a predicate you know Securities uh transaction uh involved then basically someone's got to stand up and register uh as an exchange or an ATS uh in connection with that protocol it could be the person who uh wrote the code it could be the person who deployed the code onto the blockchain it could be the person who um provides an interface to access the the protocol uh it could be the governance token holders would have to designate someone they say you know it could even be the case that the miners or validators in the blockchain uh need to designate someone or they have to cease mining or validating transactions on that protocol and there's some suggestion that if you had a a situation where a protocol that was deployed uh was deployed in kind of an immutable code whether there would be no one today who can actually step in and assume responsibility for what's taking place there because if something went wrong they couldn't do anything about it the code is immutable a suggestion there misses in the cost benefit section of a release is that um the community will need to Fork uh that protocol into one that could be compliant and this kind of goes back to what I was saying uh a moment ago which is that it seems a little strange to me because today in the traditional Securities markets uh groups of people get together and developing develop common messaging protocols to exchange information over the public internet about Securities transactions and there's no but never been a suggestion by the SEC not even in this release that if you do that um you need to register uh uh someone has to register with respect to those messaging conventions as an exchange and there's even statements of release that say well if you provide if you have some sort of system some software system that allows people to manage for orders and message each other with those orders and that's deployed by a a broker or an advisor as part of a broker advisory business you know but they probably don't need to register either May request comment about that and this suggests to me that the SEC is maybe taking an inconsistent approach here that where you have technology protocols that are used for people to communicate their trading interests with each other um that don't involve a blockchain then you know votes can continue to exist unless you're actually kind of operating you know operating a a a system where you know your own facility where you control what's going through the system but if all you're doing is providing the means for people uh to communicate uh directly with each other if there's not necessarily a registration obligation but once that happens using a blockchain all of a sudden there is and that that I think is inconsistent with the kind of Technology as I think the answer correct technology neutral um approach under the statute under the Securities laws which shouldn't really distinguish based off of the form of a technology but rather of a function and how it's deployed and who has control over it right but this is why I was surprised earlier when you said that you felt that Sim entity would have to register because just even the way you described it like earlier when you said you know either the developers or the node operators or some like somebody but I feel like even just the way you described it sort of underscore that or at least I you know the crypto Community for sure would say that sort of underscores how decentralized the whole Venture is where you have all these different entities that are putting this thing together but they're not necessarily working in concert so so it's just like I find it um yeah like contradictory that earlier you were saying well somebody will have to register it will be maybe the front ends are some some some entity like that um but then even just in your description of how it all gets put together it's very clear like these aren't all actors of the same entity so let me let me just clarify that then Laura so I think that you know if um someone is providing uh an interface that is allowing a person to um you know to communicate uh um there you know create form an order and send that order uh over um the internet whatever the internet is you know the um you know traditional internet or whether it's using uh blockchain technology or not um send that order to execute a transaction in a security again it has to involve a security um and they take some sort of transaction based compensation for doing so historical SEC precedent staff level would suggest that they need to register now there are certainly questions about whether the courts would agree with that today um they're you know merely taking transaction based compensation but without uh performing any kind of discretionary Services may not be enough under some of a case law out there but I guess my point is that if if we're given the if we're kind of constructing what we think is the future State appropriate uh policy Choice with respect to uh to defy and you're trying to figure out who among the within the ecosystem you know might be an appropriate actor to regulate I was submitting that the developers of a protocol and the protocol itself which is you correctly know had all these decentralized actors that's probably not the right place uh uh to regulate and hasn't historically been how we've regulated the markets but if someone is stepping up as an intermediary is exercising control over the uh of the transmission of orders how those orders are routed taking a commission for doing so that look starts to look a lot more like a brokerage function um that may be more appropriate um you know again uh not not regularly even necessarily as an exchange uh but have a more appropriate place for the regulation to to take hold as opposed to someone who's just providing kind of a passive uh communication um uh uh technology just like a messaging service where we are not performing any kind of meaningful discretionary role or taking a commission or anything like that no I was gonna say just take taking a step back the Securities Exchange Commission and the Securities Exchange act when it regulated exchange and set forth the definition definition of Exchange in the 1934 act it was obvious what an exchange was it was the New York Stock Exchange and the basic fundamental purpose of that 34 Act was to regulate the New York Stock Exchange and there was a building and there were people in it and you knew who was doing what it was obvious who was doing what and now we are 90 years later and it's not this discussion it's it's a it's a great discussion but it's really attempt by the agency what is an exchange it's it's not we're not dealing with the floor of the NYSE anymore it's this thing that people are writing code they're putting it together it's it's a whole network of communication at what point does that diffuse Network actually coalesce and constitute what is meant in those words in the exchange Act and the definition in the statutory definition the regulatory definition that the the the the supplemental release that the SEC put out and you look at all the questions in there and what they're trying to elicit and get input and I'm really looking forward to that that input it's going to be fascinating to see where does the point of accountability lie at what point does this do these functions coalesce into an exchange is it correct the protocol the systems of the communication protocols um so but finding that as chair Benham said finding that point of accountability that's the CR that's that's the key question so the comments on this are going to be really interesting and important to inform the agency but that's what they're struggling with how to adopt that 34 Act definition into the into this really new new new era new technology I think what's really kind of troubling about some of the stuff from that release Dan and and kind of applied I think by sort of what you're saying is there is this assumption that there there must the because people can transact with each other using some sort of Technology that necessarily means that there must be someone who provides that point of accountability and access the exchange and and I go back to what I was saying earlier in the Securities laws not not like the cftc's rules but in the Securities laws there is no requirement that people trading and securities have to trade on an exchange peer-to-peer Securities trading is permissible under our laws and so this kind of like hunting around to try to find someone who is accountable who's going to stand up and register as an exchange I think kind of turns the purpose of that requirement on a text that the requirement for an exchange to register is because there is as you said you know some group or body some organized group or body like the New York Stock Exchange you know who is providing that intermediation function and therefore needs to be regulated because of the risk um that that inner mediation function poses from a market Integrity investor protection Etc perspective but there's if there's no one performing that function if you and I are just communicating with each other using some sort of messaging protocol over the internet why is it necessarily the case that someone has to raise their hand and be accountable for sitting in between us and controlling what we're doing well I think the question is is somebody setting up a system to facilitate are we just doing it on our own or somebody somebody establishing A system that enables you know it's one thing if you and I say hey Colin let's let's meet after this and let's let's do a Securities transaction it's another thing if we come in to some centralized thing on our computer screen and we have to and we happen to meet each other and I think it's that ladder which is really the agency is trying to get at it's if somebody's facilitating us getting together if some of these establishing a system where where we can where we can do it and we hunt out various other people or not we find other people to do it it's whether whether the system but essentially meets this functional equivalent or the functional definition of of an exchanger what should the functional definition where should the line be I think that's a central question that agencies trying to say where should the line be between what you're talking about and what the exchanges but there should be a line someplace and I think agency is trying to find the right line between allowing people to communicate with each other and yet uh regulating the function of bringing these people together and facilitating that so I'd see it as agency trying to find that right line uh and they'll get comments they'll get comments whether their line is in the right place or they're overreaching the line is in in the wrong place but I think that's what they're trying to do yeah and knowing the crypto Community they will get many comments so in late April coinbase filed a court action to try to get the court to compel the SEC to respond to requests for rule making that was submitted last summer and this past week the SEC responded basically saying that it was going to us the course you refuse coinbase's request for the clarity on rulemaking so if the court sides with SEC then that will leave kind of the current approach to um regulation the sec's current approach to regulation which is what many people in Industry call quote regulation by enforcement so Colin I recognize because you're at Sullivan and Cromwell you cannot speak to the coinbase case specifically but I think both of you could answer just generally would you agree that the sec's current method for regulating the crypto industry is regulation by enforcement and if so do you think that that's the right way and if you don't believe that's what they're doing then how would you characterize it so I guess I'll start off I mean I'll juxtapose what we're seeing now with the development of the kind of electronic you know equities trading Market that Dan mentioned earlier right which took place as Dan said over a period of many years multiple no action letters eventually codified in rules where the SEC over multiple administrations took a real effort to try to facilitate and promote the use of of Technologies to provide Clarity um when people came in and asked questions they gave answers uh when they needed things to be tailored they provided relief but enabled that tailoring and they saw public comments held round tables got got a lot of input along along the way what they did not do is go out to people who were starting up these you know what were called electronic communication networks at the time sort of Brokers providing kind of exchange like functionality um and they didn't go to them and say um you know come in and talk to us and register uh and if you uh don't register in exactly the way you want we want we're going to sue you and then start suing one they did not do that um and uh I think that the that prior model you know worked right it it ensured it but technology was able to develop um effectively it gave people uh legal uncertainty you have similar things when people were developing the um on the product side developing the OTC swaps Market uh back in the 70s and more more significantly in the 80s and early 90s there were very real questions about whether those financial products were uh illegal off Exchange futures contracts uh and what the cftc did is it worked uh with Market participants it came out with a policy statement that explained essentially provided a safe harbor for when those things you know would not be subject to cftc regulation it later codified that in a um in an exemptive uh uh Rule and a provided that kind of uh legal uh legal certainty um and I think that what that is a a better model and you know of a cftc over time for raising questions about whether they should make changes in that area and probably some looking behind sight from a 2008 financial crisis would say yeah they probably should have done you know a bit more than in the late 90s but there was a process for them to engage but we again what they weren't doing was going out and and suing people who were trying to raise questions with them and engaging with them um and I think that that was a more constructive uh approach than what we see uh what we see today uh with uh with the SEC I I uh I I think the previous uh model which I mentioned in which Colin just mentioned of how new technologies get integrated with current regulatory systems it's worked it works it's worked at the cftc and it's worked at the SEC whereby and I've sat in the position prior to being at the sacs I had the cftc people would come to me and say we can you do some regulations we want regulations in this area give us Clarity and I'm sitting there at the cftc saying well in all humility I don't know what to do I mean I don't know where this technology is going if we lay down rules now by the time we get done with the rule making proceeding in two to three years the technology will be very different and that that was that was correct this technology is changing very rapidly and in that situation I think it makes sense to proceed on a case-by-case basis where you give a no action letters people come in it's the same model that was used uh uh to develop what eventually became the alternative trading systems and Regulation nms and it took it took a while but it it did work or the industry and the agency work together whether the agency promulgates a rule or not or chooses enforcement I mean this is what agencies think about and this is what they do how to proceed I I think that model works well at the cftc when I was there until 2021 one of the things that we did in the in the last few years I was there is we codified a number of no action letters that were issued in the last 10 years of following the Dodd-Frank legislation because the agency couldn't figure out there were still outstanding issues uh pending from Dodd-Frank and the regulations didn't quite fit and the agency gave no action relief with specialized circumstances if you follow all this these these conditions we won't take enforcement action and after a number of years the agency and the industry became comfortable with those no action letters and those were put into regulation so I think this process of uh this this process this process can work the one factor well let me mention two things one is the enforcement of the Securities laws against entities for violation of registration requirements did not start with the current Administration um don't go back this has been there have been enforcement actions taken in in both the current Administration the previous administration the telegram case a kit case of the other cases though so enforcement just didn't start immediately but what also we've seen recently is we've seen actually investor harm and public market harm and the agency can't sit by and not take action where there is the potential for investors to get hurt for markets uh to uh to for there to be risk in the market so enforcing uh the the regulations uh is something the agency is charged with doing and where there's the potential significant potential for investor harm as we've seen recently um that that makes it imperative I think for the agency to take enforcement action where it sees violations that doesn't mean the other track has to stop it doesn't mean that you don't continue to work with other Market participants and you continue to find find ways to go forward so I see the two tracks of enforcement plus developing um developing a framework through an iterative process I see both tracks being able to continue uh simultaneously or concurrently I guess I get concerned Dan where it seems like today only one of those tracks uh is continuing um and the one you mentioned the kind of open door to figure out how to register is is not and I think that enforcement is not a very good Tool uh if it's not paired with a viable path uh to registration if you if you sue someone for failing to register um the court can't make them come in and register and the still not yet created registration regime that would be appropriate for uh for the activity um and you still have to pair it if you're going to do that you've got to pair it with a real Open Door um and a proactive and collaborative approach to permitting people to register uh and unfortunately I just as a factual matter we don't see that right there aren't there aren't a lot of people who are registered it's not a situation where there are multiple crypto asset Securities you know trading platforms that are registered and the SEC is going after the recalcitrant folks you know we have a situation where there are not yeah at least for retailers there's none about a register and I don't think that's for lack of trying because of time I just want to ask this one last question um representative Tom emmer and representative Darren Soto have introduced the Securities Clarity Act and it's based on um what they say is the fact that existing Securities Law does not distinguish between an asset and the Securities contract that it may have been a part of so for instance if a cryptocurrency initially was issued as part of a Securities contract but then later becomes fully decentralized then at that point it could fall under different classification such as a commodity and so the um Bill proposes that any asset that is sold as part of an investment contract could later be distinct from the Securities offering so I was curious first of all what you thought of that bill and then just generally um because we keep hearing from the crypto industry that they feel that the lack of clarity around regulations in the US is causing a lot of crypto entrepreneurs to leave and that they feel this is going to hurt American competitiveness generally I was curious you know if you first of all thought this bill was good um if you thought regulation uh was affecting American competitiveness and if you thought this bill would be a good step toward you know alleviating that this this is something this concept we talked about it with the oranges is a concept that uh I've actually been spending a lot more time recently on look looking into and and uh somewhat prompted by by the legislation as well so I haven't I haven't landed exactly yet where I am on this but uh it's there's a lot a lot going on there conceptually right now so it's an interesting concept that I haven't quite landed where I want to be on it yet yeah I guess I would say on the the latter half of your question Laura I I do think that um we have seen other jurisdictions take more proactive steps most notably Europe lately with with Micah to provide Clarity and provide kind of a regulatory scheme that is tailored you know to this asset class I won't speak to ever everything there is perfect I'm sure it's not um and a lot of that will have to get uh you know address for the technical standards those are so-called level 2 process over there um but I do think that as other jurisdictions move ahead with providing uh tailored regulations for this uh for this asset class uh if the U.S does not do that um I think the natural consequences people will go to wherever is legal certainty uh we've seen that time and time again across across history and I think that that history is likely to be repeated unless we are able to provide you know similar level of certainty here and Dan you know enfc was competitiveness well I think I I obviously uh uh very much pro pro our markets and um we we have as I mentioned we have this the strongest markets um I I want to see us move forward I want to see um us have a compliant fully regulatory regulated market where people can trade in the US and the technology development continues uh to occur here in the U.S um so we have but we have to protect our markets and the reason we have the best and the strongest markets is because the robustness of our investor protections people put money into U.S markets because of of the robustness and the legal certainty that they'll get they'll get a fair deal in our markets you may when you may lose you're not going to get cheated out of your money and then and and and and both in the security side and the commodity side even if the intermediary that you give your money to blows up okay we've got systems that you can get your money even if your intermediary blows up and so people we we have these various really strong Market protections and investors come here we're still going to be the strongest Market in the world I don't want to see us lose competitively but we have to ensure that we maintain the level of Integrity of our markets keep an eye on what the Europeans and what they're doing but we've also seen uh you know one of the reasons we deregulated the swaps Market in 2000 was because the we were concerned about losing competitiveness over there that was one of the arguments we've heard these arguments before legal certainty competitiveness we got to keep up with them we've changed our regulations so we deregulated the whole swaps Market uh of those are two significant reasons and that blew up on us later so yeah let's protect our markets but let's also be competitive and let's let's work together to keep the process going forward all sides have to work go forward the Regulatory Agencies have to work with the industry the industry has to work with the Regulatory Agencies and will continue to have the best markets in the world great where can people learn more about each of you and your work I've got plenty
