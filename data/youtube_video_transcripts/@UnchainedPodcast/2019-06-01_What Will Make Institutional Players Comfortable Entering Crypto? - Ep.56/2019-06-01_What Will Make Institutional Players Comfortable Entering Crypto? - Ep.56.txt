hi everyone this is a special episode of a panel on infrastructure in the crypto space from the time summit a bridge alternatives event I had a fascinating chat with Kavon puris Thani director of institutional sales at G Dax Tim McCourt cm e groups managing director and global head of equity products and alternative investments Michael Moro CEO of Genesis trading in Genesis capital and Hugh Liang founder and CEO of Omni X we discussed what if researcher tools need to be built to get institutional players comfortable with the space how custody a digital asset differs from custody a traditional asset why they can see institutional players dealing in stable coins and trading on decentralized exchanges at some point in the future and what needs to be built out in terms of trading infrastructure for institutional players thank you - times of it for a great event and enjoy the show on may 11th and 12th some of the most interesting humans from around the globe will come together in Brooklyn for the ethereal summon hosted by consensus to collaborate on building the decentralized future to register and receive 10% off go to ethereal summit comm and enter the code unchained 10 this episode is brought to you by quant stamp quant step is building the first smart contract security auditing protocol designed to secure all smart contracts and a cost-effective and scalable manner the technology is being developed by a team of PhDs with over 500 Google Scholar citations to learn more a requesting on it visit WWE and calm infrastructure I'm Laura Shin I'm the host of two crypto podcasts Unchained and unconfirmed and joining me on stage are Katelyn Paris tawny director of institutional sales with G Jax Tim McCourt of CME managing director that's eme a Michael Mauro CEO of Genesis trading and who Liang who was formerly of State Street and is now CEO of Omni X so why don't we start by having each of you just describe briefly what it is that you do and what your company does all right sure so my name is Kevin Pierce Donnie I represent the institutional business of coinbase based in New York City I've been with firm about nine ten months before coinbase I had a career on the sell side in the equity derivatives space I've got a computer science background I've been investing in Bitcoin since 2013 so quick I guess a quick snapshot on who coinbase is and what we do within the crypto ecosystem so as most of you are probably aware coinbase was born in 2012 around the time that Bitcoin was going from being that hobbyist type thing that Olaf mentioned earlier hobbyist I placing into enjoying a broader widespread retail adoption so Brian Armstrong the CEO of coinbase created coinbase to make a platform to make it as easy as possible for anyone expert and laymen alike to easily buy and sell Bitcoin and to safely store it in our third party hosted wallet we then in 2015 around the time the family offices high-net-worth investors and prop trading firms were starting to trade crypto crypto assets and higher volumes we launched a platform called G tax which is exclusively focused on institutional investors that and professional traders and then at the end of last year as the importance of custody to the crypt of ecosystem became apparent coinbase announced a new product called coin based custody and I'm pleased to say that as early as next week we'll be rolling out coinbase custody to the first set of customers so that suit coinbase is broadly in terms of our products and services in terms of the role we play within the crypto ecosystem most people think of coin as that so-called on-ramps business from traditional finance or fiat currencies into the world of crypto finance or what we like to call finance 2.0 and it's true that a lot of coin bases business today revolves around these unranked type offerings but ultimately this is not what coin base is as a company coin base is broader mission as a crypto first company is to identify the best crypto technologies and applications available in the world today to foster their development and then to bring them to as many people as possible to create a more open financial system and this includes technologies such as identity on the blockchain stable coins decentralized exchanges and relays and so on these are all things that the folks in headquarters in San Francisco are looking at great Tim Tim McCourt global head of equity index excuse me an alternative investment products at seme group I didn't see me for about five years my background prior to that I was an equity index trader for about 13 years and what we did see me with respect to being the the world's largest you know derivatives exchange and operating on futures and options on futures exchange where we fit in with respect to the cryptocurrency really goes back to 2016 when we first announced the launch of the Bitcoin reference rate which is a reference rate that tracks the aggregate US dollar value of one Bitcoin and we kind of talked a little bit about that later but that was launched in November of 2016 and then most recently in December of 2017 we launched a Bitcoin futures based on that reference rate and we operated in the same way as a lot of our other futures products where we operate the central marketplace it's essentially a clearing product it's regulated and in terms of offering that US dollar financial contract on the Bitcoin reference rate to the ecosystem I think how I would describe see me groups role currently as the financial industry and the broader marketplace is looking to risk manage those risks associated with Bitcoin is we're bringing a certain amount of familiarity to the Bitcoin or cryptocurrency risk management in the way of offering a futures product that looks and feels and operates a lot like the other products but just now tracks a new and unique underlying asset called Bitcoin Michael Michael more on this CEO of Genesis trading which is a new york-based SEC and FINRA registered broker-dealer and one of the largest over-the-counter market makers in the cryptocurrency space we started market making in 2013 and so we can consider us the on-ramp off-ramp broker dealer for hedge funds and other institutional accounts as they look to gain exposure to Bitcoin separately in earlier this year we launched a business called Genesis Capital over the years it's sort of become apparent it's always been apparent I suppose of the need for borrow on crypto currencies whether it be to to hedge exposure on on the markets that the other features that are sort of traded at the CME or they're playing in the options market they maybe they play in the public equities under the gbtc or they're just bearish on Bitcoin in general or looking to kind of short it we created Genesis Capital which is an institutional lending business that provides our crypto burrow to institutions that are looking for either working capital or to hedge their risks around Jan around digital currencies since we launched that business in February of this year and so it's only been a few months kind of up and running but reception has been very strong and we believe very very strongly in that even though at it's at our core we are bullish on the cryptocurrency sector two-way price discovery is of essence of abutments importance as the class grows up and I think it's important for folks to express the other side of the trade should they want to permanently or at least temporarily and I think that's what Genesis capo is willing to do good morning everyone my name is Hugh Leung so as Lori said six months ago I was the senior managing director a state street running after his emerging technology center and now I'm the founder of a new startup called Omni X we are we like to think of ourselves as the first large-scale institutionally focused investment and trading platform for crypto assets notice I didn't say crypto currencies and I'll come back to that some other point but I didn't start my life within State Street and I'm not a banker by training in early 2000s I was one of the earliest people at a Silicon Valley star called Kern X some of you guys here actually probably know that company so we're at that time was the first company to create this large-scale multi bank electronic platform for currencies for the institutional space replacing telephones electronic multi bank discovery as the prime brokers shifted into the FX PV business we shifted our technology to really keep up with the active and high frequency trading shops so we became the largest high frequency routing mechanism for currencies every investment bank every chikage high frequency guy was on board by middle of 2000 we were routing about 50-60 billion per day and State Street acquired us in 2007 so I've been in State Street for the last 10 years I ran a bunch of electronic business for the u.s. I ran all the asia-pacific electronic platforms business and I started this emerging technology center three years ago until I left six months ago so during that time we explored a lot about blockchain and crypto and within the last year or so so many of Stacie's clients have been coming to us particularly the lab asking about what is crypto you know is it the blockchain technology is that a new asset class if I want to put a huge amount of pension or acid into it how do i custody and how do i trade it i mean these are big big institutions right guys like wellington that just came out a few months ago talking about it and what i realized is there isn't such a platform right crypto is an industry or a phenomenon that really started from the retail side and institutional side are playing catch-up so what i'm doing is taking the experience that i had the last 15 years in terms of a start-up financial service startup all the way to institutional finance and creating this platform that connects all the different venues together so we're not a market maker we're not an exchange we're not a custodian we're not a fund administrator but we're launching the platform in about a month we're connected to hopefully all the places that are that are on the panel right now great so Olek was talking about the infrastructure of web 3.0 which is quite a different thing from the kind of infrastructure we're gonna be discussing on this panel as you can see here on this panel we've got kind of a range of people who are hurt kind of a little bit more on the crypto side and then others that really come more from Wall Street and we're talking about sort of the infrastructure that needs to be built to bring those two worlds together so I just want to get kind of the big picture from you guys where would you say the state of infrastructure is currently any you know any of you can cough have you started at midnight I think the institutional infrastructure for access to whether it's blockchain or crypto as an asset class really is non-existent at this point right some people I think two three years ago have said blockchain and crypto is like the Internet of the 90s it is absolutely not the Internet of the 90s is about the 70s or the 80s at earliest and and we do have this divide between what people think as crypto currencies and bitcoins the decentralization that is going to completely get rid of our centralized way of doing things - what the pension funds the asset managers large hedge funds like you guys think that you can do with crypto whether it's a technology or an investment but I think in the last year or so there's been a huge change in the landscape and really building that infrastructure whether it's institutional exchanges like G Dax see me getting in people like my company coming out with the background of building that and of course you know guys like Genesis has been there forever there's lots of these things are being built right now it's not gonna happen overnight right so the question about is is gonna change the world right now no it is not but it is looking into that windshield rather than the Robo mirror you know I think for crypto to be considered a mature asset class there's three key infrastructural requirements that need to be met the first is trading venues I think judging by the dozens if not hundreds of crypto exchanges around the world today that we've made good progress there although still work to do the second requirement infrastructurally is with regard to custody although although as I just mentioned coinbase has a recently announced custody offering there's a few other services available today this is not a mature developed space and there are many institutional investors out there that don't feel comfortable with the quality and development of the custody offerings out there today and then the third bucket of infrastructure requirements I think any asset class needs is something I'll broadly call prime services and that includes things that Mike mentioned earlier like the ability to borrow and lend crypto asset ability to short it but also crucially the ability to trade it in a manner that's decoupled from the point of custom that's simply not possible today so trading venues I think we're well on our way custody is very much a work in progress and Prime Services is something that we simply need to build coinbase is working hard on that problem in particular and I'm hopeful that over the next few months you'll see some announcements from us about the work we're doing in the prime services space yeah excuse many things that I would add is when we look at the kind of the infrastructure question I think where we see it in the broader either whether we're looking at like the transactional handshake or how people are managing risk or how people are accessing exposure to cryptocurrencies or critical assets versus Bitcoin is that it is a high degree of interest there is a lot of fever around it there's a lot of attention but there's also corresponding a lot of unfamiliarity with what do i do how do i access this this is new this is nascent technology you know these are these are phrases that you hear people talking about and what they're really talking about too is I'm not quite sure how my existing infrastructure plugs and plays with this new unique technology offering and thing that has developed over the last few years so from CME's perspective when we first launched the Bitcoin reference raid back in 2016 there was this upwelling of interest from customers we look to kind of demand driven and customer driven innovation at CME and then we were getting a lot of questions of well you know what are we how do I do this how do I access this how do I trade this and that's what really steered our product development to offering the US dollar financially settled contract you know because we could actually provide exposure to Bitcoin in a way that plugged and played with existing infrastructure in terms of it being a financially settled contract against an index or a reference rate in terms of how it operates through the Machine of how it gets cleared it is no different than a future on the S&P 500 the Nasdaq the russell 2000 the dow etc it really works through the machine the same way it's an arithmetic computation exchanging payments were laid related to this reference rate so that's something I think that we thought about where the infrastructure isn't quite there and that was one of the strong pulls or demands from customers about why people wanted a future on Bitcoin at me in addition to things like being a regulated marketplace but it just it worked with the way they risk managed there are other risks and contracts so Genesis started in 2013 and here we are in 2018 and the fact that there is a conference like this with all of you in attendance with the CME trading a futures contract that that is such a massive leap and bound movement from where we've sort of started in 2013 to kind of where we are now so clearly we're headed in the right direction in terms of making this asset class have the look and feel of it being a truly institutional experience that's step one step two ultimately is and I'll add to one of the other things what you see in more matured markets is kind of the regulated ETF and sort of an easy way in the public equity market to be with the access a Bitcoin ETF obviously the SEC has expressed its view in terms of the rejections of the few of the ETFs that filed throughout 2017 personally I don't believe that we'll see anything this year perhaps next year I'm thinking probably sort of 2020 ultimately kind of timeframe but part of that is rules and regs who regulates crypto is there a bifurcation between SEC regulating tokens and crypto currencies belonging to the CFTC and we finally get a federal regulator as opposed kind of a steep bi-state thing that we're dealing with at present and ultimately the formation of SROs could there be an industry-wide effort to create a self regulatory body to oversee make sure market manipulation and things like that aren't ultimately happening at the exchange level which will give the SEC comfort that retail a product that is accessible to retail in an ETF is ready the challenge of course is that bitcoin is global and CRO and cross jurisdictional II can you do a global SRO or if it's just the US is that good enough for the SEC if miss whatever thirty forty fifty percent of the overall spot market is that still good enough for the SEC and give them enough comfort to know that they have enough of a surveillance into it those are all things that ultimately need to happen before we kind of reach the true institutions obviously I'm sure at some point Hugh's former employer and State Street's and the BNY Mellon zand and the Fidelity's will figure out and try to figure out their way and that could be kind of a last step ultimately to the true institutionalization of the asset class infrastructure wise we're still early but we've come a long way and I'm incredibly excited about the direction of all of this is ultimately heading and I also wanted to reference what the differences between custody a digital asset versus cussing a traditional one I think a lot of people in this room have been getting a primer on how this technology works but I think just like drawing out that difference right now for people so they understand kind of what the what the challenges are would be great and what's it sure I'll start I'll start with that so custody a traditional financial asset and given the vast majority of financial assets or what's called instrument registered as opposed to bearer assets it's fairly simple you have a third party trusted a source they record the title for the ownership of an asset in a ledger and that's made publicly available to the market custody a digital asset is much harder because effectively what you're doing there is securely storing a secret and as we've seen time and time again storing secrets particularly in the digital domain given the headlines we see every day about data breaches is really really hard to do and who else wants to talk about that a little bit look I would monitor gratis electro engineering my first job was programming and programming and IBM Research Lab and one of that first project was around multi-factor authentication and smart car authentication and public key cryptography so any of you guys here are familiar with technology side of things everything blockchain crypto is based fundamentally on public key cryptography and the custody of a crypto asset is nothing more than Kavon alluded to is just storing of that private key it's a bearer asset whoever has the password or the mechanism to unlock that private key now owns all the assets associated with the account there so really you're just talking about storing secrets and whichever company holds out that secret is the the attack front and everybody wants to go after it so it is the technology play but a big bunch of that is actually around you know compliance and surveillance and and and just procedures around it when you hear about cold storage that's nothing really more than a computer storing that secret that's not connected to the Internet so you have to have a person who you know puts a little flob in there and grab that key out but I think a lot of ways we talk about custody around is still thinking about a very traditional way like how do we protect a secret like if we slow this if we slow the process of retrieving that then we think it's more secure we keep it offline we think it's more secure but there's a largely a lot of technology companies out there figuring out ways to decentralize ways of storing a secret so it's almost using like the concept of a crypto and a decentralized environment to change custody now is any of that gonna play into this institutional finance stuff that we're talking about now I don't think so I mean those are ten twenty years down the road type stuff but immediately it is gonna be someone like a coin base and a G Dax offering a more institutional like system and ultimately someone like a State Street a fidelity a bony one of these guys really coming in and putting their you know putting their name behind it to hold that asset for you but we're not that far from that I don't think I have a question about that because in this world where everyone is saying that the reason that something like Bitcoin is so powerful is because it's trustless meaning that you don't have to trust a third party here we are talking about these companies that you would eventually trust to do the custody and we already see this fissure in the crypto space where there are certain people who say oh you should always hold your private keys you should never trust anybody to do them for you and then other people as you can see from the millions of users that coinbase are plenty happy dad trusts other people to manage their private keys and I also even interviewed Mike belshi of Victo which recently acquired one of the qualified Christina since because I think it might be the first one to be a qualified coaster named digital ad sets but they purchased Kingdom Trust which is this qualified custodian I asked him how it worked and he was like oh well you know within the company there's different teams that no pieces of the private key but nobody knows who everybody is on on this team not even me and so it's just kind of interesting to hear him say okay we're all within the same company but not everybody even knows who who holds all the pieces to these keys so can you talk a little bit about the philosophical differences and how that plays into the choices you might make and how to custody digital assets that one for a second so I think the beauty of Bitcoin is that gives the option to hold your own private key to kind of control your own funds whether you choose to exercise that option is entirely kind of up to the individual so my own crypto holdings yes I would hold the private keys to all of the crypto holdings that I personally have separately though at the institutional level for this audience there's this concept of how institutions are not allowed to self custody the assets that they've invested in so there's a concept of a qualified custodian which kind of plays into the bit go and then Kingdom trust but they have to pick a third-party service provider to ultimately hold the crypto assets that the out that their limited partners of ultimately kind of invested into so it legally if they're supposed are they're forced to have to trust a third party it's who the best of the the custodians that are sort of available out there frankly the institutions that we speak to it's all liability right they don't want to hold the private key for god forbid they lose it or it gets destroyed there isn't a forgot password button in Bitcoin it's gone the assets are gone forever and so in that kind of setting would you rather trust yourself and your IT team or would you rather trust a professional whose business it is to ultimately kind of guard that secret but you know it's a question it's an open question for me as to whether or not the the Wellington's of the world are going to get comfortable with the coin based kind of the solution or they really are waiting for the the state streets and the BNY Mellon to kind of enter the space because no technologists would promise you that they're hack proof right it's not like state streets gonna build something that is ultimately more secure than what coin based custody product is from a technological perspective but it's that you think there's more capital behind State Street and so if they're hacked that they'll somehow provide the the self insurance around the assets that they'll make the accounts whole should they be hacked by a third party so ultimately is that a combination of the the coin based custody like product with an insurance wrap from a third party provider that sort of guards against thefts that will get the industry over the hump or are they truly waiting for the historical custodians to kind of ultimately step in play but that may be years from now I don't have a sense of timing for when that ultimately may happen but it's it's it's so the opportunity and kind of the risk reward is what's available today what are the best available products and services that are available today and kind of go with it or wait for for the industry to be much more mature in three years when the other guys kind of enter this space but then ultimately maybe the upside on the price appreciations gone by then so it's it's it's it's a it's a give and take as to what you're ultimately kind of looking for you know oh I had a little - that - is a lot of time when we talk about something new like this but everybody the industry think of is something mutually exclusive you're either decentralized or you're centralized one of those are gonna win right you either have a perfect solution like a stay straight coming in or I won't go in it never rarely works like that in any of these area right we are gonna have semi centralized system versus decentralized system and the solutions that we have right now in terms of custody or trading or all kinds of stuff it's not perfect but it's it is very workable so in terms of our client segment we have people that are absolute crypto funds right people that are 25 years old who's raised 50 million dollars and they go out do this and they're perfectly happy we're storing this on a floppy drive I'm walking around with it and then you have people that are quantitative hedge funds which it can carve out a separate piece at 150 million bucks and they can do this on their own cold storage and then you have the bigger bigger guys who are just saying oh you know I'm not quite ready I want to learn what's available before I dive in so this Lucian's are not perfect but they're absolutely available today for the institutions to get into this market and I think that one thing that I would add is that I don't think this is just kind of a you know an either/or question all right you know in terms of what is the custodians custodial solution I think when you think about is what are the implications of getting custody correct for the ecosystem and that's where when you think about other financial markets other liquidity pools that exist other products that are out there is from our perspective it's very important to be supportive of this symbiotic relationship between things like the spot market in the futures market or the OTC or how miners are interacting with pure financial speculating firms that are just looking to trade and custody I think is something that will help with that interrelatedness it will help with that increased efficiency because it will allow other mechanisms whether it be things like a FPS or swaps or transfers or delivery these will become more and more important as the ecosystem continues to grow and I think that's also where it's not just a how do I store my my Bitcoin now it's I think how did the question that we also need to be mindful of and be challenging ourselves to answer correctly is what does this mean for the next iterative step in the development of the velocity or the transactional handshakes that exist in the Bitcoin or crit so asset ecosystem the ethereal summit hosted by consensus is anything but your average blockchain conference join builders philosophers policymakers artists and humanitarians from around the world on May 11th and 12th at the knock-down Center in Brooklyn for two days of storytelling and knowledge sharing around how we can build our decentralized future together using blockchain technology no sitting around and listening to boring presentations come participate experience and have a blast with folks like Joe Lubin amber ball det Michael Casey and thousands more to register and receive a 10% discount go to ethereal summit dot-com and enter the code unchained 10 founded in the aftermath of the dow hack quant stamp is building the first smart contract security auditing protocol designed to secure all smart contracts in a cost-effective and scalable manner relying on humans to audit smart contracts is expensive and error-prone and with the exploding growth of smart contracts that solution just scale the team at Kuan stamp is developing a solution to audit smart contracts on the etherium network in an automated and decentralized way that can scale with the growing demand being built by a team of PhDs who collectively have over 500 Google Scholar citations quant stamp is paving the way for safer and more reliable smart contracts that will power the decentralized world to learn more or request an audit visit WWF comm and how do these custody solutions prevent against and malicious employing kind of you know a tampering in some fashion or stealing these funds yeah maybe I'll take a stab at that so at coinbase we emphasize that custody is much more than a technical or engineering solution although we think that's a key foundational layer it's also about people and process and culture so coinbase ever since we you know came to market in 2012 we've been storing crypto assets for all our customers probably had the greatest scale in the world today with custody more than 20 billion dollars in crypto assets for both our retail and institutional customers and we have more than 20 million customers on our platform globally so it's something we've been doing well and to answer your question about you know what it means to prevent insider attacks and that kind of thing you embed thinking about distributed security within your organization within how you think about hiring people to make sure there are no single points of failure and additional redundant layers where whenever your engineering a system you assume that other systems adjacent to it that can touch it or talk to it I've already been compromised and you organize you design that module with the assumption that anything is talking to you may not be trusted and so layers of security upon layers of security pervade our engineering culture and is that something that can be easily scaled or is I mean you know I not that I mean obviously coinbase is quite thick for this base but if we're talking about Wall Street coming and that's a really different ballgame yeah I wouldn't say it's easy to scale in fact the one thing that we've learned in the many years that we've been doing custody is that scaling cuts the B in terms of number of investors being in terms of the amount of assets we're being in terms of the number of assets you support and the engineering and Payman trail is required to hook into those different block chains that stuff is really hard and our security team if I had to point to sort of the core secret sauce of what makes coinbase special and what makes us different from any other platform provider in the crypto space is that we have that core security knowledge around crypto which is not easy to replicate yeah well actually that goes back to my previous question she was about the difference between custom a traditional asset versus a digital asset then even within digital assets what are all the things that you need to factor in when you're trying to figure out how to custody because I imagine custody I don't know I'm gonna make this up like the ether is different from many around or something that's right I'll give you an example so some other custody offerings on the market today rely on what's called multi seek technology to require a three-way agreement between the parties involved to process of withdrawal transaction that's not the model we use and one of the reasons for that is that multi-sig the cryptography cryptography behind it is actually natively built in to the blockchain in the underlying crypto currency so if the underlying crypto currency doesn't support multi-sig transactions you will not be able to put that on a multi-sig base custody platform and so the approach we've taken is to rather than using multi sic technology which won't necessarily scale across many many assets we're using what's called Samir's secret sharing which is a way of sharding the private keys associated with a private sharding the pieces of the private key and distributing it to multiple third parties to achieve the same outcome which is requiring the agreement of multiple parties before handing withdrawal can be made but doing so in a much more scalable fashion so only our custome is a really big issue and there's plenty of other things and infrastructure to talk about let's talk about trading infrastructure where are we now and what needs to be done that one there yeah the trading side it the one thing I'll add a little bit of that to the custody side right so some lot of people think that trading always involves custody because bitcoin is about storing that coin when you do a transaction it has to hit the blockchain but I do want to point out that a lot of institutional trading and a lot of institutional trading that's already happening right now is not written to the blockchain every single time you do the transaction right I mean correct me if I'm wrong came on a lot of the trading that happens within G Dax our central limit order book type transactions that don't involve the blockchain until you move the money in and out of G Dax and a lot of the trading that happened intraday on the on the Genesis platform do not get settled until you're ready to go and settle that right and then the CM EPS it just is in cash deliver at that product right so a lot of the trading that's happening today that adds to the aggregate volume do not need to hit the blockchain every single time because it's just not really efficient but in terms of the trading platform I mean as I said earlier right this is an asset class that we believe started from the retail space and as a retail individual you're okay with tracking your portfolio on a spreadsheet you're okay and logging into four or five different screens and actually just hidden those buttons and doing whatever it is but when it comes to the institutional side that is not the case so you know we were hugely surprised when we started talking to funds and stuff and and the biggest competitor that we have really is Microsoft its Excel and it's Google it's Google sheets that's what people are using for for a four account management and that's what they're using portfolio management and you know people are forced to sort of build a technology team to connect to a lot of different places and the other thing to recognize too is that most of these exchanges that we're talking about are not traditional exchanges so they're using very different API than what a Goldmann would provide you right what a fixed API will provide you so in order for an investment fund to be able to access the pool of liquidity that is electronic or the voice liquidity that are being priced over OTC desk it's hugely cumbersome so what we're trying to do is basically take this asset class fit it into something that you already recognized now if you currently use Charles River for your OMS you're going to be very familiar to the things that we use if you currently use various different EMS systems we have the EMS system built in so that you can take this and truly treat it as an asset class you don't have to believe that 30 years from now the centralized government is gone right you need to use this because you have a multi asset class portfolio this gives you an uncorrelated return characteristic and you just want to own it because it has appreciation value and we give you the platform for that so I think you know that's what we're trying to do right make this seem like a real asset class and make the access to all the different marketplaces or endpoints whether it's custodian fund accounting liquidity easier so think of us is just you know we're the superhighway with the plumbing or the picks and shovels that gets you access to all these gentlemen here yet to his point it's all about us adapting the crypto space to meet the needs of the institutional investor as opposed to expecting institutional investors change the way they operate or changing their platforms to plug in to us so to give you a few more examples you know one thing that GDX our exchange supports and has supported for many years there's a fixed protocol which many higher velocity traders use another thing we're going to be rolling out in the near future is OTC block trading services with manned by a live execution services desk based in New York City why because that's what a lot of institutional investors want so what we're doing at coin base is meeting institutional investors on their terms rather than on ours and I think that when we're looking at the transactional infrastructure you know kind of like I was saying before like one of our central tenets for design the product was to make sure worked and felt like every other futures contract that's just one element of the transactional handshake when you think about the other transactional infrastructure that we are responsible for as an exchange operator it's bringing together the network of customers that we currently have to actually create the liquid efficient transparent price discovery that people expect of a futures contract and that's something that we thought was very important for something like Bitcoin futures when we were moving into it and why we kind of you know we're listening to customers in that kind of you know one-year run-up between the amounts of the reference rate and then the launch of the future but because we wanted to make sure we had that balanced transactional pool between customer segments you have natural transaction participants or whether they're miners or they've accumulated Bitcoin on spot transactions that's why I'm coin base they may have a risk perspective where they just want to be speculative and say they want to trade the volatility of the asset class and then in the middle you have these people who want to use future there's a primary access vehicle because they want to either trade are in regulated exchange or they want to avoid some of the kind of infrastructure complications we're talking about here in transacting spot Bitcoin or mining Bitcoin so when you put all those together that's also very important in terms of the transactional infrastructure because you need that balanced participation for the market to trade for the market to move for the market to absorb volume on outside days like yesterday we actually a record in Bitcoin futures we were trade a little bit over 5,200 contracts or almost 26,000 Bitcoin the fact that you know the average is only about 2200 outside of yesterday that the market has to be ready to almost do a 2x or 3x volume with very little notice and that's something as the exchange operator it's also making sure that the transactional ecosystem or the marketplace that people are operating in is built efficiently to handle that and they trust the rules of the road so that's why we still have risk safeguards we have clearing safeguards we have credit controls all these things around the transactional handshake are also having equally important to make sure that when people want to trade or when people need to trade they can do so in efficient and a forecast Bowl manner from a liquidity perspective I mean there's dozens of exchanges globally and and some people argue that's good because it creates arbitrage opportunities but in a different way you have to pre-fund every single one of them fiat and crypto to be able to kind of trade it and well while crypto is relatively easy to kind of move from exchange to exchange moving Fiat around between them that's a challenge and so even though there's venues of liquidity it's not sort of readily accessible at any time and so not only can you not take advantage of just ARB opportunities that kind of exists but that liquidity may be two days away because you got a fund there's a swift wire and it may take 48 hours before you can ultimately kind of get it there so from an infrastructure perspective I think will kind of get to a point where you don't necessarily need to maintain a fund at every single one of them to ultimately kind of be able to trade on them and and and otherwise it's the assets and and and our two sort of siloed at each of these exchanges and it's difficult to ultimately kind of trade and access that level of global liquidity separately there's kind of a settlements problem because there is no DTC in in crypto especially sort of on the over-the-counter side which is which is my market someone has to act first there isn't sort of the DVP type of settlement that you'll see in other markets and so for for Genesis its counterparties have to we agree to a trade counterparties have to send us the wire and then we send them the Bitcoin so the counterparties have to trust Genesis that once we receive the wire that they get the crypto but the bigger risk obviously is that the counterparty does a trade and because bitcoin is so volatile the default and don't send you the wire because the price moved and so the sort of settlement counterparty risk that exists in the OTC market which is just a risk that's kind of inherent in this current business model and kind of ultimately where we are whether or not there is sort of a clearinghouse that will be formed in the future that is independent of the OTC kind of liquidity venues that will help to settle the transactions or there's a newer version of the escort service maybe there's a smart contract solution via stable coin where things can ultimately gotta get settled in a much more efficient trustless kind of way but we are in a world in which we're still talking our who moves first if Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are trying to do know T C trade and turn argue about who does the trade who sends them wire in first there really isn't sort of a good protocol and kind of system for kind of doing that in a third party can independent kind of way so I feel thing I stole them that that's coming or already here with listed futures I'll add it just real quickly on that too because you can tell by the way we're talking right this is really talking about how to trade this totally new asset class that we don't quite figure out what the future intrinsic value is yet but we're talking about it in a contact that's very traditional marketplace in a traditional financial environment so I think the to really is married together and then there are very real issues such as performance right we're currently obviously not at a high frequency trading level yet but exchanges are falling over anytime that the the volume or price is spiking and then so we got to protect that kind of stuff so I think all the exchanges are getting themself better at it and then you have guys like us coming in here so we our system is actually run in a data center in my five has just turned on last week but we also have a web infrastructure for non time-sensitive stuff that are privately tied together and you know one of our investors is jump trading and jump capital and these guys are already quietly being market makers both on the OTC side as well as electronically on the exchanges so the number of people that are involved right now solving it from a technology perspective and also from a liquidity perspective from a credit perspective and like a sodium perspective is is mind-boggling actually the number of existing institutions they're already working on those problems one question I wanted to ask about the liquidity issue that you mentioned Michael is you mentioned that some of the weights to resolve it might be using with something like a stable coin or maybe there might be an organization sort of you know for settlement what direction do you think things are going because if I look at sort of every on the action being the open source world everybody's always talking about stable coins and says Nina this is the future but I can see maybe from the Wall Street perspective that's something more like an organization that kind of follows a model that they're used to might be more appealing I just want to know if you see kind of the wind moving in one direction or another I think the the OTC market makers will ultimately get comfortable potentially with a stable coin solution there's certainly too many of them at this point in time and while they're all kind of interesting and kind of different in a way sort of a coin just simply peg to the dollar for the settlement crypto to crypto is certainly interesting the challenges are going to be will the banks ultimately kind of support it will a major bank be kind of standing behind our network of of banks being able to say okay this dollar of this coin that I have is good for $1 at any of your institutions so there's kind of redeem ability of the token visa V one of the banks ultimately at the institutional level that's that's certainly next level so USD settlement pur USD is probably going to be the way that most of the hedge funds and sort of the family offices will sort of buy and sell the cryptocurrency but because this thing is 24/7 the ability to be able to settle at 2:00 a.m. 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. when the banking hours are closed is the most important it's kind of an EO TC market and the own the only way to really kind of do this is if you have a tokenized version of the US dollar so that you can ultimately get comfortable that you're hedging off that price risk on the crypto side with the stable coin on the other side and there's lots of initiatives kind of underway to kind of help solve that problem but it's a way to have continuous settlement regardless of whether or not the banks are open is going to be one of the key factors that I think they drive this market forward well I also want to ask about that is the fact that these markets are 24/7 365 does that present any specific challenges in building out the training infrastructure because obviously that is not the case with traditional financial market yeah I can speak to that as we're an exchange operator keeping our matching engine running 24/7 365 who pointed out it's been a challenge for us as well as many other exchanges something I think we're getting a much better at particularly since since December when we had record high trading volumes we're also in the process of moving our core matching engine to a dedicated non cloud type model we'll have some more details on that later in the year but moves like that are going to increase the reliability and determinism of our exchange in a 24/7 365 context and I think it's a challenge right because even on the future side you know where we offer near 24 hours a day with the exception of Saturday and part of Sunday that that used to be I think sufficient for 24-hour access but when we're looking at Bitcoin kind of solving this weekend problem the exchanges present a unique issues for us to address whether from a risk management perspective or from a technology perspective simple things like how do we manage circuit breakers or price limits over the weekend or how do we recede prices on a Sunday afternoon because at the market the underlying market never closes which is a new paradigm for us to deal with but when you look then at some of the conversations are around well do we still need things like maintenance windows or trading halls throughout the day and the answer is yes because the trade off for us from the exchange perspective is those are critical for us to run clearing cycles introduce new products you know introduce patches to technology fixes so there's still a need for periods of discontinuity in the trading cycle that were that we're continuing to work through but I think one of the things that it for sure is unique and I think may challenge the broader financial industry going forward is if the underlying market never truly closes how does some of us react to make sure that we maintain that touch point and kind of that interrelatedness I was speaking to you before but the trade off will be the kind of tried and trusted approach to maintaining uptime and technology for continuity of trading some of those some of those areas are already being solved by people that are not on this panel that there are banks that are starting to work 24/7 there are things that are using non leverage ways of holding assets to essentially do the tri-party model probably moving to a four party model so that the two counterparties don't have to have the same banks going forward I think in the institutional space I don't I don't know if that's really that hugely important at the moment because people have their people needs to sleep still so the number of hedge funds that actually trade 24/7 is not bad is there not that many of them right so in terms of keeping the technology stable keeping everything working perfectly a five-minute downtime on a Saturday to refresh the system if you provide that as a term of service as an SLA and people understand it at least we haven't seen those kind of issues I think people care more about the stable the system being stable when it is up rather than you know needing it to do 24/7 I think if you need a 24/7 there are a lot of decentralized systems or a retail type exchanges that will keep that going for the institutional space I think we have some time to get into that it's not hamper the adoption rate so the other thing that everybody is talking about on the public side is to centralized exchanges I think we've hit on some of the big trends stable coins is one of them but decentralized exchange is definitely another that's where you can have a protocol where exchange can be done in a peer-to-peer fashion you can also put more centralized services on those that run order books and do some matching or enabled people to to see orders and take certain orders so do you receive this kind of technology being used by more traditional players or do you or even other kinds of technologies that are being talked about in the decentralized world like atomic swaps yeah I think the answer is absolutely and it coinbase were actually pretty excited about the possibilities created by decentralized exchanges in relays as an as a centralized exchange operator we frequently get asked the question do we view these as a threat or somehow replacing or competing with our centralized exchange the answer is no we think the cryptocurrency space is diverse enough that you're going to have different types of customers with different needs so folks for which latency and velocity of trading is the most important thing to their business model will gravitate towards centralized exchanges like gix and folks that care more about the status of the custody of their assets and the security around movement of those assets and potentially confidentiality will gravitate towards relays and decentralized exchanges alright and I think do we have time for some questions okay great anybody have any questions so on your custody solution you're not goldman sachs you're not JP Morgan when are a real institutional quality prime broker custodian coming into the space yeah so Mike touched on this point earlier and I thought it was it was a really good point is that there's always going to be universe of more Conservancy institutional investors out there that regardless of the quality of your security or technology or team are simply not going to trust using you to custody on an institutional scale because you don't have a sufficiently large balance sheet and the brand name associated with that we think as Mike mentioned there's a few solutions to that one of the solutions that were exploring at coinbase is the idea of partnering with third party large insurance underwriters this is something that we already do to ensure the assets inside the hot wallet inside coinbase and so it's just a question of scaling that to cover more assets and getting a more under eye decapitate appetite on board we're also exploring other solutions but we recognize the need to have a large balance sheet underpinning a high quality institutional custody offer prime brokers coming into the space again you know high-quality prime brokers yeah this is something that we're looking at I think no no we're not but I'd argue that we have in many ways a greater sense of what crypto investors want we don't have the same balance sheet but from a technology and trading perspective I think we can potentially move faster than some of the larger slowing moving banks that said I think it is a matter of time before the larger investment banks do look at things like crypto prime brokerage and margin finance in the crypto space because they have massive balance sheets and great expertise around that so there's gonna be a sense of potentially a race to fill what's currently a really big gap in the market and may the best platforms win ultimately I think the space is going to be big enough that we're going to have a variety of platforms that are going to serve that need I think I think maybe one thing I would add though right because I think it's come up in some other panels and I think it's kind of percolating some questions here the one thing I would maybe just just add is that we have to challenge ourselves in the financial industry is to make sure that we're also not bringing a legacy bias to building this new marketplace and we also have to think we know we use the term institutional investor the thing to pay attention to is that definition is rapidly changing with respect to crypto assets you have the advent of crypto only hedge funds you have the migration of trading personnel from very established firms to starting up their own firms using what they've learned to in this new and kind of evolving landscape so I think that something we just need to be very mindful of is that this is changing and that we have to evolve with it we have to stay in front of it we can't use necessarily that that same approach that we've used historically and whether it's on the product innovation side or offering out products from funds and things like that and also I think I would just ask people to challenge themselves it's not necessarily whether or not I as the individual believe in something like Bitcoin it's about paying attention to what's going on around me and is this generational will this be different in five years from now will this be different in ten years from now and it's not about your personal belief it's about whether or not you can in an agnostic manner look at the ecosystem and come up with a thesis of where this is going and ask your ask yourself how do I add value to what is happening around me that's gonna say a little bit um to think that banks like Goldman or JP or City or State Street is actually going to start by saying hey I want to truly be innovative and I want to create this new solution to solve this market problem many of you I'm sure have been in banks and I have been in this one for the last ten year it doesn't happen right and part of that is nothing because they don't want it to happen here's the regulatory pressure and everything required to keep things safe so I think this is gonna come from the buy side right and some of these Christa's these crypto funds are very much on the Vanguard's of this but the size just isn't there right when you somebody is raising a hundred million dollars or two hundred million dollars to do this fund you can satisfy that with it existing infrastructures there's no need for the Goldman to get in but when you have a Wellington or some bigger one and with trillions of dollars and they really want to move into this market there's two problem one is the traditional financial service system we don't have this system yet but let's realize this is a four hundred billion dollar market cap the entire asset class somebody wants to move two hundred billion dollars into it that eats of one hundred percent of your bitcoins so a lot of things have to happen together let's not expect the banks to get in their next three months or six months or even a year right and you as a lot of the buy sides when you buy into this asset class and you feel like there's long term value and you want to hold it or trade it in you're multi-asset class portfolio pick up the phone call your banker that I think is a real driver and that's what made me want to leave say Street when I started hearing those kind of requests coming in from the clients knowing that my bank is not gonna be able to do that and I go and build that maybe as a as a follow-up I guess my question would be for you cave on what obviously you're not Goldman and you're you're not one of those entities but you have been the forefront of this industry for a long time so what are you doing to ensure that when you offer a custodian offering that you can protect the assets that you'll be that you'll be holding and so you don't have a balance sheet to back that up so besides the technology bill that you'll have what are you doing to make your clients comfortable yeah a number of things so we have the notion of qualified custody which is a legal designation that's a requirement for many large hedge fund investors in this space so there's an element of legal protection there but more broadly as I mentioned Laura earlier it's about people process and culture to pervade your engineering and your organization the people you hire to do that but ultimately as you alluded to like we can have the best-in-class for all of those things and large investors are not going to feel that's enough without a big balance sheet to backstop that so I really think that partnering with someone with a big balance sheet like third-party insurance or other arrangements is going to ultimately be the way to go to fully penetrate that custody space okay great I think that's tight and all the time we have for this panel so thank you so much [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
