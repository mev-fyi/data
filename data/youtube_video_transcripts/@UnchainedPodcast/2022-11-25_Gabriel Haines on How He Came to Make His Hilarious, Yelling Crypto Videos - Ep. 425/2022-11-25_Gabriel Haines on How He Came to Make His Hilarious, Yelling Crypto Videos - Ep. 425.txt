likes to call himself a crypto genius welcome Gabriel thank you for having me thank you for the title much appreciated well deserved if I might say yes for your videos in which you make funny commentary or say outrageous things about crypto in a distinctive mostly yelly voice can you yell something in that voice for people listening who can't see you and may not recognize your normal voice good morning I hope you didn't sell your coins today awesome so people love your goofy videos and I was curious how did you get started doing them yeah and it was a bit of a it was a very organic process I would say I started out my crypto Journey very early on I started making content about crypto mostly tutorials explanations about different D5 applications actually I'm wearing the sweatshirt if you can see it says yearn year two uh which is just commemorating the early people who worked on yearn and my name appears on this sweatshirt so I was very involved very early in like 2020 uh 2021 in D5 making tutorials explanations and doing a lot of interviews but actually then my daughter was born and I didn't have a lot of time to do any long-form content I don't have a time to sit down for an hour and have a conversation so it had to be a lot more condensed a lot more short form and I don't know if you have kids but when you have kids you don't sleep a lot and that contributes to a sort of psychosis maybe frustration so um I started to maybe vent a little bit express myself loudly on crypto Twitter and it kind of resonated with people and people really like liked it so I kept on doing it and yeah it's really just that's how we that's how we got here wait and so I'm so are you saying your First videos were about your lack of sleep or were they about crypto oh no they were I was just the tone was uh because of the lack of sleep I was yelling because I was not sleeping I was frustrated I need to you know get that out there but it was about crypto it was always about crypto um through the entire time just the style the tenor came from that particular emotional state that I was in and maybe continue to be and I got it and when was that exactly a year ago oh wow okay okay and so you said that you started by just making content about defy and stuff like that what did you do before I was um I was just making content even before that uh before crypto before I got into crypto I was doing a hummus review um so if you right now anyone who's listening type in chickpea challenge in Google and you will find a hummus eating competition hosted by my wife in which I'm competing to eat as much kumus as possible now I was living in Israel and I would go around to different kumu's places and review them like in the United States you have kind of like pizza places like a cultural fast food type in Israel in the Middle East you have hummus it's like fast food uh you know very quick you see you get it you go but I love hummus and I just and and there's not a lot of review there's not a lot of like uh breakdown of the whole environment so I would go to all these different places and you know just talk about them that was my very early days in uh content creation which I've been doing for now for about four years or so wow I love it I will have to check these out I had a famous road trip where it wasn't a road trip it was a like a backpacking trip in Europe with friends where somehow chickpeas favored uh or uh appeared uh they were they were a theme of the trip let's say anyway so for your current videos how do you come up with the ideas for them because they're kind of I mean they're really funny they're generally about crypto news but sometimes they're also about other things so I was curious how do you decide what you're gonna make a video about a lot of it is just uh reaction videos I'm scrolling on crypto Twitter often and I see something that just begs begs for a video to be made about it and yeah most of my videos I do in one take I don't write anything down I just kind of like just start talking maybe I have one or two words that I want to get in in that in a rant but yeah it's it's it's it's all about reaction I I think that my best stuff will come from you know seeing something outrageous going on and being even more outrageous you know in the in the way that I do what would you say are your most popular videos so far well I mean last week or uh yeah I think last week maybe a week and a half ago but the whole FTX drama was coming out and I actually had one video that was extremely popular a million views on Twitter actually that's the first time I've ever had anything any video of mine get a million views was I was talking about uh the orgies the or I don't know if there was orgies but maybe that I don't know but just kind of like talking about that and yeah I think that a lot of people are not willing to talk in that way and not willing to address these topics but I I think it's very fun and I do it in a funny way in kind of a lighthearted way that also like kind of gives gives a point of truth but also is entertaining and that was the one where you are shirtless and if I recall correctly you're wearing jeans and there's snow on the ground and you have like an ax and you are yelling about about this is that the one yeah almost I'm actually wearing a cool cat's pants which I'm wearing right now yeah I was wearing like sweatpants and not an ax it's a machete please I take my work very seriously so we need to get these things uh correct yeah yeah basically what you're describing I actually as a journalist I appreciate the fact check um I'd love to play a little clip of that terrible line and SBS having sex on those goddamn bean bags picture that in your mind disgust ing so you said you only do one take so do you set everything up yourself or do you have somebody videotaping you or like what equipment do you use and how professional of an operation is this um it's quite not professional my wife uh will off will sometimes uh film me but most of the time I just put my phone even on the floor just wherever it can be propped up actually the most recent piece of equipment that I purchased was a tripod for my phone and that's it I mean you don't you don't need anything I think that a lot of the reason also that the reason I do it this way is because I recognize that I'm not a good editor and I don't like spending a lot of time editing so if I'm able to present something that is just a scene and my voice and giving an idea that's the easiest way for me to convey my message with not a lot of production not a lot of help but just put up the phone press record say whatever it is and post no no need to to work to go crazy with any sort of edits or filters or whatever and I did see that you recently sold some of your videos as nfts before that had you ever made money from these videos or was it always just for fun yeah I mean before before selling no I mean when you get started in content I mean uh you know better than I do you've been doing this way longer than I have when you get started you're not making any money I mean you're not nobody cares about you like you're just out there yelling into account on your own but yeah I mean you can like just you can go back anyone can go back and look at my oldest videos on YouTube or Twitter or whatever there's like five views on them so yeah of course at that time I was not selling anything and yeah nfts have been a very interesting route usually what happens is that people will actually ask for me to Mint an nft I won't just go ahead and just take every video and mint it I just I want I'd like someone who wants like I'm not forcing it on anyone if someone wants to collect it and wants to support me that's awesome and I'm happy but most of the videos are just for fun like I'm just enjoying like I personally will go back and watch my videos and laugh like that sounds weird and narcissistic but I think it's funny I love it I love it I think if you find something funny then like for other people like it is sort of just gravy um all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the nfts and um kind of some other aspects of the videos which are super fun um but first a quick word from the sponsors to make this show possible defy saver is an all-in-one

like a crypto car not I wouldn't say started but you um obviously have been doing crypto content creation and I was curious with your experience with the nft sales like do you feel that this is kind of a good solution for creators like you I think it's a tool in the tool kit for sure an nft on its own is nothing it's just it's nothing I mean you you have to incorporate it under some brand you have to yeah you have to use it as part of you know your your creator toolbox being a crypto being someone who is in crypto and talks about crypto it's a very obvious fit for me to have nfts Right video nfts and as crypto grows and as you know the market the market cap continues to grow number go up then I think more and more people will be able to utilize this right now it's mostly a very it's a very Niche thing you know focused mostly on crypto creators you don't see a lot of people who are outside of crypto making nfts for obvious reasons very difficult but yeah I think it's super important and the nfts have been way more profitable than YouTube uh payments or even Twitter has like super followers those have been minuscule minuscule I mean it's maybe a hundred times more in in nfts so yes absolutely well not that the numbers of NF like not that the number of nft sales is Deepa level but it's you know it's something and that it feels good yeah I'm liking it I'm enjoying I like the nfts so you were saying that you go back and watch your own videos and they make you laugh and I you know for anybody who's followed you they have seen that some people have made comments about you or your body the fact that you do yoga you then will kind of clap back at them through videos and I was curious like how you felt about all that and if you were surprised by it or if you were hurt or if you thought it was just all in good fun or what to be oh I also want to say specifically that was big boy who'd said that I'm uh he was like are you I did some sort of yoga pose in one of my videos and the former yoga instructor so oh okay nice job on the crow pose thank you and he his reply was so weird it was like yoga's for girls or something like okay oh please please there's so many guys that do yoga I know tons of guys who do yoga well yeah and I was like and then the next video was like bit boy can you even touch your toes I don't think so right like so you know a lot of people feel like that you know they have an outlet to say I have uh you know I have a big belly man boobies whatever it is and listen I am I am overweight I mean I have uh I have a belly what am I gonna do about it um but I don't think there's any reason to be ashamed of it I mean you know if you go on Tick Tock right now or Twitter whatever you'll see a hundred guys with their shirts off most of them 99 of them have these abs like they're like uh Thor or something but you know that's just not realistic it's not like a real that's not a real person you know like there's very very few people that actually have that type of body but we see it on you know Tick Tock as if it's every single person so I think it's kind of interesting it's kind of funny like to put a guy who's like not in the best shape not it doesn't have like a six-pack abs or whatever shirtless like why not I mean it's just it's all part of the fun I would agree I would agree so your wife Lee Eller has gotten in on this and she's been posting funny videos of her own and I was curious how that all got started yeah Lee has been um she is an artist she's a musician an actress before we even met and she's been making she made songs many many years ago music videos so she knows about making content so it's not something that is foreign to her but yeah I I've just been making videos and she's always been supportive and she's always happy to tag along and do her own thing and join in on the fun so uh it's been awesome and I like that it gives a different perspective to the videos I make like you can see a guy in the snow with the machete yelling about something but then you see it from outside the window and my wife is talking about it it's kind of is very funny it gives like that alternate view which I think adds another dimension to the the universe uh of Gabe of the Haynes family if you will but yeah it's been awesome yeah between the two of you it gets very meta watching the videos it's super fun so we talked a little bit about how nfts could be beneficial for creators but your actual job is around web3 media and I was curious to hear a little bit more about that like what's your vision there how do you think web3 will change media what does it offer that people can't get on the traditional version of the internet yeah I mean there's a lot of empowerment in being able to be directly supported by your fans I mean just even a couple days ago I made a video about someone posted a tick tock video of SBF running down the street in the Bahamas and I very quickly you know made a kind of a reaction video to that someone asked and I'm and this is just a couple days ago someone asked Can you mint this can I collect this so I said sure I put up 10 nfts for 0.5 eth each and it's sold out within an hour okay now that's a few hundred dollars it's not I'm not gonna be rich from it but if you are a content creator um in any other industry you know outside of crypto if you're a chef if you're block whatever it is you're not going to be making a few hundred dollars from a video that you just made a couple hours ago it will be almost impo unless you have like you know sponsors or whatever you're not gonna get that support natively from any platform not tick tock not Twitter not YouTube nothing and the ability for fans who support my work to support me directly it feels really good and if you it gives me the confidence and the you know support to be able to keep on doing this because you know a few hundred dollars it could be today but it could be you know a couple years from now if I keep growing could be a million dollars for an nft why not um if someone sees the value so I really think that the future of web3 allows it is that connection between the creators and the audience and it's that direct no intermediary connection which is very powerful and which allows the market to actually decide who is bringing value and who is not not an algor an algorithm doesn't have to decide just individuals who find Value in what is being created awesome I love it as Creator myself I think there's a lot that web3 hopefully will bring to creators um so this episode will come out the day after Thanksgiving in the US I was wondering if there's any crypto related holiday message you want to give people buy turkey coin no I don't know um enjoy the time with family enjoy the time with friends
