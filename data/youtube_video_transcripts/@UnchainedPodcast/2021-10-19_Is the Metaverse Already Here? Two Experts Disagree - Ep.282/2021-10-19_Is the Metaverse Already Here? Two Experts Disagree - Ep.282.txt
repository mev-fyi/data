steinwald managing partner at spermian and john egan ceo of l'etelier bnp pariva welcome andrew and john bye laura thank you for having me laura so let's start by having each of you briefly describe your background in the space how you came to your current position and to be involved in nfts and the metaverse and andrew why don't we start with you yeah so essentially i first got involved with bitcoin in 2013 and i attempted a few uh blockchain related startups 2014 2016. those did not work out 2017 i launched a long short uh hedge fund that was focused on liquid crypto assets and then 2019 launched a fermion which is focused entirely on the nft asset class so that is my that is a you know very brief overview of of my my background okay and john i was a vc in london and around 2015 2016 we began to see more and more references within pitches to uh to blockchain and blockchain-based businesses and that was the initial exposure that i began to see and at the time i was i was cynical i think about a lot of it as well uh because we began to see then companies who were looking for 2 million in funding and vc funding doing an ico and raising 25 million when they couldn't get it off us so uh it was though at that point for me a personal experiment beginning to engage with the space and understand how how the mechanics have worked and my background is as an economist and i think from that point of view i found it a fascinating space moving forward i now run i'm the ceo of lutely at bmp probus a lot of what we focus on is emerging markets um and in particular over the last couple of years we've been looking at emerging digital markets and digital assets digital jobs um and our core focus has been on what we refer to as the virtual economy including including the metaverse so from our professional and personal point of view it has been a large part of my kind of daily constituency of work for the the the last six or seven years now um and various different uh various different degrees all right so we're going to now switch to our topic which is um kind of an interesting one because we often toss this word around metaverse but i don't know if people really have a good grasp on what that is if it even exists yet or if we're just working towards this or what's going on here so let's start with some definitions how would you define the metaverse and then let's also break that out into what you think the metaverse currently looks like or whatever its incarnation is and then where it's going so who wants to start andrew thank you thank you i appreciate that yeah so me and john always tease each other because it is it is such a hard term to define it's almost like seeing the internet it's very very broad but i try to simplify it as much as possible and what i you know i basically say the metaverse is just a virtual environment that people live work and play in i keep it very very simple high level and how it looks today is is um i think so for for me i think that we were we were able to kind of work inside the metaverse we were able to kind of live inside the metaverse and um you know via zoom you know by remote work and we were able to play into the metaverse through you know online gaming but really what's enabling it to come to fruition now is nfts which are just property rights because no one wants to live live inside of a virtual environment that they they cannot own their their their lives in their their their livelihoods their their you know their stuff and so for me i think that metaverse currently in its form is now just getting started because of nfts and i think that you know right now it's very very rudimentary it's it's only been out for let's call it two years max right um and it's it's it's all these things combined it's a little bit of open sea it's a little bit of zoom it's a little bit of facebook even unfortunately but um it's all these kind of things together and then and then where we're headed towards is a world where really the value paradigm is shifting from value extractive of users to value additive and that's the you know the metaverse that we're that we're working towards at you know at my firm but that's my definition i'm sure john is going to have something totally different so i'm i'm excited to hear yeah well actually before we go to that i do want to ask you like you keep saying zoom is part of the metaverse i've never thought that myself i'm on zoom a lot i never feel like i'm in the metaverse but you're saying that that is part of the metaverse i think that any sort of activity that we do online is is somewhat part of the metaverse i think that that so so communicating online you know that that is definitely part of the metaverse but in order to actually have the the quote unquote true metaverse the full vision you know that that you need you need property rights you need ownership of of your of your stuff inside the the digital world and yeah so so i it is a part of it it's not like obviously the main part um but as a way for people to communicate very easily so it is it is a important piece um but going forward it's going to be um you know all sorts of different platforms protocols products that allow people to really earn value from their activities online because right now it's it's we're not earning i'm not anything anything from using facebook i'm not earning anything from using google those platforms are extracting value for myself as a user and so where you know where we're headed is a internet or or you know a metaverse if you will where users are getting value in return for their activities online okay john what are your thoughts where i differ from from andrew is not necessarily philosophically but it's the timing of it so i don't believe the metaverse exists yet and i i don't believe that nfts are by definition a part of the metaverse and i don't believe that even web 3 is actually part of the metaverse i believe in the metaverse as this aspirational concept that we are working towards and in that way we can we can actually define a little bit more clearly because we can see it in the future i resent sometimes the ambiguity and the opacity that comes with many money definitions for this thing many different use cases for it from facebook's articulation of it which is murky and and loose and poorly constructed right through to people who use terms like metaversus as a plural term um so for me which is when you think about it that is a meaningful difference so when you have a panel and some people are talking about metaverses and some people are talking about them metaverse that is that is a vastly vastly different approach to everything we're looking to do so for me i hold it up as this aspirational concept that we're striving towards it is a dimension within which can exist endless and infinite creativity it is the the moment in time where we arrive as a species at a place where anything we can imagine can now be created within an immersive environment and i think those parameters are really important i think the metaverse necessitates a level of immersion now that immersion can come through that that pseudo-physical immersion in the sense of haptics and and vr and brain computer interfaces but it can also come in the digi physical landscape that you can interact with through lens wear so whether that's mixed reality contact lenses or mixed reality glassware i think that is absolutely essential for us to begin to say the metaverse is here i will however say that when that arrival when we do arrive at that point there will be a lot of derivative hybrids places that exist halfway between the internet as we know it now and the metaverse that are clearly reliant on are derivative to that construct but not necessarily part of it so and i'm sure we'll come to it but in my mind i've always had this kind of anecdote that i will look to and i will know that when this thing happens that's when we know conclusively the metaverse has arrived but for me now it's still an aspirational concept or construct okay so one quick thing i want to uh get out there is a disclosure that i do write a newsletter for facebook so if we're going to keep talking about facebook's uh memphis like you did mention you didn't like their murky definition as you called it but i i don't know what that definition is so what is that definition what do you not like about it well so i suppose that's you've just summed it up um i don't think anybody knows i think it's very very work orientated but when any vc will will tell you that about 10 years ago all of the decks that that came across their desk had the words ai in it and then a few years later they all had the word blockchain in it and recently they all have the word metaverse in it these are at this point this jargon that adds premium to proposals that's kind of a lot of where it exists in the investment space when facebook started talking about a metaverse they didn't explain what they were talking about aside from to say this is this is a work a labor-orientated environment that people can exist within and i'm sure over time facebook will expand on that greatly but right now there's very few people in this space who are not aware that facebook are actively speaking about the metaverse but there are also very few people in this space who understand what facebook are actually talking about when they refer to the metaverse and that is a that's a problem so when i said murky and ambiguous that's what i meant facebook have i've spoken about it at shareholder meetings they've spoken about it publicly but as yet it is not clearly defined and i haven't spoken to anybody who understands what they mean by it but it certainly makes it a more significant conversation when a company the size of facebook are talking about it and just for both of you actually from things that you were saying it made me wonder oh so then would you guys consider something like second life to be a metaverse because andrew kind of said oh metaverses don't exist until you have nfts and then john you were saying that you felt you know nothing it fits that definition out but and it needs to be immersive and something like second life it's pretty immersive as far as i understand so i was curious you know if you would consider something like that just not part of it at all or or what for me i think second life is the best in case example that has ever been created uh like as a preamble to the metaverse i i still think second life is extraordinary from a digital anthropology point of view it's an it's an incredible construct something i think will study for decades it's really an amazing achievement and the people who participate in that are certainly the people i think who are closest to achieving that because there are people who get up for work every day and they go to work in second life you know i know people who are second life entrepreneurs and they've bought their homes they've raised their families on the income they have employees within second life and they've been there for years as millionaires who have made their fortune in second life and i think that's a really important part of this this the paradigm is that people can go to work in this environment they can distill value and i'm going to pass it to andrew now because there's one very important consideration here philosophically is that for most of the the discussion about the metaverse since the 60s and william gibson through the 90s and stevenson and snow crashed through through contemporary time with ernst klein and ready player one is has always been centralized but what's happened in the last couple of years that's really important is that the conversations become about an open metaverse and i think that's probably a good place to hand this over to andrew because he is an authoritative voice on that distinction yeah so so i i think that uh i agree with what john was talking about about second life and how it is an extremely important uh platform that we can look at and say hey this is uh incredible that people were able to earn a living make friends socialize attend events basically live their full lives just on this platform and and john pointed out that that platform is centralized but but it is also very important just kind of you know historically but yeah basically my whole thesis is essentially that um we're headed towards that world where second life type of environments will be ubiquitous whether they be immersive whether it be through zoom or whatever it's really about having the ability of ownership and and the ability to earn and be able to you know pay your rent buy your groceries from your activities online and so so yeah i think that um the open metaverse is a concept that people uh it's basically a virtual environment virtual world that is that is uh that utilizes blockchain or distributed ledgers in some sense and that allows people to again own their stuff own their lives on their data on their whatever and that simple aspect about having ownership it what it does is it has a huge psychological impact on people because essentially they say okay now i feel secure in this environment so because i feel secure i'm confident and i'm going to spend even more time money and effort into this environment than it would if it was a centralized version and it's almost like i always use this analogy which i don't know if it's that good but i i say that like the internet today is communist in the sense that again we're adding value to the central entity and we're not getting anything in return uh but if you had the option to go add value to it to a capitalistic system where you know that the value is accruing to you know yourself and your family and your friends and whatever you'd much you know people would rather work and live in that environment and really the open metaverse and blockchain-based metaverson and and nfts are enabling that world so the internet is now uh enabling property rights through nfts and that's the biggest paradigm shift we've had since you know since forever and so you know each of you has a different take on kind of the current status of the metaverse or these multiple metaverses um and i i think you know what you're andrew is probably saying okay maybe we have a few many metaverses going or or there's like glimpses of of the future metaverse and john is saying like we're working toward it but you know it's not quite here it's sort of different different phrasing for kind of this current state but going back to andrew's definition about how the metaverse will be where we work play and live how would you characterize what we have now is it more of a work metaverse or a play metaverse or a live metaverse and um you know what do you think will be will drive the development of this space so yeah so i i think that with through nfts and you know blockchain more broadly we are now the the work part was now fully enabled because we were able to play through gaming through other activities you're able to you know live work and play and so you're able to socialize so that was already possible through zoom through facebook or whatever but but that work aspect you're able to use zoom to work remotely but you weren't able to earn natively through the internet you weren't able to do some sort of i don't know some some you know basically go for axi for example actually infinity which is a very popular game you now play a video game and earn value from that game right so that was not that was impossible before and now that that is enabled now it's like okay great you know the the metaverse can start to begin to to emerge and to eventually you know form what what uh it's basically going to be the internet of value so so to speak very broadly it's going to be people being able to earn through all types of activities and through that earning they're able to essentially yeah have better lives and be compensated for the value that they're adding to these platforms so um yeah again quite a kind of a nebulous definition but but yeah that that's how i see it i i agree very strongly with andrew here i think that um what we're seeing right now is the early stages of the economic infrastructure and mechanics for the metaverse being created for instance nfts and emerging nft protocols are really really important to to be able to construct to do that world building and if i take this back to the seductive concept that draws us towards the metaverse ultimately it's every one of us has found ourselves getting lost in a novel or lost in a film you fall asleep at night in another world and that's the promise of the metaverse that those worlds can be created that a talking fan can actually experience that that star wars fan can experience that in a very visceral way and that that we try that all the time we've all anyone has been to disneyland or something we've seen these the attempts to do this in a low fidelity way the metaverse promises this in a high fidelity way for that to be feasible there's a couple of things need to fall into place the first of them is the economic infrastructure the guide rails need to be put in place for any of that to actually be useful to justify the investment that's required to get the rest of the technology up to the point it needs to be to to provide that so i think what we're seeing now is actually the economic infrastructure it's the train tracks being laid the problem is the towns that are going to exist along that line have not yet been built and will take some time to be built i suggest as well but it's really important those tracks get laid because without them there is no future so but i think if we were trying to place it in time for me that's where we are now we're building the economic infrastructure for an open metaverse and it's absolutely fundamental it's extremely valuable and the the tools that we're building have mass applications in and out of the metaverse for instance digital assets and ownership unique ownership of digital assets that is not just a a metaverse proposition that's a very very real world proposition for most people as well yeah actually this reminds me of carlotta perez's book um financial capital and technological revolutions or something it maybe it's the reverse um but you know i like people are financially motivated and so of course i can see how the work or earn aspect of this is driving i mean we're seeing it already happening with actually infinity and stuff like that but um it's same with the ico craze where people thought oh you know we can get people to throw money at us so let's do it um and here it's it's similar oh i can run into the central land and grab um a part of this virtual real estate early or you know i can earn axes and then uh lend them out but john going back to some earlier comps that you made um you kind of really seem to talk about almost like a like an augmented reality and you called it like digital physical reality and you talked about certain gadgets we would need to wear our eyewear that we would need in order to access this world and so i wondered like for you do you feel that the metaverse is really dependent on things like a vr ar headset or how much of this will be more virtual in the sense that we'll just be at home and through our avatars will interact in these other worlds for me yes for me it requires some level of immersion because i think what we're seeing now is a lot of games are being called metaverses when really all they are blockchain based games that allow for people to derive value from that's a very important step forward and i don't mean to denigrate them at all they're very very worthy projects and and best of luck to them but that does not necessarily in my view make it a metaverse or make it even tangential to the metaverse so for me it requires some degree of immersion um to to make it a realistic metaverse in any real sense we need to be able to interact with a new dimension of of digital reality um and i think that the reason i speak about digi physical is because i use this proxy all the time for any gamers who are listening to this there was a game released about two years ago called red dead redemption 2 and it is an extraordinary technological accomplishment it is something just incredible the detail is phenomenal it's an open world environment that people can roam around but it took seven years for one of the world's best game publishers to create that and even at that it's still a limited world environment you can reach the edges of it quite quickly so to create something which is fully immersive and generative is still a long long way away and to my mind that's a real indicator that the first instances of this are going to be digiphysical we will interact with the virtual reality that emerges around us and to use the anecdote or the proxy that i've often spoken of is virtual pets i think when you want to know if you want to ask yourself is the metaverse here or not when people have virtual pets that they can interact with through mixed reality lens where that can those pets those semi-intelligent agents can interact with them the infrastructure around them both the physical and digital infrastructure other individuals and other virtual agents that's the metaverse that is you've now created new species of semi-intelligent agents that you can interact with and can interact with you and that gives rise to a whole new universe of opportunity that we can we can go into in detail and but then just one other thing is um so if i need to be wearing you know either a vr ar headset or you know some kind of eyewear in order to access this world and how much of this is just kind of a world that i've created for myself um versus it like do a lot of other people also need to be wearing the same thing at the same time in order for us to create this metaverse and make it a true world or is a lot of it just kind of a self-contained interaction that i'm having with virtual things it's a bit of both there's been there's been a real spate of patent registrations in eyewear over the last 10 years both contact lenses and glassware you know i think google glass was somewhat prescient of what was to come but it was poorly timed and maybe execution far short but they they knew what the future looked like and how we would interact with things in an augmented way now we see so many patterns coming through about this particular technology and the likelihood is there will be a digi digiphysical common space to which we all interact with that's layered over physical landscapes around us ownership of that will be a curious construct but we'll also be able to individualize it through the acquisition of very specific data streams for instance that we'll be able to buy data assets that potentially personalize our experience in different ways but that doesn't take away from the shared commonality of that environment that we're interacting with so if you walk out on the street the the general common part of it comes from um the fact that you might be able to interact with virtual monuments that you can only see through your lens where the individual layer of it may come from offers that are coming from restaurants or shops directly to you in a specific way that's catered to you that only you can see that nobody else can see so a high level of personalization within a common space because that's the dynamism that's offered within that technological environment and andrea what's your take do you are you more into this kind of ditch a physical aspect where people do need to be wearing gear to access it or or do you feel that's not as necessary yeah so john and i actually differ on this as well i'm i'm of the opinion that um you can have a metaverse come to form just through our computers you don't need to have a headset you don't need to have the suit you don't need to have any of that stuff it can be happening just through our computers and as long as you can live work and play inside of digital environments and you have ownership over your stuff then that means that you're able that means that the metaverse is there um so but but but saying that there's there's kind of you know we can look at some trends that are happening that will that are just marching towards this world that john's talking about of kind of deeper immersion and more uh technologically enabled gear that that that we'll be wearing if you look at number one it's just screen time so screen time around the world is on the rise it's uh you know it's average americans like around seven hours per day the average filipino is around 11 hours per day and that that number is just going up everywhere i i'm at like 13 hours per day something absurd but um i'm just ahead ahead of everybody i guess but so that's number one screen time just on the up and up and number two is technology immersion so if you look at kind of our communications technology it's constantly gotten more immersive over time so we start off with the you know the telegraph which is morse code it's like not like not immersive at all then went to telephone so suddenly you could now hear someone that's a huge leap up you know in immersion because that's your sense of you know a sense of hearing uh audio and then now we're doing video calls so you can see me and hear me so that's two senses now another huge leap and then in the future 10 15 years from now we're gonna be in some virtual environments we'll be able to shake each other's hands we'll feel the handshake and our brains will actually think that we're there but our brains will have no idea that we're actually not you know in you know sitting in our office or whatever and so so that thing is that is happening regardless of nfts or whatnot but really what what you know what what we did is we just added ft's along with those trends and so now we're able to to own and so now it's like okay well despite those trends that are happening regardless of nfts now the metaverse can come to fruition so um i i yeah i differ slightly in in john's views i think that we're headed there regardless but but i don't think that it's required for the metaverse to actually form in terms of digit physical i yeah i i agree with that i think that we're we're going to have um our digital lives our digital lives are intertwining with our physical uh so much uh that you know and even looking like going back to the screen time example we're already spending most of our time on screens you know online right we we don't we don't really notice it day to day because it just becomes so natural for us but i'm sure like most of the people listening to this their screen time is probably you know seven eight nine hours per day so that's the majority of your waking hours are spent online so in some sense we're already living in in this virtual world but when you add an fts it's okay now we can now we now we feel confident now we can own stuff and therefore uh they'll spend even more time in these environments and we'll just go go go deeper well so going back to your comments about nfts um and and also about just how right now we are i don't know about right now but um how we're already seeing glimpses of different metaverses in different ways even if it's from something like second life um at the same time here in the world of blockchain development we also have all these different competing blockchains we've got layer ones we've got layer twos and so i was wondering at this moment um just in terms of nfts even it feels like the nft world is a little bit siloed and i wondered will that also mean a more silo development for metaversus or um and and will that mean then we might have a metaverse that's more like for gaming and then another one for fashion another one for real estate how do you view um just from a technological level how that's affecting the development of the metaverse yes so so just first i'd say that like there there aren't really like going to be segmented meta verses it's almost like saying one internet for gaming one internet for this it's almost just like the whole broad concept is is the meta versus like the internet um so so there's that and then in terms of the the technological development of these different blockchains and whatnot um yeah i mean most people didn't know that mts existed until january that's a vast majority of people before that um you know really most crypto people because i remember talking about what i was doing in summer of 2020 to other crypto people and like most people were just totally destroying you know the idea they're like what are you talking about nfts are not even a thing and so that was with crypto people right so so um i think this is brand new so we're seeing a lot of uh kind of people developing you know experimenting creating new things and and trying to to test what what works we are just on the very very very bleeding edge of kind of all this development and so there's going to be just a big explosion of different chains different technologies different nfts different standards et cetera and that'll happen for a certain period of you know months to most likely years and they'll expand and then it'll it'll in inevitably at some point start to contract and we'll we'll end up with you know you know kind of three to five maybe kind of base chains or our base kind of uh infrastructure components that are really powering most of this uh in my view and i do agree that with your kind of original thoughts about how maybe it'll be you know solana will be used for gaming and maybe ethereum will be used for art art and collectibles things are that are more kind of uh you know slower but more expensive and but more kind of decentralized and hearty if you will so um yeah i i it's too early for me to uh kind of predict on how that will end up one thing i've learned is that my predictions are always way off so um i'm not good at that but uh but yeah i think that we're really early there's gonna be explosion of activity we're seeing that now and then in you know five plus years there will be consolidation into uh some core components that that most people are using i think andrew's maybe been a little bit hard on himself there his fund performance would suggest otherwise that i think he's pretty good at predictions but i i i i agree with um a lot of what he said there is particularly in the sense that they're one holistic metaverse i do and maybe this is a bit of a provocation and it's partly because i'm looking at me from a more neutral point of view but i see a schism coming between the nft maximus and the crypto maximus because they are politically and philosophically very different groups and i'm not entirely sure they're totally aware of this yet but it's to andrew's point there andrew was saw some sold the promise of nfts and how important the idea of unique digital assets and digital ownership was that's a long long long way away from the core digital libertarianism digital anarchism of crypto maximists who want to liberate themselves from a kind of a state construct state position um that drove a lot of the crypto space and clearly the majority of participants in crypto don't feel that way but the overarching philosophical philosophy drives it that way i don't believe that's the case for nfts and i share andrew's enthusiasm about the importance of nfts moving forward nfts are critical like the nfts are the great innovation it's blocked it's a crypto and blockchain was a necessary step on the journey towards nfts which is the real point of arrival at something extraordinary the ability to create a whole new class of digital assets and i think that needs to be understood within the context of the world we're living in now which is still the shadow of 2008. the world we live in now has been has been crafted by the the the the hands of the giant of 2008 that's that's the reality we live in low yield rate low yield low and fake creation environment and for anybody under the age of 40 probably very very difficult to access yield or to buy a home we've seen wages stagflation across to our stagnation across the world and we've seen significant inflation when it comes to child care and health care accommodation costs education costs and as a consequence of that there are a whole lot of people all over the world who feel like the traditional economy holds no hope for them there's no opportunity they've done everything they're supposed to do they've got a great education they've got a good job they work hard but there's no opportunity for them in the medium to long term and that's creating a significant rift so i think for a lot of those people the opportunity to immerse themselves in this new economy this new reality that is the metaverse and the primary acid construct within which is not an asset class nfts are not an asset class they're the mechanism to which we create new assets in this environment that gives them hope and opportunity unlike anything for the last 30 years this is the first time now in three decades that people of a certain age profile a younger age profile can hope to be middle class and upwardly socially mobile and it's not because of traditional economy it's because of this virtual economy and at the core of that as entities this is the perfect segue because my next questions for you are about financial opportunities in the

why don't we just talk a little bit more about the ways that you see the metaverse changing the way that people are earning money and um yeah why don't we just start with that yeah so i think it's uh it's it's really exciting because the design space for people to earn is like there's there's no limits essentially and what we're seeing today though um is again very very very early we're seeing i guess the best example would be axe infinity which essentially is is kind of like a pokemon type game where you have these creatures you battle them uh if you win the battles they drop these kind of potions which are erc20 tokens you can then sell those potions for ethereum which then you can sell that ethereum for fiat currency so you know pay your rent buy your groceries so that's very exciting and that's that's kind of one very basic way there's also ways that you can um you know host events that are ticketed and then you can sell tickets to those events maybe it's a a talk maybe it's a it's a concert um you know all sorts of different things um there's there's breeding so again in axi you can uh breed these pokemon together you know these pokemon creatures together and sell those creatures uh you know there's renting land there's there's doing advertisements on virtual land uh there's there's you know making art there's creating collectibles it's it's really an unlimited design space and what we've done through nfts right now is we've enabled the gamification of basically everything which i think you know on the surface it sounds kind of spooky but but really uh it's very very kind of uh it it it allows for um so much opportunity because now anyone can say hey i have a really cool idea and they can be living in anywhere in the world and be like i have access to the internet so therefore i have access to this global 247 unsensible economy which is the crypto economy i'm going to create a new set of you know paintings that that you know i'm going to upload and and with that i can now earn natively on the internet so yeah i think that there's today a plethora of different ways people can earn and there's going to be just so many more that i can't even it's almost like if you ask me hey like what you know about airbnb or uber back in 2002 like i would have no idea how that would work or what that even is um but yeah i'm sure in five years from now or even less we're gonna have so many different ways that that are just very interesting and very unusual that people can earn through their activities online if i was to build on that and andrew covered most of it i think it's we can already see there's a not insignificant number of people who are earning their primary income through these environments so they have already decided to give up on a traditional economy and they've got better prospects and better opportunity within this space and games are a great example of it but i think this is tangentially related to for other for instance vice industries so we see the likes of um of only fans and others providing kind of a safe haven environment for sex workers who can now work in a space that's just far safer for them they're more controlled and a much higher upside for them as well so we're seeing people make choices about the way they choose their earn income which are markedly different than anything we've seen before and it's it's an enormous shift everything from esports to streamers um to to people now like in the likes of axi are in in second life earning incomes through those environments what we're likely to see my expectation is that we'll see a greater and greater number of people earning a supplementary income from these environments maybe for example they are they have a stable of axes and they're using the scholarship program to allow other people to use those axes and to split the revenue with them and now maybe that leads to you know like a hundred dollars or a couple hundred dollars extra a month for them and over time that grows i think we're likely to see more and more of that so there is an increasing necessity or dependency on supplementary incomes because like i said before traditional incomes are not keeping up with inflation of major costs and this is becoming more of a necessity for people especially those who want to be kind of socially stable and not fall down on the ladder so that would be the thing to look out for in the short term yeah one one thing actually that i find a little curious about what's happening already is that even though play to earn obviously has enabled a traditionally underprivileged population to earn money as i'm sure you're all well aware of the price of taxis which is what you need to get started three axes has really risen and i um just did a quick search before we started recording and the cheapest axes are now 166 dollars and so if you need three at the very minimum you need 500 but apparently if you get the cheapest ones like you're not going to progress very far so it's really better to go with um ones that are more expensive and i actually saw the the most expensive ones are like hundreds of millions of dollars which i think is insane but um i just wondered you know how do you feel different creators in the metaverse can um kind of enable the metaverse to be accessible to that population well i'll take this one firsthand i think there's a couple of things on this point i suppose the company have indicated that they're going to provide a much cheaper axi that doesn't have breeding capacity so people will be able to engage with the game they'll be able to earn tokens in the game which then they can use over time to buy the full axis that gives people an access point there's a there's a couple of other things i think one is that there's a very reasonable case to be made that you've got people in wealthy countries now buying axes because they can afford them and then they're using cheap labor in you know southeast asia in particular to actually go out and work those axes and earn them more money so they're it's a form of rent um that they're deriving in a very pure capitalist way and is that really ethical or moral i think a lot of capitalists might look at that and say well two things one is that as long as they're paying a fair wage as negotiated with the the employee in this case well then that should be okay no one's been forced to do it and the second thing is the company like so actually has no obligation to provide cheap axes if the market demand um establishes a market price for it that's that's not their fault they've done nothing wrong there will be plenty of other players you earn opportunities and propositions for people to get into early um so i don't i don't it's a tricky one because i kind of see both sides of it i think there is a there is a genuine ethical question do you feel comfortable hiring people in cheap labor economies to basically farm your asset for you um and then pay them what may be a disadvantage just a disadvantage rate but at the same time it's pure capitalism right there's the this is the market determining the price of all of this and the company has no obligations do anything else so there will be plenty more opportunities and there are a ton of people we've all seen stories of people um who got in early to some of these projects and uh were paupers and are now millionaires um and they themselves will fund some of these projects moving forward as well yeah and then going off with what john said he's absolutely corrected just about market forces so right now axi is the really the only uh scale played earned scale isn't like crypto scale not not even like you know you can't even scale to regular games because that's massive it's you know tens of millions hundreds of millions of users we're talking two million users maybe and so actually is the only game right now that has their plateau mechanics really kind of enabled and there are you know 50 other games coming out that are going to all include some sort of play-doh mechanics and so right now of course the demand for axes and the price of axes is very very high but but you know as more of these games get launched and as more people you know come online and start to start to utilize these platforms then again market forces will probably have an impact and and uh things will will you know hopefully equalize or become more accessible for people in in low-age countries to actually access these these assets in order to earn and i think that that's what we'll see um but but you know i'm you know i'm not certain and what about the fact that there are different regulations in different countries affecting even things like whether or not a token is a security or an nft as a security and i just wondered how that would affect the probability of a single metaverse developing um you know i'm sure we're well aware that now in d5 often we'll see things like there's an airdrop for everyone but americans um and so you know how how does that affect um kind of a virtual world where you know it's technically borderless um will it just be there's one metaverse for americans and one metaverse for the rest of the world or how do you see that affecting things my side i don't think it'll have any significant bearing it'll just mean certain things are not accessible to certain users but i also think that those things that are not accessible are quite rare so they it won't be a regular occurrence security tokens are a really good example i do feel like security tokens are going to play a major role over the next decade because security tokens are how mass affluent get access to the yield of the super rich and there's no other instrument that provides that at low cost and i think that is a huge opportunity so security tokens i think are really important but there is a very blurred line between something that is a security token and something that is um another form of token whether that's nft or social token it's really ambiguous and that ambiguity tends to fluctuate country by country so there will need to be unified regulation when it comes to some of these tokens and it will be to everyone's benefit when it is established um and there will be workarounds you know the same things will be wrapped your yield will be sold in in other ways to to jurisdictions that don't have access uh to a particular token type i mean in the instance of of the us if it's a security token um i don't see that being a huge issue the other thing is location in the metaverse is kind of a it's a fuzzy idea because if you're using a good vpn then your location is yours to choose in a lot of to the large extent so and if you're holding those assets in the metaverse it really kind of becomes uh a very ambiguous guess which is there's a there's a legal fidelity about declaring those assets and any revenue you generate from those assets but the jurisdiction in which those assets are held the jurisdiction which those assets are acquired and the jurisdiction in which you engage with those assets is not defined yeah right right now the the current regulatory regime that the current regulatory environment at least in the states is not really compatible with you know defy and and a lot of things that are happening in crypto more broadly so i think that we need to update those laws because those laws are the securities laws are something like 100 years old old and based off of like something to do with like an orange farm in florida or something like that right um so so that that definitely we need to update that that's number one number two i i think it's with nft specifically we're going down an area that is unknown because you know i don't think that toys or art i mean some you know most art uh or collectibles you know baseball cards are securities like they shouldn't be they they weren't in the physical world so why would they be in in inside these these digital environments and just because you can earn through playing a video game doesn't mean that should also be a security if you you know in world of warcraft you could also earn money by doing doing missions or doing quests acquiring gold you could sell like gold on ebay that doesn't mean that your character is is a security so why should your axi be labeled security in my opinion it should not right yeah i don't think it's axes but things like on open seat recently they delisted some where it was provide it was um sort of like a dow and it was saying oh if you're part of the dow then you will get some of the royalties from the sale of these and and so i think that that kind of thing is more like a security but this actually leads me to a broader question was which was just in general when disputes arise in the metaverse and it's for um you know between people of different jurisdictions then how do you think those will be handled that's a great question and i think anybody who suggests they have the answer to at this point um is is just posturing there are some jurisdictions that do have some case law on it for instance the netherlands has some netherlands and some case law and digital assets but it is few and far between and yet to be determined maybe andrew sees it differently but i i think that is a kind of a looming cloud that needs to be figured out and like crypto maximus will tell you well there's no need for it because we've got the blockchain and that's the source of all truth and we can see how everything works but you know that doesn't that doesn't moderate or mitigate for theft or for fraud or for instance um you know we've seen it so many times either market manipulation or for money laundering which is an enormous issue within the space there's massive amounts of money laundering within the crypto asset space and with gaming assets as well so all of these things have real world consequences they're being actively sought out and police and there's you know the law enforcement are not going to stop at the gateway to the metaverse and say oh we can't go in there we've no jurisdiction that's not how it's going to work so there are a lot of questions to be answered at this point and i don't know if there are any really solid answers to it in large part because out of the the constellation of participants within this space there's there it's light on lawyers and some people might see that as a positive thing for now but ultimately we're going to see uh need to see a lot more jurisprudence um considerations in this space and let's also touch on identity um like so right now um you know i have kind of my different selves you know there's my cryptojournalist self there's my spiritual person yogi self there's my like concert going dancing self so in in the metaverse will i just have multiple identities and avatars depending on like what environment i'm in or will people always know it's me or how how will that how will that work itself out well i think the the the best thing is that you're gonna have the option like so so i think that um i remember when i first entered the nft space kind of you know in in a meaningful way in 2019 i decided to use my real name and my a picture of myself and that was very very unusual that like no one used their their real name or picture of themselves back back then now it's slightly more common but um but yeah that's how i stood out and i think that in the in going going forward in the future people will have the option which i think is amazing so if you want to be you know you want to kind of be totally anonymous you can do that if you're a man you want to pretend like you're a woman if you're a woman won't pretend like you're a man like it's it's whatever you want to do i think that having that freedom is is really really um satisfying to a lot of people and and really uh will enable kind of new types of you know who knows behaviors and all sorts of weird dynamics that pop up in the future that um that that just really are not possible today in our in our you know kind of in our normal kind of identification system it's like how many twitter accounts do you have how many linkedin accounts how many facebook accounts do you have you can you can create as many of them as you want to but you probably only have one of them and i think that for most people it's going to be the same they'll have one avatar base through which a lot of the right density is managed and wallets that are connected to that avatar that make the metaverse more interactive for them um to create you know to to direct the time and the resources towards creating other avatars that can be useful is um is less likely and there'll be fewer people who do it um we'll have a lot of kind of eggs within the metaverse i suppose people who are like they're they're poorly developed avatars that don't have a lot of assets or capacity to their to their name to their handle but i think for most people it'll be one and then if they want to make changes to the representation of themselves the way they express themselves that's something that can change anytime in the same way that you know if if you want to change your your profile photo on a social media account you can change it anytime but this is a much more immersive and expressive way of presenting yourself and i think that people will constantly evolve with that and they'll you know they'll use new nfts to kind of present themselves and represent themselves and that's probably the way that people will articulate that view of themselves but then on the flip side how how do we prevent that from being abused in a way that can lead to some dark things which already happen in our current web but you know things like harassment or deep fakes or misinformation and i just wonder how you know that could worsen quite a bit if um these happen in words that worlds that are already virtual where already people are interacting through avatars and i just wondered like are there particular ways to set those up where they can incentivize the normal type of behaviors we see in the real world where the vast majority of people are nice and just go about their business and instead of you know enabling anonymity or pseudonymity to encourage bad behavior to my mind oh go ahead andrew sorry oh yeah no well i think it's going to be pretty tough to be honest i think that um right now uh right the there is not a one-size-fits-all solution for that but what we've seen is that people are creating so for example decentraland the centroid is a virtual world platform you can go in you can attend events socialize build a house whatever you want and um right now it's really it's governed by a dow and so if people if i go in there and start building some structure and have hate speech all you know written all over it then basically people can essentially vote to kick me out and and to essentially block that content um so so but then what's to stop you from just creating a new identity and doing it all over again are buying up the dial yeah yeah so so yeah again for this is very very early and there is not a one-size-fits-all solution for this but from my understanding it'll block the content it'll still be there but no one can see it and so so um that is one kind of solution it's kind of you're able to enforce the the societal rules within that within that structure through people um and and that's one way to do it in a in a way that's not highly centralized uh but what it what it will look like going forward i have no idea i assume that it'll become more advanced over time just because that is the kind of the first iteration that i've seen that okay this is this is a working mvp it's not like the end-all be-all this actually works and you know we can continue with this until we figure out something better did you want to add something i i think that um we're likely to see a significant worsening of some of the worst parts of what we see on social media in certain parts of the metaverse because there is no centralized control in large part so you know you could also have a dao that is very much in favor of that so you will definitely see like daos that are created specifically for trolls um you know i think the game elite dangerous is an example of how like groups within in that game you had um you had groups that were malevolent players that that just went out to to harm the people and you also groups that were kind of philanthropic in nature and just looking to help people we'll see a lot of that but ultimately one of the the real issues with this kind of digital libertarianism is that it provides a space for the worst sort of behaviors and very very few limits or restrictions on that because philosophically it doesn't believe on it believe in it unless it's actually restricting or degrading the value of your property and i think that philosophically that's something that's very difficult to regulate for us so i i suspect that we'll see um in some cases awful and very difficult to stop behavior emerging but the space is limitless so it's very easy for communities to create environments that are much more coherent with their values and their morals and their ethics and hopefully be able to isolate those areas which become kind of no-go areas but they're very likely to emerge and so speaking of kind of um issues that come up when there isn't a centralized actor that you can go to to to get help from how do we handle things like identity theft in a decentralized world i mean if you have built your reputation with a certain avatar or you or you just have you know if i'm just laura shin and i'm in all these different metaverses or or in the metaverse and i have all my reputation and then somehow somebody gets control of um however it is that i access my identity in this world you know what can i do or what can a person a victim like that do who can they turn to how do you imagine this will play out and john you might have an opinion because your wallet was just cleaned of or one of your wallets was just cleaned out by a scammer which i'm sorry to hear you go to reddit and discord and you make everyone feel sorry for you i suppose um but uh and then tell them what your your new identity is um but yeah there are there are no protections for that in in my case we haven't figured out what happened yet i i tend to practice pretty good security hygiene um i have devices that are dedicated to my crypto activity that don't do anything else that don't touch anything sketchy i have no idea how this happened and the wallet were cleaned out for nfts and eth on my just a couple of days ago so i have i've no clue yet how it happened i think the the takeaway for me is that it is happening to me somebody who's active daily in this space and has been for a long time there's there's a part you know for a new user it must be very intimidating um and of course people will preach best practices like you know don't leave any assets in a hot water use hard wallets etc but that's ridiculous i think as well like honestly the idea that you're going to you're going to use a hard ledger for to store all of your crypto assets um is a silly idea and it's just totally um undermines the usability of the of the whole concept and it comes back to this idea of crypto versus nfts people who are nft enthusiasts want to see people really immersed in this engaged active always engaging with other people with other assets and other things and that means you need constant access to everything you own where a lot of cryptomaximus believe in taking your cryptocurrency putting in a hard wallet burying it in a hole and being ready for the day the government turn on you and you have to get up and flee via rubber dinghy to the closest island offshore so the two very different philosophies i'm i and i the way i've tried to mitigate for that is having quite a number of wallets and then spreading assets across those wallets and keeping some at various different exchanges where i do bot trading and stuff but it is um it's very unfortunate i have no idea how it happened to me if anybody else has been experiencing metamask issues where their metamask wallet got cleaned out i have i don't think it was the browser i wasn't an airbnb at the time when it happened so i thought maybe it was a security issue what to do with the airbnb but the machine doesn't seem to be compromised the browser doesn't seem to be compromised my seed phrase was was not accessible um i haven't figured it out so if people have heard any stories with this i would be very grateful if they if they if they sent it my way because i would just love to know what happened you know there's no chance i'm going to get on either back but i would love to know how it happened so it doesn't happen again but at the moment it just makes me feel cautious about metamask in particular i think but so like you know so this was you losing your assets but if we were in a metaphor situation and you lost control of your avatar then would you just need to revert to traditional social media and say hey everybody this is no longer my avatar don't let it scam you you know if it approaches you with a business proposition um it's not actually me like whatever you know i don't know how this would work but what are your thoughts on or is that even a thing can you lose your avatar or your maybe not it depends on the avatar the nature of the avatar you know it depends on the platform but if we assume the avatar is an nft for instance moving forward well then yes it could happen and if they got control of that wallet they could access all of the the assets connected to it so you could make your public case and but you in all likelihood you'd need to build your reputation from the ground up again i think there's two things you know look it's a tax write-off and you can you can benchmark the value of it so that's one positive side of it maybe but aside from that your insurance propositions right now don't cover that so i don't there is no insurance proposition really which i can access that is going to cover that theft for me so if somebody had broken into my home and it's stolen that money from my home it would have been coverage if somebody had you know mugged me on the street and taken it it would have been covered if it happened when i was on vacation it would have been covered but it is not covered if it happens within a digital environment so it is this kind of gray space at the moment and i think that that is clearly our first step because if you have amassed significant asset value at the very least you want to be able to insure it in the way you insure anything else you know we insure our property if you've got expensive jewelry you insure it if you have a house you insure it and there's a ton of people now who have significant enough crypto assets that they could cash out and buy a home with it you want to be able to ensure that in some way in the same way that your bank deposits are insured or anything else so i think that's a really simple straightforward first step that the industry needs to provide um and maybe it comes from defy although i suspect it'll it's much more likely to come from traditional institutionals rather than than d5 yeah and also to add on to that i think that um again we are extremely early and so most people like didn't know about nfts against you know up until january so i i think that solutions will be created like right now i agree with john that you're you're kind of it's going to be difficult if your stuff gets stolen it's very you know low likelihood you'll get anything back and also uh you know that that value is probably just gone and your your avatar for in in this example is also polygons therefore your identity so yes you would have to turn to traditional social media say hey everyone like my nft was taken and you know don't trust them you know whatever but yeah people will create solutions for that like that is a clearly a very big issue and and people will will figure out solutions yeah as for the insurance question i was just realizing um since you know people probably would never sell their avatar there wouldn't be a market price that you could easily point to you know the way that you can for um even something like a profile pic which is not quite the same thing as an avatar but anyway all right so we're coming up on time oh did you just want to add what you could you would have a bet like so obviously your avatar is not a particularly liquid acid but a lot of the assets associated with it would have a market price or at least a purchase price so if for instance your avatar is wearing certain clothes or has certain accessories you'll be able to establish the purchase value or maybe even a market value for for some of those for instance if it's axes you'll be able to show the value you purchase them at um so at least in that instance you should be able to but it was the first two calls i made was the first one was to my accountant the second one was the insurance company the third one was the police so um none of whom were particularly helpful but all right so we we're over time but let's just do one last quick question if you were to make projections for how things will play out um with the metaverse or whatever you want to call it in the next six months to a year what would you expect to see six months is very close um uh it's over easy for you well so i i think played iron is going to be a really significant part of this because the utility is so obvious the opportunity is so obvious so i think we'll see a lot more play to earn if we saturate a little bit longer over 36 months i think we'll begin to see some play to earn emerge in mixed reality environments so the likes of what pokemon go did and i think that's the sort of thing that gets really widespread adoption it's important to remember that a lot of these propositions don't have mobile apps yet so they they haven't gone mobile so the real scale opportunity hasn't been touched on so maybe that's in the next six months to a year we'll begin to see uh mobile iteration of some of these propositions that's maybe my prediction yeah to build off that uh i would say that platon is going to be something that is um i agree with john absolutely massive and people are kind of associating plato and they're talking about plate earn as a almost global minimum wage they think that over a long enough time span there'll be some sort of global minimum wage because of nfts and we kind of because of plate iron which is very exciting i think that um you know artists will continue to create amazing works that are fully digital i think collectors are going to continue to to collect everything from you know weird looking penguins to kind of baseball cards on the blockchain and they'll be able to nerd out with each other and socialize and and i think that virtual world platforms are like basically experience platforms will continue to get bigger and more exciting and have more people on them and host more events and i think that basically there's just going to be more of everything and and it's going to be coming at a much faster pace than what we've seen in the past six months all right well we'll have to check back at that time and see um how well your projections played out well where can people learn more about each of you and fermion and lately bnp peribus people can follow me on twitter my name is andrew steinwald and if you want to learn more about
