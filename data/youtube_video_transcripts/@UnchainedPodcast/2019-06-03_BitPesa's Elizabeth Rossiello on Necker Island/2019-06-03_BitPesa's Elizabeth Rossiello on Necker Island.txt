welcome to forbs podcasts hi everyone welcome to unchanged a forbs podcast produced by fractal recording thanks for tuning in today we're launching with two podcasts both from Sir Richard Branson's Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands after today you can expect one new show every other week for one of our inaugural podcasts we're talking with Elizabeth Ross elo the founder and CEO of bit pezoo a sub-saharan African foreign exchange and business-to-business payments company Elizabeth tells us what's broken in the world of remittance and b2b payments from Africa and she also describes the solution that her company offers so welcome Elizabeth Ross hello I'm so glad to have you on my show I've heard so much about you and it was so excited when I realized I was gonna get to meet you in person here was so nice of you um so I was wondering just I'm sure many of our listeners are kind of interested in the atmospherics of Necker Island what has been your kind of the highlight of your time here I mean you just don't realize how diverse some people's lives have been and where what they were working on before they came into either business or before they get into government and my dinner partner last night was the former prime minister of Haiti during the earthquake and and if that wasn't enough we then started talking and it turns out he's got an office in Senegal where I live and he's been working in West Africa for a decade so I mean it was just Wow okay so you don't really get that kind of networking staying at home right and then you don't normally do to do that and then also get goop paddle boarding the next day yeah I mean you know when you're running a startup it's pretty intense you don't get a lot of time to just think it strategically so there's definitely some space here for that although not a lot yeah right yeah no we've been very busy okay so um tell our listeners this story of how you came to found bit paisa and what the company does sure I'm American and I was living abroad in Europe for a few years working in investment banking and I paid off my student loans and I decided with my husband at the time that we wanted to go to a more interesting market we went living in Europe and we're in Europe in Zurich and London working for Credit Suisse and we actually applied for a job in Singapore and in the sector of microfinance which at the time was the FinTech iasts thing there was and the rating agency which I apply for a job with said sorry that jobs full why don't you go to Nairobi Kenya so sight unseen never happening what year was a 2009 okay so I accepted the offer no 8 and no 9 I began my training in Paris with planet phenols and they sent me to goes Nia and Georgia and Azerbaijan and I thought wow these banks here really are horrible I mean I can't believe the operations and the governance and the systems and they said look but these are a rated banks wait to get down to East Africa and I went down there and I led up the office and every month I would visit a new financial institution from Kenya to Botswana so covering all of sub-saharan Africa and doing everything from interviews with the governance the governance teams so the executives down to the branch officers talking to the customers in the field whether they are an urban trader or out doing agriculture looking at their credit products looking at these million-dollar management information systems that's an Mis system what's that that's the that's the nuts and bolts of how the bank runs so for small banks it's everything if you don't have a good one you don't know how many customers you have you don't know whether they have loans when when they were taken how much they've paid how much interest you're how helped efficiently you're operating which branches are doing better than others and if you do have a good system it can make a huge difference so for the systems that really integrated with Mobile Money which at the time was really coming up you saw operating expense ratios dropped from 70 percent down to closer to 10 which would give them an A rating and so for me it was really interesting always you know you could be in the coolest market with a really innovative governance team we'd have a great customer base a really cool product but honestly if you didn't have the efficient back-office it wasn't gonna work and if you couldn't manage collect sort and risk identify the risk of your data and all those things and you really had some big problems that was really interesting to me and I started to move away from doing the ratings to to kind of interpreting the ratings for investors and by investors at the time those investing in the microfinance space were social investors so Gates Foundation acumen fund Grameen Foundation and they would come down and say well we think microfinance works and there was a lot of hype about microfinance very similar to Bitcoin I might say and they said we can use microfinance for everything we can collateralize microfinance portfolios together so it sound familiar we can offer credit that credit guarantees from big banks like Citibank or Deutsche Bank that don't even do microfinance you know all those kinds of cool stuff what's happening and it's gonna save the planet and what we realized afterwards after the bubble died down was it can do a lot of things it can be a really helpful tool increasing Financial Inclusion and growing economies but it's not the end-all be-all and there were some really great learnings that came out of that and one of those things that I learned was to really make a bank or financial institution or a product work in a region where there's very little infrastructure you have to have your you have to have invest in technology and the technology not only has to be easy to use so everybody can understand it you can't have a really cool technology that only one teenager and the IT department understands you know and then when you can bring it up to the sea level or the board they're like what is this and they can interpret the data or how they use it has to be intrinsic so it's really exciting to see a few banks would be mobile money only so everything they did was just using mobile money no paper everybody that came in from day one was told all of their procedures and policies are based on that that started getting me thinking and I met one of the men Doug and Goldie Scott who had founded the first mobile money only microfinance institution in Nairobi Kenya and I said look consulting forever I'm so sick working for other people and he said I'll see you if you figure out a way to bring Bitcoin into the mix I said what's Bitcoin and he had been involved in a financial cryptography Association for a while and he said it's mobile money that goes beyond borders it's international mobile money and his idea was more of escaping the banking system and creating an you know replacing mobile money and bring it to regions like Somalia who at the time we're having real problems with international banks they're all being cut off right there with all these injunctions against Barclays because they cut up Somalia but for me I said well I'm still a business person I'm still pretty practical minded what I'm most interested in is how do we get better products to those urban customers that you see all across Africa from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to Lagos Nigeria they're importing from Dubai they're exporting to Europe they're importing from China they're trading with each other new digital businesses are growing up that have customers they're doing digital advertising and for East African markets these are really the customers that get be excited agricultural lending bottom of the pyramid lending financial services for the extreme poor I haven't given up that there are solutions for that but it's very multifaceted work it's really multivariable work you need a lot of people and the ecosystem to make that work so I have a lot of friends that do some very cool work from one acre fund even at Syngenta with farm force but for me I was interested in in creating a product that could help these urban customers grow their businesses beyond their own markets so how do you make a payment to your supplier well the way most these people made payments was they would carry cash on an airplane one friend would be representative to go to Guangzhou China with a bag full of cash or worse and I'm sorry but it was there any risk that if they were caught doing that then like the money would you know be sure is it not cash is risky but you know it works in different ways other the other way would be to send a wire to an unknown fixer or partner in China ahead of your trip that would take a few weeks and then when you get off the plane you hope that guy has sent the wire to your hotel the hotel gives you cash again in US Dollars and then they have the hotel FX broker come with his backpack to the hotel and change the cash from u.s. dollars into RMB oh my goodness so I mean those are just some of the chamber ways people used to move money around Wow yeah I mean what's like a less team way like I'm kind of curious I mean you know you don't go in person you send the cash with other people you know there's a lot of informal networks and semi formal networks something like over 75% of regional remittances out of South Africa travel by bus an envelope so and I've had with myself and I Roby Kenya I once was at a Safari house and I forgot the key and they said we'll put it in an envelope give it to the bus driver who drives the route up country I mean that's a common thing to do so because there isn't a reliable postal service or yeah there's no no there's no Postal Service in Kenya no home delivery there's only a few GPS but forgetting the Postal Service there's there's a lot of informal networks that have sprung up that are just better than the formalized networks but those only really work where you have trusts you do it on the bus routes where you know the bus driver and they're all of the same try from the same region so they're probably not gonna cheat you and if they did you know where the guy's sister lives or the mother right but what happens and you need to kind of go out of your your Nigerian community and you need to deal with somebody in Dubai or out of your Kenyan community and deal with somebody in Germany now you don't know the German sister you don't know where his mother lives you know you don't know where he went to school so if he is not trustworthy how do you deal with him so in a system like Mobile Money its domestic works beautifully because everybody's got it what if you don't have it how do you trade with them so all of these kind of questions were just really interesting to me because I had been an expat for 10 years you know I have been living abroad I've been sending money back and forth between consonants for years and it was always interesting to me how crazy is Italy different it was with each country you know I moved to Germany my first internship was with the German parliament the Bundestag and when I had to pay my rent they said oh you just you just do a wire online I said what do you mean I said yeah you just go into the online banking website and you send an uber visor which is a online wire instant and I said but I've been giving it a paper check to my landlord at my my university for four years they said what it's what the check you know and like back in the US they couldn't believe that we were using this online banking and that was in 2003 hmm so I mean it's just always been interesting me like if the technology exists weren't we using it why don't we adopt the latest what holds people back from that you know having on those ratings I saw you have the Dutch government give a million dollar management information system to a bank and they couldn't absorb it they didn't know how to use it there was no customer support that was local it was super complicated they had to do a migration from their old system to the new system they might have used one functionality out of a hundred you know so the technology had to be easier it had to be cheaper to set up heavy intuitive and you didn't need to maintain it yourself so when you think about Bitcoin right away when you start a company if you if you learn about and you have a developer that can link into it you can kind of just start you don't have to build the whole infrastructure yourself so yeah is that essentially what you're doing that pays they like do you feel like you don't have to build infrastructure because it's kind of built in oh yeah I mean you have to build security you have to procedures you have to build your product you have to build your market you have to build a relationship with your regulator build your order book but I do not need to invest in a million dollar Oracle management information system and I don't need to hire a team that sits on top of the customer support we get from Oracle you know and if turns out that my business changes and I don't need that Oracle system anymore I don't need to buy an IBM system you know so yeah so then describe your product and how is it solving that problem of you know people having to carry cash in suitcases or trust the bus driver - yeah deliver their money so sorry I'm not being succinct today so the problem with mobile money is that it's a closed loop and the problem with the Oracle systems the microfinance bank management information sins are that they're closed loops so Ugandan microfinance Bank wants to do a transaction with another let's say they actually want to demand into their Treasury and they wanted to kind of make transactions like real banks do they wouldn't be able to because you can't make a transaction out of the system to another system they didn't have Swift for microfinance you know correspondent bank relationships were only really given to the top banks in these markets so those banks were just islands amongst themselves and sometimes they would use mobile money to make payments between them so what if you used Bitcoin I'm sorry banks would use mobile money to make payments between them yeah actually you can pay in and out of any bank in Kenya using mobile money Oh interesting because there was no other way because because the correspondent banking which for our listeners who don't know was you know a way to connect kind of smaller regional things to also smaller potentially regional banks in like international locations when you when your US bank when I went to school up in Buffalo I think my bank was called M&T Bank mmm a New York bank in Kenya my bank was I&M Bank now his M&T Bank north of New York going to have a direct relationship with I am Bank Kenya - small little banks how would they ever connect with each other well they'd have to join like the international correspondent bank Network and how do they do that they kind of sign up the Citibank so when M&T bank New York wants to deal with inm Bank they go through citibank citibank their correspondent bank turns out citi bank and standard charter own pretty much the majority of the entire African continent corresponding banking relationship almost every bank in sub-saharan Africa has to go through one of those two to meet another US bank that gives it a pretty strong monopoly on pricing timing settlement no customer support no incentive to change right and yet for the African bangs to talk to each other there was no good actly so actually Swift has done this really interesting report that talks about how when Africa trades with other continents so when an African payment that's destined for Asia it often goes through a u.s. correspondent bank like Citibank back to the US clears there and then goes over to Asia Oh interesting so okay so let's talk about so BIP is it like yes what we decided was we put up a flag and we said we'll accept payments whether they're for remittances people businesses whatever they are will accept transactions and will put them in a bank or a Mobile Money or however you want to receive them here not cash so bank and Mobile Money debit cards in Nigeria we put up that flag and we said anybody who wants to gain access into these last mile his last way to a consumers wallet does not have to only go through a correspondent bank if you said meet that coin I will make sure that I'll put the corresponding value in the bank account so suddenly somebody in Canada could send me a Bitcoin and I would take the value of that Bitcoin and I'd make a market and a price for that in African currency and I'd say well we've agreed the value of this one Bitcoin is worth thirty five thousand Kenyan shilling and I'll put that directly onto the mobile money or it's worth 3,000 naira and I'll put that directly into the bank account and now I can transact with anyone in the world without going through the correspondent bank now it's it ends up in a bank in Africa and it probably started in a bank in Canada but now CIBC Bank Canada does not have to have a relationship with my end user they don't even know that it has to end up and Kanyon make and then does the sender have to convert to the Bitcoin themselves or do you also do that for them so that's a great question in the beginning the sender had a by the Bitcoin themself so the sender from Canada had a say I've got Bitcoin I'd like you to put this in a Tanzanian Bank and we said sure we'll do that now we have a Nigerian will come to us and say I need this to go to a Chinese bank I don't know anything about Bitcoin we say okay that's fine so they give us Nigerian naira we effectively sell them Bitcoin but we deliver that Bitcoin to a broker in China and they don't know I mean they know they've come to us because our company's name is Bethesda they know that we do something unique on the receipt it says how much Bitcoin they've received but they don't have to hold the Bitcoin they don't have an exposure to the Bitcoin when we give them a quote what that Nigerian naira to Chinese yen price is it includes the transaction fee for going through our version of a correspondent bank and what do you charge for a large transaction it could be a less than 1% well for a smaller transaction it can go up to 3 4 percent depending on the currency depending on the form of payment sometimes it's a flat fee so if somebody pays us by as a debit card or pays us by mobile money then we need to pay a flat fee for that which can increase the cost okay and how does that compare to what people have been paying on these other methods yeah so they can pay anywhere from 2 to 20 percent well what scenarios are they paying 20 percent so the average cost of remittances to Tanzania is 19% from anywhere from anywhere - the average incoming cost of remittances Tanzania intra Kenya was pretty expensive it was it was over 12% so Kenya to Tanzania was over 12% and when you use a mobile money so you go from Vodafone Kenya to Vodafone Tanzania it's over 6% and we couldn't same company right across the border you have some really crazy corridors like Rwanda - India is over 20% so specific corridors where there's not a lot of competition it gets very expensive now why isn't there a lot of competition well is there a one in banking to have a direct relationship with every Indian bank and every Canadian bank you know Rwanda is a small country it's at the responsibility of the banks go around the world and develop direct relationships what if they use a different management information system what if they have IBM and everybody else has Oracle forget IBM a lot of them have a smaller one called m2 or emerge or these octopuses are small companies that make small Bank micromanagement information systems so large banks won't be able to integrate with that so who are your clients so our clients started out as tech people early adopters who are very excited they knew a Bitcoin was they were following Bitcoin online they were just excited to be able to use Bitcoin to take over whatever their transactions were in Kenya and these techies would say well I'm paying my cousin you know I'm living in Canada I'm a software designer I know about the coins I'm in the tech world but I do have to pay my family member once a month and actually pay three family members $100 each so I'm gonna send you three hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin and you'll pay it out to three different people and it was you know within minutes you know three percent as opposed to what he was paying before over seven percent and stainless you know yeah and actually when you say you know it's near instant and can you lift your arms for me yeah and when you say that it's near instant and you know you gave the examples of money being moved from Africa to the u.s. to Asia how would that compare in terms of you know how long would it take previously yeah again it depends on what what method he was using before there are now some apps and some companies in certain markets specifically Kenya where you have m-pesa where you can pay with a debit card in the US and it goes pretty quickly to Kenya and it's getting it's getting competitive there but Kenya's the best version of that and you have to wait if you're going through and pass that you have limits it can only go up to $700 so businesses don't really use that so then we said well actually it's businesses that really need us we have a jewelry company which is a social enterprise so they employ a lot of women in Kenya making jewelry a lot of really cool young designers and they're in their headquarters and they sell the jewelry wholesale online into stores in the u.s. so every month they have quite a lot of money that needs to come from their company in the u.s. to their company in Kenya an intra-company transfer now this is their cash this is their business they're a small growing business when they would send the transfer via Bank it could take up to 12 days oh my gosh and they didn't really know what day it would arrive so if you've gotta wait for a big payment when do you make the order well we don't know when to make the order because we don't know when the money is arriving so your cash is tied up for half the month right and your staff can't really plan systematically because maybe this month it came three days earlier in that month two days later and goodness for bed you missed the telephone call from the security check from the US bank which will call you on the phone in the middle of the night Kenyan time that says are you the person that initiated this wire you know I mean the checks are still pretty old-fashioned and then you start the whole process again and you don't also always know what the price is until it arrives so with large transactions the margins get tighter of course if you're able to negotiate that if you don't negotiate it still can be quite expensive but the speed and the ease and the customer service are the real problem so that's what we kind of take care of for these customers and so you're delivering the money like you know since it's on the Bitcoin watching presumably on average within 10 minutes yeah I mean it depends in the last mile so if the bank that we're putting the money in has closed for the day you know we can't do business we just did a trade with bit Oasis in Dubai and their weekend is slightly different than our weekend so we had past the cut off on Friday for delivering it so they had to wait until the everything opened up again oh I see and so there are those limits you know there's still pretty pedestrian limits on what you're using it however it's not weeks yeah and limits from the traditional banking system not from exactly acknowledging so those those limits were already there plus there were extra inhibitions ease on top okay he can get a receipt of payment instantly okay and so um you were saying that now you're seeing a lot more corporate customers who are they so it differs depending on where we're talking about so in East Africa we have a lot of social entrepreneurs that's the testing ground for a lot of social enterprises because mobile money is there so it makes micro payments easier what financial services there's a lot of funders Nairobi Kenya is one of the six UN headquarters headquarters globally so you have it just the hub of a lot of that kind of activity and it's very easy to travel and work between Tanzania Uganda and Kenya so a lot of our first businesses there were social enterprises doing cool things like that solar customer solar fashion real estate microlending even and even some remittance companies payment digital advertising in Nigeria you seen much larger volumes so almost triple neva it tripled the average transaction size in Nigeria and there you're seeing larger scale importers so people bringing in plastics and selling plastic furniture or plastic casing plastic boxes lighting lighting for theatres lighting for showrooms you know much bigger import/export happening in Nigeria and while they might have already solved that payment problem in East Africa that's still a major problem in Nigeria okay and there was something very interesting that you said earlier which I didn't quite follow but you said that there's a collection of Nigerian churches in Texas that used that pace on bulk what what was that about yeah I mean we have a some of the way that we do business development as we go and want to get away all my secrets here for all my business about quite a separate competition so maybe I'll just be vague um but clearly when you're dealing with the diaspora population often religious religious units and networks are really helpful so we go through a lot of the church groups so we enter a new market and we talk to them about they send money back and not only for p2p remittances but you also see private investment clubs in circles sending money back quite frequently and goodwill so houses churches correspondent church buildings there's a lot of financial transactions happening between these networks so one of our one of our great clients is a Texas company that that collects and sends a lot of money back to Nigeria hmm okay and then in terms of examples of some of the bigger clients he also said like some of the biggest breweries and there were some other yeah I mean I wouldn't give away nothing to share publicly yet okay and but we've been talking with a lot of much bigger blue chip fortune 500 companies so they're saying now I'd say when we started they said oh you're just some kind of Bitcoin company I said no we're a company that you can buy and sell African currencies so are you working in Africa yes well do you have payments or collections and African currencies yes so do you have a team that thinks about how to buy them at a good rate and settle them and does you have a Treasury Department no well why not these these currencies are volatile they move around they're hard to access the banks closed at all hours the desks are difficult to deal with nothing's digitized well you know we just haven't thought about it well did you see how much error affects expose your FX risk it's costing your company that's something we would always look at as a rating analyst which is the FX loss that you're not managing and a lot of them would say oh well we buy our African currencies in London we buy them in New York if we need to and we break down the rates and say what they're actually losing doing that kind of business or you know we've been weak haven't entered that market because we don't know how to get local currency if you don't have a local bank account so it's taking a lot of Education and even saying that this is this solution exists and then once they say oh well your name is bit peso and you're dealing with Bitcoin we say well you know we use it for efficiency we use it for a lot of different ways but that's not who we are when banks started using email imagine the first bank went to its regulator and the regulator says so what you're an email company now no we're still a bank we just use email well no no if you use this technology you're clearly an email company you know and now all kinds of companies use email but in the beginning a lot of people would say to us oh you're that Bitcoin company we say well being a Bitcoin company is not a business so we're a foreign exchange a solution we're a payments company and we use Bitcoin to me price is more efficient okay so another thing that interested me was um over you know during the course of this gathering you have spoken about how your business has enabled businesses within these markets like you know in Nigeria or in South Africa um it's open new opportunities for them that they didn't have before and you made an example of that like ads Oh in Nigeria ads and South Africa a.m. so um we met a South African company that does digital advertising across the continent and they were struggling to collect their ad revenue from their customers in Nigeria since it wasn't so easy to make a payment from Nigeria to South Africa they would have to wait and then the FX price might change and then when by the time they received it they had an FX exposure so if they could just collect more easily then they could do it more frequently and they would reduce immediately their FX loss so suddenly we said to them well you can make a trade any two every ten minutes you know and you can cut Wow well go to web do use a credit card no do I you know what do I need for that and when we talk through that and that solution and makes it easier for them to do business and now they're not gonna hesitate when they're taking on Nigerian customers because now they know that can collect that payment another company we worked with man they always show us a list of all the companies that are operating all the countries they're operating in they say where are you who are you in this list how many more have you opened in because um they were really excited to take a customer in Tanzania because they knew that they could end collect payment from them using us okay so tell me how you got the paisa off the ground you started and you were mostly dealing with retail customers and then you said eventually you moved on or found that you know there was more work with enterprise how did how did that evolution happen yeah so when we first started we were really looking at the largest chunk of egregious fees and that was remittance fees coming in to Kenya and there was a lot of interest from the World Bank and see gap which is microfinance think tank and body and and we said hmm let's talk at that so when we first did our our pilot and we're two years live now this month and we went up to the UK and we met with immigrant groups there and diaspora groups there and we talked to them about and we tested the product it was it okay this will be used for a p2p service sending money home but people's behavior was difficult to change yes they were saving some money but it was still difficult for them to get used to the new behavior and they still needed to have a way to change their British pounds into Bitcoin and you know we weren't gonna be able to do both ends otherwise that would mean that would mean me being ally and Suzy at the same time you know I'm Suzy I need to find my ally you know I need to find somebody in those markets and it was very easy to start a business doing that but you didn't have as many people doing it it was a lot of hype about Bitcoin what a companies saying they were gonna do these things but it wouldn't came down to it and I had my team call them up and say let me see your API let me see a platform what is your KYC naml look like you know let me see your policies and procedures and let's have a relationship they just weren't ready so we found ourselves working really hard to make sure we were ready in our markets but it was difficult for us to find those brokers at least brokers that were very easy to use from individuals but when you went up a little bit and you looked at businesses that were really struggling they had a lot of incentive to change their behavior and the brokers that were serving those big businesses were much more professional they were licensed they they had Treasury tasks they would settle in price instantly you know as the margins and the sums get bigger you suddenly find more professionalism earlier on now I would still love to serve that p2p space but I think the whole ecosystem has to mature a bit more and we're doing that in some markets and that's coming around so for the last two years what we really wanted to focus on is building building an easy seamless frictionless way to get access to the currencies in the markets where I operate and anybody who wants that link into that can do it easily and even for free and did that mean creating establishing banking relationships in every country that you operate in that's our model it's a little bit heavy on the infrastructure but coming into a country and let's talk about the second part of regulation which is approaching a regulator and a government and saying listen we're using this new kind of technology but don't freak out we're just like the other businesses in your country we're gonna be either a payment institution or for an exchange PRL or a money service business you know depending on the different regulatory differences between each market we've got to be one of these three maybe we're a commodity exchange but just because we're using this technology doesn't mean you have to create a bucket called Bitcoin company you know because what is a Bitcoin company what if he's Bitcoin to label water bottles what if you use Bitcoin to one guy was sending satellites up at this base you know what if you used Bitcoin to buy and sell currencies you know those are three very busy this is very different businesses should you have a regulatory bucket just for that but a lot of regulators got distracted and said if you're using email you're an email company no we're not anymore you're still the bank so some markets we went into and the regulator just said well we don't really know what to do with you yet so we're not gonna even deal with you know you're not illegal but you're not licensed so you're in limbo and then how long would it take them to come around well we're still talking to a lot of them oh really I mean even in the US and in Europe you're just seeing now regulators become much more clear so the US was the first to make very clear statement saying you are definitely an MSB anybody using this technology to do what the past is doing would be considered an MSB um in the UK we've received a license from the FCA as a payment institution we've seen Japan come around Luxembourg come around you know a lot of other countries make clear statements unfortunately we still don't have an African regulator that's made a very clear statement now there's many many shades of grey we could sit here and talk all day about all the different ways the different regulators in the region have have approached us and talked to us and how they're looking at the topic and it's sad to say that in some markets the regulator is really just not investing the time to really understand it and realize this is just a piece of technology that can be used by all the businesses here you know well but so it sounds like you have really established relationships with a number of things even in African countries and yet you're doing that without clear guidance from regulators there or well sometimes some of the regulators have spoken to us open to the banks giving us guidance told us that we have to consider AML kyc which we do that we have to register we pay our taxes I mean we're licensed we're registered in all these countries where we're actual incorporated businesses we follow the rules we pay taxes we have work permits you know we have a physical office we submit KYC naml we have bank accounts there's many ways to kind of run a business when we're over certain local laws like $10,000 transactions you have to submit to a whole different point of rules those all happen even without a license that's just being part of following the law of a lot of these countries now going above and beyond that we don't hold deposits we don't have wallets so we couldn't do that without a license okay so one thing that I was curious about is when you were talking about this really high fees like 20% and stuff like that you would mention something earlier about a study that talked about how if Western Union or money bank enter a market first and make a deal with a postal service then they will end up not only with a lion's share the market but then the prices in that country will be rather high yeah what are the stats on that and it that the reason for those high prices that you mentioned earlier I I was into the link so you can look at the stats yourself because I don't want to recite them and I will send you the two economists at Sonia Sonia Plaza is one of them at the World Bank that published that report but essentially what it was is that cornering the Postal Service the post banks in a market and getting an exclusivity agreement with the postal banks of a market severely affects the average rate of remittances into that country going forward they did a really great study where they went across Southeast Asia Africa South America and then looked at all the different markets with really expensive remittance corridors and they said you know well is there an exclusivity arrangement with one of the big two with MoneyGram does that means that every post office bank in Ecuador has a MoneyGram sign and no Western Union that means there's an exclusivity agreement and usually there's like a price floor because they have to pay a fee back to those banks for every transaction so now you've suddenly set the price of the market hmm so I mean it just it just distorts that those exclusivity agreements are quite damaging when you have a new customer a new company come in and we say hey we can strike a deal we can give your customers better service they go why I'm getting all these kickbacks all these fees from this exclusive arrangement I'm not gonna ruin that so you don't get to enter this market well wait and has that been an obstacle for you well there certainly originally we approached a lot of banks and they said we're already working with these three companies and they give us a per transaction fee so why would we work with you who has less fees and then and then we talk about well actually you know we're bringing more money into the country so do you want your customers bank accounts to have more money in them you know they'll actually transact more money if the fees are lower so just a different kind of perspective on what would help grow their business and volumes and you have to kind of align your interests oh I like that argument um in general what are some of the bigger obstacles you have tended to face and how have you gotten around them well regulation is the number one obstacle we face we're in the region where you've had the least clarity from regulators and if you look at a map of the world and you look at countries colored by what the regulators have said so clarity or non green red yellow you just see a gigantic gray space for Africa so that hurts every time I see that you know not to get emotional because you know without the regulatory clarity you really struggle to have market entrance and you know we do a lot of things to get through that we have a lot of communication with the central bank's you know we have meetings with them we'll bring our investors down and we'll sit down with them we talk about where they will be going when they finally get there what's the timeframe how they view it what are the other ways that we can transact can we partner with a regulated entity we've done that sometimes but takes a lot more legwork and a lot more intimate knowledge of the market to know well even if their regulation is not there you have these five other signals that tell you how the market will go and what it will look like kind of understand what your risk appetite isn't that current in that market hmm okay so what keeps you up at night like what are you worried about you know what do you think would be kind of something that could really potentially impact your company in a negative way I mean we've already seen the worst that can happen 400 times I mean we've seen systems we rely on crash suddenly we had one system that we relied on and it when it stopped working for a few days wait I'm sorry you're saying a system that really yeah I mean one of the banking one of our bank accounts the online banking crashed so no transactions in or out so you know customers came to us and what we were still relying on the local bank so you know everybody in that market had a problem with it but you know when you're doing business and when you're doing business and developing markets where every all the people you do business with are struggling you know you have a lot of weak spaces so imagine how often a u.s. online banking platform goes offline for three days Wiegel was never yeah okay that happens quite a lot that's just part of doing business you know but everybody's dealing with that not just my company so it's not like our customers are extra angry but when I'm looking at a company like mine operating in the u.s. they don't even have to worry about that infrastructure problem or you know you have blackouts or power outages and all sorts of things or elections or random holidays nobody announces I mean is still a lot of bumpy roads to go down but it's getting less and I think their demand from the customers for a simple digital product that's user centric is high and so that's been exciting and the reason that you keep your money of those local currencies is to protect against volatility in terms of the price of Bitcoin I mean we're a dollar company so we have our accounts in dollars we also have our counts in local currency for sure but we don't we use Bitcoin for settlement that's it use Bitcoin as a debit card almost we don't have a debit card we pay people with our Bitcoin debit card we trade it into Bitcoin to make a payment and then we cash it out we keep local currency because our consumers need payouts instantly and the only way for that to happen is us at the local currency there okay what's a customer success story like a story from one of your clients that has really touched you yeah and we've had we have a few x we just put it them up on the website we have this company that was growing in in Nigeria and they suddenly were struggling to make salary payments abroad the way that had been making payments before was a third-party PSP like a payment service provider it wasn't working any more price-wise their system was down and they really were just like what do we do and they knew nothing about Bitcoin and their friend somehow knew our newer employee in our Leggo's office and we're employees and they come to us they go I don't know what you're doing but I just need to make these salary payments and they were getting desperate and their employees abroad we're like demanding that they make those payments and it just came to us and said what can you do for me you literally don't have to know anything about Bitcoin I'll just show you what to do you're gonna send me a Nigerian bank transfer and I'm gonna make that payment and they said well what did you use did you have a Visa card I said no you know did you did you make a big bank international wire no you know how did you do it you use PayPal and though so here's a solution and it's actually quite simple and that gets us exciting that we're helping companies solve problems that they have and every kind of company will have this problem okay what have I not asked you that you'd like our listeners to know hmm I think the size and the opportunity in African market is constantly underestimated you know there's still this aura of huh scary your home so crazy and while and maybe I haven't done a great job by telling you extreme stories but it's a beautiful diverse enormous continent you know and everybody says you know what's happening in Africa there's this great Facebook page called Africa is a country that like makes fun of the idea that Africa's just one place it was small I mean I lived in Kenya all the way in the east of Africa for almost seven years and now I'm in Senegal which is all the way on the west and it's like I'm in a different planet and I've lived and worked in many many countries in between so I'm just constantly surprised how many big global companies are just now thinking about how to enter the market now you have some really big ones that have been there uber for instance has expanded rapidly across Africa and thank thank you so much Cooper because it makes my life a lot easier when I come into a country that be able to use my uber account you can kind of consolidate all my expenses probably easy no matter where I'm traveling so I mean that's been awesome and they've done great and I think you know there's just this fear factor and you know people don't travel there as much on vacation they don't have relatives there as much they don't hear about it as much so there's not a lot of African owned media coming out that reaches the global space so you know stories are really hinged upon disease and war and all that nonsense so so people don't really think well this is a market I want to expand to so we're really excited to be part of a movement making it easier for people to do business in the region great well thank you
