not a dividend it's a tale of two funds now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um unnamed trading firms who are very involved as the ultimate pump d5 protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody welcome to the chopping block uh every couple weeks the usually four of us get together and give the crypto give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so uh quick intros first up we've got robert crypto connoisseur and captain of compound next up we've got taroun the gigabrain and grand pub at gauntlet uh then we've got emin gunsir the emperor of avalanche and uh lastly myself and messive i'm the head hype man at dragonfly so uh we are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice boone it's great to see you guys i i know that you have had a harrowing few weeks with this whole drama we talked about it on the last episode uh just to get everybody caught up and and really quickly jump into the media thing so uh there's this guy named kyle roche uh who is a class action lawyer who was caught in some kind of uh sting video recording operation basically saying that he is the attack dog of avalanche and he's suing a bunch of avalanche competitors um labs came out and basically said that actually kyle roche was one of like a bunch of lawyers we used um kyle has since been largely publicly disgraced both kyle and avalabs have both uh uh basically deny that they have a continuing ongoing relationship and uh kyle roche apparently uh since our last episode it's been announced that kyle roche withdrew from the open class action cases and was let go from his own law firm uh rosh friedman so uh if i'm understanding correctly uh the tether lawsuit the bifidex lawsuit tron and binance class action lawsuits all uh kyle roche is no longer active on those on those lawsuits so i know that this has probably been an insane few weeks for you um what's your give us the give us the give us the industry insider's perspective sure um when i heard what what uh what was on that site i was taken aback i was i was incredulous and uh and my first reaction was this is crazy um and it's it's so out there that it's unbelievable that i don't think anyone's going to take any of this seriously so um i still hold that position it's just way out there and uh kyle roche is a lawyer of the many lawyers that we employed it's one of the lawyers that we employed in the early days uh of a labs we've since of course cut all ties with him um and uh kyle was uh evidently trying to impress someone and uh to do that he decided to uh to make up this whole walter mitty world for himself where he's doing things and and in the middle of everything and suing this and that the one time we told kyle what to do was the time after he sued solana and we learned about it from the press and we were immediately on the phone with him saying what the heck are you doing you can't be doing this and and he refused any any advice so he told him not to sue solana and my general counsel then wrote a long piece saying that the core argument behind that class action lawsuit is entirely false and doesn't doesn't have legs so that's the fact pattern we don't sue our competitors we have nothing to do with those lawsuits so that's uh that's the short of it the long of it of course is you know kyle has sued a lot of projects has made a lot of enemies and he got trapped into saying things that are utterly false i will add one one additional fact to the fact pattern he admitted that he lied and it's also been entered into court proceedings so when he's withdrawing he has actually written out that that there were complete fabrications and falsifications made so um i think it's over you know i'm over it and uh you know there's no material to those but there was a joke before that when tyrone was late that uh he better be here on time or else i'll have him i'll have him soon named kyle uh that's a good question that's a good question wait are you saying there are other kyles who are problem children no i'm just saying there's lots of kyles who like show up in the news okay i thought you were i thought you might been calling out specific kyle so amongst all of the false statements that kyle made were there any truthful statements in the video recordings that you saw sure um so i i'm supposed to extract from what i saw so let me be clear i didn't have the heart to watch all of it because it's just it just triggered me way too much but he was employed in the early days uh but just about every statement i heard was you know a small nugget of truth you know maxed out to its extreme like from the percentage of coins that he supposedly holds to the impact he had to how he did whatever he did um it's just all like uh all just extreme far out there uh so yeah he was our lawyer in the early days uh and um you know that's uh that's about the extent of it yeah oh he did he did represent us in a handful of cases let me be clear he represented us in a bunch of lawsuits you know routine commercial things you know um contractor we terminate the relationship contractor wants more this and that they sue us whatever so those kinds of things as far as i can remember off the top of my head about he was involved in about six different cases and they were all defensive and then there was one lawsuit where he represented me against somebody who who made statements about my involvement in some organization that i have nothing to do with so that was the extent of our involvement yeah i mean we talked about this on the last episode and jill was mentioning that if you're in crypto long enough you just you come across people who are just like i was i was in the room when blah blah blah happened and i was like i'm satoshi nakamoto i mean ethereum has how many co-founders but the thing is if i try to count the number of people who've told me they're an ethereum co-founder it's much more than a few dozen yeah that's the problem with decentralization that we don't have very formal structures around these things so people are just free to kind of say whatever and uh it's it's often it's common enough and start i mean i can't tell you how many people i've met who tell me that they're elon's closest friend and it's just like okay well you can't all be right because he seems very busy so well he has to get the memes from somewhere so you might not be his friend you might just be the meme supplier oh that is true that is true that's a different kind of friendship than normal kind but um so is it do you feel like this is mostly blown over i think so i mean what's what's there to blow over it's just a bunch of made up stuff there is not much i can do i can control the things i build i can control the things i uh you know i do uh but i can't control what other people outside of my organization will say to the rest of the world and so and then you know the only thing you can do when they say crazy things is to say no that's not the truth this is what we did and uh i'm i'm hoping every time i underestimate the world it surprises me in a pleasant way that i think people are decent they understand what can happen and and the truth finds a way of coming out so i think this is over now and it's over in my mind i think we've we've had a very strong reaction we clarified the record repeatedly so uh of course there will be attempts to bring this back again and again and again that's okay we'll deal with that that's just a minor hassle for us so tell us about the icp angle because i know that this is uh interesting another interesting angle of intrigue yeah that's right that's uh you think clown possible not the insane so i don't really have much to say on that front uh kyle sued icp and i didn't actually know that kyle had sued icp until this event so um so that's all i know and uh and so that's that's that connection and uh dom uh also has some kind of beef with us because he thinks he owns the word subnet and we use the word subnet and that's fine whatever like he can get upset at us we didn't know he was he was using the word i think the word is uh is pretty clear the way we use it we have a different definition for it he's free to use it as well that's totally fine so that's the angle i know and uh there's also a bsv angle right so kyle had sued um was involved in the lawsuit between kleiman and craig ray and so um you know again it's it's my loose understanding may or may not be factual that whoever did the recordings was uh was involved in bsv but i don't know so oh really this is this is all out way outside how did he get involved in all these cases i'm like either he's a genius lawyer or something like there's got to be some there's got to be something there he's like somehow like everyone handles the americans file a class-action lawsuit against anyone they want and that's one of the problems with the legal system that we have in america it's one of the things that is actually nice about the us that the government doesn't have to prosecute you if there's something bad happening that affects enough number of people that you can take the matter into your own hands so i like that thing then it becomes very litigious and that of course is not good in any case it's all beyond me i have nothing to do with this stuff you know we built systems kyle does lawyer stuff and we needed defensive work we hired him and uh we haven't used them in an offensive capacity well anyway i think i think we've said enough about this yeah at this point i feel like it's kind of blood from a stone with respect to the story it's just been a slow few weeks that we have to i know it's been slow it hasn't been slow i feel like it's been pretty slow it feels like it's been a very slow few weeks i don't think that's true what is the exciting thing that's happened the last few weeks well i feel like i feel like people are speculating on on the one big event of the week that is true the emerge oh the merge so i mean that that is the one big thing today uh we're recording this on september 12th uh the merge is slated most likely to go live on september 15th so for those of you who somehow don't know what the hell's going on the merge is when ethereum uh transitions to full proof of stake and abandons proof of work except for the one eath pal fork which i guess is still supposedly going to go on i think it's going to happen uh it's not going to happen but i think they're going to will it succeed i feel like it's going to happen but they're going to mess it up so yeah so okay so just real real quick high level stats on the merge so net issuance is expected to be between zero and point five percent annually after the merge just for reference bitcoin today is about one point eight percent annual inflation ethereum pre-merge not including fee burn was about four point five percent february obviously has been super volatile but um it's you know somewhere in the four percent range is going to go down to about point five percent so you're going to lose 90 of the eat issuance after the merge and of course energy usage is going to cut down by like 99.95 so it's gonna be gonna be basically totally green and very esg after the merge anybody following the eth pal stuff does anyone know what's going on there i loosely follow the eth pal stuff here's my take on the situation yeah obviously there's a huge amount of proof-of-work mining hardware designed for ethereum that has to go somewhere in general ethereum classic is not a great use of that mining equipment and a lot of the miners think that the easiest thing to do is to keep on mining ethereum with the existing state and just fork it and direct all of their hardware towards continuing proof of work for a fork of ethereum i think the bigger issue is that there's a lot of hardware that has to go somewhere and is depreciating quickly and miners are at some point either going to have to you know realize that the hardware is no longer as useful or you know will a blockchain into existence that has value and i think they're trying to will a blockchain into an existence that has value now the approach that they're taking is to fork the entire state of ethereum not fork just the ether balances but to fork every single smart contract and i think it's going to be a total cluster i'm in their discord and it already is they're they have like a private discord and i will say this or you're in a private disclosure yeah they're like dm to get into our private discord if you want to help qa or pc i was like sure okay and uh is gauntlet going to support that no no no no no no no no no this is me as a universal i just wanted to see what i'm dealing with you know i don't think anyone leaked the anon alpha the the alpha is basically they haven't been able to cinco node fully with all their changes it's like not bitwise identical up to like some point so there's just some points at which they are observing some contract state that's different than each mainnet and they haven't been able to fix it and obviously they don't have much time and all the miners have to sync so one thing is if they can't get their their client to be a bit wise identical you can't just take an existing archive node and use its data up to the fork block what else are they changing that it wouldn't be bit wise identical well yeah there's a lot there's like pre-compiles and stuff that have been added that they're trying to remove they also changed all the minor fees so like the base fee is going to minor dow it's not going burnt anymore they're taking all the theorem foundation's east and sending it themselves what yeah there's like all sorts of [ __ ] i did not know this but they [ __ ] up all of that so they're trying to give miners access to some like private rpc node they're running that they're debugging on but like not giving out the full thing because i still can't get identical this is a terrible way to fork the blockchain this is ridiculous why it's not a terrible way to fight yeah it's not the best thing how would goon fork ethereum i wouldn't fork it to you the first time if you did if you did if i did it tomorrow morning you wake up tomorrow morning and you are you are the head of ethanol oh no if that kind of a fork is a hostile fork i would never do it but uh if i were them i'd start an l2 powered by pal and then that would be it and just be like hey this is an l2 done and that would be the sensible thing to do but um have you guys looked at the fee calculation and geth it's just layers upon layers of very complex code like i'm not the least bit surprised to hear that they screwed up that stuff the base fee burning thing like removing that actually like just changed something changes so many things about it yeah it's just so the mempool uh one of the bugs i saw on the discord was the mempool priority do you remember like in like the early days of d5 there were lots of these bugs that people found were like the geth didn't order equal keys and the priority queue for gas like this yeah people would like grind people like right so so like basically they have bugs like that coming from their basement oh wow so like they can't replay correctly which is like gonna like how are you how are you gonna mine on that this was just me going in for a little dumpster dive and i i was like all right great that's that's how much how much of the communication there is in english um there's a lot of u.s minors who are asking questions okay like like they're all the random u.s miners who who are running gpus are like sitting there and they're they don't have any chinese people working they're all in texas i see but the develop the development is all happening in china right but the u.s miners are like running the nodes and trying to like test that they're existing they have code bases too for managing the devops of like oh when do they spin up and spin down things like yeah yeah how much should they allocate and like all of that's not working because they can't actually think of things wow that's why i only know the problems from the perspective of these people trying to run the nodes i don't i'm sure there's even more than the development this is just from that they got three days no i don't know how you're gonna sink in time like i actually think they're just gonna do kind of what you're saying like they're gonna give up on it and just just run a separate chain and try to think yeah right right because they want to send all these like random accounts for themselves yeah that's not the right way to launch the fork i mean they did it too late that's the problem right like chandler grow came out and said it like what like three months ago yeah and they didn't even like get enough momentum they should they come on this is the slowest moving railroad car you've ever seen you could you could have like tried to have started like a year early right right and this is the the the the same thing bsv did right then bsv also basically uh satoshi's vision yeah it is but i didn't think they actually deserved the coins i'm pretty sure they did yeah i believe they reassigned they talked about it i don't know if they did it oh man you probably know better than we said they're like your arch enemies no no no no for whatever reason they love to attack me but no no no um no i haven't followed closely enough i didn't think they took the coins though i mean if you're listening right now you know just tweet directly at haseeb that's right if you're part of the psv community and you're mad about it shows up on his phone just go ahead and flame me into the ground um okay so whatever if pow aside sounds like it's a dumpster fire but yeah it's kind of a little bit embarrassing to all the people who did forks in the past it's like it's like kind of shows forks or to your blog point like very hard to orchestrate with smart contracts that's right that's right well they're they're trying they're trying their best and so it's whatever but but the main show is the merge right we should talk about the merge yeah i mean that's a great thing so i here here's here's the thing i'm kind of like so when you're talking to laura about the show laura's like oh you shouldn't make it about the merge you guys should talk about stuff with me what else is there to talk about we've all talked about the merge for like years now it's going to happen on wednesday or whatever and then like the day after wednesday you're going to wake up and you'll be like oh the merge happened now yeah we're trying to look forward to in life now that the merge is done uh all the features that are promised in all these efps 4000 and up yeah so like okay so we got to wait for like the actual changes 4844 all these things like unclear what they're doing what is 48.44 explain it 40 yeah so so there's a couple paths that theory must take so ethereum if you didn't tune in since 2019 was basically like hey our scaling plan is to go sharding which is to you know have many shards they synchronize on the beacon chain they've decided to go the cosmo celestia route more so than the the pure sharding route and have a data availability layer where basically you know there's sort of this way of verifying that someone has the right data without you actually you know storing all that data yourself it's called like sort of a date availability proof and so they want to add that to ethereum so that applications don't need to actually like store as much data or hopefully um and so they've there's a bunch of proposals which you know in some ways are you could some have argued that there are block size increases some have argued they're not i'm not going to wait into that or i'll let the bsv people handle that but it basically separates blobs which is data that's written that is not computed on necessarily but within the transactions submitted and data that and compute separately so separating compute and storage which you know a bunch of blockchains already do uh doing that ethereum's a lot more hairy because you need to make it backwards compatible with all the existing storage now the upshot of this for rollups is that rollups only have to do compute when they post to fraud proof usually if yeah if their fraud boosts their working and whatever whatever the end state overlapping let's let's look i'm thinking this fantasy world of yours is amazing he goes infinity overlaps not t equals now of that's what i'm saying so roll ups do post these blobs right because the state has to live on this chain and i think like there's still a lot of debate as to whether ethereum will be able to implement this in a fast path and like actually get this running or is this going to be like 15 59 we're you know like burning the base fee ironically a form of lock-in against forks as we've learned uh in some indirect way by being a very complicated piece of code right um but yeah they well are they going to implement this how are they going to implement it is still a big deal and so i think the post-emerge road map is a bigger concern the merge is just a narrative for investors who don't want to really understand how technology works to buy into it because they're like oh like supply lines oh all these esg funds cannot buy like the current version of it none of the features that were promised a long time ago are even close to being well i agree with that i agree with that yes it's just like it's just like we went from this list of 500 items and we did like two and it took 10 times it's very simple merge and then surge comes before general robert petraeus i i feel like they i feel like they nailed the messaging the fact that you could you get on the show just the merge the surge the splurge the verge have you seen that that that crazy flowchart diagram that vitalik has of this i mean that there's so many things on that this is like playing shoots and ladders and you just got to the first ladder well there's unfortunately there's no way to fast track you can only lose progress apparently which is which seems like what we've done i mean remember like the merge is supposed to be done in 2017. right that was the original ethereum road map was that they believed i mean that's why the difficulty bomb was put where it was because they believed that within two years no i think it was eighteen but yeah it was a close yeah okay yeah but i remember discussing how to shard blockchains back in uh 15 yeah with vlad and metallic and uh yeah no it's been a while so good you were there you were there you are you know the og among ogs when it comes to seeing the development of smart contracts give us like back in the day what was what how did people think about proof of stake back when ethereum was first getting put together so tell us the story the entirety of that thinking was uh was predicated on matching proof-of-work so everything that you see in ethereum uh two is is there because people felt that they had to one for one cover pow and have a mechanism that corresponds to what's happening in pow so um you know things like slashing uh things like uh you know just the way the discourse happened the framework in which people think about these things is is based entirely on the bitcoin way of thinking and trying to match bitcoin's features so um and there was a lot of talk about sharding and uh you know it's a good idea in general if i leave a phd student alone in the first month they will be like oh yeah to scale something up you got to shard it um in the early days the focus was entirely on sharding because how else are you going to get any kind of scale up but uh if i leave a phd student alone for a year they'll come back and say let's not charge this is hard because it opens up a whole lot of issues especially on the public blockchain because now you get people who are picking and choosing their shards you get you know you once you shard something k ways you had one problem you've got k charts now you got k plus one problems right the k shards each in and and every one of them plus the inter short communication rule yeah k squared really squared right yeah it's really k squared t minus one this is a really k factorial pretty easily so uh so yeah no it's in the early days this it seemed like maybe it was solvable and so on but tyrone just summarized it really well like it starts out with with a big vision and then when the when the you know the push comes to shove you just jettison everything and uh and so now we're back to but i think that that merge is a fantastic thing i cannot wait for it to happen uh one of the biggest outcomes from it will be the the fact that we'll no longer talk about the merge so we'll save a lot of time we're going to move on to the search we'll we're going to move on to whatever comes next it'll become even slower new cycle i'm more excited for all these access gpus to just be used for stable diffusion and which is that which is generally some friend of mine who works at this like minor in new jersey and they've literally turned all their east miners into ml excess capacity like i feel like a lot of business model there effectively you're just competing with open ai right because like the question is will the open source thing it will be will it be good enough like linux where like being the infrastructure provider like aws is good enough that like it will beat the like really optimize someone's going to stick a token model on this i mean they already have yeah yeah there's like a million people golem wasn't goldman sachs but no one is actually focused on the ai thing of like oh like how valuable is this particular graphic to you and i'm gonna up charge you for that because like i think that's where you're that's where we're we haven't seen that's the innovation of this cycle computer you're talking about non-commodified compute yeah it's just gpu stable diffusion well no what i'm saying what i'm saying is that like uh so normally almost all compute today is modified meaning that the compute is not charged to you differently based on what you're doing and sort of but it's still value-based you still bid in auctions for preemptables right yeah but it's still a commodity yeah but it's still treated as a commodity right something that is not commodity price and that looks at the value you're creating with it and charges you right based on the value you create one percent of your nft sale based on what it output that would be non-commodity exactly but that's a lot like just more mean that i think there'll be auctions for the there's like a fixed amount of uh i mean commodities but what i mean is like currently if you look at the pricing of like open ai api call or or api call those uniform across all queries there's no competition for that and i actually think that will see what you're saying that's the thing that will change now that this is sort of like this race where like a lot of people are doing these stable diffusion startups so if you had the estimate the cost of computing one call to like stable fusion in like thousandths of a cent what would you estimate i think right now it's free actually there's like a bunch of free services i agree it's free right now we ignore all the subsidies that are coming but like the underlying cost i i probably in the range of like tens of cents no tens percent you can run this on a laptop but for quite quite on the m1 not on the like sure sure let's say it's one cent yeah maybe maybe a cent maybe a few cents if it's one cent i mean i'm just waiting for someone to like make a movie out of this because like 60 frames per second right like i'm serious yeah yeah yeah google has been demonstrating uh some really interesting okay by the way we're getting like way off topic no there's the good stuff yeah yeah yeah wait wait wait we're coming back to what the token model for this thing is but the number one thing the number one thing is that like it's in video and video has probably been the number one company that's been rocked the most by crypto right because you remember 2017 their stock price went crazy well they got they got a fine from the sec this year by not disclosing that crypto was a material impact that's right that's right that's right i feel bad for them although they've also made a ton of money from crypto but now looks like gpus are finally going back to like regular pricing like their supply shortages are going away normal gamers can buy gpus without like 2x markup on secondary markets so that is one big change and the other thing that's happened is that all these random proof of work coins are starting to pump so ravencoin i read is up like a hundred percent wait why wouldn't it be the inverse because when you can mine it so easily yeah exactly because if you have gpus you can mine this coin same with each classic right why did each classic go up because if you have gpus you can mine each classic okay and so who are the buyers you've this is what happens is that people who don't understand that they see this leaning in oh hash rate's going up therefore it's more valuable so i will buy it or is that why the buyers are interested in good that's your claim in the short term in the short term it is it's it's not a good so much as this it creates momentum that causes people to buy and then the miners dump into that by pressure right like this happens all the time every time that you see these rotation of hash rate the price pumps because people are like oh finally this thing is coming to life like ravencoin look i don't know anything about ravencoin wasn't that the overstock.com related one the only time i've ever heard the name ravencoin is from proof-of-work miners who are rotating uh no no no the reason i heard about it is do you remember there was this scandal about this company that was trying to make an ethic this was bottom of the bear market used 2019 lindsay l-i-n-z-h-i and they like wrote this blog about making this aesthetic that will like dominate each mining and that never happened those people were the ravencoin people oh okay that's the only reason i've ever heard of raven coins yeah yeah i only hear about ravenclaw from miners i've never heard of anyone normal tell me about it i found out about it from 4chan because people were like patrick byrne is buying it or whatever oh is that right yeah who's patrick or maybe the overstock overstock oh that guy yeah that guy yeah he's an older master in it i feel like the the big nugget here is how often do you read 4chan i was an active uh reader of biz in like 2017 or so really really uh okay it got really woe jacky after that and i stopped reading it but back in 2017 i read biz all the time great crypto forum back in the day ah so tell us what is the 4chan perspective on crypto from that you remember i haven't followed since 2017. um but back in the day there was a lot of great memes about basic attention token and link also wait does anyone ever think about how basic attention token is a really [ __ ] up name because it kind of it kind of sounds like the the the stanford prison experiment like as a token like basic you don't have basic attention you need this token to have basic attention like sorry i just i forgot it was even that was what it stood for because yeah why is the basic word in there it should have been brave but here's my 2017 recollection i could be like way off base here the idea was that it would be the standard cost of an advertising unit hence they were trying to value your attention for something very 1984 though valuing your attention yeah absolutely and they're trying to come up with like a canonical like you know um empirical unit for attention for like one advertising impression this is a very 2017 like look we're going to take this like broad concept yeah and turn it into a token in retrospect if it does just really sound like you know some like means of controlling your attention token yeah that was the idea that was the idea behind it i i knew i knew brandon so i knew the etymology it never struck me as that it didn't no it's not trying to control you i mean if they could that'd be great it'd be a great business model i've been totally brainwashed of course grandma controls everything i think really clearly his basic attention is very expensive yeah it's already been bought out disclosure i'm not a holder of bat okay okay yeah we rat bat and ravencoin this is how you know you're in the bear market when people bring those names on any of these topics i'm just so afraid of uh yes you never know when people are gonna get upset at you yeah well that's kind of the theme of the show is that we just say random stuff and the people that matters emin hates ravencoin and back that's what i got from this that's gonna be your next scandal i mean i was just breathing a little bit of a relief that's right that's right well so actually here's here's a question for you guys do you feel like the beefs that you've gotten into with other founders has been good for you or bad for you uh on the net absolutely bad absolutely horrible really of course and i don't get that impression why i feel like beefs between i feel like beefs between coins is like actually it makes news it's like it's like wrestlemania right i found out about you and i respected you all the way back when you were ripping on bancor way back in the day i was like who is this cornell professor ripping on the bankwear idea yeah no was it on the net it's it's it's a big negative you just make enemies for no reason and uh you know i feel compelled to say the things i say because you know i feel like this is the truth as i know it and therefore i have to say it and then it gets me in hot water and then suddenly there's like some kind of altercation it's kind of unnecessary a lot of these people are people i like you know but sometimes it's just people i really hate and they're doing a scam and then they attack me oh either way you know i've gotten used to it but if i could just do it over again i'd keep a low profile um if i could my personality wouldn't allow this but if i could redo my life i'd be a you know go with the flow kind of guy that's not me i do not believe i can't do it i would want to whatever happened to team rocket team rocket they disappeared they did their best they did their bit every every big movement needs a creation story every big one and the biggest gift any group can give you is anonymity it's like they give you something take it or leave it all in the service they don't want credit they don't want anything else here it is and if we like it we like it if we don't we so team rocket disappear chose to disappear like uh what's uh kaiser soze just bam vanish fair enough all right well move on to the other story that keeps on giving besides the merge which is the tornado sanctions oh yeah so um i don't know there's been much specific news except the two two big items that i saw this week the first was that huawei the big asian exchange delisted every major privacy coin so they delisted z cash monero uh decred dash and the three other ones that i've never heard of sorry decred counts as a privacy coin in 2022 sure i guess i don't know they had some privacy they had a broken version of uh like a mimblewimble additively that's right that's right like there were so many bugs [Laughter] yeah yeah well i guess they stopped litecoin right like incorporated member didn't they litecoin's too big to fail i guess the like coin foundation army is big on twitter now they're right yeah i don't know all i know is charlie lee is like i was like just as research i was trying to like watch uh you know normal tv coverage of crypto because i didn't i have no clue what people think uh and charlie lee is on like every single one of these like really like news channel episodes lately being talking about the litecoin foundation i was like they have a foundation that's active like wow i'm learning so much about you guys like you read 4chan you watch tv lawyers lawyers be happy that you're late because they charged you for being late i'll never get sued well speaking speaking of lawsuits so the other big news in tornado land was that coinbase is bankrolling uh a number of lawsuits against treasury so basically are these separate lawsuits or is that is it one treasury yeah against treasury um for the ofac restrictions i thought it was one lawsuit with six plaintiffs so they're backing a lawsuit against uh treasury there's a number of plaintiffs each of whom yeah each of whom had some kind of sympathetic story or so they basically did the thing they're supposed to do which is fine sympathetic plaintiffs who have like clean stories not just like you know some dude who from north korea is like hey why are you taking my money away um it's somebody who's like i i one of the stories was a cordev who was getting paid for something and one of their neighbors was like hey i heard that you're in ethereum and uh and then he was like huh i should like use tornado to like hide the money they're making because this person apparently was like tracking something i didn't chain like some nft purchase or something there's some some story like this also i think preston this is preston right i don't know i think this is him uh he also had this thing where like there was some point vitalik sent him like a large amount of east to pay for prism not for like and that's what funded one of these client development groups but i think people inferred that as like he got that and it like i think that also led to some security things for him with like people trying to impersonate him and message send messages to vitalik to say like send more money oh oh so like he had a lot of good reasons yeah they were they were just like people were spoofing his identity a lot yeah there's you don't have to have a good reason to want financial privacy right let's you just to have good reasons but generally speaking you shouldn't have to have good reasons but anyway so yeah yeah so it was preston van loon and um i mean the overall picture so in in the last episode uh i came out kind of calling out coinbase and saying that i thought they were going to roll over i cannot be wrong so maya culpa congrats to coinbase for sticking up uh as somebody somebody said that this is the best pr that coinbase could have possibly done and it was like surprisingly cheap for how much credibility it won them and i think it's well deserved um but somebody else was telling me that they thought actually this was a really bad move by coinbase um or so i should say not a bad move in terms of coinbase for pr purposes but a bad move with respect to getting treasury to back off and the way that they put it to me and i don't i don't know if i agree with this i don't have enough context i don't know enough about how these kind of things play out what they were what they were claiming to be somebody who spends a lot more time you know with people on capitol hill i don't know robert you might have a better perspective is that treasury is people too and when you sue someone they get mad and they get scared and they dig in and they like you know really what would have been best from the industry on the whole is to give treasury a way out and to like help them save face in trying to back off from these things is clearly the reaction that they were got that they got was not what they expected uh and there are probably a lot of people scrambling to figure out like oh crap like everyone seems to be really pissed about this what do we do going straight to a lawsuit makes it very very difficult for them to actually walk it back if that's in fact a possibility now maybe it's not maybe there are things we don't know about treasury digging in their feet um but this is like the nuclear option is the way that it was described to me i don't know if that is a good assessment yeah i mean it's definitely an escalation right and you know i think it's too early to you know tell whether it's going to be successful or not i think there's a lot of merit to the lawsuit that was filed i think there's a good chance that the arguments come through you know i think from what i've heard that you know a lot of the folks in treasury didn't necessarily even understand that there was a difference between tornado and other mixing services and they didn't appreciate the difference between a smart contract based system versus a centralized mixer and they are radically different and that a lot of people are just caught off guard by the backlash and you know it's you know hard to say whether you know it's going to make them more willing to concede that they were wrong or less you know i would hope that you know it would be a wake-up call to say like wow if it's creating this much pushback like we clearly didn't do our homework enough on this um so i i'm optimistic that the lawsuit is actually gonna help and i don't think it's gonna cause anyone to dig in their heels i hope that people are able to say like you know what there wasn't enough homework done we thought all mixers were all mixers it turns out that you know we're getting into base layer you know and smart contract censorship here and like raising issues that were not anticipated at all nobody wants to see north korea succeed right like i don't think anyone's advocating for the illegal uses of it you know it's just a matter of wow more care needs to go into making you know existential changes to how sanctions work going from sanctioning people and businesses to sanctioning autonomous programs so i'll bring in some bit of history here i'm totally totally in line with what you said so do you guys remember the 90s when like the internet was getting to be bigger and bigger and all these all these forums including 4chan were beginning to pop up and you could go anywhere and you could say anything senator blah blah blah is a jackass or what have you and so this really pissed off a lot of people on capitol hill and there was a lot of talk about one concept that some of your viewers may not have heard about but was called the driver's license for the internet there was legislation attempts to to mandate a driver's license for the internet and and the core reason being that old people on capitol hill could not handle other people saying whatever the hell they want on on the internet and uh so this mobilized everybody the internet you know the old old ietf crowd do the internet engineering task force everybody there got mobilized to try to educate the lawmakers and say look there's an ethos associated with the internet there's also technology these two things don't really allow what you want to have done here and if you try to do this you will not achieve your policy aims it's a parallel to uh to the exact situation we have with tornado cache and privacy on blockchains and in that case the techies won right we have the internet we have today it's not censored uh when law enforcement wants to do something they have the hooks that they need and they it's a sort of a co-evolution right they evolved to a point where they got the hooks that they they needed and the technology gave them access in just the way that they wanted but they end up getting those hooks from the edge right they never had to ban uh what what you do on a carrier like a t never has to look at your packets to see you know they don't listen to your phone conversations to see if you're doing an illegal convo they don't look at your data and uh but now with this tornado cache thing we're going towards a move where somebody has to look at what you're doing on the blockchain so so there are great parallels there and in this case on the blockchain side there's a they stepped outside of historical precedent and they got the backlash so we'll see how this plays out but i do agree that the lawsuit does does notch everything up on that yeah it's a fascinating analogy um what do you feel like you know from from your perspective what do you feel like it is that the industry needs to do better in order to get the same kind of uh the the the same kind of community on board with this idea they're like hey the internet the internet doesn't have this notion of a driver's license and blockchain shouldn't either right so that's a separate conversation and and and i i've been thinking about it a lot so this is the blockchain community is strictly smaller than the internet crowd right and there is a very vocal crowd that is anti-blockchain and uh some of them are hardcore techies too they're like i've got my stock options i've got my cushy job at large blue chip company and i hate the blockchain and they hate it with a passion right and it's really interesting you see this you see this culture clash and so what does it take to get all these people on board to say look we're all fighting for the same thing financial freedom breaking down monopolies and even playing field and so we need to do a lot better in reaching out we need to do a lot better at policing ourselves and the maximalism that came with some of the earlier systems do not help us right this whole like we're going to take down governments there's only going to be one coin for the entire world etc that that extreme libertarian idealism etc it doesn't really win new friends you you really gotta admit that there's a bigger world out there that you need to integrate into i think as a group we need to back down from one of the core narratives in blockchains which is i will build you a single chain to rule the world i think people have to admit as an industry we have to win it's time to admit that there can't be a single chain that suits every need what you build for the us will not satisfy the people in europe will not satisfy the people in china etc etc so when we were building avalanche that's why we went to this different architecture with multiple chains avalanche is not a single chain it's not three chains it's actually a multitude of chains so that was that was part of our vision um and it's an underappreciated fact that uh that the industry has to grapple with i guess the other thing about this whole concept of suing treasury and making this into a big fight right like it's clearly an escalation of what came before um the other thing it brings to mind is that like coinbase seems to be for whatever reason right like it feels to me like ftx versus coinbase ftx has been super friendly um they obviously got into this uh spat with the cftc uh when they were doing the hearings about have this vertical as that's right oh that's right that's right oh yeah for ftx us and their insurance stuff um but uh i feel like sam has been very collaborative with government it feels like coinbase has been like i mean coinbase like went to the map with the sec over the coinbase earned thing they are like digging their heels in on a lot of the listed assets on coinbase saying like hey if you think these securities come and get it like some because there was the when the sec issued the what was the one where they listed like seven tokens and they said they were securities nine tokens for the insider trading the insider that was right it was the inside trading case where they they dropped these things that statement that nine of these uh tokens were securities that were traded uh coinbase said we're not gonna be listening to the one that's not in the u.s doesn't has it's much easier to do yes i think being in the u.s is way but fdx has a big u.s presence you have a huge u.s presence but you know it's so arms like hq is offshore you know right right you you don't you don't have to you don't have to like fight for survival in the same way i feel like that's true you're the worst case what's the worst case you get rid of the u.s unit which volume wise it's a small yeah it's a small portion so it's like i i would argue that it's all it reflects that corporate structuring difference that like coinbase can't get out of that they're forever a us guy even if they tried to move yeah they would just be like the us's and trying to get rid of theirs all of their team is here yeah they're obviously traded corporations here like they've picked you know their jurisdiction and you know personally you know i don't think you should have to you know look offshore to like be a successful company i fully agree with that i fully agree with it's such a red flag for me in my book that you know a company that's based here started here drew its human resources from here ought to be here so if if if somebody's going off it's a red flag if somebody has to go off you're driving them offshore that's another red flag it's red flags all around but it also you know i'm curious about that how it came to be that coinbase with such a large u.s presence has less influence on the hill than ftx so is it clear that they do or is it just that coinbase is horrible at pr that's like the thing i've never been able to take i can't tell i can't tell i i think it's pretty clear that we're still a very young industry like the internet industry when it first started even after having lots of money had no idea how to talk to lawmakers and how to talk to regulators so i think there's a learning curve to this stuff i think the first mover has the worst time at doing that that's also true it's like the oldest sibling yeah definitely not trying to say like there wasn't some skill or planning in ftx's moves but they had the huge benefit of watching coinbase fail so many times that's true that's true but also like the parents chill out a bit after the first year yeah i spent a little bit of time talking to lawmakers and um it's it's it's interesting how united uh the blockchain interested lawmakers to both in congress and then senate they are like regardless of which ideology right so both democrats and republicans you know they get it and um uh so i was very pleasantly surprised at the level of sophistication that these people have i think something in sam's favorite is i think is his parents are lobbyists so i think that's part of the law professors ah okay okay law obvious i see all right that's a great it's a great line wow i i mean okay one funny fact of a news article i learned of something i learned this week since we're talking about ft access so i guess ftx invested in scaramucci's recent skype oh yeah but then skybridge invested in ftx and it's like there's lots of this type of stuff in crypto but this was the most publicly like funny like like like you go to both the websites yeah no i i mean not to be you know um cynical about it but you know if you buy 30 of skybridge for like 30 million dollars then direct you know 100 million dollars of assets into your own vehicle that you're charging 220 off and and fees buying on your exchange right it's yeah you basically come out ahead for free you know like very cynically i think it was a brilliant investment if it was so self-serving i just think it's funny to it's funny people used to be very careful about hiding all these like recursive loops that live in crypto and this was one of the more blatantly obvious yeah one of the more obscene yeah you know are you gonna spend much time with mooch no you have you have you i don't know okay i don't know how he ended up in this industry he's very random to me i don't know what his uh i don't really understand what he brings to the team we're growing like the the space is growing everybody wants to be in the crypto industry that's true he's he's run the successful conference i'll give him isn't it right now yes yes right now yeah yeah so it's you know it think about this way as you go down the level of sophistication of the investor table you still you have this huge stack that still hasn't come into the space and you need the the the people who tell the narrative on the way down well the last piece of news i mean did you guys see today that there was a rumor that fidelity was going to start directing retail capital into crypto i i don't know if it's founded or unfounded but i was reading that on the internet today nova was [Laughter] yeah fidelity is a strong group i would not be surprised that's good to hear so the other thing torino that i've seen it's not so much that the big folks moved in and then the smaller fish are coming in um so i've been seeing large so first of all when i was a professor all these funds that were coming into crypto would come to us and they'd be like hey we need some academics and trustworthy individuals who can tell us what we need to pay attention to as we make investments into crypto so i knew hedge funds were coming six six months before they were coming in and in a similar fashion i started seeing really large but very slow players starting with canadian retirement funds start to go into crypto investing in celsius yeah that's a great track tracker that's true but there are there are large funds sources of money that are coming into the space even in the bear market so i just mean but those people rely on these this like other layer of fees industry like cambridge associates and people to like direct them to what to invest and like that's what moot that's scaramucci is he's like he's the he's the he's like below some other geppetto all right that's good okay all right so last question before we wrap uh let's say september 15th the merge goes through it is all successful what do you do the day after the merge robert what do you do eat steak eat steak hopefully are you vegetarian no oh you're not gonna say hopefully i i already was just drunk and so oh you're driving you're gonna be drooling through the merch yeah hangover so you're like alcohol your blood alcohol levels like it converge with like the difficulty level yeah exactly and then at that point it's like oh man that's perfect that's perfect with tyrone you know i haven't got much to be done i want the merge to be done i'd stop i'd stock up on food because after the merge like these proof-of-stake systems have failer modes that uh are different from proof-of-work proof-of-work is a very robust very well-understood technology once you switch the proof-of-stake i can tell you firsthand that it is not the world's easiest and you can have and solana people will tell you the same thing right you can have loops in there you can have recursive feedback loops that cause problems for you so i'd stock up on popcorn okay okay so oh i thought you're saying stock up on food because the economy goes up we're like we're like stock up on food yeah doesn't work yeah that's right it'll work it'll work for you yeah you just started like all the plumbing goes out like the lights and then it's pretty soon world doesn't run on ethereum yet yeah it's getting there unless except in dubai uh that's the one smart city stuff did you do you remember the simpsons episode on the only y2k where like we y2k hits and the the the street lights are shooting lasers at people we're not quite you know this week actually speaking of news i just learned about the 2038 problem oh yeah yeah i just learned about this this week it's like the next y2k 2013 this is actually serious yeah this is really serious january 9th i believe 2038 like all time is calculated you know since 1970 and we start to get an overflow on january 32-bit time period yeah the beginning of the unix epoch was uh was 1970 yeah yeah yeah and so it runs do you overrun the 32-bit counter in 2013 people are using 32-bit the elevators will stop i need a lot of oil they'll drop you out of it okay good what do you think is probability that merge fails oh excuse me what you're zero percent no no no no yes zero percent zero exactly zero percent failure of uh of the merge on uh when every thursday whenever it is and um i would say 100 expectation i would say of a liveness failure in the next six months that's my that's a good prediction market let's see but i'm hoping obviously listen i don't want this misinterpreted i wanted to of course succeed yeah so uh but i do know how hard these systems are to build so let's see how it plays in and they have had liveness failures on test net so without any uh any financial incentives to play funny games yeah so yeah or if anything maybe an incentive not to play the games if you know of vulnerability pocket it and then hit it on main net and short short coin i don't think anyone's really that sophisticated but we'll see i think the people who are that sophisticated are nice people i think they tell you i think the people who are that sophisticated are going to play like games instead yeah yeah but the real thing mev game is like if the pow fork even kind of gets alive and just like that will be the king i mean i really want someone to just make a bridge to the people like the pow people their way of like saving face and becoming a layer too is like oh here's a bridge that we forked that you can reach to infrastructure to run that bridge yeah okay tara's was one node fair enough that worked out like clearly i don't expect anything less than similar for this fork based on their discard okay well i think we're i think we're at time thank you very much goon for coming on and sharing your sharing your wisdom and thanks for having me your optimism about everything going on that's it from us see you guys in a couple weeks
