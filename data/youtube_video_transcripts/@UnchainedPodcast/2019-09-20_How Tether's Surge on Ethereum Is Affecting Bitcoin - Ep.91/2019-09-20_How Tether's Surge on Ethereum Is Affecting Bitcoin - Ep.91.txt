metrics welcome Jacob hi Lauren thanks for having me daily transaction fees on aetherium are overtaking those on Bitcoin what exactly are we seeing there yeah it's a great question so on September 15th we saw the kind of total daily fees on ethereum surpassed Bitcoin and we wrote about this in our newsletter I want to give a shout out to Nate Majeure who's our head of research and our newsletter team but it's important important for us to kind of clarify what we mean by by daily fees so here we're talking about the cumulative sum of all of the fees across all transactions in the day and that's important to distinguish between kind of the individual or mean fee per transaction and something we'll talk a little bit about later but fees are important because they're kind of an indicator of overall usage and demand so the higher demand for something the more people are willing to pay for something and fees kind of combine two important metrics so they combine you know the transaction count and the fee per transaction and so it gives you a nice kind of holistic measure of demand and allows you to get a sense of kind of overall usage of these different chains now this is actually not the first time that that fees on aetherium have surpassed fees on Bitcoin for a few months in 2018 actually this was the case for more than a you know for most of that period actually but I think what happened in 2019 is we saw a large separation between Bitcoin where he's really surpassed aetherium and then only recently has there been a sharp decline in fees on Bitcoin and a sharp rise on aetherium and I think you know maybe that has led to the community kind of noticing this and starting to talk about it on Twitter and there's a lot of kind of potential interesting reasons for that and so before we go into those reasons I'm just curious you know you said that this can mean this is a number that represents both total number of transactions as well as the amount of the fees and so is it both federal or is like one of them really kind of the main cause for this yeah it's a great question you know please themselves the actual price or the fee per transaction is somewhat set by the market right and that really depends on on market conditions it depends on you know really whether the chains full and kind of some of those dynamics I think what's driving it is probably more so the transaction counts in this case and in particular what we've seen is is the rise of tether you know the meteoric rise of tether on aetherium and somewhat the decline of tether on omni and so omni is this kind of you know second or separate layer protocol that's actually built on top of Bitcoin and every transaction on Omni is actually a transaction on Bitcoin and we've seen you know just over the last year month or so a kind of sharp decline in the transactions on Omni of tether you know tethers this stable coin and we've seen a real meteoric rise going back to April of this year on aetherium to the point where transactions of tether on aetherium are now 25% of all transactions on the etherium network and at a time you know tether was about 15% or more of the transactions on the Bitcoin network and so that shift of from-from of tether from you know from Bitcoin or Omni to aetherium has kind of probably been partly the the cause of this difference in fees and is it that the number of tether transactions so we'll wait so just to be clear there's basically now two versions of tether one that is on this omni layer of the Bitcoin network and one is on aetherium yeah is actually more there's actually a version on a OS there's a version on Tron and I believe there's a version on Algar and there's also a euro version that is that is on Omni and I think launching on a theorem has already launched so there's a few different versions the etherium version actually launched in 2017 but basically was flat for almost two years and it's unclear why or what has led to the this kind of shift but it all of a sudden woke up in April of 2019 and has just been exponentially increasing ever since whereas you've seen a reduction in you know transactions on on the Bitcoin network or on Omni there may be a few different reasons for that some think that it's due to you know quicker kind of or fewer confirmation times and so traders that are performing arbitrage might prefer it tether on a theorem is also near c20 token and so there's a lot of kind of network effects and just good infrastructure wallet infrastructure other you know the the option to interact with other spar contracts and other kind of defy potential you know applications that might be part of it as well it's not entirely clear to me why why that rises happens yeah I mean the thing is like the block size on a theorem has always been shorter so I don't understand why suddenly in April people would be like oh well the blocks and the block times on a theory or is so much shorter do you know what I mean like like why indeed like in April I don't understand how that would be connected and then yeah anyway uh-huh okay so I wonder like I'm just blanking on when the news came out about the New York Attorney General's charges against tether do you know if that I think that was later wasn't it yeah that's a great question I think it was I don't have the data in front of me I think it was after April and I think your question is a good one in the sense of you know why why then and I don't have a great answer to it you know other than you know the few things that I've suggested the fees on on a theorem are also the individual fees to transact are also lower so it's possible that you know certain you know high frequency traders or others that they kind of make a lot of trades and and the individual fee cost is important for that you know that might have started it too but why it was so dramatic and came out of nowhere is really hard to explain at least for me at the moment hmm yeah because the other thing that you suggested about the defy movement is that's been around for a while too I mean granted obviously it's been super small and so maybe it was just in April when kind of a critical mass heard about it um you know I mean granted that is relatively new it's not like brand new or it wasn't brand new in April but it was relatively new then so okay alright well maybe if if I kind of suss out what what the contents is in another episode all I'll try to explain that so one other thing is that I noticed in the analysis you guys release that the usage of gas on etherium you know traditionally has been for like ether transactions tether ERC 20 and then ERC 721 which ERC 20 is like you know the different tokens on a theory me or c7 21 is the non-functional Kogan's but those transactions have actually declined compared to the demand for gas for other types of contracts and you guys have this like great little graphic showing that but I didn't know like when you see other types of contracts like what what's an example of some of those other kinds of contracts yeah so a great question and and what we've seen basically is a large increase and if you look actually across all the whole history of aetherium and you look at kind of the gas used for transaction what you see is just a steady rise up and to the right which is indicating that transactions on a theorem are getting more complex you know essentially they're requiring more gas for transaction and so a very simple operation on on the if you're in virtual machine like sending you know ether to to and from a certain wallet is is it has a low cost but as you start to interact with more complex contracts those have a larger gas cost and depending on the gas market will will tend to have higher fees and so you know I think part of this is is do you know specifically to the rise and defy or other applique there's also gambling applications and and you kind of see a lot of these interesting you know I don't want to necessarily call them Ponzi applications but sometimes they look like that but that have more complex contracts and that require you know more gas in general it's hard to say I haven't kind of done a deep dive into exactly which contracts are rising in that kind of other you know non air-sea non non here c20 or c 7:21 bucket but i suspect it's largely due to the rise in defy and just more complicated contracts things like maker Dow and you know synthetics and a lot of these other kind of interesting applications and one thing I also wanted to ask was you know obviously when you look at this graphic of which I'll try to put in the show notes of the transactions on Bitcoin versus if you're the transaction fees on Bitcoin versus that theorem it really feels like it's more about the dramatic drop in transaction daily transaction fees on Bitcoin rather than it is I mean you can see that there is this you know various kind of slow and gradual rise on aetherium but I wondered like you know is part of the drop on Bitcoin because there are more transactions migrating to layer two do you know what I'm saying that like we can't see yeah it could be a part of that I mean my understanding of lightning is that you know the growth has been a little bit small it is hard to tell because it is somewhat private and if you're not running a no you can't necessarily observe you know what's happening on the network I think if you look at the graph though of Bitcoin fees you know again total daily fees and you look at tethered transactions the to actually follow one another quite closely and really in the last you know several months or so you can see kind of this steady decline of tether transactions that seem to coincide with the decline in fees so Bitcoin has also increased its batching so you can actually you know batch transactions and include more transfers per transaction and you actually save a little bit on fees in that way as well so it could be you know a few things coming together tether it could be things moving to lightning it could be more particularly exchanges or batching which is reducing the overall fees then you are seeing a little bit of a rise in fees on on a theorem as well and so those two things coinciding could could be you know resulting in what we're seeing now the big question is whether this is going to continue and is this just a blip you know it's already kind of reverted so Bitcoin over the last few days is doing you know more in daily fees than than aetherium but what's interesting is on aetherium that the miners have now been voting up the gas limit and so effectively increasing theorems blocksize by something like 12% and if theorem is a little bit different from Bitcoin in that it has a dynamic limit it you know the gas limit sets the per block that's the kind of block size it's not fixed bitesize as it is on Bitcoin and so miners can actually dynamically incrementally in small steps increase the the you know the block size by voting up the gas limit and so if they're doing that because the demand has been at the ceiling kind of for a while it's possible that this trend will continue and if tethers growth continues as well you know soon soon it might you know soon we might get to a point where the theorem is kind of continuously above Bitcoin and at that point who knows maybe each other will continue to migrate you know more and more to Yasir or some of these other chains but you know all of that kind of remains to be seen all right so we're gonna discuss a little bit more on this topic as well as some of the differences in the various Bitcoin Forks but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer-to-peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations cipher trace is working on this vision of the future sign up to stay up to date on the privacy enhanced compliance initiative and receive authoritative crypto AML reports quarterly WWF retraced calm /keep crypto clean back to my conversation with Jacob Franek so one other thing that I was wondering about this you know Bitcoin vs. aetherium daily transaction fees does the fullness of either chain affect the numbers meaning like are these numbers less of a proxy of demand on both chains if the fullness of the blocks on either chain is sort of preventing us from seeing like how much demand there it really is or would be without that limit yes the fullness of the chains really impacts you know both the transaction count and and the the price right and so as blocks become full you know the demand for block space becomes higher and people start to you know start to you know raise the fees in order to get their transactions through you know theorem in general processes at the moment about more than twice the number of transactions that per day than Bitcoin so even though the cost is a little bit lower like the cost per transaction right now at least the fees is a little bit lower just by the simple fact that it's processing so many more transactions you know the fees or fees are a little bit higher but you know as that becomes full definitely you know the fees are going to start to go up again and so for Bitcoin it's probably going to be correlated you know with the decline in tether is probably going to be correlated more with price and and you know perhaps the next bull market you're going to start to see again fees starting to rise dramatically it just depends really on demand and what you know what Leber's are being pulled there I know there's also you know very block transactions that are starting to fill up the Bitcoin chain and so there's other things that might start to compete for blog space that could result in in more fees okay so that's actually the perfect segue to our next discussion about like the different Bitcoin Forks but so why don't we just briefly can you just describe what very block is yeah I'm actually not super familiar with véra block and I know that it's a way of kind of finalizing things from another chain restoring data I unfortunately haven't spent myself personally too much time digging into it so I don't have a great answer for you there okay well so you know you guys did do this analysis on Bitcoin and the various Forks what factors did you guys look at and what were your findings yeah so coin metrics wrote a research piece about Bitcoin cash versus Bitcoin sv versus Bitcoin and the genesis of this was actually a legacy asset manager who wanted to enter into a position into Bitcoin and they were having some internal debates about you know which Bitcoin to enter in and some of your you know listeners might think of that's kind of silly or that it should be obvious but obviously if you're entering into the space you know fairly nascent or you haven't been in the space a long time it can be a little bit confusing and what's important to kind of you know tease this tease this out was trying to identify what the value proposition of these different coins were and then how did that relate to things that we were seeing on chain and so Bitcoin cash forked from Bitcoin as part of a you know block size debate and proponents of Bitcoin cash believed that Bitcoin was increasingly becoming a store of value and not a medium of exchange the latter of which they thought was kind of more aligned with the original purpose of Bitcoin so bch Forge at forked or Bitcoin cash or bch forked and increase the block size from one megabyte to 32 and then bsv later fork from bch so bitcoin sv satoshis vision later forked from Bitcoin cash and further increased the block size to 128 megabytes and then also reduced the restrictions on storing data so that you know you could store kind of more data on the chain itself and I think the quote was you know to unshackle the the data storage use case so this was kind of the pretense that we entered into this you know research piece trying to understand okay these are the different value propositions and then how does that actually align with what we see on chain and in order to do this we looked at kind of three different analyses so one was what we call the medium of exchange analysis to look at new transactions fees transfer volume you know see these different indicators that would look at how you know whether these coins were being used more as a store value or more as a medium of exchange we also looked at the block size and then finally we looked at a security analysis looking at hash rate minor revenue and a few other things and so what what did you find in terms of how they are being used yeah so starting with the kind of medium of exchange analysis you know we saw that fees are indeed lower on on Bitcoin cash in Bitcoin SV right so you know they wanted to increase the block size and by increasing the block size you can you know you increase the throughput and potentially lowered fees right so we did see that you know in fact the the I think the median fee was almost zero on both Bitcoin cash in Bitcoin SV but really that was driven just because of by little usage of either change so there was far fewer transactions on both chains compared to Bitcoin there was far fewer active addresses and a lower overall transfer volume and interestingly Bitcoin SV was predominantly being used as a way to record data on change so something like 94% plus of all transactions contained in OP return code which is essentially the way of storing you know just storing data on the chain and not actually doing anything economic so not actually transferring units of Bitcoin SV and a majority of those 94 percent so 94 percent of them are being used to store data only and a majority of those were coming from a single weather application so single weather app was storing you know weather data on chain and so when we wrote this piece we kind of tweeted that out and the community you know kind of took that and ran with it and thought was pretty interesting because that's something that just doesn't come out when you're just looking at a kind of raw transaction counts and so you know there is a potential that with bigger blocks and lower fees that Bitcoin cash in Bitcoin SV could be used more as a medium of exchange but we just aren't seeing it yet today I mean there's far fewer transactions and and so on and know what is the purpose of putting weather data on bsv yeah my sense is just to you know enter it into an immutable blockchain you know I'm not too familiar with the kind of value proposition of this application I mean I guess the idea is to have an immutable record of weather data and potentially somehow you know sell that through the block I'm not I'm not exactly sure how you know the business model of that would work I don't know if there's a an issue with you know fake weather or climate data so I'm not sure what was the genesis I don't know if this was just kind of testing it I personally haven't dug too much into it but I think the idea was just to have it on an immutable record so that there was a historical record of whether for that day well Vitalik booter and the creative etherium also I think he twit can't remember he might have weeded that he thought maybe be a Bitcoin cash and bsv should be used as data storage for other block chains does it look like that's kind of already happening or or no is is it really just this one app yeah I don't think there's too much evidence of other block chains yet storing data on on Bitcoin or so on I believe actually that's somewhat what bear block is doing in terms of kind of storing hashes from another chain on and using Bitcoin security but we haven't really seen that across other chains I think it's an interesting idea I mean obviously you know there's only so much block space there's only so much information that you can store on Bitcoin or so on so you know some other chains might look to store maybe hashed or other kind of you know condensed versions of information on these kind of more secure chains I think it's an interesting idea I just I'm not sure what the demand for the market is I'm still somewhat a you know money maximalist in the sense that you know for me the most interesting thing about public blockchain so far is the money and kind of related applications so I'm not sure there's a strong you know use case yet out there but you know V telex floated kind of different ideas like you know diplomas and and things like that storing kind of those kind of immutable records where we're having a permanent record of something on chain might be useful and but like if you do that how does that affect the crypto economics like will the chain be secure enough like is it really then just you know the miners earned their block reward and yeah I'm just wondering like will the value of the coin be enough that the whole thing will work out and and the chain will be secured do you see what I'm saying yeah I mean that's one of the long-term questions and that's one of I think one of the things that led to Bitcoin s fee you know forking from Bitcoin cash you know was this idea that they wanted to store additional information on chain things like invoices and you know things that don't are probably part of an economic transaction but we're seeing is even non-economic things being stored on the chain and to your point I mean what's the you know is that really gonna be enough to confer value and and and and helped keep the chain secure and in fact when we looked at our kind of security analysis I mean bitcoins hash rate you know dominates that of the coin has to be in Bitcoin cash and in fact when Bitcoin has to be forked from Bitcoin cash it effectively split its hash rate in half and weakened it even further and so you know hash rates one thing and then you look at the overall minor revenue and similarly Bitcoin kind of dominates both of those now obviously all of that is driven to some degree by demand and so it's possible that this will change in the future but you can imagine if you know Bitcoin is paying it security you know through through minor revenue multiple you know many multiples more than these other chains it's just going to attract a larger you know market of hash rate and so it seems it's gonna be quite challenging for these other chains you know without having a kind of clear use case or clear demand to compete long term because the hash rate is just so you know the value of what you can earn on those chains as a minor is just so much smaller and last quick question before we hop off but I was just curious does it look to you like either of these chains will ever be used as a medium of exchange yeah it's a great question I mean I think it's still the jury's out it's still quite a bit early right so the for these Forks have only happened recently but you know I'm somewhat of a store of value maximalists myself in the sense that you know people have to accept a currency right there has to be for currency to be used as a medium of exchange somebody else has to want to keep it right it has to want to hold it and so it's hard in my mind to have a chain or have an asset become valuable if it's only use cases is a medium of exchange and if you look back in over monetary history you know these things kind of evolved in different ways by typically there's something that drives the kind of you know wanting people wanting to hold it right something intrinsic to the asset has to be there in order for there to be enough demand for somebody else to accept it and that's kind of where you you lean a little bit more on the store value use case first I think it's interesting there's a lot of different models you know grin is trying to be you know highly inflationary and and trying to win that kind of medium of exchange use case I'm just not convinced you know without a strong intrinsic you know or set of strong intrinsic properties that there's enough impetus there for you know someone else to want to accept it but it still is early and and you know perhaps that some of these data storage kind of use cases or applications might find we might find Annie sure or you know that killer app might emerge I'm a little skeptical but I I think it's you know I think it's a little too hard to say at this time yeah yeah well as we always say it's still early days alright well thank you so much for
