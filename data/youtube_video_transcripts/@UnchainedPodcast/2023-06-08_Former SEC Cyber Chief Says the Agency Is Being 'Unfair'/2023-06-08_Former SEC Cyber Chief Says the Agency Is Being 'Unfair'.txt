when the SEC says that a token is a security and was not registered they seem to at least be implying that something wrong happened there not only by the defendant in that case but they're at least you know casting some negative suggestion on the people who were involved in that token in the first place hi everyone I'm here with Rob Cohen partner at Davis Polk I know that there is one particular aspect of the cases that the SEC brought against finance and coinbase that you can talk about and I'm so eager to pick your brain on those which is the fact that a number of these tokens are being named as Securities um kind of indirectly in these or I mean directly but they're not being named as defendants in these lawsuits so what are your thoughts on the fact that SEC is doing this I think it's pretty unfair it's having a real impact on real people and real businesses it's unfair they're named in a government complaint the tokens are named in a government complaint and the people who created those tokens or whose businesses or livelihoods are really intertwine with those tokens are hugely impacted by those allegations ends but they're not a party they're not there to defend themselves and I understand why the SEC does it I worked at the SEC for a very long time and I think very highly of the agency and the people there but I I do think this particular context is is unfair let's talk a little bit about why you think the SEC is doing that I think they would say it's similar to when they bring an insider trading case so if they sue somebody for insider trading they typically will say in the complaint what companies stock that person traded and I think they view it somewhat similarly but I actually think it's different why do you think in an insider trading case if a company stock is being traded you know by somebody who's committing insider trading nobody's thinking particularly negatively about that company in fact that company is a victim it's their information that is being misused and certainly there's no allegation or suggestion that a company whose stock is traded is itself doing something wrong or committing a Securities Law violation but with these crypto cases it's very different when the SEC says that a token is a security and was not registered they seem to at least be implying that something wrong happened there not only by the defendant in that case but they're at least you know casting some negative suggestion on the people who were involved in that token in the first place one other thing that's so curious is as you mentioned you know these platforms Finance Employments they have hundreds of tokens so it sort of seems kind of unfair that the sqc is just picked a few especially some of the bigger ones that actually probably are a little bit more legitimate than um some of the other tokens that are listed so I was curious why do you think the SEC chose the ones it did it's a good question and it's hard to say and that and I do agree there's I'm sure they had reasons for for picking the tokens that they picked but out of the hundreds of tokens that trade on these platforms there is a seeming element of real bad luck and Randomness and getting singled out to be one of the 10 or 12 tokens that are mentioned when there's hundreds that could have been and when you think about a government taking action that sort of Randomness seems rather unfair if the SEC were passing rules it affects everyone the same way and people have a chance to comment so why the SEC picked them I mean it seems like they may have picked tokens that represent different types of Industries within the crypto world and tokens of different sizes but you know they certainly obviously are not saying you know how or why they pick those and by the way this may never get decided these tokens get named in a complaint but these these complaints may never actually go to trial they might get settled they might get dismissed for other reasons there's all kinds of reasons why there may never actually be a decision on whether that token is a security for example this came up in The Insider training case the SEC filed not that long ago and in that case they named a number of tokens and this process happened then where these tokens were named they were not parties they could not defend themselves and then those individuals who were accused of insider trading are largely settling so you know those allegations are out there but they're never going to get decided by a judge or a jury and in the coinbase and binance complaints those cases could easily litigate for years look at the Ripple litigation how long has that been going on that's been going on for years and there Ripple is present to defend itself here these allegations may be out there for years they may never get decided it's very different come on [Music]
