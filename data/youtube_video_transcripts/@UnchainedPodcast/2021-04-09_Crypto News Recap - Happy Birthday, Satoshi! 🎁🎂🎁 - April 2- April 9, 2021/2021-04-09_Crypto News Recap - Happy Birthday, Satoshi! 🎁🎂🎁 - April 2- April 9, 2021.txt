transformative new technology the cci's inception comes in the same week that in a letter to shareholders jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon who infamously declared bitcoin a fraud in 2017 included the quote regulatory status of cryptocurrencies as an emerging issue in the us that the u.s must deal with if it is to bounce back from the economic fallout from covet 19. regulations regarding crypto remain

compared to q4 of 2020. as if despite the bubble-popping narrative the nft headlines were just as wacky as usual if not more so a few of the more interesting stories include tom brady and peyton manning are now fighting for nft supremacy brady the seven-time super bowl champion is launching an nft platform called autograph seeking to extend the idea of an autograph into the digital world manning along with his brother eli is set to launch the manning legacy collection made up of eight unique art pieces through maker's place on april 16th forbes my former employer dropped an nft of its

understanding of how nfts work or what they may become i highly recommend this nft canon by a16c a carefully curated collection of articles and resources for the nft curious next headline ripple wins lawsuit for access to internal sec communications on crypto in december the sec announced a lawsuit against ripple labs claiming that xrp was a security and that the company had raised more than 1.3 billion dollars in unregistered offerings on tuesday ripple labs won a discovery ruling that will require the sec to hand over internal communications on how it determines whether a cryptocurrency is a security the sec does not consider bitcoin and ether to be securities but has not issued any formal guidance explaining how it arrived at those conclusions ripple likely hopes the sec mentions xrp as a virtual currency similar to btc and eth which would help its case to be treated as a non-security barring a blatant mention of xrp in the same vein as bitcoin and ethereum the ruling could still offer the general public its first in-depth look at how the sec regulates crypto ripple labs its token xrp is up nearly 20 since the report broke next headline vc-backed stablecoin protocol fey is off to a shaky start faye and an algorithmic stable coin pegged to the dollar recently concluded its genesis event in total the protocol minted 1.3 billion of its fey tokens as a stable coin fey got off to a shaky start trading between 5 cents and 10 cents off the targeted 1 mark for the first few days before tanking to under 80 cents on thursday the situation emphasizes the difficulties in creating an algorithmic stablecoin the protocol aimed to create a stablecoin that would purchase assets outright with its token rather than holding them as collateral like a tether fei is created with a trade instead of debt however a vulnerability in its incentive mechanism made it prohibitively expensive for users to sell in the days following the genesis event to enforce its peg faye had established a uniswap burn penalty that penalizes traders for transacting with fey under its one dollar peg and a reway of fae tokens on uniswep that burns underpegged tokens thereby increasing demand back to one dollar however eventually the penalty became so high that at times the burns would exceed 100 of a trades value effectively making the token worthless when attempting to sell it on uniswap additionally the team was alerted to a bug via its bug bounty program and so it had to suspend the minting rewards that come with buying fey leaving only the sell disincentives faye currently has a market cap of 1.6 billion dollars next headline messaging app signal to integrate cryptocurrency payment feature signal an encrypted messaging app is rolling out payments using the fair cryptocurrency mobile coin unlike whatsapp and imessage which allow payments to be sent via bank accounts signal is looking to provide a way to send money that nobody outside the sender or recipient can track while zcash and monero are the most popular cryptocurrencies with that sort of privacy capability signal chose mobile coins for its user experience minimal storage requirements and quick transaction time in a blog post announcing the news signal clarified that it would not have access to user balances transaction history or funds while many in the crypto community expressed excitement there were also a few dissenting voices matt corrallo a developer at square crypto tweeted there is no technical justification for signal requiring its own blockchain in order to get the payment throughput they want there is no reason at all for requiring the token issuance to go entirely to the small number of founders except to maximize profits there is zero reason even to require their own token at all when this could absolutely have been built using existing cryptocurrency systems pegged to traditional fiat currencies which would offer significantly better ux and avoid the massive value fluctuation risk that signal is now hoisting onto its user base next headline china's digital currency head start the wall street journal wrote an in-depth analysis of china's digital yuan calling it quote a first for a major economy the digital yuan launched through a mobile app that has since been downloaded over 100 thousand times the government issued digital money money can be used to track people spending in real time speed relief to disaster victims or flag criminal behavior the article also notes quote the money itself is programmable beijing has tested expiration dates to encourage users to spend it quickly for times when the economy needs a jump start however the wall street journal adds that the digital e1 may also be used to tighten president xi jinping's authoritarian rule as a tracking tool making it possible to collect fines as soon as an infraction is committed the article also points out that the digital yuan could undermine the supremacy of the dollar saying quote it would provide options for people in poor countries to transfer money internationally even limited international usage could soften the bite of u.s sanctions which increasingly are used against chinese companies or individuals josh lipsky a former international monetary fund staffer now at the atlanta council think tank said quote anything that threatens the dollar is a national security issue this threatens a dollar over the long term the wall street journal notes that a chinese marketing campaign depicts a man in an american flag shirt being knocked out by an animated digital yuan conversely paypal
