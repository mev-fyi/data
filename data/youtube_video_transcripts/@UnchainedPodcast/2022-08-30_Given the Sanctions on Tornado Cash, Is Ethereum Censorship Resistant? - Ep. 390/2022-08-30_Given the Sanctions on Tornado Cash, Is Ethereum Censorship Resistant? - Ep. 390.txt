dapps nfts bridges subnets and more today today's topic is how sanctions on tornado cache will affect ethereum at the base layer here to discuss are drew hinkis partner at k l gates an adjunct professor at miu and martin koppelman co-founder of gnosis welcome drew and martin welcome thank you on august 8th the u.s treasury department's office of foreign assets control sanctioned tornado cache a series of autonomous smart contracts on ethereum this was an unprecedented move since previously the only entities ever named to the sanctions left had been organizations or people who had the agency to also appeal to the government to be removed obviously a set of smart contracts cannot defend themselves if you haven't yet be sure to listen to my interviews with jerry brito of coincenter and erie redboard of trm labs for more background on why these sanctions are so consequential the lack of guidance from ofac around this unprecedented move has caused quite a bit of consternation for numerous entities in the ethereum ecosystem and it's raised questions for ethereum itself at a pretty delicate time the blockchain is about to adopt a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and the new validation process involves numerous different entities they all now face the question of whether any action they take that helps validate blocks containing such transactions is a violation of sanctions and the ethereum community is also facing existential questions around how to maintain its censorship resistance despite the presence of a number of these entities which have exposure to us jurisdiction we are going to unpack all of this with one crypto legal mind which is true and one developer who is very familiar with the ins and outs of the new sticking process on ethereum that's martin drew why don't we start with you can you tell us from the legal side what is the significance of these sanctions and why has it been causing such complications sure so ofac maintains a list called the specially designated nationals list and this is a list of uh countries and their nationals who for policy reasons have uh been determined to be subject to sanctions the sanctions prevent u.s persons from engaging in financial transactions with those listed persons their accounts and their property and also renders those who have received property from those persons who renders that property blocked and blocked property cannot be transacted if you're in possession to block property you're required to segregate it in a interest-bearing account and to make rec reports to the government 10 days after you segregate and then annually thereafter these are laws that are designed around fiat they're designed around the system of banks and they're designed around a number of tested assumptions obviously there are limits as to the law as our friends at coin center have noted the law previously has been implemented against people and a bunch of autonomous smart contracts operating at a on a blockchain wallet with no human controlling them probably doesn't qualify as a legal person and as your introductory notes suggested there's no one really to appeal on behalf of those smart contracts and so we have some foundational questions as to whether the exercise of power under the statute is proper it creates some really significant issues as to those who want to comply the smart contracts aren't a person so the value that flows through them maybe isn't necessarily any one person's property if a person sends their assets through the smart contracts and they they are sent out from one of the blocks smart contract addresses you could view it as okay this is blocked property because it came from the address or you could view it as i don't know whose asset this is but there is no person called tornado cash so i don't think that these assets are actually blocked persons assets and so i maybe this isn't blocked property we don't necessarily know if you are in receipt of blocked property that you actually think is blocked property what to do if you were engaged in the fiat world you would have a bank that maintains its own ledger and it could move the dollars or pesos or whatever into a segregated account it would be an interest-bearing account and they've got obligations to report to the government in crypto we don't have banks that handle crypto for us we don't have interest-bearing accounts that the government has blessed i know we all wish that there were um and we certainly don't have any clarity as to what we're supposed to do if we find ourselves with blocked property what's a segregated account do i have to make a new wallet that has its own separate private key and then transfer that blocked property to that new wallet we have seen a law that was put in place for the legacy world being implemented in a new way against a new type of actor if it's even an actor at all and now we're grappling with the fact that we're missing a lot of information that's necessary for everyone to understand their obligations yeah i think there's a number of regulators that listen to my show so if any of them work for ofac then here you go sort of a wish list of what the community is looking for so martin let's turn to you before we get into kind of the intricacies around the upcoming proof of stake system on ethereum can you just explain how um the miners on ethereum under proof of work currently have been reacting to the sanctions we have seen that some miners have well apparently change their behavior so usually or kind of the default behavior would be that as a minor you collect transactions and then you kind of just very simply order them by how much fees they pay and then you put them into blocks kind of that that was initially the default behavior but now we are seeing that some miners have stopped to kind of include transactions yeah into blocks that are touching addresses and what touching even means is also complicated but let's keep at this moment touching touching addresses that are on the sanction list before we even get into all the details around proof of stake i was kind of curious if you at this point or if the community at this point has a sense of whether a proof of work chain or a proof of stake chain would be more censorship resistant yeah i think that is a very um complex topic um i think there are arguments for both i would be leaning towards proof of stake chain can be more censorship resistance resistant but again there are definitely arguments for both so one argument for proof of stake is that in general the number of participants can likely be higher so kind of the concrete example is i myself can without any issue run a proof of stake validator at home while having a competitive miner at home uh kind of is is a much uh yeah kind of more challenging um enterprise okay so you're you're just saying that it's more decentralized under proof of stake is that what you're there are definitely elements that lead can lead to more decentralization of proof of stake yeah all right so now let's dive a little bit more into the details around proof of stake as we just mentioned at the moment the government took this action but there isn't really any guidance around how to implement it so people are concerned about you know which of the steps in approval stake system constitutes a violation of these sanctions and so drew i don't know if you have you know how much you've looked into the different steps here or you know what their level of compliance should be but do you have any sense if there are certain actions that clearly probably would violate sanctions when it comes to validating blocks under proof of stake well well i think we need to take a half step back and think about whether the law even applies to validators we know that there are really two questions here first are validators subject to u.s jurisdiction or are they otherwise engaged in conduct that would cause them to have liability under u.s law the first question has a lot to do with who is where is it a us-based company are they using us-based resources it's common knowledge available online that a considerable amount of the staking validators are using us-based cloud computing platforms and so you've got some connectivity to the united states jurisdiction there a lot of the larger validators are also u.s companies so there's no question in that case that you're going to look at us jurisdiction so then assuming u.s law applies then we look and see whether the specific law at issue applies to the conduct the sanctions apply to what are called financial institutions there's a statute that defines a financial institution and a financial institution is the us entity that's engaged in the business of and there's a whole laundry list of stuff but it's like accepting deposits and making and granting and transferring and brokering loans and credit and selling foreign exchange or securities or futures or options and so forth as a principal or an agent it's not entirely clear whether validators on a base layer of a blockchain are subject to the law what we're looking at here is a mismatch between the legacy concepts that underlie our definitions of who's regulated and what's actually happening on a blockchain on a blockchain you don't have a bank you don't have a registered entity that because they have this dispensation from the government is allowed to take certain acts where they can take custody of third-party property and they can charge interest and they can make loans and do all this instead we have a bunch of people whether they're companies or otherwise that are deciding to deploy technology resources in order to undertake what i would argue is sort of a ministerial function they are taking transactions between two willing parties and they're doing the work that's necessary to make sure that they are validated and that they become part of the canonical history of the transfers undertaken by that blockchain system and so there's a real question that we don't really have a clear answer to as to whether these entities that are providing the service to this technology system are financial institutions at all and if they are not financial institutions then we have to sort of pivot the analysis from as financial institutions what are their obligations to if they're not financial institutions do they otherwise have obligations it's possible if they're not that a conservative approach would suggest that they should still undertake some sort of measures because in this case the juice may not be worth the squeeze sanctions is under u.s law something of a strict liability standard the why you did it or the circumstances in which you violated aren't really that material if you violated you have violated and then there's a process by which you can introduce information about mitigating circumstances and then ofac will decide whether after you violated any sanctions necessary at all the sanctions can range from incarceration to a fine to public description of what happened to nothing and so given the ambiguity and how the law applies at all and given the lack of clarity as to whether these actors have obligations at all it's very hard to come to any conclusion without more information from the government and we could get that information in one of a couple ways the government or ofac could provide us with what are called faqs which lay out additional detail that helps those who believe that they're subject to obligations understand what they can and can't do and how to do it and there's also a process by which information as to what someone can or can't do in light of the sanctioned designation that can be issued generally which would be called a general license a general license might be really helpful in that it might say if you have blocked property here's how you designate it in a sanction in a segregated wallet and if you do these things even if they technically violate we're not going to hold that to be a violation now if you have a specific issue as your specific assets you can ask for something called a a more narrow specific license as opposed to a general license and you get that sort of license if you have a specific piece of property that you believe is blocked but you want some clarity as to what you can or can't do we need more from ofac to really understand whether validators are subject to this law at all and we need more from ofac to understand really practical how do i implement this and when do i implement this sort of questions yeah actually from your comments earlier on um where you were talking about you know whether or not something is a financial institution i happen to see that martin tweeted about a cloud provider that blocked an ethereum user martin can you talk about that because that indicates that yeah some of these tech companies are feeling like they have an obligation to to comply so martin can you talk a little bit about what you saw there right so i think it just shows how how large the uncertainty is about kind of how many layers down the stack are we going so it's unclear whether validator has kind of those obligations even even those might not have the applica those application obligations but now it turns out that even kind of the layer below so yeah a cloud cloud provider in this case it was um hetzner so kind of they they offer some somewhat similar to aws they off make it easy to kind of yeah run an ethereum node in the cloud they have started to be much more strict against ethereum um usage so right now you are on most of their services not allowed kind of to run to just even run an ethereum node even if you are not a validator kind of a complete strict then of um just running ethereum nodes which in my view is pretty insane yeah so and again this is under proof of work so now let's turn to proof of stake and martin why don't you just walk us through what that validation process looks like who the different entities are and then we're going to kind of step by step ask different questions about what they're like what their need is to you know comply with these regulations so just walk us through how that process works yeah so so mainly we are talking about um validators so who are validators validators anyone can be a validator i'm running a validator for ethereum but really anyone can do it with you need a 32 ether and you need to kind of put them in into a smart contract and then you can run a validator and on ethereum there are currently 300 000 of those validators and it is the task of the validators to build to build blocks more or less randomly or yeah randomly kind of for each for each next block one of those validators is chosen and now there are multiple roles so first someone and that can be the validator that can be someone else needs to build a block and that really kind of means taking a bunch of transactions putting them in order and then kind of executing them and then kind of well producing kind of this this new block so the first step is the block building in the next step only for each yeah we call it slot so for a slot is a potential block for each slot there is exactly one validator out of those three hundred thousand chosen and this is the proposer so now this proposal has some time a few seconds to to propose a block that was built again it could be built by themselves it could be built by someone else and now this block can be proposed and in the next step so that's the second step building proposing and the third step is attestations so again for each of those slots there is a subset of all the validators is subset is responsible to a test kind of to a proposed block and as someone or as a validator with the obligation to um a test to a block you have kind of two choices you you you can you wait for the block and if you see it great if you see the correct block by the correct proposal you can attest to that if you don't see that block and that might be the case because the proposer might not be online so that usually rarely happens but it could happen then you would attest to the latest block you know so that's step three at the stations and in a way then step four is this process again and then kind of producing a new block and then building on top of the of that block and i think kind of for all those four steps potentially we need to ask questions around how does this relate to sanctions and kind of is that yeah i mean questions are obvious why don't we just start with the proposers the ones that are you know propagating these blocks out since the you know process of building the block happens with the block builder would validators even know if they're processing a block that has sanctioned transactions in it yeah so that is the so far default behavior is that a builder and the proposer kind of that's that's done by the same uh by the same validator that that is so far um the default but there are um there are a lot of efforts builder proposal separation to yeah to separate those processes and have specialized builders and yeah quite likely that's that's currently a little bit also up in the air but it seems very much that the default software will support again a separation of that so as a as a proposer you can kind of point to to builder either to a single builder or to a network of builders and you kind of get suggestions from different builders and then you could pick the one that is kind of highest paying so if if there is no separation well then obviously as a proposer you know what's in the block because you have been building the block yourself if there is a separation then exactly you're right as a proposer you don't know what's in the block so you kind of ask the builders and what you get from them is just a hash of the block plus a promised kind of payment and that's all you know so you only know this block will pay so much in the next step you would sign it this hash just this hash and only after you signed it then the builder would release would release the block and kind of then those who attest to the block they they again then see the block and see all the transactions oh so only the testers end up seeing the transactions oh this is so interesting so drew when you listen to well so so let before we get to the proposer builder separation part of it so if a validator is both building the block but then also validating it what do you think their liability is here do they need to censor transactions or is it again what you were saying before it's not clear if their function is more financial or technical or yeah i just want to hear you kind of analyze what their liability would be sure we need olfact to give us some more information to understand how all their law all of the obligations that apply to listed addresses and to blocked property should apply in this context what i take away from martin's really clear explanation is that the process of validating is more complex with more actors with different amounts of information one bit of information that i do want to pepper in just to make it even more complicated is the fact that there are hypothetically two different types of transactions that might be of concern one would be transactions that include an address that is listed hypothetically and the other one would include property derived from a listed address which hypothetically could be considered to be blocked obviously hypothetically assuming that there was some sort of obligation it would be a lot easier for anybody looking at a block to look at an address because if it's on this list and it's in the block and you can see the block then hypothetically you can potentially do something about it it strikes me as though it would be incredibly complex and perhaps not practical to further impose the obligation on anyone participating in validation not just to look up addresses but also to try to determine whether a given asset that is to be transacted in a block is blocked properly it's martin will probably tell me that it would be impossible to do so without some dramatic overhaul of the the way that consensus is built or without the addition of other technology tools so i wish that i i wish laura i could tell you that i knew exactly what ofac was thinking i wish i could tell you that i've seen a draft faq or something the government unfortunately does not tell me what they're thinking i find out with everybody else when they decide to tell us the hope is that we will get clarity either in the form of a general license or an faqs that can address some of these questions but for now we're we're stuck in a place where we're speculating and i want i want to build on that so even the first option you mentioned kind of quote unquote just blocking the addresses even that is technically far from trivial because what what is relatively easy is kind of to see if you see a transaction you can relatively easy see it has a from and it has a two however the two can very well be a smart contract and and you don't know what this contract will do and it's absolutely not trivial to figure out in advance what this contract will do so it's possible that you see kind of the promise fine the two is fine but then the two is a contract and it executes some complicated logic and it calls another contract and calls another contract and eventually this other contract then finally calls or sends money to uh to a sanctioned address there are some people arguing um if you would try to to kind of filter those filters those transactions out um that you yeah would have kind of ddos problems so kind of that the validator could be could be spammed with lots of transactions and they execute them all just to at the very end learn that they need to throw them away because because they touch this forbidden address that was by the way many years ago also the argument to not do yeah what's called a soft fork in those kind of the time when the dow heck happened so when the dow heck happened before then eventually this fork was done where kind of the heck was reverted there was a discussion to yeah in a way censor or block the attacker and exactly because that is so complicated and you can't really know up front whether a transaction will eventually touch it exactly because of that reason that plan was was was given up upon and and so so the other thing would be would be i i really don't see um kind of to go then even step further and say kind of try to block everything that has tokens or coins in it that came from somewhere yeah i can't really see how that would work just to build on martin's point remember these laws are created for banks these are banks that are required to send information about the sender and recipient the source of funds and all the other stuff that travels along when a bank transacts with another bank based on the travel rule obligations so finding out the source and the origination of a transfer is trivial all that information comes with the transaction what we see with these assets is the complete opposite not only do not get that sort of information but as martin suggested you might be sending between two robots who actually have code that would result in the ultimate destination address being contingent on some third-party factor imagine it goes to a smart contract that says if the certain occurrence it comes to pass then it goes to address a and if a certain occurrence comes to pass and it goes to address b it may be that it's impossible at the time of the transaction to know where the ultimate destination is so again this is dramatically different than what we see in the traditional banking system and it's one of these complications that although i don't expect that ofac would give us faq that cover every hypothetical contingency some clarity would certainly be beneficial yeah i actually wanted to mention about martin's point about the dow hack you know because this came up when i wrote my book but one of the fun facts about that was that it was a high school student who figured out that this denial of service attack was possible basically by by doing that and i agree it's it's basically the same situation here all of this is very complicated it takes kind of a long time to explain so what we're going to do is we are going to talk about how all this would work once we have

download the free core browser extension from google chrome's app store today back to my conversation with martin and drew so as we just mentioned things will look even different uh once we implement proposer builder separation on ethereum so at that point you know as we discussed the blocks will be created by a different entity from the proposer so at that point can we talk a little bit about what the liability might be of the different actors you know we have the block builders the proposers and then the attesters and as martin pointed out it's the proposers who actually won't really know what the transactions are true do you have a sense of what the liability might be for each of those entities i i fear that i'm going to start sounding like a broken record but again the the laws that are in place that were grappling with we're not designed for protocols that facilitate transactions they're designed to regulate actors that are legally addressable and that have obligations under enforceable law we're thinking more long lines banks rather than of those that are part of the plumbing yeah but is there a way to save something as simple as since the builders and the attesters will actually see the transactions that their liability might be higher or again the keystone issue is does this law apply at all are these the sort of actors where the law would potentially apply i guess we should talk about secondary liability which is notwithstanding whether you have any obligation you're registered or not if you are eating and abetting third parties and transacting blocked property for instance you may have liability again we have no idea how ofac thinks about block validators or miners or those that operate the base layer you can make an argument that for instance banks are regulated but the swift protocol by which banks communicate with each other is not regulated offac doesn't tell the swift network don't send a message here it tells participating banks don't honor messages from this bank we saw with russia for instance burbank which is largest bank i think in russia used to be a member of swift and there was political pressure placed on swift so that the member banks which include non-us banks would discontinue communications over swift with spurbank so it may not be the cleanest analogy but there is an argument to be made that we should think about the base layer irrespective of whether there are entities that are providing services on the base layer as if it's a communications protocol and not a set of legal actors with obligations we don't know how ofac thinks about this so it's it's too speculative for me to really take that anywhere what what i can do at least is try to make the kind of technical argument why they should not so the the task of the builder can really be described as a pure mathematical optimization problem and actually yeah it is also possible uh to represent the problem very much abstracted away from um from from the concrete addresses so like mathematically speaking you have just a bunch of items and you want to pack them together in the most efficient way so that you in the end generate the most fees again you could convert this this problem to really a pure mathematical optimization problem so if solving that or working on this optimization problem is allowed then probably you could argue the builder doing this builder's job is is fine because that's really all they do so next the proposal what they do is really just query a bunch of those solvers or kind of those those who try to solve this problem as good as possible and all they do is pick pick the one that pays most again that's all they do and at this point when they sign it they don't have any knowledge about what transactions are in this block so now the third step would be those who attest to the block and again here they are in a situation where they have only the choice to say kind of this block exists and i'm testing that it exists or well they could kind of decide to lie about it and say it doesn't exist but yeah those are again the only uh two choices so as long as they kind of uh don't maliciously act against the protocol and then pretend something doesn't exist that does exist they also don't really have any any choice here why don't we now talk about the fact that some good percentage of the proposer validators are going to be these large entities that have us exposure coinbase kraken i don't know actually i try to figure out does lido have us exposure or do do we know if it's going to follow sanctions yeah so was with lido it is slightly more complex again because lido is um somewhat layer in between validators so how lido works is that they um that plenty of people can kind of deposit their ether to a contract and now lido yeah kind of a dao or entity whatever you want to call it is splitting up that ether to many individual validators i i don't know the exact number but it's at least 20 20 then validators that this ether is kind of delegated or given to but in such a way that they don't control the ether but they can perform this attestation and propose a proposal task so because yeah you can set up a validator and you have a kind of a specific withdrawal key which kind of means you are in control of the ether and and that's not given to them but the key that is used for those attestations and proposing that is given to them so asking deeper i assume one of those 20 validators in lido i i very much assume there are also u.s entities in it but i don't know in general if we're going to have so if we add up coinbase kraken binance unclear uh they at least have binance us lido also unclear but all of those together that's like 60 of all validators i don't know what your perception is around what the risks are posed now to validation if we have some of these major entities that at least some of them do have u.s exposure yeah so there are a few things that could happen so again the i can i guess the happy cases it turns out it's fine for them and and nothing happens at all the there is then of course the case that they um feel that they are obliged to kind of not include those transactions that would probably mean they can't use proposal builder separation because again if they if they use that they they don't know what they are proposing or they would need to specifically work with with builders that that kind of built according to some rules then there is still the case where even if it's 60 even if it's 70 percent of the validators would do that what that then effectively would mean that specific transactions will essentially kind of will take longer because if you do a specific transaction that is filtered out by some rules you will probably need to wait for until a validator comes that uses different rules and will include your transaction of course like if we are talking about those hypotheticals then i guess the question is even are notes then even allowed to broadcast those transactions but okay put it putting that put putting that aside so so kind of that that could be one case that those transactions will just be kind of slower because you need to wait for for such a validator the thing where it really becomes could threaten ethereum at its core would be if those yeah kind of those validators that follow different rules would not even build on top of blocks that violate those rules well do you have any indication of whether or not they're thinking about trying to not build on blocks that contain sanctioned addresses yeah so far everyone absolutely said that they would not do it um yeah coinbase the coinbase um ceo was even saying on twitter before before doing that they would uh halt or kind of stop all um all their validators so far that is absolutely no one saying is that they would do that but it's yeah that would be theoretically possible and that would really uh could really um threaten ethereum yeah i did see that nick carter of castle island ventures did an op-ed for coindesk and in it he wrote the board won't allow brian armstrong the ceo of coinbase to shut down coinbase's massively lucrative staking business because some dot eats were mean to him online so i mean who knows obviously we don't have somebody from coinbase here but you know it is a good point that brian may have said this on twitter but when it comes down to it uh for business reasons who knows what they would actually do so one thing is you know because brian did raise this issue of them shutting down their staking business i was curious how long would it take a large staker like coinbase to exit uh like i read eric wall surmised maybe a month or longer and then i didn't know like during that time would they still be proposing blocks or like how does that part work i think we we need to all separate you two things so it is possible right now to kind of stop being a validator what is not yet possible uh is is to withdraw your stake so we are still in this uh period where we are we are still pre-merged and even with the merge the transition to proof of stake will not be completed because again eventually it should be possible to kind of stop being a validator and essentially eventually having your essa again on the ethereum blockchain having it transferable so this moment when you can yeah withdraw stake that is expected to happen six to 12 months after the merge but what is possible right now and is immediately possible is kind of to stop your validator duties yeah and that means a few things that means first you will not no longer be yeah you will no longer be choosing to yeah propose and attest to blocks and it's important to note that if you uh if you stop attesting to blocks while you are still yeah while you are still in active validators you are penalized how much that is depends so if if very few nodes in the network or validators in the network um disappear those penalties are fairly small so kind of being one day offline is the just equivalent roughly of what you would earn for being one day of online so kind of it's it's it's wouldn't be a big penalty if if um out of a year you are two two days off um offline and that's important because we want kind of also have have it possible to be a validator if you don't have a professional setup and you kind of just run your validator from home however if a large percentage of the network uh kind of is is is not online um then those penalties can be very significant and that's also kind of needed because if a large percentage of the network would be offline and that is a little bit how it would look like from from a network from a network perspective if some validators would decide to not build on top of specific blocks because for those who do build on it they kind of just see their version of the history and in their version they just see that those that those yeah kind of some percentages is missing and they don't necessarily see that they are building their alternative version of of history so kind of on a chain that would be like let's say then uncensored those validators that are not the testing would kind of potentially dramatically lose lose their stake because on that chain they are offline and a lot of them are offline so they will kind of essentially their stake will disapp disappear in a way until that chain is then able to what we call finalize again so finalized means that um enough of the active validators attest um to uh to a block no wait so are you saying that in that instance then that would cause a fork or are you saying it would cause a reorg or i don't know if i fully followed yeah i mean both of those things are possible again we are talking about this hypothetical scenario that some validators would start just ignoring blocks although they are correct uh proposed and they get correct at the stations but if you would have the policy that you in your kind of view you would see them as invalid because again they violate some rules some additional rules that are not part of the ethereum protocol then yeah you would probably build build a block and that would potentially cause a fork yes and then kind of on the other fork you would lose your stake okay yeah one thing i wanted to just mention about that was um obviously so as as people saw like coinbase you know is a large staker at the moment my guess would personally be that if for whatever reason the the money that they had staked was slashed i feel like the company would somehow make it up to their clients even even though um some number of them are probably institutional would probably be a lot of money but for the retail i imagine they would why don't we just move now to forks uh i do have some other questions about those entities but since we're talking about forks right now why don't we just talk about this because there were there were people talking about doing what's called a user activated hard fork to prevent censorship on the chain and this would be kind of a user-led movement to punish validators who do censor the chain but martin just from the way you were describing things does it do you think that that would then essentially lead to two different chains or what's your take on what would happen if if people were to try to do that again it depends on on many factors so if a minority of um of validators would start yeah what i would call adding additional rules to ethereum because that's what it is if you say kind of specific transactions are not valid then you then by ethereum standards it is a valid block by your standards it's not so if a minority would kind of ignore valid blocks ethereum valid blocks then they would essentially create their own fork and and that would be kind of in a way fine for ethereum the the issue comes when that becomes the majority so again this is very hypothetical but if a majority of validators would agree on the same rules and that is not even that that's very far from trivial because like even if they if they all agree they will want to honor those or kind of want to want to kind of act according to those sanctions it's absolutely i mean there are so many edge cases where where it's not at all trivial kind of to to then make a clear distinction between valid and not valid and that would be required to have a coordinated fork so if that would happen that i don't know 70 80 90 of validators would would um yeah kind of add new rules and kind of try to go for such a fork then yes there is a theoretical again all very theoretical option of a user activated fork where you could or where users could decide to essentially manually remove those validators from from ethereum or kind of remove their esa balances remove them from the validator set and continue with the validator set that acts according to the ethereum rules again all very hypothetical and i just have a question because it wasn't totally clear to me people were also talking about something called social slashing is that the exact same thing that we're talking about or is that that would be social slashing exactly okay well as i read social slashing isn't something that's in the protocol so it would sort of be like people taking it on them upon themselves like vigilante style to do this like how you know is that even enforceable well i mean in a way that is what happened in the in the um in the dow fork so i mean to be cleared of course the fork uh that reverts to dowag was also not in the protocol but yes it is ultimately a community power or kind of a network power to to make forks every fork is a is a something that's not in the protocol or was previously not in the protocol okay so i'm curious to hear from the both of you just what do you think are the risks that will end up with two chains sort of like the ofac compliant chain and then the censorship resistant chain i think it is unlikely that we end up with a chain where under no circumstances for instance block property could ever be transacted for a very simple and obvious reason if you're in possession of blocked property you're required to send it to a segregated account if i'm in a centralized bank the bank can just move some asset on a sub-ledger and say okay i create a new account it's interest-bearing because i have the legal power to do that i'm going to file my report with ofac and i'll keep filing my annual reports and the bank customer just sort of goes along with their their life and if ofac wants to investigate they might they might inconvenience the customer and great or not great however it shakes out for them in this context if a recipient of blocked property and let's ignore the fact that we don't really understand if tornado cash if transactions that come from tornado cash listed each addresses are blocked or not the safe conservative approach would be to say yes but there are real questions if it is leaving that issue aside let's say that there was property that came from say the chinese fentanyl ring whose addresses were designated on the sdn list in 2020 by ofac let's say that you unwittingly unknowingly by no fault of your own receive some eat from them if you wanted to comply you would try to figure out well how do i segregate that any effort to segregate requires a validator to validate the transaction i can't use a magic wand and just move my eth without having it confirmed by the network so unless ofac tells us how we logically would need validators to validate a transaction of blocked property now how could they do this they could give us a general license that says if you want to segregate your blocked property do this and that would hypothetically give the validators some comfort that they could validate again broken record we need ofac to tell us what to do but if we are to adhere to what it appears the law requires it seems unlikely that we would ever be in a world where absolutely no transactions of block property are allowable the simple reason that the law seems to require them yeah so to make that also very concrete that is one thing that happened a few days after after the sanction list got announced that someone started sending tiny amounts from one of those addresses uh to many many um yeah kind of prominent ethereum addresses so kind of ethereum addresses of celebrities of yeah i think shaquille o'neal exactly brian armstrong yeah exactly exactly so all those um yeah all those addresses are well potentially yeah potentially blocked or or or whatever and kind of theoretically and and it it would be fairly trivial to to do that at a much larger scale than it was was was done i was previously well half well kind of well obviously joking but but saying kind of in theory someone could write a bot that says that that watches out for uh for any um for any larger deposit to an exchange because it's fairly easy to see and while that transaction is is in the in the mempool so kind of not yet confirmed uh but but visible but someone could send the send to uh to the sender so so now kind of at that moment when the when the exchange receives receives the money from that sender uh they they kind of the exchange would need to acknowledge that just a second before uh that address received one cent from uh from from yeah kind of the sanctioned address so i guess where i'm where i'm trying to go it is incredibly hard to uh to kind of come to any practical uh practical kind of um solution for for those sanctioned or how to deal with those sanctions so that is again also why i would answer your initial question how likely is it that we will see a fork with very very unlikely because it's again very very unlikely to find to find the technical practical practical rules for ethereum how ethereum could meaningful exist so i think to implement those yeah kind of sanctions in their strictest in the strictest form i think you would need to turn ethereum completely on its head and say it's uh it's it's by default the permission system so kind of right right now it's kind of right now anything that is um by default kind of any kind of transaction is allowed and if you would want to do this strict censorship you would need to have yeah just a white listed list of of transactions of transaction types that you are allowed to do so you could say yeah sending esa between two uh to to addresses that are not on the list that's fine uh but then immediately as it comes to contracts you would say yeah only contracts where we know they only call those kind of um so again i think that would be very different from from what ethereum is and by the way it is possible to build such a permissions permission system on top of ethereum but i don't really see that it is possible to build that into ethereum so you can have a permissioned system on top of a permissionless system but not the other way around one quick clarification just for the listeners this is complicated stuff and we don't usually spend a lot of time thinking about sanctions because it's not something that usually kind of invades the the conversation like this but just a little bit of a clarification an address receiving blocked property does not make the address blocked when a bank account receives a transfer that should be blocked some of the cash that's received needs to be segregated one of the questions that we have and this is uh an eth question but more of a crypto question writ large is if a dress that has five ethan it receives one tenth of an eath what exactly are we segregating ether are fungible and balance based so can we just choose any one tenth and move it to some other address and move on with our lives like we would with cash or is there some some obligation to try to identify the fraction of beef that was received if that's even possible if we're looking at this on a on a utxo based type of system like bitcoin it's actually easier if you catch it because you can actually identify the fragment of bitcoin that you've received the actual utxo and segregate that but again this is this is a question that we don't have an answer to from ofac and this is one that you can that we can probably get an answer to through faq but the big picture is you don't become a listed account or a listed address simply because you've been griefed or spammed yeah why on social media you probably saw a bunch of users being like i didn't even engage with tornado cash like why am i being blocked from this or that d5 protocol or even someone was like i was hacked that's how my money my account got associated with tornado cash because somebody stole the money from it ran it through tornado cash but like that was before it hit tornado cash and they were being blocked so uh and we're interesting and that's important that you you you say that but the unfortunate reality is that a bunch of pro projects uh kind of went so far and and did that so essentially uh said um and again this is that is the reason is the uncertainty um they then call it a risk-based approach and say kind of this address received money from out of tornado and then we just ban it in our service really quickly what i'll say in a podcast under a set of hypothetical questions and conditions is different than how i'll advise a client when i have specific facts but we're talking about most of our conversation has been about those who are serving third parties that want to transact on a base layer different companies that provide different services at different layers may have different levels of exposure and different legal obligations so i would caution perhaps some sympathy or pathos for different folks in the industry that are looking at this challenge with a different set of obligations everyone is hamstrung to a degree by the fact that we're trying to implement 19th century or 18 sorry 20th century rules on 21st century technology yeah one other um kind of ludicrous scenario you could call it that um eric wahl a bitcoiner who's also very interested in ethereum pointed out he wrote this amazing blog post the case for social slashing uh which people should read because it walks through all different kinds of game theory around um sanctions on ethereum but essentially you know he concluded okay so you know here if we end up with this chain that does follow sanctions then who's to say like what what if you know people wanted to follow the sanctions of this other country that you know has interest different from the us or whatever and so like yeah it just gets to this place where it is kind of ridiculous and it sort of shows how unenforceable this is i'd like i want to push back on that for just a second the us the u.s is big in a lot of ways i think we still have the biggest economy in the world and i know for sure that we do the most sanctions in the world um and most other sanctions lists are based in in in fact if not a concept on the united states we are those sanctions heavy of any jurisdiction so while the idea that we could splinter ethereum based upon the whims of certain specific subgroups into a bunch of groups of validators that lose the ability to remain in consensus with others because they change the protocol rules so they can't form new blocks together could lead to a number of new versions and distinct chains we have seen that the majority of validators will continue to be supporting the chain that most will use and in the context of ethereum where there are so many material commercial considerations that are built and operated on the second layer above and on ethereum we've seen commercial interests indicate even if there is a pow fork that remains after the merge the authoritative canonical supported commercially viable version of their product will be on the pos system as it goes forward if there were to be nine different sanction versions i suspect that those actors would do the same thing yeah before we actually get to that i just want to ask one last oh martin did you want to say anything just one comment to the kind of the united states is the country with the most sanctions maybe that's true but uh but it's certainly not the country with the most restrictions so i mean like even if it's not called sanctions other countries have all kind of restrictions what uh what you are allowed or not allowed to do and i would argue on that level the u.s well the united states are more on the you're allowed to do more so kind of if ethereum would need to to kind of make sure that all the i don't know kind of restrictions that are are are applied in china for currency control or kind of all those things would also need to deal with them again that would make the system impossible to to operate yeah before we move on to some of the things that true was mentioning which refers basically to defy i did want to ask about one last piece about the validation process which is the fact that flashbacks will be the default relay on ethereum at the time of the merge the company's already announced that its relay will be censoring transactions that involve these sanctioned addresses and so they said that they were going to be open sourcing the relay code to encourage other ones to be built but obviously it's a short timeline um they only announced this roughly like a month before the march is going to happen i'm guessing that flashbot still will be the default relay at the time of the merge i don't know martin maybe you'll tell me i'm wrong but i was wondering if that's the case does that mean that effectively ethereum will be uh complying with sanctions for some period and will not be censorship resistant for the first i don't know month or two of launch yeah so a few important pieces here so first um it's not uh it's still a choice of every individual validator whether or not they use a builder proposal separation so it's absolutely still your choice to build your own blocks and therefore yeah in a way not use flashbots or medboost the second thing is yes i think you yeah you mentioned it so flashbots used to be for a long time the most prominent builder although there have always been others there has been a project called eden network whatever there have been others um and but but they um yeah kind of um open sourced their their their software um yeah it's called mev boost and uh that that kind of yeah facilitates this builder proposal separation and yes they will probably run a builder or if you want to go even more into details they will run a relay so kind of that connects various builders to to the validators to the proposers but yes there was already an announcement that at least there will be at least a handful of other relays some have said of course that's we will only see time will tell that they will not apply sanctions or kind of filter for those transactions but bottom line is there will be some validators that simply don't use it that simply builds their own blocks according to their own rules and yes there will be there will be a very variety of of of builders with different strategies okay so now let's turn to um the d5 issues and really um i think uh well you can name uh there's two different factors here first is that a number of these d5 entities do have u.s jurisdictional exposure um and then on top of that as i'm sure well aware usdc uh is managed by a consortium that um you know the two most prominent members are circle and coinbase also both us entities and usdc is something that's just interwoven through the fabric of d5 um you know i would almost say that d5 is like somewhat dependent on it it's just thought was the top asset for borrowing and lending on compound it backs more than half of dye et cetera so um how do you feel that you know these issues around both different d5 protocols exposure to the us and you know the dependence on usdc how do you think that's going to affect how things play out because a part of me feels like it almost pushes things in the direction of two chains but yeah no i mean that that is a very very um big question of again how practically but usdc decides to to deal with the situation so um you mentioned correctly that at the moment that might change very well but at the moment a very big percentage of dye is is backed by um by usdc and i think that's that's a little bit provocative statement but some have called the direct usdc and i for example doesn't have the ability to to restrict individual accounts so with with usdc an in individual account can be frozen with dye it can not be and of course um in in general those those those sanctions or kind of restrictions um if they are very easy to circumvent they are well they they will just they will just i mean not be effective or kind of not not really do um anything so then of course then always the question is if they are being circumvented uh what will the next step be and of course ultimately the step could be for for for usdc um that they would somehow need to be what would well would probably be pressured or kind of see an obligation to restrict the use uh how or restrict the form of how dye is using that that is a big open question it can there are multiple outcomes here possible outcomes um one could be that um yeah dai is kind of trying to get independent from usdc another one can probably also be that more measures are implemented that makes it somehow okay for use dc to continuously use this role but yeah certainly lots of lots of open questions yeah i just want to point out though that when rune christensen the founder of maker dao suggested that they sort of d-peg die from the us dollar uh to try to reduce that dependence on usdc then even people like vitalik said that they thought that was a terrible idea so i think that was somewhat joking he was saying kind of yeah they should just uh market them or kind of just use all the usdc to buy ether and i think that was the part that i mean that was definitely a joke and that was the part where vitalik said um shouldn't do that oh oh oh oh maybe i didn't read it carefully so i thought he was saying so wait are you saying that roon wasn't serious about trying to d-peg oh well okay okay no i mean um there are multiple things so so i think there's clearly an understanding or there's a clearly an attempt in the maker community to become more independent of usdc the question is is that possible and still keeping a pack to to the dollar so there are some stablecoin projects that are not dependent on usdc but they have we are often given up on on the one-to-one parity with the dollar they are fairly stable against the dollar they i don't know kind of go up a few percent but but still they are they go up i don't know three four percent go down three four percent so if you allow uh for that volatility it's much easier to design uh stable coins that are not kind of backed by by dollars and i think that was uh that is potential question for maker i think currently there's no no majority uh kind of supporting that but that's at least an idea or kind of that might be a consequence of saying if we really want to get rid of fiat backed collateral then we might or style would might need to get rid of the one-to-one packing to the dollar oh okay interesting and andrew did you want to add anything about kind of the power of usdc here um i'll keep my comments brief on this point if you're a us-based entity if you're regulated or if you are clearly within the us jurisdiction and you're looking at what you've seen from a fact for the 18th time in the call or on this podcast i'll say we don't have enough information to understand what our obligations are however the magnitude of the penalties here are so severe this is this is potential jail time um it wouldn't surprise me if most significant u.s based companies were taking a conservative approach it doesn't mean that they're not going to also try to find ways to challenge the the designations here doesn't mean that they're not going to introduce lawsuits doesn't mean they're not going to ask for licenses it doesn't mean that they're not going to deploy lobbyists over to treasury to try to get faq on things that they care about when you have this sort of lack of guidance and lack of understanding as to how to implement your what you are obliged to do a lot of times lawyers will counsel doing nothing rather than taking some sort of aggressive action because if you take the wrong aggressive action it could actually exacerbate the problem rather than solve the problem i would love to see faq issued you know the day that this podcast is run it would be amazing and it would probably moot everything that i've said because it will answer all of the questions however government entities um are not always moving at the speed of light a lot of times it might take them a while they're going to engage with industry they're going to ask questions they're going to listen to the best podcasts in the industry they're going to come up with their own ideas and they're going to battle test them with important stakeholders and so the process of coming up with the guidance that we need the faqs or issuing the general licenses to empower us to take certain actions that on its face may be prohibited is not going to be fast so for for regulated u.s actors they are probably going to be conservative and they're probably not going to move terribly quickly and out of curiosity is that typical for in situations like this involving sanctions for the government to just issue you know some kind of ruling like this and then later explain how it should be implemented or does this sort of indicate that there was a sort of hasty action taken before um they had time to think through everything so i can't speculate as to the deliberations that went on within ofac it is typical or not uncommon for there to be a designation and then after a period of time faqs that provide additional color as to how to comply or that provide additional information that's helpful to interpret the meaning of the designation if you go on the ofac website for instance you'll see that there are searchable faq they're actually grouped by topic and there's i don't know 12 or 13 that actually address virtual currency and some of them are actually quite helpful if you're a centralized entity um there are actually there's actually some guidance in the faq as to how to deal with blocked property what it does not tell you is if you are uh if you find yourself the recipient of block property in a self-custodial wallet for instance um there is some guidance if you're an exchange but not if you're a self-user or a self-custody user so it is typical that there is some some um deliberation internal to the organization before they put out the faqs um sometimes they revise faqs to update them and as i said before there are certain issues here that are going to be widespread where a general license which would be published and public and anybody could read it would be a effective way to address some of the issues okay well clearly there's a lot of questions that this has opened and we'll sort of have to see when it is that the government finally issues some faqs and also what what those say um in the meantime are there any parting thoughts as we head into the merge in a few weeks yeah i want to just make a make a high-level comment on the whole situation i have been passionate in a way about uh well kind of tornado cache and i a little bit want to explain um why and kind of maybe a little bit zooming out so to me what what we see happening is that yeah if you use the blockchain more and more and i am a heavy blockchain user since many years and that is absolutely the exception that it's only kind of a very small number of of people who are kind of today using blockchain on a daily basis but um if you do that you leave an incredibly large trace of um of yeah of course of kind of transactions you essentially uh yeah you could imagine let's assume every every payment you do every bank account you have kind of everything would be public and visibly uh by anyone that's essentially what what is is is happening on the blockchain and again it doesn't affect you if you kind of only uh bought some coins two years ago and they are just laying there then that's fine but if you if you do daily transactions and again we are moving there then that is the trace um that you are um leaving now tornado cache was a project or is a project that kind of well didn't uh necessarily invented new technology the technology was around in in in different form very similar technology is used in in zcash and was available for some time but they kind of just went ahead and took the pieces that were largely available and made some usable product for ethereum for the first where it was practically for the first time on ethereum doable for at least advanced users to well have some privacy and that can be as simple as um yeah if i want to send someone money and i do that all the time and i kind of also do transactions all the time that are that are associated with with i don't know kind of my my address that you can immediately find if you look me up on twitter and if i just want to make sure that i also have some addresses that are not linkable to that if i don't want to kind of expose to the whole world all my all my crypto i needed to use a tool like tornado cash now of course the problem was and that that is a real problem that only a very small number of of or maybe also false statement but a fairly small number of of users are kind of in that situation where they where their blockchain live or whether life is in large parts on the chain so in a way the number of users or kind of who really needed in a way a tornado cache was small absolutely not i mean absolutely real users so in still thousands but kind of in the grand scheme of things small now unfortunately also very large and real user uh was of course we don't know that for sure but but it seems like this uh north korea's state-sponsored hacker group um at least i mean at the end we that's all always very hard to know what what what's true in those cases but let's assume it's true um then that is a very real problem and that is very real harm that in a way uh was done and from that perspective on on some level i kind of understand this uh those those sanctions the issue is now that it creates now a situation where it is almost um kind of impossible to work on on yeah kind of good solutions to this problem so the problem is how can we on the one hand provide people some level of uh of privacy and on the other hand still hopefully make it as hard as possible for hackers to to kind of obfuscate their their their stolen funds and there were actually um yeah some interesting proposals of how you could tweak a tornado or something like tornado um various proposals one was kind of to say you need to make a deposit and then there is some waiting period where those who have already deposit can kind of decide whether this new deposit is accepted or or you could kind of reveal when you when you withdraw you can reveal um that your deposit was not coming from from let's say um this so so stolen funds or something like that um the issue now is uh won't even find someone who is confident working on that because it's so unclear what you're allowed to do or not to do so it's it's kind of it's kind of unclear are you allowed to work on on on that technology i mean obviously there was to my knowledge absolutely no law kind of that prevented the tornado guys from from from writing this code and publishing this and and now one of them is is in jail so that's of course a horrible situation and makes it very very hard to um yeah to come up with good solutions to those um hard problems yeah i think so many of the points that you made are super interesting and valuable and should be listened to by uh regulators uh who you know have any say on on what's been happening i had two quick parting comments the first is it's unclear whether ofac understood the full implications of its designation of the eth addresses associated with tornado cash there's some language that suggested that it was considering tornado cache the same way it considered other centralized entities operating mixers and if that's the case then it's likely that they did not understand the broader implications of designating smart contract addresses and all the complexities that they were bringing into the market if that is the case then we should all be looking at this saga as a really important opportunity to engage with regulators to educate regulators and to partner with the government so that there is a good dialogue between the industry and those that are making decisions that impact the industry can't underscore enough how important it is for us to educate those who are making the rules for our products and systems and services and businesses if they don't understand what they're doing or what these systems and products are doing it's unreasonable for us to expect that they always get the rules right it needs to be a two-way street and it's something that the industry should embrace because it's to their benefit the second point goes to what martin said before which is at this point we are running out of ways to anonymously or privately transact in the united states we have this amazing thing called the fourth amendment which gives us tremendous protections over our persons our papers and our homes and we have progressively seen those rights eroded over time because there are regulated intermediaries that have been deputized by law enforcement as basically agents for their purposes national security is incredibly important but we still are allowed to use cash and cash at this point is one of the few ways that we can transact without being subject to surveillance the other is crypto so while martin's point with respect to we should be working on privacy and anonymization technology but we don't even know whether we can anymore i think that we should continue to work on it i think that projects like aztec are important and continue to push the envelope for private transactions um and i think that we need to continue to fight for the rights that we have in our respective jurisdictions to continue to be able to transact anonymously we can do it with cash we should not allow our desire for convenience and payments to erode all of our rights to privacy all right well great words to end on um now uh do you guys each want to say where people can learn more about you and your work yeah i'm i'm usually kind of my my main work is around gnosis we're also working on yeah the gnosis chain the nose blockchain the chain that also puts decentralization and having many validators that run a validator from home first but about me you find me pretty active on twitter at kaplan this is drew you can follow me on twitter at propel forward you can look me up on my law firm's website klgates
