[Music] hi everyone thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline the market crashed coinbase binance and other exchanges briefly shut down the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is down roughly 20 over the past seven days from about 2.2 trillion dollars to 1.7 trillion as a press time thursday afternoon bitcoin is sitting at around 40k after bouncing back from 30 thousand dollars while ethereum hit a weekly low of 1 860 before bumping back up to the high 2000s wednesday was the bottom for the market when bitcoin and ether lost 30 and 40 of their value respectively in a single day the correction led to coinbase reporting intermittent downtime for customers attempting to purchase cryptos on sale finance was also disrupted as the exchange stopped ethereum-related token withdrawals from its platform the dip however did not affect decentralized exchanges such as sushi swap which reported its highest trading volume ever in a 24-hour period on the flip side average gas fees rose 239.4 percent on wednesday compared to tuesday meaning ethereum users paid steep prices to used apps next headline the crypto dip is not all elon's fault as for what caused this week's bruising several factors likely came together first tether last friday for the first time since 2014 to the tether revealed the breakdown of its reserves as part of its settlement with the new york attorney general's office three months ago which requires an ongoing publication of the assets backing usdt as of march 31st 2021 usdt is backed by 76 cash and cash equivalents with a final 24 filled by secured loans at 12.55 corporate bonds funds and precious metals at 9.96 percent and other investments including digital tokens at 1.96 percent the ft looked at what the 76 percent of cash and cash equivalents is comprised of and surprisingly only 3.87 of that or 2.9 percent of all tether is actually backed by cash about two-thirds of that 76 percent in cash and cash equivalents comes from commercial paper with fiduciary deposits making up 24.2 reverse repo notes taking up 3.6 and treasury bills just 2.94 when tether initially launched usdt claimed to be backed one-to-one with u.s dollars in 2019 the company changed the wording to say usdt was backed 100 by ted reserves which it seems is still company policy today caitlyn long ceo of a bondi bank wrote a tweet thread about her thoughts on stable coins and the cryptocell off which were probably connected in the thread she argued that risk managers at crypto hedge funds quote almost certainly will require haircuts on tether forcing traders to sell crypto to reduce risk because quote tethers probability of default and loss severity in default just went up based on the disclosure another cause of this week's sell-off may have been unease over china on tuesday three self-regulatory bodies in china all of which are under the supervision of the people's bank of china jointly published a note reiterating a 2017 ban on financial and payment institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions and initial coin offerings although it was nothing new it appears a misleading reuters article made the rounds tuesday morning spreading a rumor that china had completely banned crypto which was much more dramatic than the reality the third driver of the drawdown this week may have been elon musk and his twitter account last week tesla announced it will no longer accept btc as payment for vehicles citing environmental concerns regarding bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus algorithm then over the weekend tesla ceo elon musk hinted that tesla may sell or had already sold its bitcoin holdings by responding indeed to a tweet from cryptowale on twitter that said quote bitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out tesla dumped the rest of their bitcoin holdings musk later clarified the speculation tweeting tesla has not sold any bitcoin and that tesla has diamond hands however by that time btc had already slid well under 50k the final impetus behind the price plunge may have also been retail traders milton demir's chief strategy officer at coinshares said quote crypto is still largely a retail driven market driven by fear and panic it operates 24 7 365. this is a perfect recipe for panic selling exacerbated by media hype over non-events next headline ethereum had an impressive q1 james wang a former arc analyst wrote an insightful article earlier this week about ethereum's impressive q1 performance here are a few highlights on ethereum's growth between q1 2020 and q1 2021 total transaction fees are on ethereum are up 200x to 1.7 billion daily active users increased 71 percent total value logged in defy rose 64 x to 52 billion dollars from 800 million dollars nft art sales rose from 700k to 396 million dollars on a related note on wednesday coin shares reported that digital asset investment products saw a net outflow of 50 million over the previous seven days which is the first net outflow since october 2020 and the largest since may 2019. surprisingly the prime suspect of the outflows was bitcoin investment products which accounted for 98 million dollars flowing out of the system point shares noted that other digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling 48 million over that last week implying that investors might be diversifying their crypto portfolios interestingly ethereum accounted for 27 million of the inflows continuing the trend of eth outperforming btc this year as melton pointed out quote may is the first month ether products traded more volume than bitcoin next headline u.s regulators sprint to keep up with crypto during a virtual hearing of the house financial services committee michael sue the acting head of the controller of the currency expressed concern that quote the regulatory community is taking a fragmented agency by agency approach to the technology driven changes taking place today sue was eyeing a collaboration between the occ federal reserve and fdic to create what he's calling an interagency sprint team that would establish a unified framework and set definitions for cryptocurrencies additionally sue requested a staff review of all the occ's crypto related guidance issued over the past year which will encompass the entirety of former controller brian brooks's reign at the occ when the regulator established crypto guidance largely seen as beneficial to the industry for example brooks wrote a series of interpretive letters during his tenure clarifying that federally chartered banks could custody stable coins and hold them in reserve caitlyn long ceo of avonte bank pointed out that earlier on tuesday the occ had reversed a final ruling which although unrelated to crypto is a very rare occurrence perhaps signaling that suit could zig where brooks zagged four other u.s regulatory headlines are also worth noting us congressman thomas emmer sent a letter to the financial accounting standards board or fasb urging clear accounting standards for digital currencies the fdic put out a request to depository institutions this week asking banks about the handling of digital assets on thursday senate banking chairman sherrod brown penned a letter to michael sue regarding his concern over the occ previously granting national trust charters to paxos anchorage and protego signaling that their trust charters may be at risk the us treasury is calling for businesses that receive ten thousand dollars in crypto to report such transactions to the irs stating that while they are a quote small portion of business income today cryptocurrency transactions are likely to rise in importance in the next decade the irs will also be given additional funding to address the crypto market next headline wells fargo and bank of america make crypto moves on wednesday wells fargo's wealth and investment management division announced that it will soon introduce an actively managed crypto strategy wells fargo is the latest u.s bank following morgan stanley goldman sachs and possibly jp morgan to grant

from its all-time high it was an easy week to bash the first cryptocurrency in the past a dip of this magnitude may have warranted a bitcoin obituary this week the obituary was replaced by an article titled first mover advantage is great but could bitcoin end up the myspace way by joe weisenthal executive editor at bloomberg with the just being that btc could like myspace end up being replaced by better technology all of facebook though joe admits it will be harder to supplant btc due to the nature of blockchain tech versus social media here's where the humor comes in however tenuous the connection it seems the creator of myspace tom anderson is a bitcoiner which is perhaps worrisome for btc holders or hodlers in an odd yet humorous move tom has only posted on his twitter account five times in 2021. three of those posts came in response to nick carter partner at castle island ventures and an ardent bitcoin defender tom's latest tweet was posted on sunday showing off his new profile
