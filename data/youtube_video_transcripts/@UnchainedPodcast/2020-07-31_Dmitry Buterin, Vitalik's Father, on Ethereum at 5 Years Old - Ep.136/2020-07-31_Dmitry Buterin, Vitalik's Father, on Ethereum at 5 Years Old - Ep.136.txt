glad to have you here so congratulations on ethereum turning five how does it feel to see your son's creation ethereum turning five years old oh it's exciting it's uh you know i said him imagining and i'm going to see him in a couple of hours right and uh so much has happened in five years it's uh it's a breathtaking you know so much learning had to happen so much foreigners has been made so many unexpected challenges as is always the case right and there is still so much to do so really it's a nice round milestone right and and it's a milestone so moving forward everyone is vitalik's path to creating ethereum actually began with bitcoin and you were the person who introduced vetteling to bitcoin he eventually became a prolific bitcoin journalist and also was a co-owner of bitcoin magazine how did you hear about bitcoin and why did you tell vitalik about it one of the drivers of my personality is curiosity i constantly read and consume a lot of different you know all kinds of information and it used to be about technology uh mostly nowadays it's a much better range of things and uh i think i might have come across it in a podcast by steve gibson says a podcast about security yeah computer security right and uh it sounded like a really exciting concept right and uh what uh the person satoshi was able to achieve and whatever i learned then i turned around and shared with people around me and i with thailand obviously has an extremely client who is always eager to learn right so it was just natural for me to share that with him and actually just uh yesterday two days ago i was looking at the stack of bitcoin magazines at my place i'm like oh wow you know they're like really nice mementos of that time and so at that time he um also ended up dropping out of college to write for bitcoin magazine well not i mean he was already running for them but when he dropped out he was primarily writing for them and also traveling the world to um visit different bitcoin communities what did you think at that time when he did that i actually remember that day because you know he he came home and uh and then his mom was also there so all three of us myself my wife and his mom were there and he mentioned to us that he was thinking about dropping out of college right and we all were actually quite excited for him because again like uh the school that he was in it's an awesome university the best possibly in computer science not right but for me learning is not something that you do in but you have to do in a particular place right it's a i'm a big believer that learning happens throughout our whole life right and i knew knowing metallic i knew that he's not going to stop learning right and he before he mentioned that so the school was not quite giving him what enough to chew on so to say right and when he shared his plans and what he wanted to do we actually were all quite excited and supported him because again like going to school and i know that if you go to that school after the ad so you will probably get recruited by somebody like microsoft or google and get a very nice you know six-figure salary and whatnot but uh i also knew that if he dropped and then he actually does stuff and there is uh much more learning that can happen in the real world right because we see this all the time that uh the disconnect between what is being taught and formal uh education system and the real that's uh there was a big difference and then eventually i think within about a year he had his idea for ethereum when he told you about his idea what did you think yeah i i remember that as well too you know he actually showed me his uh uh first draft of the white paper right i do have science education but i have not been really following that uh crypto space that closely so i could understand the concepts but did you know on the superficial level but i was very impressed with how well thought out the whole concept was with a lot of things and also how clearly it was communicated right because uh reading a lot of technical documents connection any kinds of documents any kind of things i know that it's really hard to express something complicated in a way that people can understand it right so most people actually don't understand things themselves and then they try to overcomplicate things very complex technical language to hide they're actually the fact that they don't know right but vitalik always had this gift when he was able to express himself very clearly especially and even on a very complex thought if you look at his uh articles in bitcoin magazine you can see that right so that was his gift for a long time so when i read his uh white paper i'm like wow this sounds like really awesome cons but then it makes total sense right like the way i think about it as a bitcoin was a awesome huge milestone and i think about it as a when people started building websites right internet was born and then people started building the html site right and html websites are great and you know you can do all kinds of cool things but then javascript was born and then with javascript uh you can actually now build the full-fledged applications with that and that's kind of how i understood the concept and and this is how it's borne out and yeah so was it very exciting to see that and so when ethereum first launched what did you imagine it would become it was really hard to do that i think that vitalik did a much better job of imagining that like even now when people look back at the original white paper right and he talks about uh you know stable points and other kind of aspects he obviously did a lot of deep thinking about that and uh and i have not by that time you know i was just like following their progress and for me it was uh just fascinating to watch uh how awesome theoretical if you will computer science idea was coming to fruition and then also mentioned with all the reality of life right all the people all their motivations you will degrade their personal preferences all kinds of things right so for me to kind of watch that thing unfold and all the people getting involved was a really fascinating time yeah we'll we'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment but i also wanted to ask you was there any particular moment where you realized that this was going to be really big ethereum was going to be really big i don't know there was a petition right but uh and big things they take time right it's they don't they don't like uh happen like oh this is huge but it's more like you wake up like oh this is huge because it's happened right and if you look right now the theorem and all the work by so many people that went into this it's amazing what has been achieved um but i mean their initial white paper was uh uh very impressive and again without me really being in that space but then kind of watching from the side and seeing so many awesome smart people all kinds of people being involved with that and like okay so uh struck a note with a lot of people uh and uh they're excited and uh like seeing that community uh being created for me was a very exciting aspect of this and kind of looking at what is happening now there's a reflection of that right because again awesome smart ideas vitalik came up with this idea but obviously his idea was built on ideas of other people and you probably know that and if you have an idea for a startup then probably at this same time in the world there are a few thousand people if not people have similar ideas right but having their technical ideas one aspect of this but then having their if you will their clueless ideology in a available we'll discuss some of the personal challenges that vitalik faced as well as things like the ico craze but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible in this crisis many investors aim to keep and grow their digital assets others seek to maximize the yield

the end of september back to my conversation with demetri voterin what did you think of the ico craze which was essentially enabled by ethereum i looked at most of the projects like i would say 99 of the projects and like they don't make any sense to me like like people talk to me and they would show me all kinds of white papers and they all look very sophisticated but again their sophistication was of the kind that when you look deeper like okay can you explain it in a very simple language people couldn't right it's like basically for most people it's like oh i think we can make lots of money with that in my experience uh building something big is very rarely related you know very early starts with the concept let's make lots of money right and uh and then people of course wrap it with a lot of like oh and we can do this for this kind of people but when we talk to them he realizes it's like since the second thought that they had but the first is like oh it's exciting we can make money so anyways like i was looking at with amazement and uh there was a lot of stuff happening and i think that maybe into one particular project recommended by a friend uh well a couple of projects but other than that and i was just uh amazed and we're going to go through transition right and i've seen that happen with the internet back in uh whatever their end of the 90s right it's like it had a similar feel to that but on the other hand it also felt like a very natural uh evolution of the space right just like uh your interview recently with you with vitalik and other conversations he had and when he talks about defy like you know what's the sunset and people are questioning that but on the other hand this is a really awesome way for people to experiment and build crazy complicated amazing mechanisms that they can be that can be leveraged right and you look at many other things like auger version 2 coming out recently so i think it's augur as a really uh interesting project and uh i think they were the field on ethereum or something like that and uh big things you know things that make real important world they take time right so and they take time to shape out i was looking at those icos people were basically doing a lot of very short-term thinking let's raise lots of money and let's kind of go all out and build something quickly right but i'm not delivering sustainability you know life as if you will a marathon is not a sprint and we cannot just like uh kill ourselves trying to like oh let's do this right now yesterday tomorrow or whatever right but it's uh you have to take a long-term perspective and this is exactly as i look at uh five years of ethereum right it's really been about consistency there was a plan there were a lot of first herds or a lot of failed attempts and you know dead ends and still the team the community they kept marching forward and they kept overcoming those things and yeah things take longer and one of my analogies is like when you're building a business it's like when you plant a tree you plant the tree into the soil and you put some nutrients you water it and you do all the things and after that you can do all kinds of crazy dancing or you know you know prey whatever but it will just grow with its pace and that's just any substantial initiative it will evolve with the speed that they're that matches if you will the environment and one of the threats that had been hanging over ethereum for a few years was whether or not ether would be considered a security or whether or not the sec would go after ethereum for its crowd sale it eventually became apparent neither of those things would happen but were you ever nervous for vitalik i wasn't yeah i mean i remember that time and uh and on your interview you're talking about uh some of the space uh like the guy stephen your rayoff right and i remember there was a conference in toronto i think it was uh maybe three years ago and then i just happened to be president of that conversation stephen was really trying to uh basically explain to vitalik that vitalik this is very dangerous you're going to go to jail and i'm the only person who can say because i have all this awesome connection all kinds of people and law enforcement and you know senate and whatnot and after we talk we talked to him and then you know i'm talking to vitalik and i'm asking how do you feel and he said well but also like when there's so much pressure being applied to me then i can start to question is this really real uh and i said yeah i mean that's kind of how i feel about this too and how to put this method multiple times right and you know him end of the day you know that he has uh his heart in the right place as they say right so i'm pretty sure that's uh and then again law enforcement and those uh branches of our government they don't have to be reasonable but i kind of have to believe that uh when people talk to vitalik and they see this is his intent right it was not it was never his mind to trying to make money or whatever uh invite investors to this right and if you think back into this to this whole ico craze right he was uh constantly warning people about the basically to blow up right so it was a bit of concern but it was not a huge concern yeah it's um interesting that you mentioned steven nerioff just then because i do think in general and vitalik has talked about this that one of his biggest challenges if not the biggest challenge i actually think he said this in that interview i uh published on tuesday that uh his biggest challenges and biggest challenge in steering ethereum to where it is today was the social aspect of like people-related issues and was that something that you were aware of during you know while he was trying to help grow this network and did you try to help him at all with that or what were your thoughts uh yeah so of course it was uh uh i could clearly see that right i had superficial interaction with quite a number of people involved in their uh project from the early days and i could see i could see that and i did all for my help but then he kind of how to put this some of their life lessons you cannot learn from books so you cannot learn from other people you can have to go through that yourself and yes he you guys did discuss it and you know i just listened to that very recently and uh i think it was a huge aspect of his growth he's learning and his maturity as a human being and so during this time that he's created and grown ethereum how would you say he's changed i think it's uh he has developed a much broader perspective on social institutions on people and what not right and much more multi-dimensional versus like seeing people or institutions like banks and other bad banks of you know big evil corporations right but then you realize well there are so many aspects to those institutions there are so many aspects to each human right and each human awesome uh has their strength and then has their weaknesses and they all come as one package right you cannot deny any one of them so anyways and for vitalik uh i could see how his uh obviously he always had uh very high intellect right but as you know quite well it's quite possible to be extremely smart and the total right it's so for me it was uh sometimes it was painful to see their the emotional challenges that he had to go through like realizing all of that stuff but again this is how you integrate some of those lessons you cannot just like without that heavy emotional processing so so for me seeing that maturity in him that level of uh new phone wisdom and taking a broader perspective understanding so many more intricate shades of uh all the different aspects of life that was i would say the biggest part of what i have observed in the last five years all right so what are some things that you expect to happen in ethereum over the next five years i really have no clue but i'm excited obviously about 2.0 because at this point ethereum is still uh you know at most a beta product you know it's still uh if you will a toy and people tried that but that's the reality every new technology especially as complicated as this uh has to go through those uh stages right and i'm actually i think i'm very excited to see that so many things are coming together and the community of people is as strong as ever and as as much more diffused and dispersed and differentiated than it ever has been so familiar in that ongoing evolution and actually seeing ethereum become an essential aspect of the public infrastructure and there are so many cool things that the people are trying to do from the device to the d2 reputation systems to you know that experimentation with quadratic funding quadratic voting all of this stuff so a lot of really cool experimentations right so i really have no idea how to evolve for me it's uh it's pretty obvious so you know it makes more sense that it will become a very important aspect of our default public infrastructure infrastructure how we no longer thinking about the internet it's just a given for when you look at kids growing up right it's it's a given for them internet and apps and websites and whatnot and so i think ethereum has a really good chance to become that can public infrastructure component very essential to the function of the society and actually one last question which is i think ethereum i think vitalik had told me that one of your interests in bitcoin had to do with an interest in austrian economics and gold and you can correct that if it's wrong but i did wonder he did say the other day that you know essentially if under ethereum 2.0 could have more emphasis on the monetary policy and so at some times the asset could be inflationary and other times deflationary do you have any opinion on that or do you feel like it should be one way or the other i've never really started the economics uh to uh you know in depth but on a superficial level i think that uh brands for the monetary policy of ethereum makes a lot of sense to me because again like when i look at uh our current society and we want to look at even at what's been happening last let's say three four months right and they're printing all this magic money right and looking back and looking at their inflation levels that we have seen in the last let's say 50 years right people don't realize how insane is how those things constantly eating eating into their incomes and affecting their lives right because two three percent a year doesn't seem much but you know when you compound that or take hate then it becomes a big difference so i think that the direction that ethereum is going into uh and i kind of like that people uh starting with italic and the community the team they're thinking about and then they're flexible because again and the bitcoin they're just saying this is hard cap and no okay maybe right we will see in the jk if that's sustainable right but the way they think about the theorem it's like okay here's our current best gas and let's be flexible flexible and let's then kind of find a way to change that if there is a new sexual consensus emerging right so yeah that makes a lot of sense all right well we will see what happens when that transition takes place it's been so great having you on the show thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed yeah it was good to see good to talk to you take care don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break looking to connect with thought leaders innovators and blockchain enthusiasts welcome to t quorum a weekly virtual series about all things tazos each week will feature presentations about the latest advancements that help the ecosystem grow together interested in speaking at tquorum submit your presentation ideas and the tezos community will vote on who comes to the podium next sign up and learn more about the virtual series at tcorum.com [Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline bitcoin crosses 10k after months of treading water the price of bitcoin surged past ten thousand dollars earlier this week although it's not clear why recent news has been bullish for crypto for instance the office of the controller of the currency is now allowing us banks to custody crypto and the pandemic continues to have a dampening effect on the economy some industry analysts also believe that defy gains are being redirected toward bitcoin the impact was also felt on derivatives as backed and cme both saw record volumes in their bitcoin futures markets crypto analytics firm skew tweeted cme bitcoin futures had the most active session of the year yesterday 1.3 billion dollars notional traded open interest also climbed to a record high on a side note coinbase institutional published a report on the first half of 2020 that gives a good overview of the year in crypto so far it said new people are purchasing bitcoin and an increasing number of investors are treating it as a store of value it also highlighted a number of positive metrics in areas as wide ranging as defy to stable coins to derivatives to mining for instance ethereum is up 73 stable coins have more than doubled and derivatives have also seen an increase with btc options tripling next headline an easy to understand ethereum 2.0 primer ethereum 2.0 is coming and it's complicated if you haven't fully wrapped your head around it yet coindesk published a detailed but accessible report on ethereum 2.0 that includes everything from the definitions of terms like serenity casper and shasper to explanations of why at first eath created on ethereum 2.0 cannot be sent back to the original chain it breaks down what will happen in each phase of the transition for instance phase 0 launches the beacon chain and proof of stake phase 2 introduces sharding phase sorry phase one phase two is for deploying dapps and phase three which is the least defined as of yet will likely include more complex technological features such as ones that increase privacy there's also a deep dive into the economics of ethereum 2.0 which may lead to the creation of digital assets that will be the tokenized versions of staked eth and rewards earned by validators also if you're wondering what ethereum 2.0 will look like and want to hear it the way that a friend might explain it to you check out hasev qureshi's article in bankless on defy and ethereum 2.0 the dragonfly capital partner writes quote ethereum 2.0 is going to create a bunch of shards which will work like loosely connected blockchains but all the d5 stuff will end up living on a single shard since it all wants to coagulate together he further adds that d5 shard will be the place where the major d5 protocols settle those that benefit from high velocity and being connected to large liquidity pools for liquidations flash loans or whatever maybe there will be one major financial shard like london or two city shards with their own specializations like new york city and chicago i expect if there is a second city shard it will be for centralized exchange settlement separated from defy and all of its chaos next headline what is the best way to upgrade bitcoin governance in a protocol that takes decentralization as seriously as bitcoin does is always a tricky subject with the taproop softwork upgrade nearly ready the bitcoin community is pondering how best to activate the soft fork if you're wondering what the main issues are a recent bitmex blog post breaks them down into quote one should the minor threshold signaling period be followed by a flag day activation two which parts of the activation logic if any should be included in bitcoin core three should minor signaling eventually become mandatory for the uninitiated flag day activation refers to nodes and miners switching to a different code after a certain point in time whereas threshold signaling essentially requires miners and nodes to signal support for a change bit bitmix created a decision tree that goes in order from least amount of centralized decision making to most for instance the least amount of centralization will be for there to be no flag day activation and also no activation logic included in bitcoin core the most centralized would be to require a flag day activation a flag date in the bitcoin course software and also for minor signaling at the end of the period the report recommends a compromise where bitcoin core follows the bitcoin improvement proposal number nine which includes quote a 95 minor threshold activation logic without a flag day and mandatory minor signaling which is basically a goldilocks version next headline why everyone keeps talking about yfi in the world of defy yield farmers seem to chase high interest rates from protocol to protocol like lemmings maybe not jumping off cliffs but perhaps parkouring between them i made that up and if you don't like that joke too bad but one new defy token stands a bit separate yfi as community member ross galloway put it in a recent why earn dot finance messaging board quote yfi is a mechanism to claim reward and yield farm tokens that are earned with the funds in why earns various and upcoming products it may also capture some revenues of upcoming or current products as decided upon by the community through the governance process at its core yfi is the token of a collective yield farm that leverages unique elements of defy and ethereum to capture yield for users of its products for those of you who have been following this space for a while to me it seems similar to a dow token if the dao had survived and we all know how excited the world was about the dow which raised 150 million dollars in 2016 and that was quite the feat considering how low crypto prices were back then on top of all this yfi was distributed almost like bitcoin in what the community perceives as a fair distribution in which no insiders or vcs or even the creator benefited the token was released via the y dot curve dot fi pool in what ross calls a continuous farmed offering and he describes that as quote the newest fairest crowd sale alex saunders of nugget news tweeted quote over the weekend yfi broke the record for the fastest coin to 100 x it jumped from 34 to 4 500 in seven days however it actually traded at three dollars on uniswap after wi-fi creator andre cronier released it meaning i earn finance did 1000x in a week next headline wth is yfii chinese yield farmers unhappy about the fact that wi-fi could only be earned through liquidity mining forked wi-fi to create yfii which has a larger issuance plus a having mechanism this may not seem like a big deal but this spin-off became an example of the differences between the east and west crypto communities with the western d5 community calling it a scam and the chinese defy community hailing it as the next big thing yfiii adoption exploded in china with crypto whales traditional c5 businesses exchanges mining pools and other entities adding it while western projects had a different reaction balancer quickly blacklisted the yfi slash dipole from its front-end interface which sparked a separate debate about whether balancer was truly decentralized the chief analyst at token insight minion act abct whose first name i don't know so sorry about that summed it up in this tweet thread quote communities in the east are not super fussy about risks compared to the west some experienced ones are willing to gamble to chase the high yield and some are putting a small amount of money just to try it out and experience the excitement on such high yields and speaking of the east china arrested 109 members allegedly behind the plus token project bitcoin's biggest ponzi scheme ever with over three billion dollars worth of crypto being scammed so next we have a d5 roundup because there is kind of a lot of activity in d5 so we're just gonna do a quick run through some of these developments first with the explosion in d5 the number of contract calls to ethereum hit an all-time high on july 25th with more than 3.1 million daily contract calls the majority of them being attributed to d5 according to coinmetrics next headline our next bullet point maker doubt became the first d5 protocol to reach one billion dollars in total value locked however kyle simani of my multi-coin capital and tweeted that total volume locked or tvl is not a useful metric at least for lending pools like compound and ave since it subtracts demand from the main metric meanwhile synthetics replace the synthetics foundation with three dowels one for protocol upgrades one to fund public goods and synthetics and one to manage and deploy funds to contributors d5 protocol ave also went fully decentralized transferring governance from the ave core team to ave token holders dharma integrated with uniswap and enabled support for over 2000 tokens on the uniswap v2 platform betting platform agar launched its version 2 which integrates d5 features such as ipfs the file storage system 0x mesh dye and uniswap's v2 oracle network and finally ftx is launching a dex called serum on solana according to ftx ceo sam thinkman freed solana can process ten thousand times as much as ethereum and it's one million times cheaper time for fun bits an adorable way to view live transactions txtreet.com is a very cute transaction visualizer which represents bitcoin ethereum and or bitcoin cash as transactions or sorry the the transactions on those networks as little people lining up to ride buses whenever a new transaction is broadcast on the network a person appears to board a bus they get to board the first bus if the transaction has a high enough fee otherwise they have to wait their turn alright thanks for tuning in and to learn more about dimitri and ethereum be sure to check out the
