hi folks we have a fabulous episode with milton demirs and lynn alden on the macro environment surrounding bitcoin pegged to the us presidential election which takes place the day this show comes out however first i would like to add context to the unchained interview with andre cronia of urine finance whether or not andre's statements in this episode are inaccurate is up to interpretation but the additional context can help you all decide during the episode i asked andre about a dispute he had with phantom and xar which involves greg vander spay of z-a-r network and andre said quote there is no contractual agreements between me and them the additional context i would like to provide here is that greg andre and two other parties had a memorandum of understanding dating back to may 2019 to establish a blockchain platform called zar zar network later a contract between an entity named kirk neutone of which andre had 25 and the phantom network was signed in august 2019. andre also said quote the long and the short is all of this only happened after yearns success andre dates year in success to may 2020 when yearn reached a total value locked of more than 10 million dollars greg's first legal letter to andre was june 16th 2020. however text message messages show discord between andre and greg in april i also asked andre about their allegations that he was running yearn.finance yearn.exchange and yearn.fi on their infrastructure andre said that the civil action against him was quote based on the fact that i had unlawful access to our amazon web services account which was registered under my credit card that i have proof and evidence for greg says it is true that andre registered those on andre's personal aws and with his personal credit card however on the who is look up for urine.finance and yearn dot exchange the registrant organization which is another word for owner is tsar network spelled z-a-r and that's the blockchain platform described in the memorandum of understanding also greg says that andre originally tried to register 12 domains using greg's personal credit card and greg's aws account but that when the payment for the domains for urine.finance yearn.f.i and urine.exchange was declined on greg's card andre registered those on his personal credit card andre claims that it was a shared aws for the company greg says it is his account in a text exchange andre informed greg he had accidentally registered those domains on what greg calls our account and andre responds he thought he was logged in on his account and so would reimburse greg greg responds no need at all dude additionally it looks like andre had stored the logo that is now used as the urine logo on the tsar xar google drive and the ileverage.finance iliquidate.finance and itrade.finance domains were also stored on greg's aws and those domains now show notices that they are quote the subject of an active criminal investigation case number cas 176-7 2020 of fraud theft and crime in nigeria with the south african police services the notice says this also applies to a list of other domains including yearn.finance lastly andre said in the show quote greg himself later came out and said there is no case against me however greg says there is an active criminal investigation into andre opened in c point cape town andre says his attorneys have looked for the case but have not found anything i reached out to the south african police in multiple ways and was not able to determine the validity of the claims on either side however the police did say that the notice on the websites was not placed by them since the contact address is a gmail address and not a south african police services or saps email i and the team at unchained regret not reading reaching out to xar or phantom in this dispute for comment before publishing the show now on to my conversation with milton and lynn hi everyone welcome to unchained your no-hype resource for all things crypto i'm

is the seventh episode in the why bitcoin now series in which we take a closer look at bitcoin in the context of macroeconomic forces including the pandemic and the economic response the series launched at the end of june with a look at the macro environment then and how it intersected with bitcoin and now four months later we're going to regroup on that topic amidst the presidential election to cover the many macro developments since then and how they impact bitcoin here to discuss are melton to mirrors chief strategy officer at coin shares and lynn alden founder of lynn alden investment strategy welcome melton lin hi it's so exciting to be here and i'm so thrilled i have to say to finally do podcasts with lin yeah thanks so much for having me and i'm glad to meet both of you and i'm really excited for this so let's just start with kind of like a little price check-in before we dive into all the macro stuff as of the time of this recording bitcoin has passed the three-month mark of having a price above 10k during the 2017-2018 bull run it only stayed above that price for two months what do you think is the significance of this and what does it say about how bitcoin and the circumstances surrounding bitcoin have changed over that period lynn why don't you kick this off and then i'll go into the crypto nitty gritty uh sure so i mean you know i look a lot about bitcoin in context of the having cycle so this is actually pretty normal uh for where we are uh you know this this many months after the having and so of course every cycle you don't know if it's gonna it's gonna perform like the last couple cycles have uh but it's it's one of the strongest uh kind of patterns we have so far even though it's a pretty small sample size uh so combining that with the macro backdrop it's not too surprising to see how bitcoin's holding up you know i think a key thing to watch is that you know going forward uh that a lot of the macroeconomic situation in addition to being tied to the virus is very tied to stimulus and so we see you know whenever there's not enough stimulus we see kind of disinflationary pressures reassert themselves and it's going to be interesting to see if you know if if bitcoin's kind of bullish having cycle how that relates to uh you know potentially that that volatile aspect and so far it's holding up uh you know quite well compared to you know compared to precious metals compared to equities uh so far it's kind of doing its own thing to some extent and i'll i'll just add on to what lynn said um i think one of the other interesting things you know since the inception of bitcoin and the writing of the bitcoin white paper which we're going to celebrate the 12-year birthday this weekend which is exciting um one important thing to keep in mind is we've never really seen how bitcoin behaves during an economic recession and at this point i think it's fair to say we are in a recession after two quarters of back-to-back economic contraction so what i think is really interesting is for the first time we are actually watching bitcoin in the environment for which bitcoin was sort of designed if you will if you look at what's happening which you know lynn has alluded to and has written about in so much of her research the environment we're in right now um that is unfolding you know there's all this money printing going on when money printer go burr right we anticipate inflation will happen just because it hasn't happened yet and just because from a cpi or consumer price index perspective we aren't feeling inflation doesn't mean it's not rampant in the market if we look at the facts u.s home prices are seeing their fastest quarter over quarter increase in recent history i think in 40-year history so home prices are going up at a very rapid pace um we're seeing equities right equities are trading at 2025 forward p e multiples so people are pricing in their expectations of the future today and they're looking for for growth so i think bitcoin is actually starting to find its place in the narrative we talk about narrative all the time in the crypto space and i think one of the things lynn alluded to when she talked about the having psyche you know this is one of the narratives it's also substantiated with a lot of data but the having narrative is is a consistent one we've had over sort of the last 12 years of bitcoin and i think what we're seeing now and the reason i talk about all of these facts is this narrative that we've talked about in the bitcoin community for you know the last seven years that i've been in it is now finally unfolding in the real world and so watching bitcoin's behavior in this environment i think is really exciting um to me you know we're going to continue to test bitcoin strength i think bitcoin's decoupling from equities has been interesting to watch bitcoin's breakout from gold has been interesting to watch but until this actually plays out and we have the data and the evidence which again likes what i love about lynn and she's like show me the receipts right show me the receipts so until we have the receipts to prove bitcoin's behavior in this environment we've hypothesized about for so long um it'll be difficult to sort of say definitively what'll happen but my view i'm very bullish very excited and as um our friend raul powell likes to say irresponsibly long yeah i love how you phrased that when you said that this is the environment that bitcoin was designed for in a way that's like uh perhaps a more succinct way of explaining why i'm doing this series now you know when the pandemic started happening and the stimulus response came in i just thought how are these not the perfect conditions for bitcoin and it should be a time when i would have expected that a lot of people would be doing research about it so that's why i was like i should probably do a series on all this and so another big development going on is that the day this episode comes out will be the presidential election and lynn you wrote up a really thorough analysis of u.s gdp growth federal debt growth and stock market performance under republican and democratic presidents and something that struck me about it is that the gdp and stock performance uh was better under democratic presidents than republicans republican ones which surprised me because i thought markets generally went up on positive news for republicans you know for instance like when trump won the election in 2016. so and then actually the other thing i noticed was you know even things like federal debt have tended to rise under republicans more than democrats and then again the conventional wisdom tends to be that democrats are the big spenders and republicans are fiscally conservative so why is there this disconnect between the narrative and the data and how do you think the markets will react to a trump win versus abide in win especially one in which their party also takes the legislature if if that happens yeah and i think you know one one thing i kind of point out in the article was the difficulty of forecasting because first you have to be right about the outcome and then write about the uh you know uh when you get that outcome how does the market respond to it uh so one thing i point out is back when you know when when trump and clinton were going together uh the narrative was that you know because uh trump was the outsider he was the the long shot and so people were like if he wins like the markets are probably going to crash uh there are a couple economists that were kind of pointing that out and so when he did have that upset win uh markets immediately sold off for a few hours that night and then and then just soared of course uh in the in the months that followed and that's of course because they were correctly pricing in their corporate tax cuts that were going to come uh and so you know we've seen that play out now going forward i don't have a strong differentiator between if you get a a trump win and a red hold in the senate or if you get a biden uh win i think there are certain sectors that could that could perform very differently uh but the kind of the two things i'm weighing against each other are of course if you get the if you get the blue sweep you have a higher probability of corporate tax rates going up uh and potentially other taxes going up uh but you also have potentially more stimulus spending uh which could benefit some of those companies bottom lines especially if you look a little bit more in the in the cyclical stocks or the value stocks on the other hand if you have a you know kind of a more red sweep uh you know you're kind of increasing the probability that you're locking in the existing tax cuts and potentially getting more tax cuts we're also potentially factoring in somewhat lower uh stimulus spending and i think actually the the thing that people aren't focusing on enough is whether or not you get a gridlock scenario so i'm actually paying a little bit closer attention to the senate race as it pertains to asset prices uh than i am to the presidential race because uh in many ways uh you know trump's not he doesn't fit cleanly in with either party to some extent he's not a he's not a you know kind of a traditional fiscal conservative uh he he wants very large stimulus so the senate is a little bit more of a battleground between kind of fiscal conservatism and uh some of the more progressive aspects that we're seeing so i'm actually focusing on more so who wins the senate because for example a buying win with a red senate is a very different outcome than a biden win with a blue senate or even a trump win with a red senate because he could potentially get more things through that senate than biden could so i i think that's kind of the key thing to look out for is is how kind of gridlocked it is or how decisive it is melting do you want to add anything to that because i i was a little bit it just wasn't the kind of analysis that or the conclusions of it were not what i was expecting and that made me wonder how things would and go you know uh with this election yeah absolutely well this is why i love reading lin's research like not to fangirl for lynn which i do on a regular basis but she has the receipts which obviously you know one of my big focuses particularly with the way i look at the crypto ecosystem and what i like to share is you know let's look at the data let's look at the facts and see whether those facts substantiate the narrative and i think what lin's research piece very helpfully points out is the facts right when we look at the data they don't support the popular narrative i think she's absolutely right in terms of the senate and house races mattering much more than the presidential race the other thing that's that's been really interesting to see that i don't think we talk about enough is stimulus and tax cuts right um and typically i think the way people frame their thinking is democrats are all for stimulus social aid benefits people call them quote unquote socialist policies because they focus more on distributive economics uh and sort of distributing wealth and and creating a bigger state and sort of this idea of you know distribu distributing uh wealth whereas i think the republicans and and the way the gop is sort of framing policy right now is in the form of tax cuts right so minimizing uh sort of uh the the amount that gets taken out of your paycheck making sure that some of the regulatory restrictions that are making it more challenging this is their framing not mine for certain businesses to operate are removed making it easier for people uh you know and and part of this also really matters in what's happening on the supreme court right now if you'll recall rgb was staunchly anti-corporate um and she defended workers rights amy coney barrett you know we don't have that much data about her rulings but my senses she's probably more pro-corporate and less workers rights so i anticipate there will be some erosion of workers rights under the current construction of the supreme court which is important to consider but i think what what people mistake is stimulus and tax cuts have the same effect in the sense that they create a massive deficit and the story here is regardless of who gets elected we have a massive massive deficit in this country and then you factor in the one really important thing that i think neither party talks about is unaccounted for liabilities right so typically people are you know putting together the balance sheet if you will for united states we have tax revenues every year on the scale somewhere between four and five trillion dollars and then we have all of these liabilities which is our spending we have a bunch of unfunded liabilities in the form of medicare medicaid and social security and those unfunded liabilities are only going to get larger as more and more people start to retire right we are seeing the biggest shift in our labor force ever we're seeing supposedly a massive generational wealth transfer but health care costs are highly highly inflationary and continuing to rise and so my biggest concern is this under either party we have a huge problem with the deficit we have a huge problem with the liability of social security medicare and medicaid we have a population where wealth has disproportionately accrued to the older generations and younger generations are not accumulating wealth so what we have is a setup for a cataclysmic retirement crisis and in this environment there is no possible way i don't care if you're blue you're red you're orange i don't care what color you are in this environment there is no possible way for any party to do anything other than continue to inflate 401ks and retirement accounts and continue to inflate home prices which constitute the majority of wealth that the average american holds right the largest asset they typically have is their 401k or their retirement account and their home value and in this environment they both sides they have to print money it's not even a partisan issue what this leads to and this again sort of goes back to i think a lot of what lynn writes about there is no there is no foreseeable way out of this debt spiral or money printing spiral it is completely and fundamentally unsustainable and so um i'm just you know i'm very interested to see over the next four or five years how political parties might actually start to change because of this wealth gap i'm in texas right now in houston young voters are turning out in droves right the power is shifting states that were previously read are becoming purple or in some cases may flip blue states that were blue in the past are starting to become maybe purple or shifting towards reds like the battleground is shifting and people don't talk enough about the demographic changes that are influencing those shifts and the underlying sort of culture war that is emerging between the old way and sort of this this new way um and at the end of the day you know i'm not going to work 40 hours a week as a 25 year old so i can pay 80 of my income you know to make sure grandma and grandpa have have medical care and and can live comfortably in retirement that's not gonna fly so i'm very curious to see how these dynamics unfold and i don't think people talk about that enough in terms of sort of the political landscape we've had a number of unique circumstances this year the pandemic hit and we saw record unemployment and especially in the us and obviously certain industries pretty much came to a near halt but then at least also in the us we saw the us government deployed 2.6 million dollars a trillion dollars in stimulus and nine zeros um yeah things would look a little different if it was 2.6 million but anyway um there was about 20 trillion dollars in stimulus um deployed overall worldwide according to the imf and i just wondered how would you say these countervailing factors you know the record unemployment and these industries just coming to a halt um against all the stimulus how would you say that those have affected the macro environment and bitcoin so far this year uh so a big thing i'm kind of focusing on is where we are in the long term debt cycle so a lot of my work uh you know ray dalia popularized that concept and it's something that i've incorporated as well which is that you know you have the normal five to ten year business cycle but you know they don't just every time you get to the end of that cycle and restart you don't start fresh right so every every cycle you get lower and lower interest rates you get higher and higher debt levels and you string a bunch of those together until you hit the zero bound in interest rates and until you get extraordinarily high debt levels as a percentage of gdp and so then that subsequent deleveraging event looks very different than you know the the say the five or six or seven normal deleveraging events that transpired before then and so the last time we were in a situation where the long-term death cycle was unfolding was way back in the 1930s and 40s and so it's it's you know it's a very challenging period to compare to because you know technology's so different culture's so different geopolitics are so different but it's the closest thing we have to in terms of where policymakers are in terms of fiscal monetary policy and that's actually true that the same kind of structures in place for most developed countries in the world and to some extent emerging markets but mostly to develop a developed market phenomenon and so you know if if this pandemic had happened in say a much less levered world uh the response could have been much smaller uh because you know people would have had more say savings less debt levels and so you know stimulus could have been more targeted more specific but because it's such a highly leveraged system and so you know the impact of shutting down a highly leveraged system is so systemic that's why we've seen such massive stimulus and you know the federal government for example went into this running trillion dollar deficits uh with with you know with debt to gdp ratios not seen since the you know the 1940s and so this just blew out that fiscal situation and put pressure on the fact that housing uh and pri and corporate sector debts are are still extraordinarily high uh and so that that's kind of how i'm looking at this and that's why you know the election to some extent it matters in the sense that you know how gridlocked it is uh and there will be specific differences between who wins but as melton point out who i whoever wins the deficits are still going to be continued to be very large you know years out regardless of almost any political outcome yeah and and i'll add to some of what lynn said i think the other thing that's really notable laura i mean we saw this with how stimulus was implemented right um large corporations who have spent decades uh doing share buybacks paying large bonus packages and basically you know operating on on really high levels of debt um turned to the government and needed bailouts to stay afloat and i think that is and like endemic to a a form of corporate social like we don't live in a democracy we live in a corporate socialist society where the government takes money from taxpayers 75 of tax revenues come from individuals 75 only 11 comes from corporations so they're taking taxpayer dollars right um and they are using it to finance bailouts for large corporations it happened in 2008 which is where we learned that this was totally acceptable behavior and basically other than a handful of groups like you know um occupy wall street nobody really cared and bankers walked away you know with massive bonus packages and and this process continued for another 10 years now it's happening again you know government's gonna do what they can get away with you know people have talked a lot about uh sort of the cantelon effect or the fact that people who are closest to the money printer are those who are most likely to receive bailouts and you see this right the private sector has ingratiated itself with the public sector there is very little distinction here and it's really wall street that's driving policy when it comes to the stimulus right and both sides again i think people try to you know differentiate political parties by their their policies particularly their economic policies i call bs right i'm not gonna cuss but it's total bs they're one in the same both parties are one in the same they're gonna engage in the same behavior some will be mo more over about it some will be more covert about it some will be more subtle some will be more you know in your face and we've seen with trump sort of personal styling that he is very overt about his actions but the democrats are really no different in their behavior and they were complicit in one of the largest sort of tax uh fraud sort of instances with with tarp right there are billions of dollars that were unaccounted for there are still billions of dollars that are unaccounted for so i think the same cycle is sort of continuing there's total lack of accountability there's a total lack of responsibility there's a total lack of leadership and so i don't see this changing anytime soon and the the prevailing ideology it's not just in the us it's everywhere spend spend spend the last point i'll make um which i think is interesting is you know lynn you just said zero is is the limit zero is no longer the limit right like a mervin good friend predicted this uh many many years ago marvin good friend you know he predicted nrp or negative rate policies he also predicted that the only way you could implement nrp or negative rate policy was through a central bank digital currency or some way to keep people from exiting the system and so again like we're in this setup we're entering you know people overuse this phrase but we're entering an unprecedented period in history we've never seen something like this before but rates are zero for the foreseeable future inflation target is two to two point five percent how does that work so to me the answer then is it's bitcoin it's gold right there are assets that people believe are resilient in the face of inflation and what's interesting the last thing i'll say which i already said but one more thing so people like to say you know the stock market oh it's bullish stock market is over performing stocks stocks are not going up what's happening is the value of the dollar is going down right and and that really i think is the fundamental framing that people don't understand until they start to grasp the idea of bitcoin and things that are are scarce in nature we can print more dollars we can't print more bitcoins the reason the price of stocks is going up is because there are more and more dollars in the system chasing fewer and fewer assets and so again what i think this means for bitcoin if i'm looking at my portfolio right let's say i'm a an advisor and i charge two percent to my clients to manage their portfolios and i have them in a typical 60 40 portfolio meaning i have 60 in equities of 40 in bonds my 40 just got wiped to zero my 40 is now zero and so there is no way that my client is going to continue to pay me two percent to give them zero or very close to zero so how am i going to deliver performance how am i effectively going to diversify and how am i going to keep pace with inflation and i think all across the world in investment committees these conversations are happening and they have to happen they're starting slowly but i think as this realization sets in right with the boomers who are running these banks and no offense because they generally are men in their 50s and 60s who have a certain set of beliefs of how the world functions and that belief has been completely shattered they have not yet adapted to their new reality but they soon will have to i'm sure lynn you've been talking to many banks who are like what do we do we've been talking to banks and asset managers who are asking what do we do and is bitcoin maybe part of the answer to how we stay relevant how we keep aum and actually deliver a product that our clients will pay for it like it's it's not rocket science right it's it's simple math it's addition and multiplication like any number times zero is zero and lynn are you having similar conversations because i do wonder um if this is part of you know the fuel that's led to things like the recent jpmorgan research note that finally years after many of us have been in the space and recognized that oh yeah some of the um assets in bitcoin could be tran in gold could be transferred over to bitcoin um or things like that you know they finally publish something like that um are you noticing similar uh thoughts from other traditional investors absolutely i mean you know one of my common questions from my research clients is you know what do i do with like the you know the bond portfolio uh you know the portion of my portfolio that spots uh because you know they're worried about they're looking at equities they're saying okay you know so so with stocks in many cases are are quite expensive based on most uh metrics on the other hand the one metric where stocks are not expensive is the equity risk premium so if you compare say the s p 500 earnings yield or the dividend yield compared to the 10-year treasury that's actually still moderate and it's because as expensive stocks are bonds in many ways are even more expensive if you look at it you know that in that way because their yields are so low and so they're saying you know what what are the what's left uh so i often point to you know certain foreign markets uh potentially offer better risk board uh scenarios with with you know more attractive valuations relative to their growth potential i also point to alternative assets like gold and you know bitcoin uh i think for example gold can replace a a segment of a bond portfolio uh for example uh and so you know it's definitely like one of the most common questions i get and it's getting more and more mainstream the the the concern about what is what's going to happen to my cash if i just hold this at zero yields for the next five years uh and you know for example the other day i gave a presentation to a bank board of directors and you know bitcoin wasn't one of my kind of presentation points like i was just talking about fiscal monetary policy and then one of the first things they asked when i was done was uh what do i think about bitcoin uh because they had noticed uh for example the michael michael saylor you know at this point it's worth half a billion dollars in bitcoin that he put on his balance sheet uh and they had heard in one of the interviews that you know he he when he was convincing his board of directors he sent a bunch of different materials to them and one of the things he sent was my article on bitcoin uh so the board's like so is this like how real is this like how so is this like still an asset crack class for the crazies or is it like a you know an actual that's how they phrased it or is it an actual like do you treat it like a commodity do you treat like a currency uh so i gave them like my you know kind of my five minute you know kind of bullish overview for bitcoin uh so yeah i'm definitely kind of seeing this both you know down to the retail investor and all the way up to people you know kind of overseeing banks and just thinking you know what are we looking at here and interesting from the people running the banks i mean they even questioned uh whether or not things like cpi are accurate measures of inflation uh because in some ways they were actually uh referring to the austrian definition of inflation which is just increasing the monetary supply uh so they were saying that you know this year their deposit place just uh blew up right so the amount of deposits coming in uh has grown dramatically for them which is true if you look you know nationwide uh what a bank's deposits done you know because broad money supply has gone up so much because bank deposits went up so much they're reviewing that as a form of inflation uh and saying you know is this is this going to be different than say 2008 so that was kind of how they were looking at it well this is really fascinating and um it makes me uh reminisce a little bit about those days when we used to talk about the um wall of institutional money that was going to come to the space and now i'm a little bit like oh okay well maybe it will actually happen finally um wait hold on laura you know i i want to say something about that and this is something i get very fired up about we don't need the wall of institutional money coming into bitcoin institutions do not get bitcoin they have not gotten bitcoin and the way they're thinking about bitcoin now is completely antithetical to the point of bitcoin what they want to do with bitcoin is stick it into a vault right however you do that through their custody solution and then they want to hypothecate it and multiply the bitcoin supply by creating synthetic products on top of the bitcoin they okay for bitcoin to go mainstream and i'd we can even like categorize on mainstream use if we want the number to go up right like the way number goes up is very simple we need more demand than supply that's already happened and that's the happening that that um that lin mentioned earlier but the thing is like everyone keeps talking about institutional money i don't care about the institutional money right because the institutional money we keep trying to take bitcoin and shove it into a box so that institutions will want to buy it hold it eat it right we're like hey if we take this and we package it and we shove it down your throat do you want it right and they're like oh if we package it this way like yes i don't want to do that right bitcoin needs to fundamentally change the way that we think about financial institutions that is the whole point and i think that's what so many people are proving with the way they're building their bitcoin focused businesses but taking all of the bitcoin in the world and shoving it in into bony's custody solution and then building a bunch of synthetic derivatives around it so you get bitcoin depository receipts that is no different than the paper money we hold today right like it's marginally better maybe sort of from monetary policy perspective but it's nonsensical so i actually reject this notion that institutions need to adopt bitcoin bitcoin is going to fundamentally change the way that institutions function that is my goal that is my objective that is my belief yes there will be a transition period or an evolutionary period over which that happens but if the objective is to take bitcoin and make it look feel smell taste you know look like what what banking looks like today then we have completely missed the point so i would say forget about the institutional wall of money focus on changing what it means to be an institution servicing a new asset like bitcoin yeah actually it's funny that you say all this because i have been thinking to myself oh once kraken launches its bank and um avanti bank launches i i just wonder how these things will change the way banking is done because their business model is going to be quite different um but so this is kind of like a perfect moment actually because we're going to take a little break and there's so much else to discuss because there's this whole like geopolitical thing going on in the world that really intersects with everything going on bitcoin so we will talk about that in a moment after this quick word from our sponsors crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and

focused on what's been going on in the u.s um but i also wanted to talk about how the imf recently made waves for a speech in which the washington dc managing director crystalina george ava called for a new bretton woods moment the speech itself was actually kind of anodyne to me um you know she called for financial inclusion closing the gender inequality gap addressing climate change um but then you know a lot of people were talking about this and saying there's a lot more under the hood to what she was saying so what do you think is or will be the significance of this speech particularly for digital assets and bitcoin amidst you know everything else going on so i i can hop in here to start and then i'll i'll pass it to you um look i i think the notable thing about what's unfolding um and it's not just the imf it's the ecb it's you know bank of japan it's the pdc the people's bank of china um there there's all of this um monetary talk unfolding right and basically what's what's happening is for the last gosh in 60 years the dollar really since world war ii right and arguably maybe even before the dollar has been the supreme currency the us has had both political and economic hegemony and in many ways you know the us has benefited from its ability to export inflation by printing more dollars and by sort of having the entire global economy run on on dollars largely fueled by the way um by sort of the the petro dollar right or the use of the dollar in the oil and gas industry which for many many years defined the nature of global geopolitical conflict and the largest uh financial flows between nation states and so for the first time i think um everyone around the world is is seeing an opportunity to erode the supremacy of the us dollar and when i say that i don't necessarily think that's that's a negative thing but i think uh the the u.s dollar has sort of been in this dominant position for so long that people now see a window of opportunity to sort of redefine uh where the us dollar fits in sort of the global monetary system bitcoin i think is sort of the initial challenge if bitcoin has proven one thing um that i think is really valuable it's that there is room for things like bitcoin to not only exist but to actually thrive right and what's so fun to me um a few years ago i love sharing this story a few years ago i went to um eurofee which is an event for european central bankers and um i was at a dinner with with several central bankers including you know the gabundus bank and bis and some of these large large global banks and i was talking about bitcoin and of course right i was the crazy bitcoin lady only women in the room but also the crazy bitcoin lady um and and one of the the people who runs one of these things said to me well you can't have a currency you don't have an army and i said i'm excuse me i have an army it's called crypto twitter and and i say this in a slightly joking way but it's it's very serious like for the first time we have proven that um the the intractable link between money and state can be broken and you can have money without state right and the idea of digital statehood which i know lynn and i both want to get into and like the internet versus everything else um we've proven this idea and i think that is extremely powerful it's extremely scary i don't think people grasp how serious it is and you can't put it back right bitcoin has reached a point where like you you can't go back it's inevitability so it's to me i think bitcoin has actually forced a conversation that maybe would have not happened for another 10 15 20 years if these events hadn't unfolded in this way maybe it's serendipitous like maybe there are greater forces at play but i definitely think a lot of people whether they will admit it or not have been inspired by bitcoin um both positive and negative right but they've seen the potential of what can be done um when you build a global movement and bitcoin's not just technology or money right it's also social on a political movement yeah i agree and you know one thing i've been focusing on so a lot of people now are kind of asking me what are my thoughts on this you know the new you know the quote new britain woods uh you know proposal and now we're using words like great reset things like that uh so i view a lot of this is kind of framing a narrative uh however if you look back over the past several years there have been kind of cracks in the in the current system building for a while and so we were already kind of moving towards uh you know i think the outcome can take many forms but we're already kind of moving towards the necessity for the current system to kind of shift over into another system and so this is kind of like you know now the pandemic kind of pulled forward maybe the next three years or so and just kind of put that more in the forefront uh you know we're already kind of getting there so if you look back you know so we had the bread and wood system which was that the doll the dollars backed by gold and other currencies back themselves by the dollar and uh but that kind of ended of course in 1971 when you know the us was exporting a lot of its gold and so that was it was an unkind of sustainable situation uh so then the dollar is backed by nothing and you know globally we had then you know a pretty rapid period of currency devaluation so we had high inflation in multiple countries uh in the us in particular we had some issues and so the next stage of that system was the petrodollar system where you know we using the united states large military presence and ability to protect a supply line to protect certain nations uh they set it up so that you know almost all oil pricing worldwide happens in dollars and so people often refer to the fact that you know every say you know 50 to 100 years you have another global reserve currency uh but wait what made this period unique is that you know in those past periods it wasn't necessarily the the current itself that was the global reserve asset i mean there's still like precious metals that were kind of the core of that uh but it was the fact that that currency was widely accepted uh whereas the petrodollar system was a more unique period where one currency had a total lock on global uh you know commodity pricing which is which is different from the previous ones and so we had this situation where all all countries had to have the dollar in order to buy commodities especially oil and so but that also makes a situation where we had to make sure that we had tons of dollars out there in the system uh which necessarily means that we're running very large trade deficits uh you know over uh decades pretty much and there were economists uh back when this was set up they warned that this this you know back in the bretton woods system they warned that this would be an issue over time uh but basically you know we said okay we don't care about what happens 50 years from now we want to we want to you know structure the system to uh you know kind of solidify power now but now there were decades later you know now that those decades later are here uh so basically if you look back over the past several decades you know the united states has run very persistent trade deficits and that the system itself is is reinforcing uh so because there's so much dollar demand out there right because there's there's demand for the dollar in order by commodities and then over time you get more and more dollar dominated debt outside of the outside of the u.s right so you know corporations and countries around the world uh you know they get financing in dollars and so that you know to service those debt they need dollars uh so we have this kind of dual kind of demand for the dollar that's really persistent so for most countries if they start running big trade deficits uh you know next time they have like a recession or crisis they usually get kind of a currency devaluation uh and that increases their uh you know export competitiveness and reduces their import ability and so it kind of helps correct their imbalance the us never really experiences that uh correction because there's this kind of extra demand for the dollar the dollar at all times and so we've basically over you know say 50 years exported a very large portion of our industrial base even more than many other developed countries like if you compare us to europe or compared to japan we've really kind of doubled down on the services sector and exported a lot of our industrial base of course and that has had you know profound impacts on you know especially you know craftsman blue collar labor uh and to the benefit and for many types of white collar labor for example so we've had you know some of the benefits of crew to some segment to society and not to others and but this system's really kind of stretched now because you know that the world is so kind of uh uh kind of saturated with dollar debt uh at the same time the us is just so kind of hollowed out in terms of its industrial base and now there's a narrative that we want to bring back industrial base but that's really challenging to do with the with the current system as structured uh so there's so many kind of uh things pointing to another system slowly emerging and we started to see this you know uh you know for the past decades whenever a country tries to price oil on something other than dollars uh their next several years tend to not be very pleasant you know militarily you know militarily speaking uh but we started to see for example uh when russia says that they want to start pricing uh oil and euros there's not much that the us can do about that you know physically uh so instead we sanction them we we say mean things but there's not a ton we can we can directly do about it uh and similarly we if you looked at for example uh trade between russia and china over the past several years uh if you look back you know two three years ago uh you know something like eighty percent of their trade was dollar based uh and that's now fallen to something like you know forty five percent uh so they started using the euro more they started to use some of their local currencies and so we're starting to see somewhat of a multi-polar system uh and so in some ways you know people are worried about how that would affect the the dollar and you know america's status in the world but in many cases even the united states is really harmed by this current you know system as structured right because we're the ones that have to run very large deficits uh and so as we move on to the next system you know it's gonna be it's be some sort of multi-polar system or you know neutral reserve settlement assets there are all sorts of you know of course digital assets now present another type of technology we can incorporate into the ways that these uh countries can go about that but the general theme is that it's less based on one country's currency and more based on either multi-polar system or on a neutral reserve asset yeah so this is the perfect segue to my next question because obviously in the mix with all of this china has begun rolling out its digital currency dcep and um amidst you know all these kind of um things it's doing with you know trading partners such as russia i also wondered what you thought about how the dcep will affect the the balance um particularly when it comes to africa because you know the population there is so young and that's where we're seeing digital asset adoption maybe can move a bit faster because the legacy financial system there is less robust so i wondered what effect you thought the dc ep would have on the playing field you know do you think it gives china leg up especially if it can use that as a leverage point when it comes to dealing with these emerging economies particularly around the belt and road initiative or do you think that you know people and many businesses and countries have inherent trust issues with china so i wondered if that would always sort of like limit the impact of dcep um if i may jump in here so we've invested in a number of companies at coin shares outside of the the us and particularly in emerging markets including southeast asia middle east regions where china is attempting to extend its influence so let's just talk quickly about dcp i think there are two things that are really important about dcp that are not talked about enough i believe that that we will have over one billion chinese consumers interacting with digital renminbi before western governments write a single definitive policy guidance okay and and i say this not uh to lambast the leadership of western quote-unquote democracies although i certainly do that in other conversations i say that because the fundamental difference between china and the u.s for example china is a command and control system right there is one philosophy one ideology there's one ruler and it flows downhill the u.s has been in partisan gridlock for a long time now and we see it um in the regulatory environment right there are lots of different regulators they are you know their state rights versus federal rights and the system of checks and balances that has been set up to uh sort of you know protect the republic and and sort of this concept of american democracy and the form in which it had historically existed is no longer really relevant in our digital world and i think what we're seeing is the struggle of the american republic and its governance structure to operate successfully in in the digital world right like it's very difficult to find to define where physical jurisdiction begins and ends in a world that's digital right this concept is intractable like these these two ideas are fundamentally incompatible which is why you see so much of cryptocurrency focused regulation is defined by physical jurisdiction right like bitcoin doesn't have a physical jurisdiction it just doesn't and so what we see um i think one is you know there's a fundamental difference and it means that china moves at a much higher speed the second thing that i think is really interesting is china has one singular focus their focus is empire right and here i'm sort of projecting a bit but the focus is empire and i think what's been interesting to observe is in in the chinese system when there's support for something there's an unlimited amount of economic capital like investment capital but also political capital that's made available to make this thing happen right so you look at the investment in manufacturing capabilities you look at the investment r d and uh semiconductor fab right you look at different parts of their economy now you look at dcp and bri the belt and road initiative like these are all a function of the fact that china has unlimited economic and political will lynn shared an interesting statistic on her blog that 10 years from now you know the chinese economy will comprise close to 30 percent of the global economy and the us economy will sort of shrink over time and i think this this shifting and rebalancing of the world is is an interesting one one topic we haven't talked about is india right um india actually in a way is i think an under discussed topic the indian subcontinent is more populous than north america south america and europe combined right but also uh i think the indian subcontinent is just less understood perhaps than china people don't talk about it as much and i think politically maybe it's been a little less organized um but i do think what you're seeing right now is a realigning a polarization right if we think about you know the the 1945 the result of 1945 and the drawing of spheres of influence and the splitting of the world into axes and allies right we're now seeing a new type of polarization i call it the new cold war maybe that's a bad characterization but i definitely think there's sort of a schism and it exists along three primary lines it's economic right and we've talked a little bit about the currency war and and some of the things happening there it's it's digital right um in terms of infrastructure information where information resides how it flows who develops software who uses software and we see this playing out right like huawei getting hit with ricoh charges and not being able to build 5g in the us or in europe the implementation of the clean act which like tries to remove chinese influence and makes an american firewall more explicit in terms of our telecommunications infrastructure we see it with tick-tock right and like president trump bragging about you know selling tick-tock when in fact the only thing that tick-tock actually did was move its u.s data into a data center run by oracle which is a us corporation but like fundamentally the company bike dance is is still domiciled in china so it's very bizarre so you see this sort of uh digital war that's breaking down and then the last one again is it's it's a culture war right and i think again this is where it starts to get really interesting the demographics of the west are aging sick populations and an extreme disparity of wealth um in many ways right but also extreme distributions of wealth meaning older generations have much more wealth than younger generations and the ability of younger generations to earn wealth is less than before in each successive generation whereas in these emerging economies and these rising powers right um the the demographic situation's much different they have a young population it's not as old they have a booming young population um that young population is very entrepreneurial you know they have they're starting to see more and more economic opportunity they're building businesses so i think there are these fundamental differences they're starting to merge economic warfare digital warfare and then i think there's sort of a demographic or sort of culture war that's emerging and all three of these are working together to sort of redefine the the fabric of our world i'm not an expert by any means in any one of these i just find this very fascinating because i don't think people think about them in tandem enough i think there are people who specialize right in the economic implications maybe in the infrastructure implications and maybe separately on the the culture and sort of demographic implications but none of these things exist in isolation and when you look at them together i think the story is so telling and it's terrifying in some way but i think change is good like i'm i'm a proponent of change right like the universe tends towards entropy and chaos so you might as well lean in embrace it and sort of build for a future filled with chaos and uncertainty so my belief is more chaos more uncertainty and increased polarization i actually i want to take this so i know this episode is mostly about bitcoin but i just have to call out this essay that you wrote on the digital war because it was so fascinating to me i just i hadn't really you know i mean you know like you said you're just pulling in kinds of all you know all these different things together and into one piece but one thing that fascinated me about your conclusion was that you said that you felt that all these things going on in terms of the digital war would result in more metered bandwidth consumption which is basically a definition of ethereum you know it's a platform in which you pay for the computation that you use and so of course i know this this episode and this series does focus on bitcoin but this was actually the first time i'd seen a clear argument for how macro forces will drive usage of ethereum so can we just take a a couple minutes for you to explain that because that was so fascinating i hadn't really heard anybody articulated in that way before i i think it's not a uh necessarily you know an articulation of the value proposition of ethereum i actually want to go back to something i vehemently believe which is that bitcoin at its core is a telecommunications protocol right it's a protocol that allows us to communicate um but it allows us to communicate about utxos right and and value in the form of bitcoin what i think is really interesting is the bitcoin mining community right the physical network that is the backbone so bitcoin has three layers sort of in my simple construction there's the protocol which is the the code that actually governs or it's the governance layer of bitcoin if you will governs how consensus operates in bitcoin world there's the physical bitcoin network right which is how the protocol gets implemented it includes routing logic but it really that that mining layer ensures the security of the bitcoin network and the hash rate is a function of that right and you have to expend electrons and silicon to make that happen it's very expensive both from a capex and opex perspective and then on top of that you have applications and products and services and all of that what i think is really interesting is bitcoin mining is going through its own evolution because of the introduction of asset-backed debt right for the first time ever you can uh utilize bitcoin itself the output of this process to finance further investment in bitcoin mining capabilities and what's happening is as a result of this new financing vehicle we're seeing bitcoin mining pop up in different parts of the world we are also seeing a concerted effort to onshore bitcoin mining into the u.s and what's really interesting here is i actually think that bitcoin at its core as a communication protocol means that bitcoin starts to become vital to companies and nation states in terms of preserving their access and their ability to access the bitcoin network right because if i'm a bitcoin miner now this doesn't really happen today i can choose and sort of prioritize what transactions i want to mine into a block and so in my view investment in physical bitcoin infrastructure is closely associated sort of with uh security and the military-industrial complex and i think as bitcoin's use becomes more prevalent bitcoin will become a matter of national security and investment in bitcoin infrastructure will become a matter of security just as today we see people realizing in nation states realizing right that semiconductor fab semiconductor r d that's being onshored to the u.s why because it's vitally important we have chips inside of our phones inside of our devices that are manufactured right in china now it's known right that there are back doors that are installed into these these chips and into these systems that we use um there's all sorts of really interesting sort of data when you start to get into the world of cyber security which is a world i love again i'm a novice at it i learn every day from people who are way smarter than me but i think there is this whole dynamic that's unfolding that closely couples together the manufacturing process that lin spoke about right that we've historically exported it now needs to be reimported because there is a fundamental relationship between physical assets and physical infrastructure and the digital world and people seem to believe that like wi-fi and internet just like floats around in the ether and it materialized by magic no it doesn't right it doesn't people seem to think that you know blockchain compute is accessible and available to everyone and it's a free result like no it's not these things require electricity and silicon to run they require rare resources they require things that are in short supply and the laws of thermodynamics dictate that there is a limited amount of energy in the universe right energy cannot be created or destroyed matter cannot be created or destroyed it can only mute or change form and so like this is a very long way and very long-winded and very metaphysical way of saying um like there is a fundamental relationship between the investments we make today and the world we see tomorrow and i think we have chronically under invested in very important infrastructure that supports our ability to communicate to transact and to function in this new digital world and other countries have been over investing particularly china and this i think is one of the greatest travesties of modern democracy is through regulation and really piss-poor public policy we have chronically chronically damaged american infrastructure and european infrastructure to the point where i believe it will be fundamentally impossible to compete our infrastructure our technology our capacity for r d our capacity for capitalizing this infrastructure build is not even a discussion lin i'd be curious to see what you think sorry i went off there laura but no no but that was fascinating and and it surprises me that because i felt like your essay was arguing that this um was why a theory was important but people can read that essay later and decide what they think but yeah lin what what's your take on this uh so i can i think i can tie two points together uh laura you mentioned that you know we're starting to see kind of uh you know more adoption of certain things in other countries so for example uh you know africa's got a younger population they've been more prone to digital assets uh for example and we've also seen if you look at mobile payments uh you know china and india have been huge centers of mobile payment adoption uh they kind of leapfrogged over the credit card uh model you know straight from cash to mobile rather than cash to credit and then slowly into mobile like we have here in the united states uh and so and that kind of gave them an advantage in certain ways uh so we've seen you know china really kind of spearhead the digital payments uh you know area with alipay and and wechat uh and uh going back to kind of uh about you know um the point about how the whole internet everything the way everything runs is still kind of essential for certain commodities and certain infrastructure so in addition to securing semiconductor capabilities it's also about making sure that that countries have kind of a certain key commodity exposure and if you look at china in particular that's always been one of their weaknesses is that asia is not they're not very energy rich uh and then you know they're they're rich in certain uh minerals but overall most asian countries are net importers of commodities and so you know going back to that whole kind of uh structure of the way everything is has been over the past 50 years or so you know first when when the us was running really massive deficits trade deficits uh our first kind of major source was to europe so europe would sell us things we would give them dollars and they would take those dollars and they'd reinvest in our treasuries uh so they would finance our our deficits and you know we'd have we'd be importing you know uh treasuries and dollars for goods then you know we kind of matured that relationship and we started to see the rise of japan uh so uh that japan kind of took over as the really big country that was you know running big trade surpluses with us and then reinvesting those uh dollars into our treasuries uh and then starting at around roughly 20 years ago uh you know as that relationship with japan matured uh it became china so china was this big rising power uh they ran massive trade surpluses with us and then they took those dollars and reinvested into our treasuries and every you know we you know and so it hurt a lot of blue-collar labor uh but the whole geopolitical kind of alignment was all kind of uh you know just nice and just it's going fine but then about you know five six years ago china said it's really no longer in their interest to keep uh buying treasuries uh so if you look at china's treasury holdings they kind of leveled off and so instead they started taking those dollars and they started the whole kind of belt and road initiative they started basically using those dollars uh they would lend them to countries in africa other countries in in the asia uh uh south america all around the world uh to uh basically uh secure resources uh so they instead of kind of funneling those dollars back into treasuries they in most cases funnel those treasures those dollars back into hard assets uh so to secure you know food imports energy imports uh you know metals all the different all the different kind of materials they need to basically run their economy and so that that that started kind of the conflict is okay well now you know united states is seeing okay they're using the current global dollar system against us so instead of playing along in this kind of cycle we go through now it's you know we're sending dollars to them and they're using those dollars to secure their infrastructure their commodities and so the u.s was kind of the losing side of that and that's why i often point out that as currently structured the global reserve status doesn't even really benefit the us anymore in the same way that it did you know back in the 70s 80s uh now it's a very different world and so i think it's a key point that you know some of these other areas have really gotten a strong leg up in terms of you know advancing infrastructure uh securing certain commodity rights and it's something that this is kind of as we go forward in this decade we're probably going to see more and more kind of a focus on you know different regions making sure there's as self-sufficient as possible so the us found out the hard way that you know we don't we didn't make masks uh you know most of our medicines uh come from chinese components uh so you know trade deficits like don't matter until they matter right so until you know it's a pandemic and there's a shortage and we say wait so we don't make any of this like we literally are totally reliant on on countries that we're not too friendly with anymore uh so both in terms of semiconductors in terms of vital medicines and just kind of the whole supply chain you're kind of slowly reorganizing more and more and of course that's further benefited by automation right so automation can replace some forms of cheap labor so that can kind of give some of the wealthier countries ability to manufacture things affordably that they couldn't necessarily manufacture before and that they had they had to outsource that if they wanted to be competitive uh so i think that that kind of ties into uh you know that that's the trend we're seeing and some of these other markets just they're so far ahead in terms of mobile payments and acceptance of digital assets that you know they have kind of an advantage there yeah and actually lynn um we i think um you know melton answered this question first and then i asked her something else but i actually also just wanted to get your take on how the rollout of dcep and china you know amidst everything that you just said would affect the balance of of power uh financially but then also how you think all these things will affect the adoption of bitcoin yeah so for china i mean the main thing that that china and russia and some other countries are doing is they want to be able to bypass the dollar system uh so you know a lot of people view china as wanting to overtake the us as the global reserve currency but that's you know as far as most analysts are concerned that's not really their primary target they want to be able to buy commodities uh without the dollar essentially so it's not necessary that they want you know massive holdings they don't want to repeat the whole kind of tripping dilemma that the u.s just went through over the past 50 years of having to export our supply chains china just you know they they had a very export driven economy for the past 20 years uh and now they're they're kind of moving on to the more of the empire stage right so they want to have all these kind of tendrils to other countries and now they're the biggest commodity importer uh so you know there there are newer technologies around their currency one of the goals is to make their currency more accessible more usable and and to increase its ability to go around the dollar system so i think that adds to the current trend of more trade happening outside of the dollar i think that's kind of the key thing to focus on now and and how bitcoin fits in that i think we'll see i mean china so far has not been uh you know really friendly to bitcoin in some ways maybe melton has more details on this uh so there's kind of a war between you know making their currency more accessible while we have some of these more decentralized uh uh currencies so of course bitcoin is a totally decentralized neutral asset uh gold historically has also been kind of the you know the older the less technology advanced form of that where you know over the past say five years uh as we've seen countries not really buy treasuries they've instead slowly stocked up on gold so we've had you know they've been net purchase of gold more so than treasuries over the past five years in their in their central bank holding so there is kind of a shift towards these neutral assets uh so you know of course you know bitcoin is a much smaller asset so we might start to see that show up in some of these smaller uh players uh whereas we've already kind of seen that trend uh going in in gold's direction so there is definitely kind of a demand for these neutral assets on bitcoin and china the only thing i will say is you know we've watched the bitcoin china narrative unfold we call it the china fud or the china fear uncertainty and doubt in the bitcoin space like if you're a bitcoiner you're probably laughing because there was you know in 2014 2015 every month there would be new china fud like china shut down mining china shut down exchanges this exchange ceo was arrested like we just saw this happened with ok x right um so look the china fud in the bitcoin space been going on for a long time the only thing i will say that i've been surprised by and i think in a in a pleasant way is um how permissive uh the chinese authorities have been towards bitcoin as of late in particular but really um in the last few years right uh there hasn't been much regulatory crackdown i think there's been you know maybe they're ignoring bitcoin maybe they think bitcoin is actually net positive to achieving some of the goals that lynn outlined in terms of bypassing the us dollar system and therefore supporting bitcoin whether explicitly or in a more subtle way by not doing anything or ignoring it effectively from policy perspectives sort of path forward but i actually have have been fairly surprised laura because i would have expected more action against bitcoin particularly as a way to stem people removing money from a china sort of capital controls but we haven't really seen that and i think that's actually been surprising i certainly was surprised i expected more draconian enforcement but instead we've actually seen the us trending that way so i think that kind of highlights the dilemma that you know china's main thing is they want to make sure there's not a lot of export capital happening they don't want a lot of money flowing out but the other hand you know if there's a system that that makes global payments easier and uh is a store of value and competes with the dollar they have kind of a you know they're all for that in a certain way so if that can kind of take off without harming them so they're kind of in that balance i think one thing i was curious about is melton did talk earlier about the growing inequality and the world economic forum recently published a report saying quote the pandemic is a boon for the ultra rich in the u.s over 44 million people lost their jobs and unemployment surged toward 15 between april and june yet the fortunes of the top five billionaires rose by 102 billion dollars increasing their wealth by 26 percent in fact the combined wealth of u.s billionaires increased by over 637 billion to a total of 3.6 trillion which is considerably more than the entire wealth of the 54 countries on the african continent so there's this meme on twitter i'm sure you guys have seen it bitcoin solves this and you know bitcoin is supposed to represent this democratization of finance but based on what we're seeing so far it feels to me at least tell me if i'm wrong that bitcoin is currently being dominated by those who are already at the top of the ladder you know the chamath pala habitas of the world the winklevoss twins of the world the paulister joneses of the world and not the people who might be suffering in this pandemic so do you think bitcoin will ever help address this inequality and if so how and if not you know why do you think it won't fulfill that potential i i want to just start by clarifying terms though laura democracy does not mean equal distribution right but right so we're even just talking about access yeah absolutely right so inequality and extreme inequality is a problem and i think one of the things that's been interesting to study just sort of going back to facts you know i have the receipts in this situation um if we look at the genie coefficient right it's not just the income genie coefficient but the wealth genie coefficient um if we look at the wealth coefficient in uh developed countries developing economies and in the bitcoin economy right in bitcoin i haven't looked at it since about 2018 um and biology foreign was the first one who's sort of written about it back in 2015. the genie wealth coefficient of bitcoin was initially really bad right very few people owned a lot of bitcoin and then there was a long tale of people who own very little bitcoin but the thing about bitcoin is because it is limited in supply it's fundamentally distributed in nature meaning as the price of bitcoin goes up people who have a lot of it will sell it and sort of that that very uh distorted sort of curve where you have a really really sort of fat uh grouping at the top where you have a few people holding a lot of wealth that sort of gets compressed and then the tail starts to get fatter as there are more people sort of further down the line who start to have the ability to accumulate more bitcoin so i think what i would focus on is the quality of opportunity right someone who has ten dollars and has the choice of what to do with ten dollars they've always had the option of buying bitcoin it's just that a lot of people haven't done it right and there's sort of this other meme that isn't bitcoin fixes this but it's like you know heard about bitcoin 2015 didn't buy it heard about in 2016 didn't buy it 2017 didn't buy it and then like in 2020 the person is crying you know the fetal physician so anyways um yes it is problematic the distribution's not equal you know yes but at the same time i don't think it's bitcoin's responsibility to fix the quality of of access and to fix like fundamental systemic problems these are complex systemic problems i do think though that bitcoin does provide a certain equality of opportunity like anyone with a smartphone today can get exposure to to bitcoin and participate in the bitcoin economy if if they have a phone in the will to to do so um so i do think there is an equality of opportunity that maybe is not seen in other assets maybe i'm being overly optimistic because obviously like i'm invested in bitcoin and i'm naturally incentivized to you know say nice things about bitcoin but lynn i'd be curious to hear your thoughts uh so i think i think there are kind of two sides of it that like two totally different ways to look at the whole kind of bitcoin fixes this as it relates to kind of wealth concentration uh so one is obviously the practical aspect that if you have this really small asset class that is mostly uh driven by small investors retail investors and if that you know if if bitcoin bulls continue to be right about it right so it's already it's already made a lot of millionaires for example uh and if you so if you see you know the 2020s play out anywhere like the 2010s and you see kind of bitcoin continue to get a larger and larger market capitalization uh what that essentially is is a wealth transfer from say you know it's a very it's a retail driven it's it's young driven uh so you see kind of a transfer from some of the older generations to the younger generations uh you see kind of big banks hopping on late big investors hopping on late uh so it kind of is is more focused on the retail market and some of these early adopters uh for for wealth managers uh and hedge fund managers family offices so it makes some rich people richer uh but you know if you look at kind of the really big money centers uh compared to who who kind of initiated continues this trend uh that kind of practically would benefit from people that got on that train if they are correct about you know it continues to expand and market capitalization i think the other kind of way of looking in that is uh somewhat the more kind of the austin economic view or like the ability of kind of hard money to kind of pressure uh government's ability to spend in a certain way in the sense that you know as i think was melton that earlier pointed out that you know we in some ways we don't really have say a free market we have kind of socialism for the well-connected uh and capitalism for the unconnected right so if if you were to working a job i mean it's very capitalism oriented if you lose your job you're you get some benefit but then you're kind of on your own i was if you're a large money center bank if you're a systemically important organization if you fail you get bailed out the executives are fine they get golden parachutes uh that you know they're not allowed to fail we also see a disparity in financing right so if you're a large organization you can access capital markets get really low borrowing rates and then the fed comes in and makes those borrowing rates even lower by being willing to buy your bonds even if they're not necessarily an investment grade uh whereas if you were if you're running like a say you're a family run uh restaurant right and it's it's harder for you to get financing especially at attractive rates if you want to continue through this difficult time so we see kind of that different access to capital and so you know i think one of the the kind of subsets of bitcoiners is the the view that that can kind of pressure uh government's ability to kind of keep distributing to the top uh more so than the bottom if they can kind of uh invest in these harder assets and if those assets grow big enough uh that they challenge some of those money systems i think those are kind of the two kind of ways to look at that outcome and so let's just circle back to the presidential election because i was wondering so regardless of what administration does come into office next year what signals or signs will you be looking for from that administration as you continue investing in the bitcoin space like are there any particular types of legislation or appointments or changes in the handling of the pandemic or just or the stimulus or whatever it might be like what are you going to be looking for when you think about how the industry will develop going forward and how that will impact bitcoin i'm only looking at one thing and it's uh laws associated with privacy right now encryption is under attack in the united states and in most western nations most developed countries uh so there is a a number of bill there are a number of bills pardoned on the floor right now they're sponsored by republicans uh particularly mitch mcconnell lindsey graham uh the earn it bill in particular is one i'm referring to which would seek to to limit and severely curtail the use of end-to-end encryption in consumer focused applications and implement the effectively a back door for the nsa and other intelligence agencies and five eyes you know the this uh this organization of intelligence agencies around the world have sort of signed off on this we saw a few weeks ago there's statement from the the doj and and sort of the powers that be um that the calling for more surveillance on the crypto ecosystem travel rule is seeking to go from three thousand dollar transaction limit to a 250 transaction limit around the world privacy is under attack and that means bitcoin is under attack in many ways um governments want to tax bitcoin they want to know who holds bitcoin they want to know what you're doing with it and i think uh this is this is an existential threat to bitcoiners everywhere um you know again i think the premise that that lin raises premise of hard money when you can be identified and pressured into you know having to pay taxes on these hard assets you hold um you know turkey right now is trying to implement a tax on gold they're trying to figure out how to feasibly tax gold when much of the gold there is held by retail owners um you know under their mattresses and not in bank vaults very hard to do but taxing something like bitcoin is very easy to do and you can quickly see states try to seize these assets from people this is this is my greatest fear so i'm very focused on privacy and privacy related issues i believe it's fundamentally important that we maintain the ability for consumers around the world to use products and services that facilitate end-to-end encryption and protect their privacy i agree so you know i think one thing you can look at is you know the last time uh where we were at this point in the long-term debt cycle so i mentioned before that you know we have to go back to the 30s and 40s to find a similar time and if you look back then there was roughly a 40-year period where 10-year treasuries didn't really give positive returns uh so you know because you had the inflationary 1940s you had the inflationary 1970s uh there's a little bit in the middle there where they did okay but they were still actually pretty low rates and just kind of barely tried raw water with inflation so there was like a you know period from if you had bought treasuries in the mid 1930s uh by the time those matured you were already in the middle of the inflationary 1940s so you actually you know lost money compared to inflation uh so roughly from the mid-1930s to the mid-1970s uh it was not great to hold treasuries and it's it overlaps almost perfectly with the period where gold was was illegal to own for americans uh so one of the primary release valves of of that kind of monetary system because so at the end of a long-term debt cycle it's basically currency deviation is that is what's used to kind of alleviate those debts so instead of debts going down nominally uh you basically have a little bit of deleveraging here and there but mostly it's that they just massively increase the amount of currency units in the system so you lower say debt to gdp you lower debt to money supply mostly because the denominator is going up uh now but the big pressure to that is if people take those assets out and they go into other things and of course you know from the government's perspective there are certain assets that are more acceptable uh like stocks or real estate uh that they'd prefer you to put into uh and so but when people try to go those other routes like into gold or into cryptocurrencies that the government's less thrilled about those release valves uh for for currency protection uh so uh the problem though is that you know for example when they ban gold it's really hard to enforce so it actually was backed up by pretty severe penalties but the number of of you know instances where they enforce that were low uh because they didn't they didn't send people with guns around every home and and checking when it's gold right it's just it's it's more costly to enforce uh so they basically try to enforce it just through threats essentially uh and you know some kind of around the margins enforcement uh and hoping that people stick with it you know bitcoin of course is is unconfiscatable uh so again it's like how would you enforce it so you know if you were to you know people always say will they ban cryptocurrency of course they can't ban it but they can they can pressure the exchanges they can they can get in the way now lately we've seen the opposite we've seen for example laws that in many cases favor the custodian of digital assets i'm sure melton covered these way more closely than i do but i do think that you know focusing on privacy is important uh and also you know if they can't ban things the next thing they can do is tax things so one thing that is gold's always had an unfavorable tax treatment is that it's usually taxed as a collectible which means that the long-term capital gains are at a higher rate than uh say stocks and so you know there's basically ways that they can pressure these scarce assets by saying okay you know you can have it but we want to know who has it we want to tax it to add an egregious amount and by the way they will know who has it on the 2021 tax forms the the top question on your 1040 is not did you buy or sell cryptocurrency which was the last year's or this year's question it's um do you own cryptocurrency do you hold any cryptocurrency and the irs has gone on numerous fishing expeditions the coinbase fishing expedition has been widely documented but what's not documented is more important they go on fishing expeditions on a daily weekly basis they know if you live in the united states and even if you don't they know who holds cryptocurrency and who doesn't and that information will be used at some point is my belief yeah i think so i think you know at the most benign way is that they want to make sure they get their taxes for it uh and of course there's more insidious things they can do and kind of the whole one of the whole you know quote benefits of of digital currencies from the government's perspective is to give them they they get more transparency they get more control uh they get more control over interest rates even uh let alone they can they can do different things like they can they can program it to be you know spendable in certain jurisdictions on certain things depending on how far down the rabbit hole they go into how advanced they want to get with digital currencies and so you know any sort of decentralized asset is is just it's not part of what they want to to you know be going well generally so it is something i think to watch for that you know to see that that kind of balance between uh it becoming more and more accepted uh and at a certain point there's you know you can argue how big does it have to be some people say the government won't consider a threat until it's big enough but then on the spectrum once it's big enough that it you know it it wouldn't impact so many uh investors to harm it uh that's also another way of kind of protecting it right so if the donor class is heavily involved in bitcoin suddenly it's a lot harder to to you know kind of pressure bitcoin so there's always these kind of counter forces that are always at play all right well we will have to see what happens maybe next year i'll have you guys back and we can regroup and see what we think um well this has been a great discussion where can people learn more about each of you i'm at lyndall.com i'm at twitter at lynn alden contact and i do you know a lot of free material uh focus on macro uh you know i i cover a bunch of different asset classes so i'm not specifically in the digital asset asset space although i i've been more involved lately because i've been bullish on bitcoin yeah so highly recommend uh reading lin's lin's research i think it's really good and i will say you were one of the first people lynn to actually write um research coverage on on bitcoin from sort of an investor perspective macro perspective so i give you a lot of credit for that you were willing to to dip your toe in when a lot of people are sort of running for the hills so kudos to you um me you can find me on twitter at mel underscore dem uh you can find me at coinshares.com i write on various forums i am very online and very easy to find if you ever cannot find me feel free to drop me a dm in in twitter and i will certainly try to write back to you great well thank you both so much for coming on unchained thanks
