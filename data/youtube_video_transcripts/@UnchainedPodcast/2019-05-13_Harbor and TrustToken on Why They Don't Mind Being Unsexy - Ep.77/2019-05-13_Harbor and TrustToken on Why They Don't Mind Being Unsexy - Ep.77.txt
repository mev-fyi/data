powered money today today our topic is security tokens and tokens backed by real world assets and here to discuss our Josh Stein CEO of harbor and a neon co-founder and CEO of trust token welcome Josh and Danny thank you I won't have each of you describe your products but before we do that lets just start simply with your areas of focus Josh harbour focuses on security tokens what is the definition of security token a security token is a token that represents a security interest so you can think harbour particular we're focused on traditional private security so think is sharing a private company a share and a private reading LP interest in a fund things that we know are securities but now you simply put an electronic wrapper around it and Danny trust token focuses on tokenizing real-world assets how do you define that and what are some examples yeah definitely so we rolled a sets we create passive back tokens which means there's an underlying world asset backing a token out there large majorities will probably be security tokens we started off by tokenizing currencies and so the first tokenized currencies that we created was true USD and that's just tokenize dollars and the basic idea there is that there's $100 sitting in the escrow somewhere escrow account and there's 100 true USD out in circulation so so far the vast majority of the ico hype has been around utility tokens why did you guys decide to go with what some people or even a lot of people in this space view as a less sexy area of crypto so at Harbor we our founding story was having an aha moment so David Sachs was raising his first venture capitalist year and wanted tokenize it and realized there was no compliant way to do so and then that's where the idea of harbor came from it's a huge market I mean there are so many necessary protocols and DAPs and other things we need out on the blockchain but there's also a tremendous amount of real-world assets that would benefit from tokenization to make them more liquid and readily accessible and so I don't think it's an either/or I think both sorts of endeavors are really useful and we don't mind not being sexy Danny yeah and for us we we kind of saw etherium as this world computer that would run humanity's most important computation and when we asked ourselves what's actually in run on a world computer is pretty clear that the primary use case of digital assets like Bitcoin in aetherium was just trading the bath back and forth blogging financial transactions and when we looked at today's markets like the New York Stock Exchange basically everything that's traded is real-world assets and their derivatives and so for us when we looked at the space we thought that there was a potential for a new global financial system to emerge and that you know cryptocurrency at that time was you know a couple dozens of billions and we rolled assets are 250 trillion and so we saw that the long-term potential would be you know the bridge between we rolled assets and this new global financial system interesting so let's now focus in on each project and Josh why don't you start what are the problems you're trying to solve and how does Harper solve them we're attacking both the initial formation of private capital and then the secondary liquidity so I'll start at the end and then go to the beginning so right now private securities today are highly illiquid they're almost completely illiquid and there's three main reasons why buyer and seller can't find each other you have to repay for every transaction the most expensive and irritating way possible and most importantly there's almost always a prohibition on the transfer of that private security if you own an LP interest and a fund or a share in a private even if you found a buyer and even made economic sense to pay 20 grand to repay for the transaction you can't do it you have to go through that fund manager through that GP or that refund manager and the reason why is there's all these complicated compliance rules and contractual rules that you have to enforce or we call it the who what where of compliance who the buyer and seller are what the trade is where it occurs and so as a result because you can only control those things by making it go through the fund manager these things that are highly illiquid and the end result is that it takes months sometimes years to get out of a position it takes a lot of elbow grease founding faxing emailing around to a limited number of people it takes 10 to 20 grand to repaper the transaction and then you take a big hit on valuation at the end of the day it's called the illiquidity discount so academic literature tells you it can range to 20 30 percent or more we've heard a lot of stories from folks out there with LP interests or shares and private read for example where that discounts 40 50 or even 60 percent off of the nav but when you need liquidity you need it and so if you can unlock liquidy you can deliver tremendous value so tokenization attacks all three problems and harbor attacks one in particular so buyer and seller can now find each other because of all these exchanges that are springing up in the US and around the world and I think there are particularly interesting aspects to the decentralized exchanges folks like 0x that we should talk about a little bit later you if you set up your corporate documents correctly you do not need to repaper every transaction every time you trade that token that is enough to do everything you need to do from a legal basis and then most importantly harbour was established to control that who what where of compliance so who the buyer and seller are things like kyc AML and credit investors - that people talk about all the time it's a lot of other restrictions that people don't talk about as much things like special restrictions on control officers special restrictions on affiliates what the trade is are things usually related to that cap table so minimum number of investors or maximum number of investors limitations on any one investor or group of investors holdings holding periods and then where the trade occurs so that's the venue is it going peer-to-peer or is it going trading on it a licensed exchange so essentially the way harbor works is every time that security token goes to tread it calls to harbor and I'm oversimplifying here Harbor is the all-knowing trade compliance Oracle we check the who what where of compliance and if it's compliant the trade goes through and no one knows harbor was ever involved and if it's not compliant we throw an error like an email message bouncing back that explains why the trade didn't go through so for example the trade would result in too many or too few shareholders as a result that fund manager can lift the prohibition of transfer on the on the private security allow it to trade to the limits of the market conditions in the regulatory rule sets and you can now unlock tremendous value by making something that was formerly completely illiquid now much more liquid than it used to be it's interesting but just one quick question before we turn to Danny so what if Harbour goes away then what happens then you there's two different alternatives you come up with another provider and so you reassure another says security tokens and if the whole blockchain effort goes away which I think would all agree is extraordinarily unlikely then you revert back to paper then so let me explain harbour is designed to fail close so if harbor goes away or if you terminate harbor as a provider the security tokens will no longer tread but you now have a perfect cap table you know exactly who owns the shares and then you go to another provider and you simply reissue a new set of security tokens you know who all the owners are both by real world identity and by wallet address you simply reissue them new securities on but the new provider or you could keep using harbor and do it on a different blockchain and if the blockchain technology in general fails you would revert to paper but because you always have that perfect cap table you know exactly who owned what when you have this ability to change providers change blockchain technologies or revert to paper yeah I think this is an interesting contrast to trust token as well soon find out so Danny why don't you tell us for a trust token what problems you're trying it to solve and how it trust took themselves them yeah definitely and so we're also involved in real world asset tokenization but we're much more interested in kind of the global nature of the financial system that's emerging and so can think of some tokenization companies what they're do is there's a centralized entity that tokenize has assets and then sells them often to crypto markets and then there are more decentralized players for example following math comes to mind where they create a token which is used as a means of payment to bring all the providers necessary to tokenize an asset so that could be on the legal side as well as on the actual issuing side I'm sorry I missed the name of that project what did she fall in that polymath right okay and we're kind of stood right in the middle where we are a centralized organization services where we the first thing that we took in eyes is US dollars which is true USD and then what we do is we say what's the single component which is most important to decentralized and expand across the world and the component that we picked is kind of a view of decentralized underwriting where if you're a Chinese business person and you're buying you know assets from let's say real estate token from Brazil or US equity token it's difficult for you to understand the language and legalities of the underlying legal connection between the asset and the asset token and so we created a token it's called trust token and what it's used to do is piss take on these asset tokens which acts as a on chain collateral and a signal and guarantee of trust and so if there were a case where you know there is no actual house connecting connected to house token it would reimburse the the asset token purchasers and this happens in traditional finance whenever let's say Goldman underwrites an IPO or Moody's does it bond rating whenever there's a representation of an asset created there's always some entity that's doing the due diligence and taking on some form of the liability so that when the asset purchaser or the asset token buyer buys they don't necessarily have to do the research they can just piggyback off of the research done previously and when someone puts an asset on using trust Hogan on the blockchain does that verification happen before that or after it goes up good question and so it's usually right before there's a purchasing there's a let's say a bid to sell the asset tokens so there's kind of a request to stake model and or a request for stake and what that requests for stake triggers is essentially research into the underlying mechanics of how the asset tokens created and how it's connected to the underlying asset yeah I think this is what I find interesting because this is like I you know you did say at the beginning that there is an aspect of this set centralized but this part is decentralized and in that regard I think you will always at any given moment have tokens or or or there is the possibility at any given moment that there will be tokens that have been put on the blockchain using trust token that are fraudulent and they would only be found out after the fact right whereas like with harbor you would know for certain beforehand that you know something is legitimate isn't that am I correct in thinking that yes so with asset recognization it in the space acquires some of the most trusts because you're relying on someone to have done a sound legal connection and so if you have a trusted entity like harbor you know most people will generally trust that unless harbour isn't as well known across let's say in the Asian regions so there's always this problem of how do you create a standard by which the the world can accept that that's a signal and guarantee of trust and so one way to think about that is if you're on Alibaba or Amazon you're looking at the five star ratings and reviews but when those were coming online you know it wasn't accepted as the standard means of what to who to buy from and what to buy now that kind of this but the problem with buying acid tokens is that you're never actually getting let's say a shoe box where you can inspect the quality immediately after you purchase it or sometime soon after you're buying a representation of the asset and that asset changes in value over time and the underlying asset also changes over time as well and so there needs to be a process by which people can have a let's say a new and improved ratings and review model where you can start to see where the stake accrues to the most trustworthy asset token assures as well as the stickers themselves who would have would be given the most stake if they were they did the best due diligence and took on most of the liability okay so yeah this whole thing is interesting we can get more into it later but you just want to find out from you guys so if your projects are successful at tokenizing these types of assets what new types of trading or investing behaviors or products and services do you think they'll enable so I think you can see a really interest bundling and then rebounding of property interests I think if you step back what tokenization does in the software platforms that on board the investors and the issuers do is it allows you to form private capital faster cheaper and easier and then it allows secondary liquidity that is faster cheaper and easier by orders of magnitude and so as a result if you think of these things as Lego blocks you can unbundle property rights down into smaller units and different units and then rebuttal them together in interesting ways so if you take real estate for example which is where we're seeing a lot of concentrated interest you can imagine a world in which you have tokenized interests in a bunch of the Class A office buildings around the New York region you could then create a fund that owns 10% of the interests in the Class A in downtown essentially be a Class A ETF you could do the same for Midtown for the Upper East Side you could then create a fund on top of that that would be a Manhattan in Class A ETF in essence the way it functions you have the same thing for Jersey for the borough's and then using great technologies like dydx you could very cheaply go long downtown short uptown you give a long manhattan short the borough's long New York short San Francisco in other words you can make a much more concentrated investment bet than you can otherwise and really express your thesis and lay lay off or take on risk as appropriate I think what becomes really interesting as well as if you think about say sports teams and I think those are interesting because you can now rebuttal in rights not normally associated with a private security so take for example let's take a sports team say the 49ers and let's use a round number let's say they're worth a billion dollars you could tokenize a portion of that asset you could create a class of stock they don't say 10% of the 49ers today if you did that you'd go sell that to a single individual who would then want a lot of onerous control provisions if you tokenized it if you broke it up into a lot of smaller pieces say 2,000 pieces which is the maximum number of shareholders for a single class of equity that's now a $50,000 unit of investment so there's a lot of people around the Bay Area who would love to own a piece of the 49ers and that would be a real piece of stock with potentially dividends as well as capital when it's sold but now you could bundle in other interesting rights so you could say everyone who's a equity share holder in the 49ers now has first dibs on box seats or on season passes you could say every home game you get to meet the players after the game just for the shareholders you could have an annual meeting where you talk to the coaches in the GM about the strategy and the 49ers would get a much better price a much higher value for that small minority interest in the company the shareholders would get things that they value so much more things that our property interest not normally associated with securities and what's really interesting is all those little extras I talked about have enormous value to the fans who become shareholders but have almost no cost to the 49ers and so as a result what you're doing is you're unbundling and then rebounding property interests in ways that allow each side to get the maximum value that they're looking for because they can get precisely what they want and the reason that's not possible now is simply because of the cost of administration of that type of thing is that what it is yes it simply becomes impractical I think if we step back we think about the effective tokenization I think of it as the transition from snail mail the email right it used to be with written communications we typed it out we click print we threw it an envelope we paid 50 Cent's we waited three days and that seemed just fine and then suddenly I can remember distinctly when we started clicking send and was orders of magnitude faster cheaper and easier to send that communication the content the written communication was the same but by putting an electronic format you could do wonderful things with it I think similar as private securities once you put it in electronic format in a way that's interoperable and interchangeable across all these different systems like exchanges that are springing up you can now do things with it on a practical level that you couldn't before I mean it used to be no one in the history of the world ever mailed a letter to somebody saying where we go in to lunch today but we send that email all the time because it simply wasn't practical to do so before email came along Danny did you want to add anything about new behaviors or services yeah definitely I think I think just put it very well we we can I guess geek out on on the ramifications of tokens and tokenization of assets and thing that I'm most excited about but I don't get a lot of chance to talk about because I think it's kind of more of a far-out futuristic scene is around when you start to connect these assets onto a transparent interoperable codable system the amount of things that you can build on top of let's say house point and us decline and dollar or euro going is is amazing and so one one concrete example of this is there's a lot of work going into tokenizing US dollars to create true USD but then soon afterward a project called set protocol bundle up maker Dow and a couple of other stable crimes like trio Sdn and created a set of stable coins and on top of that you can create more stable coins and you can start to have what what Josh was describing where you are able to create bundles or sets of all these different tokens and then there can be code written on top of them about how these tokens should be traded and valued and so that that kind of future world where the financial system is transparent and people can build on top of it anything in the barriers to entry to doing that is very low I think has unforeseen consequences that will be make our species much more productive and transparent as a result and Danny you mentioned a figure earlier about the size of the current securities market or investment vehicles based off real-world assets and I don't remember the number but how what is that and then how much bigger or do you think it could grow number is 250 trillion dollars how much bigger it could grow it generally is trending with I guess human productivity and how much we value assets and so it grows just as quickly as I would guess productivity grows for three many okay and so let's go to the exchange question that Josh brought up earlier where will these types of tokens trade are there any exchanges that are set up now that can trade security tokens or other real world well I guess there are ones that can do real world as about tokens but yet let's start there there are a number that are in place today and there's a lot more there in the pipeline that should be getting their proper regulatory approvals shortly we're big fans folks on the 0x protocol in particular and I think what's really interesting about that Laura is the ability to have a worldwide order book if you asked today why isn't everything in one exchange and the answer is is because it's there's so many different stacks that you have to do there's a tech stack to running exchange which is a non-trivial lift there's a relationship stack you have to have relationships with market makers and investors and others and then there is a regulatory stack where you need to get the right licensure you have to have the right compliance people you gotta generate the right reports you have to control for all the right regulatory things and we've seen that the failure to do that and some of the recent headlines around wash trading in Bitcoin in particular and so as a result you have a bunch of different exchanges by jurisdiction and what 0x I think is really interesting that allows you to do is now in a security token world you can have exchanges around the world that are compliant ly licensed in their jurisdiction that specialize in their countries relationships and they're all the folks that they need that relationship stack that business stack that tech stack that regulatory stack and yet there can be one worldwide order buck one worldwide pool of liquidity which today you can't do all those different exchanges are fragmented pools of liquidity and I think that's really exciting and something that's only the blockchain can do and something that's very new and so just name some of the exchanges where people can trade security tokens now so there are folks that are compliantly set up and licensed are open finance and templum spring to mind there's t0 as well I'm not quite sure on the status of their project ocean X or the ocean as they're now called should be coming along shortly and there are a number of other folks that are in the pipeline both in the US and abroad okay let's let's talk about regulation I think there's kind of a whole soup of regulations that apply in this realm especially around securities law can you name some of these like Reggae Reggae Reggae s and define them and any particular rules in foreign jurisdictions that might be important for people to know about just so as we keep you know moving through this discussion people have a framework suture so reg D reg ass reg a those things you hear about apply to private securities that are trying to avoid becoming public securities their exemptions so the rule generally is you start with the rule that if you're going to offer securities you have to publicly rush register go file an s-1 with the SEC they have to review it you have to comply with a whole host of ongoing regulatory restrictions both on raising the capital and then ongoing as an enterprise there are exemptions to that that allow you to raise capital privately and they become very big people raise more capital now privately than they do publicly not just in the US but in almost all places around the world because if you fall in one of these exemptions you avoid a lot of expense and delay inherent with complying with all these regulatory requirements so one of those is reg d it's probably the most commonly used and that allows you to be exempt from filing for registration with the SEC you have to meet hit certain requirements and when the biggest ones is is to oversimplify as essentially you're only dealing with accredited investors individuals with more than two hundred thousand and income or couples with more than three hundred thousand income or assets over a million dollars and so it becomes restrictive and you'll hear a lot of that about about this issue when we're in other crypto forums simply because people feel like it excludes a lot of people from investment opportunities I think what's notable about those reg D securities is that after a year you can have non accredited by them particularly for non equity securities another class is what they call reg S so those are securities offered overseas sold overseas investors essentially what it says is the US will not apply most of its rules as long as they're sold overseas and you take reasonable precautions to keep them from filtering back into the u.s. and then finally there's or there's regulation C F or reg crowdfunding which allows you I can't remember the exact limit is it's 2 million or 5 million but allows you to raise money from non-accredited it's more widely and there's reg a or reg 8 plus where you have a filing with the SEC and you can take in non-accredited 's in their cert but there are certain restrictions around them and there our different classifications or requirements depending on how much money you raise people refer to reggae a lot of times as IPO light and depending on how much money you're raising and what you're doing it's much more on the light scale or much more feels like an IPL and Danny are there any other types of regulation that you feel like people should know about when it comes to the other types of assets that trust token deals with no just a good coverage of it okay in the United States okay yeah and no for any are there any foreign regulations that we should talk about now before we move forward no I don't think so there was I guess the China had a restriction on icos but that was just kind of a blanket ban and I just got back from Beijing it seems like they've lightened and relaxed that and said proceed with caution huh interesting oh I missed that news okay so let's just dive a little bit deeper into security tokens how do you make sure that any investors that are holding these securities are compliant with their regulations in that jurisdiction so at harbor the way we deal with is we're a platform plus a protocol so we're a software as a service platform for onboarding the investor and that way we always have a real-world identity that we can correlate with a blockchain Wald address and then that way we're able to check the who aware of compliance constantly there are certain things you can't encode so you cannot encode whether or not there's underlying fraud going on in the business or the businesses cooking its books obviously and there's certain other aspects to the rules around how this trade that you can't in code so if you trade after ninety days in the u.s. you can do it according to what's called a section four a seven exemption where credit investors can trade amongst themselves but they can't post a public ask they can't generally solicit someone to buy from them it has to be done among pre-existing relationships are quietly what we would call peer to peer and so in essence what harbor can control foreign does control four is that if it's posted on exchange it's not an exchange that's compliantly license but we can't control whether or not someone's generally soliciting under four a seven that's something that occurs off the blockchain so I think there needs to be a real distinction between what's occurring on blockchain that you can't control for and what occurs out in the real world that doesn't have a connection that you cannot troll for and just out of curiosity so what standards are you using for identity to ensure compliance are you using blockchain based identities or something else we go through a standard kyc AML process so for example when an investor goes to set up a harbor account to be vetted to invest it's a very streamlined process but it's very similar to opening up an accounts at another financial institution name address social date of birth few other pieces of info and then they upload a copy of the driver's license both sides and then we go through an automated kyc AML process to do some initial vetting and we also check sanctions lists and other lists that you look at to avoid people that you don't want investing but fundamentally it's not it's not something that can be done wholly on the blockchain for both technical reasons and for regulatory reasons so then how do you make sure that the secondary trading is is compliant in terms of who's buying if the buyer is unknown that trade won't go through so short term what it means is it means the buyer would have to go through the harbor platform to get vetted longer term we hope to establish relationships with exchanges around the world where we can rely on each other's kyc so that way that and you would pass that information probably via api off chain or perhaps in the future through certain designations on chain that would allow the trade to go through without any friction but ultimately some people view that you could put this entirely on the blockchain and rely on that but the problem is you can outsource the work of kyc AML you cannot outsource the responsibility so ultimately if you want to rely on someone else's kyc AML work one under the regulations if you're going to rely on that they need to be a licensed financial institution and two you want to make sure they're doing it correctly and so you would want to kick the tires on their compliance program you'd want to know that they were reputable you simply so some unknown party having written that this is an okay investor on the blockchain is not something that at least I would want to wager my livelihood on we're gonna get into more specific questions for each project but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous

backed tokens with Josh Stein of harbor and a neon of trust token so Danny I actually wanted to find out so you know obviously with harbor because it is more centralized and they are controlling this platform if regulations change they can probably do that upgrade and Josh correct me if I got that wrong but I was curious with with trust token how that works it fits you know if there is kind of a slightly more decentralized model yeah and so the way you can think about trust okay staking is that it's shifting the counterparty risk that's off chain on chain and so when there's the actual smart contracts for Wednesday kiss release I'll be very clear about when is the case when in which cases is released and so that could cover you know any regulatory mishap and so the way to think about it is that the stake essentially is is a guarantee that there will be a reimbursement of of the purchase of the amount of the asset oaken's in the case that there isn't a regulatory adaptation that occurs and so it's pretty difficult to actually follow along with all the regulatory changes going around globally and making sure that whenever a new regulatory change happens that there is a change in exactly how the code is is operating but you can create a essentially a generalized insurance mechanism or some way of ensuring that someone is watching out for that and saying like okay I have my stake and so I will notify let's say the token issuer to to change this because now now they are outside of the bounds of particular jurisdictions regulation and just because we didn't go into detail on this before I just want to have you spell it for listeners how it is that stickers get compensated for the work they do yes so sticking incentives are there kind of a two-fold model and so one sticking incentive model is based off of tokenized currencies and it's all based off of velocity and so acid tokens that tend to move around a lot will have a transaction fee or even collateral interest based off of the dollars or currency sitting in the bank account and the second model is based off of acid tokens that are based off of commodities or assets that you tend to just hold for the appreciation value so they don't have a lot of velocity and so this model we've kind of derived just by looking at how bond ratings occur with bond issuers and so in the 2008 financial crisis the aftermath sp500 got got fine it's a close to a billion dollars because they have an incentive to give good bond ratings to the bond issuers for continued business and that became a problem in thousand eight financial crisis because you know they were giving better bond ratings than was warranted for those bonds and the way that the incentive model works for staking is that there will just be a type a set fixed token dilution where it will be printing let's say there's a hundred gold coins some number of gold coins per month to give to the actual stickers as recompensation and so that better aligns the incentive where now the Staker itself has a automated way of receiving incentives but also is aligned in you know giving actually sticking only things they they have long term belief in Josh Harper has proposed what it calls the private I CEO or picot what is that that was a thought piece we put out there a blog post where we talked about ways to navigate the securities laws in the US if you were doing an IC o---- that would be deemed as a security it is in essence an explanation how you can get increasing liquidity over time even under the current restrictive security guidelines and we proposes a way for i cos to navigate those issues I think it becomes difficult though because for a protocol token which is what I refer to I'm talking about ICS for a protocol token fundamentally you don't want to be treated as as security because if you are you can't play that role as a payment service within the particular DAP and you can't become a long-term store of value which seems to be for a lot of protocol tokens the important way that they get increasing value so it is one way to comply with the securities law is while you're waiting for regulatory clarity but ultimately I think for most protocol tokens they won't work if they are deemed to be securities Oh interesting okay yeah that makes sense Danny I wanted to ask you I know that you guys work with a license trust company that will hold assets at least I guess in the case of true USD I'm behalf of token holders so let's say that there ends up being like I don't know a hundred million dollars worth of for true USD in that account and in in that instance I'm assuming kyc AML has been done and all the purchasers will that also be done on everyone that they trade with and if not how does that affect any regulations that the trust he has to abide by and if if so how do you enforce kyc am L being done on all purchases of secondary purchases or sure UST definitely and so we do koa CML upon all purchases whenever there's Fiat involved for wiring money in and out and then we rely also we have a policy that we send to all the exchanges kind of clarifying what are the kos a Matt policies that we expect of them and this is similar to the idea of that Josh mentioned where you could piggyback off of other kyc practices and so there is a kind of a question of whether or not you have to kyc AML every single trio is the older and so the kind of argument that I've heard from attorneys about this is that you don't care a caml every single person that holds cash and there is a bit more transparency in exactly where the funds are for truest T in these pseudonymous wallets oh so that there isn't legal clarity about whether or not there needs to be kyc AML and all those traits or transactions yeah and generally a lot of the space has very little legal clarity on own exactly what is the amount of or there's there's very little legal full legal clarity here in the space and so one thing that we've test-drive which is similar to how harbor probably does it with kose AML and then we have a public key address that we do identity verification on and then we link the identity with public key and we have a whitelist and so 0x and the relay is there are testing a way where you could have a decentralized exchange that pings a kyc ml whitelist to be able to confirm that this person has a verified identity based off of our Kos EML practices and so it would be a similar methodology for checking each each trade whether or not both the buyer and seller have the proper identity of people to facilitate the trade I actually want to go back to our conversation about Dex's Josh I definitely understand you know what points you were making there about why Jax has seemed quite promising to use and particularly in the case where you're using real layers that can perform kyc am all procedures you know that would make a lot of sense but then if you're using the protocol and the peer-to-peer fashion then it doesn't that risk securities being traded out of compliance no it doesn't so when it's traded peer-to-peer when it goes from one wall address the person who owns it to the buyer the buyer must have been vetted if it's a harbor issued token if the buyer is unknown it'll throw an error and the trade will never happen because the whole point is if you can't in real time correlate real world identity with blockchain identity with the Wald address you can't control that who what where of compliance oh right okay that's because of the centralized aspect yes so we have in harbor it's interesting so we're not fully decentralized I think some systems like trust token or palm out they're interesting in the sense of its fully decentralized actors who trust each other because they've posted bonds and it's an interesting model some folks are fully centralized where they're the issuing platform the exchange and everything can only happen within their walled garden the approach harbors take it is what we feel is a sweet spot in between where we are decentralized as to everything but compliance harbor centralizes the compliance functions which we think for both regulatory reasons in the state at which the markets currently are make the most sense but we're decentralized as everything else these are ERC 20 standard tokens that work with any wallet any exchange any system that works with ERC 20 standard tokens so let's keep talking about the centralization because I don't know you may not have heard but on a recent skeptics podcast I did with meltem two mirrors and Jill Carlson Melton said something hilarious everybody Lita needs to listen to this episode if you haven't heard it because she you know was just saying like she really felt like there was no value add to securitizing financial to tokenizing securities and she said just use it and Excel spreadsheet I had another person tell me they thought securitizing tokenizing securities gave marginal improvements of maybe like at most 1.5 X and in general I feel like you know some of these people are saying well you know the purpose of blockchain technology is for trustless transactions and so in the case of you know as a token I security where let's say it's a share of a company or something you still have to trust that that company will honor its obligations to you so how can you enforce that you know they feel like this does this doesn't solve some of the other problems that that we have in centralized systems so they're correct in the sense of you're not in a crypto Nirvana where everything is trustless I think you can think of what the blockchain does for tokenized Securities and Trust in three areas you can think of in terms of the investment the record the record are evidence of ownership and then secondary liquidity in terms of the investment itself it doesn't change anything when you invest you're investing your money into the hands of somebody else and that's why there's securities laws to begin with because there are trust issues what's called the principal agent problem so you need to do your due diligence on the investment and that doesn't change doesn't change at all if you have a terrible investment and you tokenize it it's now a much more liquid terrible investment I've used more scatological community oh no that title of that episode with Milton Manjula was something called like something about the coin waterfalls so I literally had to give an explicit warning because they had warned me in advance that there was going to be explicit language you now have a more liquid crappy investment any parent of young children knows that that's a bad idea so you were but your record of ownership is suddenly much better why because you have one record that distributed ledger that shows who owns what so particularly for overseas investors relative to where the investment is but even for anyone you don't have the double counting problem you know if you own a share you own that one share and no one else owns it you don't have the dole foods problem where dole was if I can remember the facts correctly was public going private Dole thought they had 34 million shares outstanding the investing public thought they had 46 million shares and the Delaware Chancery Court threw up their hands in the air and said you guys go figure it out yeah this is Kaitlin Lowell always references that when she talks about the promise of love chain but anyway keep going it's a great one so you know you own what you own and particularly for four companies as well if we go back to that sports team analogy the 49ers for them to bundle other property rights into securities at NAR nor associated with them they need to know who all their shareholders are and in the public markets the companies don't all Apple knows or IBM knows is that dtc owns all their shares and the dtc only knows they have these huge broker accounts and those brokers only know they have the sub broker accounts and that's why the records get out of whack and nobody can reach out directly so so so the investment is still centralized you still need to have trust and do your due diligence your record of ownership now is clear you know what you own what you own you double counting but now secondary liquidity is where you get the magic of the blockchain and that is where you can trade 24/7 365 around the globe with near instantaneous settlement and no counterparty risk and tokenization of the blockchain and only the blockchain can deliver that and that is a revolution in value and to go back where you sit where you say well it's only 1.5 X 1.5 X seems wonderful what you're referencing is the value of the asset when you think of the tens of trillions of dollars of assets - tokenize if you could increase the value of them by 50% that's a tremendous amount of value to unlock like I said we don't mind not being sexy well I want to ask you about the having this record of ownership that you well and that isn't inaccurate right but what if let's say that I own a share of a private company and I say that I lose my private keys and you know the company thinks I'm just claiming that I lost it so do I lose that share forever does the company and so does the company just keep that money or do they replace this year for me and if so then how can I actually prove that I did really lose that access and I'm not just trying to get a second share so at Harper what we would do is we would cancel the lost share the shares that are in that lost wallet and then reissue new shares so let me explain that a little bit as a private company you have to have the ability to control your cap table if for example if a court orders that ownership be delivered from one person to another you have to be able to amend the books and records your corporation that stock ledger to show that Josh no longer owns a share Laura does if for example there is a divorce or there's a court decree and you have to move ownership you have to have the ability to do that so in the way we've organized our spark contracts in the way it interacts with the off chain platform we have the ability to cancel shares and then reissue them and you need to have the ability to do that that becomes controversial in the crypto world sometimes in the sense that people say well then how do I own what I own the answer is you own it in a sense in the same way you do today it's not the token itself it's the record of ownership that the token is that shows you own what you own and that record of ownership needs to be transferred as appropriate hmm interesting so here's a question for both of you do the token standards that you're creating do they work together are they interoperable so at harbor it's an ER C 20 standard token it works with any other system or DAP that works with er C 20 standard tokens there's just simply a vetting process so if there's an intermediate wallet we would have to whitelist that wallet because we would have to ensure that's trading on a compliant we licensed exchange but otherwise like I said only the compliance is centralized everything else is decentralized and fits into the larger aetherium ecosystem so if I let's say you know this kind of global exchange that you described earlier comes to fruition if I won't exchange a security token that is built on the harbor standard with a different security token built on the trust token standard can I do that that is not something I've thought through before I know we're on the podcast but I'm stirring up the ceiling thinking you know we def def something we'd have to work through but out to be honest I'm really excited about a particular class of trust tokens true USD or I'll call it just crypto fiha we have with our platform come up with a way for investors to pay with Bitcoin or ether when they buy security tokens and but the issue that doesn't seem too revolutionary what was revolutionary and took a lot of engineering and a lot of thought in designing processes was nobody wanted to take cryptocurrency risk how do you do it in a way where people invest you can hold the cryptocurrency in escrow and then later convert and no one in cryptocurrency risk is actually a very difficult problem and it made me convinced that stable coins with on ramps and off ramps to Fiat out in the real world are extraordinarily necessary for the crypto economy to really take off and so we look forward to true ESD being available to more retail like individuals to use because we would love to be able to accept it and facilitate it people are buying securities as they're issued yeah Danny why don't you talk about that because I know you have an interesting strategy around why you guys decided to start there in the universe of all the different world world assets that you could have tokenized yeah so the way that we thought about which assets to tokenize in which sequence is how complex the asset that we would think about that is how much information it would you need to know from me if you're buying that asset so currency or buying US dollars from me you don't need to know basically any information if you're buying commodities who needs a little more gold and oil and when you get into securities like real estate or corporation shares that's when you need most disclosures and so a lot of that is actually about information asymmetry how much information you would need to know and how much information could someone take advantage of to price the the asset in their favor and so the advantage of tokenize currencies is that one they had more legal clarity meaning that there's a strong legal argument that it's not a security token because there's no expectation of profit people generally by jury us see a dollar and expect to sell out a dollar and there was a second thing was that there was proven demand and there was space for let's say a more trustworthy alternative as a stable coin and three it was just the simplest asset class to tokenize but that makes it also one of the most pragmatic and useful ones that the crypto economy could use for sure so a question for both of you how do you plan to compete against traditional finance and all the firm's that are currently profiting from securities and other real world assets so we don't think that harbor competes with those I think the best analogy is salesforce.com no one ever said let's not use Salesforce because it's going to compete with our salespeople they went and bought the technology because was a platform that enabled them to be more effective and efficient so similarly we've you Harbor as a platform for companies raising capital for brokers investment banks and others to be able to raise private capital more if additionally and raised more of it and to enable this secondary liquidity private secures that never really existed before and so we don't view ourselves as competitive to them we view us as enabling them with the new technology so they'll be your customers the people raising capital are our customers so ultimately the companies but we want to be partners with the investment banks the broker dealers with and others so you're still going to need networks of broker dealers to sell some of these investments you still need investment banks to structure it and place it you still need the services of other folks in there but if we can all become more efficient and play those roles better by using harbor then everybody's better off it's lower costs and more capital more quickly to the companies that need capital to go do real things in the real world and it's a better market for everyone involved because it's a bigger more liquid market Danny what about you how do you how does trust talk and plan to compete well since we have a decentralized model it very much is the case that we see it as as long as people if people are willing to adopt let's say trust tokens taking across the world not just in the United States ours is much for collaborative and so we will tokenize assets and we'll use as a demonstration of the standards but we hope to work with you know many of token asset token issuers as well as traditional financial firms at the interface and collaborate and a lot of people in crypto are talking about how in order for the space to take off we need infrastructure to be built what kinds of infrastructure needs to be built in order for this particular area with security tokens or other tokenized versions of real-world assets to become easily tradable so I think we're well on our way there and I think it's going to be a process as it gets better and better more and more but I think I'd illustrate that with some things that seem more trivial or administrative or actually big let's the great part about tokenization is that you can break things down into smaller units of investment you can create more shares you can on you can syndicate more widely that actually increases the administrative burden so an investment where you're raising a hundred million that you would normally take on twenty investors or thirty and now suddenly you're taking on two means that's 2,000 more or 1800 more people to track if you're reap or a fund that's doing distributions that's 10x the number of checks you got to write 1099 s or K ones you have to distribute in other words there's going to need to be a whole bunch of services around cap table management and fund administration and that will enable this to go forward even more for investors they're gonna need a lot more friendly UX and UI in how they interact with the tokenized securities and this has been said on some of your podcasts and others before which is we'll know we're successful and we know we have mainstream adoption at the point which no one hears the word Crypt or token it just feels like dealing with the normal SAS interface and you're just focused on the investment not the underlying technology yeah Jani do you want to anything yeah I think custody is a large component here both from personal and institutional custody where a lot of people still don't aren't comfortable at all with private key management and for wide stream adoption being able to hold crypto and and actually own it is an important component where there's wider adoption so I I think actually that's true in certain cases I think it's less true or a misnomer and others that's important to understand which is in the case of private securities we get led astray by using the term token token is a mental model that's not actually accurate there is nothing physical to a token a token is simply a notational ledger like the old stock ledger that companies kept that just says Josh owns 50 shares and then when we trade it says Josh minus 20 and Laura plus 20 so there is actually no share to custody there is no stock certificate out there so you don't have the same custodial requirements you would you need similar services because you don't want to lose your keys and then go through the hassle of having that old share cancelled and then reissued so there are practical administrative reasons but tokenized real-world assets are very different than crypto currency or crypto assets in the sense of if you're hacked and lose a crypto currency you were out that money the asset is gone if you lose your share in a company the company hasn't gone anywhere the asset is still there the record your ownership is still there all you've lost was an easy way to transfer that ownership and now you need to be reissued a way to transfer that ownership the magnitude of loss is not the same and the why you want good security hygiene to avoid administrative issues down the road it's not the same threat of loss or custodial issues that you get when it's actual assets yeah I think I'm just realizing for Danny I have a question because I sort of asked this of Josh what happens if I lose a true USD that I've bought secondarily but since there are actual dollars in a bank but you know obviously if I'm the one holding the private keys for those tokens then what happens do I just lose that money or can the bank somehow issue me new true USD or what happens yeah so we have centralized control to USD the ability to mint and burn tree of tea as well as freeze funds cancel funds issue funds into any public key and so similar to how josh described the centralized control over the asset token smart contract we had that ability we haven't had anyone reach out to us saying you know we've completely lost millions of dollars of curiosity but this is something we would be able to do if we were if that was proven okay okay so in that regard I think maybe the custody issues are not as great even for true USD yes the custody issues are not as great but you still need a we still needed a private key management and people home no don't like to do private key management I would second that motion um so who are some of the issuer's that plan to use either the our token standard or the trust token standard and what will the first well I mean obviously aside from true you see what will be the first projects we'll see coming out of both of your teams so for harbor there's been a real flood of interest in real estate in particular and I think it's interesting to discuss why so I think an interesting question is what makes sense to tokenize and what doesn't so I think what makes sense to tokenize are those interests and assets that are relatively capital intensive that are sensitive to the cost of capital and real oddly indifferent to the identity investor so our mantra is lock up the capital not the investors so things like real estate uses a lot of capital very sense of the cost of capital long-term assets where they it's difficult for them to give redemption rights or to take cash back out but relatively indifferent to who the investors are as long as they're legal investors that's a great area to tokenize because you can now unbundle things into smaller units of investment gather more capital from around the world and lower your cost of capital I think great contre distinction is say tech startups folks could tokenize the equity in their Silicon Valley startup but it really doesn't make a lot of sense because most of them don't want investors trading freely in and out of their cap table they're not going to allow for liquidity so in that case tokenizing it gives you a little bit better cap table management there's some incremental administrative value but if you're not allowing widespread trading you haven't delivered any true transformation in value tokenization it hasn't done much for you hmm and Danny sure you obviously you've got your USD how is that going by the way what are some metrics or stats around how much is out there yeah so right now we're at a million more I get about 60 million and then four months into creating curiosity at 80 million and so Treo steep price flux or the market cap fluctuates as people's perceptions of what crypto will do change and so if it's going down people definitely like curiosity as a crypto safe-haven to write out the the down wave and then if it's going up they want to participate in the A+ appreciation so they go into let's say Bitcoin but overall it's doing well it's the second-largest Abel coin and it's the only all the Fiat back stable coin besides tether on market right now and what are some of the other first projects you'll do aside from true USD yeah so we're looking at other tokenize currencies we're really looking at security token exchanges going alive and getting more adoption before really looking at the most complex assets like real estate and tokenizing other complex assets that will definitely be security tokens and commodities as well so maybe a gold or silver token and which currencies are you looking at most of the major so euro Hong Kong dollar and others okay alright well thank you both for coming on Unchained where can people
