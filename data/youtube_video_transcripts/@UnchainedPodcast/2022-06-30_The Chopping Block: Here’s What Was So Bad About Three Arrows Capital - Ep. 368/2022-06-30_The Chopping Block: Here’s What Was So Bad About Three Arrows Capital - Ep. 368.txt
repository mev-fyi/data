hey everybody welcome to the chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first up we've got tom the d5 maven and master of memes next up we've got robert krypto connoisseur and captain of compound then we've got taroun the gigabrain and grand puba at gauntlet and joining us today a special guest we have taylor monahan the matriarch of metamask but not the ceo very important not ceo of metamask and then we have myself haseeb i'm the head hype man of dragonfly um so the four of us regulars are early stage investors in crypto but i want to caveat nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice so we've been off for a couple weeks and we picked a really amazing couple weeks to not be talking about the news and so now we have just the most just absolutely lurid backlog of stuff that we have to talk about unfortunately but tay it's it's nice to i've we've actually never met it's great to meet you and and thanks for coming to hang out with us on this really depressing podcast i'm so excited to be here on this really depressing podcast also now the chopping block is now known as the guillotine oh yeah bear market rebrand it we need it i mean this this is going to be a tough show this is the two weeks is a really long like the past two weeks have been extremely long yeah so so just by way background um so tay you were the ceo and founder of my crypto which used to be combined with my ether wallet you guys broke off you you you ended up getting acquired by consensus and now you're one of the masterminds behind metamask but not ceo but you're also you're known for being one of the loudest voices advocating for ux and security in crypto and that's that's how i think of you is that very often whenever there's something that goes horribly wrong in crypto around security or ux i always know that you're going to have an amazing hot take about it what do you perceive as being your role in crypto because that's what i perceive your role as being yeah i think that that's pretty accurate i think like bigger picture is sort of like i want to say the things that need to be said right regardless of what they are and i think that crypto needs a lot more mindfulness around ux security like like keeping in mind that there's like people that are using these things with their real life money and that the things that we build have consequences if the ecosystem were to suddenly like become mindful and intentional and make purposeful design decisions i'd probably be talking about something else that's very effective actually just to start what what's the definition in your mind of like a mindful and purposeful design decision because i feel like there's that has changed in and of itself over the last probably 10 years do you think eip1559 was good or bad for you that gets answered second that consensual second we're answering these questions in order i think that it's actually quite quite a low bar right like being mindful in this space only requires you to like be aware that your actions could impact other people like that's the bar that it's so low it is so low because so many people are just running around without a care in the world you know i think if this industry matures the bar might be erased like a tiny bit um and then you want to think about like how not just like how do you prevent bad but how do you actually ensure that you're building things that are creating equality and creating the right incentives right and with regards to 1559 it's turned out a lot better than i expected i will say that i will say that technically speaking i was never doubting like the technical side of it it was more like the implementation and especially like on the user facing products specifically the wallets there's definitely like i don't know all of a sudden all of the wallets were like ah we have to do this thing and we're not prepared and the documents were not the greatest and then as i was looking around there was so many expectations that had been set in the community that like for example transactions were suddenly gonna be way cheaper right like that was the perception that i was seeing a lot of and i just like saw this potential for like a super mismatch of expectations and then not delivering on any of them and then everyone gets hurt or disappointed or you know bad things like that so just a little reset on the hype narrative well we've got the same thing happening now with the merge where a lot of people seem to believe the merge is going to cause more block space or fees to go down or something and we had this what is it jp morgan that just issued a report that you know hot off the presses jp morgan has figured out that the merge is not going to lower transaction fees so i'm glad we have trout fight to the rescue thanks guys i mean i i think um well we look we've got we've got a lot of winter shop today because there's a lot of bad stuff that's happened in the world in the last few weeks and i think a lot of it unfortunately a lot of it is less connected to ux so much as it's connected to just the financial plumbing that makes crypto tick and a lot of that has gone wrong over the last couple weeks and so i think that that's been the big story around one the massive price decline we've seen but also this broader just meltdown that we've seen in the crypto market so let's let's start from the top so all this started with two big precipitating events so you guys remember obviously last month in early may you had the collapse of terra terra although it kind of scared everybody it spooked the whole market and we saw a broader drawdown because of the collapse of terra terra was pretty isolated or at least it seemed right like nothing else really relied on terra nobody else is really using ust outside of the you know the small cohort of the atom uh sort of cosmos community as well as like the terra satellites but most everything else was basically fine or so we thought so now it turns out there's a really big firm called three arrows capital three hours capital for those of you who don't know zero's capital is a prop firm uh meaning that it's a it's a firm that doesn't take outside capital or at least mostly doesn't take outside capital mostly trades their own money and the own money was of two guys suzu and kyle davies who were american expats who had moved to singapore they used to be forex traders they got into crypto and they were some of the most successful crypto traders basically in history they turned single-digit millions into over 10 billion dollars at the height of the market they were big investors into tara luna and of course deraluna went horribly south they lost a lot of money on that but you know by all indications they were still a fairly large and very strong firm and they were also very aggressive investors so they kind of took on this like tiger-like strategy that they would invest huge amounts of money into private deals kind of you know talk their book mark them up be super aggressive and so it turned out that after the decline of terra three arrows decided that they wanted to try to make up their losses they want to try to get back even and the way that they were going to try to get back even is through two particular trades the first trade was the gbtc trade which we've talked about before on the show which is you know very briefly gbtc bitcoin trust it trades at a discount to par um if the gbtc trust is converted into an etf basically if an etf is approved particularly grayscales then this thing will you'll be able to immediately make up the discount and get out you know make like 30 overnight and so uh three hours is betting really big on the gbtc trade betting that the discount was going to close and then second they were also betting on the lido st trade which is one that tyrone has brought up on a previous show tldr on that basically it's leverage staking you you take some uh if you turn to st you borrow against it and then you just lever up and you keep putting it into sdes until you get really significant apy on your ether where the the natural rate of interest on ether is relatively low so they were doing both of these trades and both these trades unwound in a really massive way i don't think we have time to describe exactly why they unwound but they totally unwound they lost tons and tons of money but it turns out they didn't just lose their own money normally and i want to make this clear because i think a lot of people don't understand why the three-hour story is so bad normally if you go make a big trade and you lose a bunch of your own money it's fine it's not a big deal right funds go to zero all the time if you went to xero somebody else made the money people bet against each other it's that's how markets work right but three arrows was borrowing tons of money from other people and they were also not telling their counterparties exactly how much leverage they were taking on and exactly who they were borrowing from and so it turned out they borrowed so much of other people's money that they lost uh so much money that they went into negative equity meaning that they owed more money than they had and that is really bad that is way worse than going to zero because when you go negative that means that now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet somebody else is absorbing the loss that you took by gambling like crazy and the people who are absorbing those losses are basically the crypto lenders or you know you can sort of think of the lenders as the crypto banks these are people who are basically involved in the act of money creation and so some of their big lenders include block fi genesis voyager oh celsius also lender to three hours highly likely highly okay yes highly likely and so it turns out that a lot of the money in crypto a lot of the lenders in crypto were extending credit to three arrows and this credit was under collateralized and so now they're massively in the hole so when the banks lose money this is extremely bad because this now means that the banks need to control their risk and the way they control their is because they now realize they're down a ton they need to start recalling their loans to other people because they don't know who else got hurt they don't know who else is down so they start recalling loans everywhere a bunch of people suddenly start getting margin called and these people are getting margin called they might not have the cash on hand so they need to start selling some assets in order to meet the margin call or to go repay the loan and in this situation you get a bunch of people selling at the same time and not only that but liquidity is worse because the market makers who are who are managing the liquidity and keeping markets liquid they're also getting their loans recalled they also have less money so they can't keep markets liquid and the end result is just a meltdown and so that's what we saw over the last couple of weeks we saw this massive fear around exactly how bad was three errors in negative how much money did the banks lose how much of these loans are getting recalled and how long is the selling going to take and that's caused an absolute wreckage in the crypto markets where at times we actually saw bitcoin and ether sell off more than the alts which is extremely rare and that's a sign basically that what's happening is forced it's not a people have lost confidence in bitcoin and ethereum it's that something really bad has happened in the market and now you have for selling so that's a very very broad tl dr of what happened with three euros there's more to come but i'll stop there and take your guys reflections on the whole three arrow saga so a couple addendums because that was an unbelievable summary receive and i hope people just hit play to like get the tldr on it a couple clarifications is i understand them and i could be incorrect on this so one three arrows capital was actually doing this levered gbtc uh arbitrage trade for years like not not to make it all back from luna but this is something that they were heavily engaged in for an extremely long period of time oftentimes using gbtc shares as collateral to borrow this is a very long-standing trade they previously previously lost a lot of money on it i know that for a fact it's not a new trade they've been doing it for years and years and years at one point they were contributing borrowed bitcoin to get the gbtc shares at par hoping to sell them at a premium back in the days where it was a premium and then later i think trying to borrow bitcoin to buy it at a discount but always like with the same general concept of like borrowing like bitcoin to speculate on this vehicle and then using the shares as collateral to borrow more bitcoin they were like widely you know known to be huge borrowers with that structure so that's the first clarification the second clarification is that you know as i understand it you know their primary trade to make it all back was not like you know staked ether which is illiquid it wasn't you know just the grayscale trade but they were just directionally extremely long crypto they are widely and publicly very bullish on the future of crypto prices and i think they were caught borrowed levered long a lot of l1s and just big believers in the long-term price targets that they had set and they had such high conviction that they were willing to go all in on it and they just got completely slammed and all the money they borrowed is not going to be repaid wow okay i didn't realize that i thought those two trades were big contributors but if if they just borrowed money and then bet on black that's pretty no i mean i mean part of it is like gbtc had the structural change right where like it went from being that positive to net negative and i think a lot of people assumed it would revert but actually in the last year we basically saw outflows net outflows or gbtc as each bitcoin etf application failed and i think basically three arrows had made moved by the time to mainly l1 speculation but the problem is when the l1 trade died and luna basically killed all l1's like there's no there's no you know solana may be the only one that has any net inflows over the last six months and basically every l1 kind of from a an institutional standpoint has died and so they were just basically like hey let's go do the trades we know already that are just bitcoin and eth staked each is a trade you can get a bunch of leverage on bitcoin's a trade you can get a bunch of leverage on the other thing that's a little bit weird is under under collaterize and really uncollateralized in a lot of cases i think three hours didn't put up any collateral with some of these lenders because they're like the gbtc trade is viewed as safe and so you could basically borrow putting up no collateral which you know obviously means that like you're assuming that the trade reverts at some point because they were very successful with it with it when it was a positive uh redemption price um yeah i i think it's easy to like you know [ __ ] on three arrows but like this was a very very popular trailer even like block five was doing this right to like unsuccessful bitcoin yeah right um and so it's like a lot of these you know consumer lending desks were also doing kind of degen with consumer funds to get the yield that they were getting and it's like this really dangerous arms race of like who can post the highest yield but not like who is posting the you know safest you know yield and that's kind of what we're seeing well interestingly this it's a it's a great reflection of a credit cycle basically a credit cycle is when over the course of a financial cycle credit gets easier and easier and people are comfortable taking on more and more risk because they have to in order to stay competitive so all these crypto banks that we're basically offering yield on deposited assets all these banks were implicitly competing with each other right so you know for celsius versus block five versus you know whatever all these other all these earned type products right initially they were probably doing stuff that was relatively safe because you know you don't have to offer a lot of yield in order to attract a marginal deposit but when you know so celsius which is one of the biggest crypto banks blew up and we were actually able to track a lot of celsius's activities on chain we know they got blue out blown out in the the state deep trade but also a bunch of other stuff that they end up losing a bunch of money on um supposedly they also lost money in anchor so celsius is now going through a bankruptcy so it is very very likely that celsius is completely insolvent and that nobody's going to be able to save them but the dynamic that contributed to this is that over the course of the cycle right like so celsius offers eight percent and let's say that you know this is a time of higher yields right let's say that in in that time it's actually pretty safe to get eight percent during d5 summer right but you'll start to go down and they say okay we should really lower your yield because safe yields have really gone down a lot but somebody else is like you know what actually i'm offering nine percent it's like how are you getting how are you offering nine percent the answer is well they're moving further down the risk they're doing something a little bit crazier and they're like man if we if we don't increase our rates we're going to lose all of our deposits to this other guy and so you like to tom's point you get this arms race and this arms race in almost every secular market ends up in credit uh getting easier and easier and easier until it breaks and then when it breaks a bunch of people lose money simultaneously and that's effectively what we've seen happen is that even the lenders so celsius is called we call celsius a lender kind of as a euphemism right it's not actually a lender it's really more like a hedge fund where you give deposits to celsius and then celsius goes and does crazy [ __ ] on chain with it right that's a hedge fund that's not a lender um now that being said block five is a real lender block fight doesn't go do principle stuff on chain but the people blockwise lending to are people who are going and doing crazy [ __ ] on chain right so in some sense it doesn't really matter how many layers of removal how many layers are moved you are the credit cycle forces you to take on more risk over time until that risk blows up on you smaller small addendum block fight also did principal things from their balance sheet including the gbtc trade which they have disclosed so they also did some hedge fund stuff themselves but using their own balance sheet capital which is investor capital oh okay so that's the difference i'm looking at an article from january of 2021 okay these numbers are insane so 3ac had just increased their position on g btc to they now had 6.1 percent which was 36 000 bitcoin but block fi owned 5.07 percent not that far behind so did block fight exit the position earlier block fly didn't apparently didn't chase when it went negative they basically were mainly clipping doing the gbtc trade while the spread was positive but when it was negative they effectively stopped and then they raised money right so like they're fundraising timing with the gbtc like there's a lot of correlation between fundraising events for these centralized lending companies and basically when gbtc stopped being profitable so gbtc for the record in the bear market was the main way a lot of trading firms and sort of centralized entities who are had took some risk stayed alive because it was almost the only risk-free ish okay there's no such thing as a risk-free rate in crypto opportunity cost rate it was the only opportunity cost rate that was like relatively low risk at that time partially because you know dcg was doing everything possible to get adopted and it was also the only way for a lot of institutions to buy bitcoin that had like all sorts of restrictions on like kyc sock 2 whatever all these types of things whereas right now it's like even endowments just go to anchorage or coinbase or probably ftx soon and just go buy direct so they don't need to buy gbtc that that's also a structural problem for gbtc is that all the crypto exchanges just met all the compliance needs over time it just took a while but once they did there's like no reason to buy it per se do you know when the shift happened from like because it was trading in a premium right and that's what's part of where the yield came from and then it shifted was that like recently or was that like in 2021 it was like a year ago it's like a year ago yeah okay it was a little while ago now that this just look at whenever blockfly's fundraiser was i remember was like a week after it crossed zero so okay so the aftermath of all this right so three arrows goes negative about you know something like two billion of losses that has to get absorbed by their counterparties now their counterparties freak out they need to get recapitalized otherwise if they don't get recapitalized retail is going to lose massive amounts of money and confidence in crypto is going to get really really hurt so over the over uh the weekend before last there was basically what seemed like just max fear um we were seeing a lot of these liquidations taking place in real time markets were melting down and there was a sense that nobody knows where the bottom is nobody knows how much force selling is really left in the market and how many people are are dying in front of us because they basically assume that crypto you know bitcoin was never going to go below 20k and it started tumbling to 17 000 over the weekend enter sam bankman freed so spf the uh the the founder and ceo of ftx basically stepped in sunday before last and said hey we are going to backstop the market and by that what he means is that all of these lenders that have absorbed massive losses on the balance sheet he is going to step in and try to make sure that they do not have to default on customer deposits okay so it's worth illustrating exactly what what is going on here so in the event of a bankruptcy almost always your secured creditors are are senior to your unsecured creditors okay what that means is that if you go bankrupt first you have to pay back all the secured creditors those are the actual lenders right so if block 5 borrowed money from somebody else they have to pay that person back before retail gets anything you have to pay back everybody if your whole is really big then there is nothing to pay back retail with potentially you could pay back your lenders 80 cents on the dollar and retail gets zero that's really bad that means retail would get totally destroyed depending on the size of the whole so sam bankman free basically stepped in and said hey this is unacceptable we cannot allow retail to lose all of their money in these crypto banks so he essentially offered credit lines to blockfy and voyager and said hey if you draw down this credit line this credit line will actually be junior to customer deposits meaning that in a bankruptcy customers get paid first before we get paid back for our loan and you need to use this to keep your operations running and if you keep that your operations running we may decide to buy you but if we buy you it will essentially be for pennies on the dollar because your negative equity is so big you have lost so much money that the enterprise value your business might not even be worth the cost to save you so we are basically saving you effectively as a public service and we'll decide at a later date whether we want to do it and take on your liabilities and renegotiate with your creditors the the liabilities that you that you currently owe them so this is actually very analogous to what happened in 2008. so in 2008 you might remember you know the banks lost tons of money because of mortgage-backed securities that ended up going you know becoming really bad loans the banks lost tons of money and what they did was before they went to the fed they all went to warren buffett and they called him up he was in his bathtub and they called the war and said hey warren everyone trusts you they don't trust us everyone's scared of the banks but they trust you will you backstop us to save the world and warren buffett said no it doesn't sound like a good deal and so the banks went under and they ultimately ended up calling the fed uh well in crypto we don't have a fed we've got sam sam is our fed and uh sam has basically said yes i am willing to backstop he has managed to rally a bunch of other parties to come in and also try to bail out some of these companies and so for now it seems to be that's what's booing the market and giving people a perception that credit markets will ultimately be okay we're not going to have a total crisis of confidence within you know the the the lenders and the crypto banks if we manage to save these companies i think it'll be very very good from a regulatory perspective but if these companies go down it's going to be really ugly for crypto regulation especially in the us going forward so curious what your guys thoughts are about spf stepping in and trying to backstrap everybody i will use this opportunity as the d5 founder to say that d5 protocols don't have to get bailed out and were designed specifically to avoid this [ __ ] okay and the reason why celsius and voyager and blockfi are all in this pickle is because they're opaque they're run based on the whims of people who are not very good managers and they do not leverage any of the inherent new technological advantages of crypto itself to run their businesses they're running their businesses the same exact way that wall street was running itself in 2007 and d5 protocols are the antidote to exactly this problem and it's incredibly sad to see people repeat the exact same mistakes when the tools to avoid them are right there in front of their faces and hopefully as an industry we all learn from this experience and everybody else can say in the future like aha this is why we should actually have d5 protocols and not a business with a spreadsheet doing whatever it wants and making loans to whoever it feels like without any collateral and just praying that it all works before the house of cards collapses this is why we actually like d5 protocols that are transparent and autonomous and are not based on the whims of a incompetent manager they just run themselves based on some open source code and you can see exactly how it works and it does what it says it's going to do unlike block fi celsius voyager all these people that aren't doing what they said they're gonna do lots of mistakes intentional and unintentional there a lot of unforced errors hopefully this is the catalyst and the inflection point where people like finally get it or at least some people get it or you know regulators get it or power users get it but like this is the moment that everyone should wake up and see that all of that nonsense can be avoided with defy yeah and we uh i don't know like how many times we're gonna learn this lesson right because you know we've mentioned the 2008 financial crisis uh let's go further back and say like the whole reason that we have a fed right like 1907 right that was pretty good um like that's that exact same thing right um but mount cox was like also not that long ago where we all collectively realized how screwed we were if we put all of the crypto money in one single place and we also saw that had contagion aspects too because um it turns out that a lot of the smaller exchanges were actually storing all of their customer assets on mount cox so when mount cox went down there was this trickle for months of like uh oh yeah even though you weren't on mount gox you didn't realize that you were on mong cox because so and so had their funds there so i don't know like i feel like mount cox was not that long ago i get that the ecosystem has grown a lot but we need to get better at like sort of like learning the lessons ins and like internalizing them and then projecting them in the years to come so that newcomers entering the space don't forget these lessons and specifically like i think that the bitcoin community tries to do this has tried to do this right around mount cox like not your keys not your coins like all of these things that are very much associated with the bitcoin crowd the problem is they like kind of went down a angry annoying path yeah i was also about to say let me tell you how many bitcoin maximalists self-describe bitcoin maximus would just have block fi logos on their podcast because they got paid to yeah i would argue that like 90 of them were shilling all of these uh centralized lenders like like hotel or not or whatever which just blew up today the canadian public company that's in singapore that turned out to have like a ton of sort of extreme uncollaterized lending exposure that was being if i remember correctly i remember there was a time where liquid which is block streams weird sort of semi-centralized because it's effectively a multi-stick bridge type of thing was showing how you should put your your liquid btc deposits in total or not uh so like i i don't know i i would say that uh ev everyone has some blood on their hands if we're gonna be very honest a hundred percent and i think that like one of the things that really got under my skin sort of during d5 summer and the period directly after it was the sheer number of hardcore bitcoiners who would go on twitter and chill narratives and then throw a block by or a celsius ad or even make arguments as to why these centralized providers were better than the d5 stuff on this shitty chain called ethereum right and like i think that that is not the way to do it i think you have to both like like you can't just you can't just shill the lessons right like you have to internalize it and also externalize it right so that it it comes from a place of authenticity not of like just trying to shield your narrative do you do you think that the sort of like the old school kind of bitcoin celebrities who were just shilling kind of a lot of the centralized lenders for the last five years do you think they face any repercussions from this blow up because i'm sure a lot of people who a significant portion of people who are trying to withdraw their money from these places right now may have put it in because they saw it on like this podcast or this type of thing i wouldn't be surprised if that's like a huge the biggest marketing channel for for some of these lenders yeah i think that for me like the thing that i'm watching right now and and kind of like very curious about is how did these players get so legitimate so fast and then that legitimacy literally turned into money in some cases like 3ac it seems like they were borrowing money sort of based partially or fully on their reputation right this impression that they're like the top dogs the best people like they're gonna get you all the returns they they cannot lose right that's the only reason that someone like voyager would give them hundreds of millions of dollars apparently completely unsecured you know like those types of things like in order to get to that place as far as i know i don't know when 3ac came on your guys radar but like for me they came on my radar like in the last year same with doe quan right was like september of last year when he came on my radar the amount of growth that we saw not just in terms of like the financial and like the numbers but but legitimacy and then it's like this positive feedback loop right like you get numbers go up you get more money you get more legitimacy you never go up right and then it all comes crashing down if we can sort of uh i don't know stop that loop somehow right because it's it's a it's a bad loop to get in then we have a chance of i'm kind of inclined to push back on um the demoralizing around failures like this right because there's always a strong instinct to be like i told you so why did you put block fi why did you talk about celsius like obviously i mean one the people who were doing this they had no [ __ ] clue what was going on behind the scenes right so i don't think it's fair to say like well those of you who had a coinbase logo you guys are okay because coinbase is fine but those are celsius you're evil because celsius blew up like it it's it's not really fair to place that on people who are just trying to run a media business right like how else you supposed to run a media business in crypto but also like i don't think we should take the story from this like in some sense like i think it's it's never a good solution to a systemic problem to point at uh individuals right if you point at individuals you say this person was wrong this person was evil this person was a bad manager um it's like these people were following their incentives they were trying to do the right thing in the situation that they were in and you know their investors i mean look we'll see what happens in the coming months when we learn was there actual malfeasance but the answer might have been like look yeah if you if you lend to the biggest guy who has 10 billion balance sheet and they lie to you about it what are you gonna do you know like yes that's that's a place where you're gonna lose money if someone lies to you right this happened in trad five very recently with arkaygos the um the big the big family office guy who basically just got indicted by the sec so it can happen anywhere the question in my mind is more like okay where do we go from here and how do we make sure that these lessons are collectively burned into our brains and in defy it already happened it happened in march of 2020. like all the d5 protocols that were around since then they know to expect this they're not like oh my god i can't believe prices went down 30 in a day how could that happen they're like oh yeah i remember when they went down 50 of the day and we had to survive that right and so that resilience like most of these centralized lenders have not gone through that because their books were so small at that time that they basically came of age in this cycle and that's how credit cycles work right if you survive a credit cycle you're it's burned into your brain you will never forget it doesn't matter you don't need regulation you don't need like people to putting you on on twitter like you will never forget how much money you lost and how terrible that was when you didn't take on that risk and that's how you get great risk managers great risk managers come from losing lots of money and so i kind of think the the task as an industry is to make sure we all learn from this but i don't think i don't think we're going to get there by like you know digging the knife in further like these guys are already dead right there they are going to have a very unpleasant next couple years i would i would push back on the the media outlet piece though because i actually do think the media the people who are broadcasting these things are like hey not your keys not your coins but block fi is actually totally safe like earn five percent of your bitcoin those people deserve to be pilloried those people deserve to be pilloried in like whatever sense you want okay if only it's hypocrites yeah yes i hypocrisy is always a pleasure to call it another thing that of this whole story that i still am not personally i don't understand enough is like there were also a ton of chinese unsecured crypto lenders some of whom who we know had issues some of whom didn't and i have not heard anyone actually give me the whole like why is it only these like the us ones that seem to have had the like public rug pull ftx had to white knight them shaming where is the equivalent for babble where's equivalent for like because like some of the crazy minor derivatives that are being sold in asia i think probably also blew up but like we just haven't like heard there's in the us i think the reason why yeah i think the reason why is that they're not retail facing so most of the big lenders in asia are institution-facing or like kind of worth facing so if they go under then their counterparties who are big whales in asia lose money but it's like okay they're big boys they can they can take it right it's really if if you lose retail money that's when the regulators come out that's when the guns come out that's when the industry gets marred permanently you know for folks like babel and coinflex most of their counterparties are institutional and so roger vera counts as an institutional he's high net worth he's high net worth he's definitely not working i have i have enjoyed the weird types of collateral is he high net worth anymore he's still high net worth yeah yeah i don't know um but yeah i like i i you hear these stories like about people posting like random like safes and like chunks of equity as collateral and like pledging those and it's like not really what you sort of imagine when you're like you're thinking about uh you know crypto lending but i mean i guess people people do it i think um i do like wanna like again re-emphasize that like it's amazing to me how fine defy is i feel like they did go through this like this they're almost like heroes journey of like march 2020 developing more robust systems and now they're more robust this time around and like it really it's like a lot of the blue chips from that time are still the ones that are around i still the ones that are like makey and not all the crazy dj that blew up in the in the past year and i think you know it has not it's not totally without you know uh fault or issue there was obviously you know what happened with solend and i think you know maple made 11 times up to babel and so they might have a hole in their balance sheet but like you know all this stuff is transparent and audible and like we we knew all this was happening and we can sort of design systems to remedy it it's not like oh you know this thing might be insolvent we have no idea you know where the liabilities are uh we can sort of see in real time exactly what's happening and know how to like you know adjust for it that's a great point because you know maple finance which is an on-chain lending protocol like they they kind of have a block-fi like business model but the gigantic yawning gap of difference between block fi and maple finance is that with maple finance you can see the loan book like yes as a depositor you get to actually see what the loan book looks like if you want to deposit money in block fight of course you can't do no you have no idea what the loan book is you have no idea what their exposure is you just see the api numbers you see some marketing and you know maybe you know folks like us who can call up some of the higher ups at block by they might tell us what the loan book is but they're not going to tell a random retail depositor and so that democratization of information is such a huge difference between what what defy offers and what c5 offers and i think that the story that i've gotten i mean i've talked to like a bunch of journalists who keep asking about this and very often they're like oh isn't this like an indictment of crypto and like no no it's an indictment of centralized finance right that's what c5 centralized finance centralized finance absolutely messed up but defy the pure play crypto stuff all worked beautifully and that's how it was supposed to work i also want to point out that like if it turns out that 3ac was basically a huge fraud right regulation would not have caught it right like if they were lying if they were falsifying stuff if they were doing that right like as we saw with archaegos like it's almost exactly the same regulation would not have like prevented that so i think that's a really important thing that we talk about right it's not just that defy does all these great things that hopefully solve some of the systemic issues but also that like we might somehow be in a position where we're the best ones to like regulate right to like actually regulate ourselves and have the best outcomes somehow didn't see that coming but somehow that's the case right where the sec and every other one of those three letter agencies has failed to to uh yeah failed on in every regard right totally totally and i think in a way you know sam right now is getting a lot of [ __ ] on twitter because people are like oh my god sam you're like taking over the world is it so bad you're like an evil mastermind effectively what sam is doing is a kind of self-regulation for the industry he's basically saying like look we are going to step in and we're also going to set the rules about what happens in this situation and the rules he's setting you know my understanding is that the credit line that they offered to voyager the credit line is contingent on them continuing to process withdrawals and if they don't process withdrawals if they shut off retail then the credit line shuts off which basically says you have to keep the lights on you have to keep the business running you have to keep honoring retail uh withdrawals if you don't the money is you know the money's gone you're not getting this money also the fact that he's subordinating the loans to customer deposits basically says very clearly like look if if we're going to be the lender of last resort we're going to set the rules and the rules are customers come first period customers retail comes first i think that if this if we pull this off or if sam really pulls this off and the coalition that forms around him i think the the industry is going to end up looking much better off than we would otherwise i think in in the alternative it looks really really bad and we're in for a regulatory nightmare over the next you know six or 12 months and just to point out for the last time the difference between c5 and d5 a d5 protocol like compound or maker now there is no ability to halt withdrawals this isn't even a conversation point compounds cannot block withdrawals period full stop right this is one more difference between you know what users should expect from c5 which is the rules change whenever someone feels like it or the rules change based on a backroom deal that gets made versus code doing what it's supposed to do mm-hmm should we talk about governance can we do it yeah you brought up maker and that now we know we have like the the holy hell all right who is the tldr 30 000 foot summary someone's gonna have to do like a better description of maker than what i got this morning because i am so lost but i was also thinking about like the banker stuff the solo and stuff right like these are pretty interesting uh should we should we should we delve into it i feel like um we're we just spent a lot of time building up how great defy is and we're gonna turn around and and shut it we can do that i'm down the dialectic is a more honest form of just discourse we should we should talk about maker now we should talk about soul land okay i'm i'm i'm behind the loop on maker i was trying to catch up yesterday morning makers reminds me of this the statement that i remember that that matt levine used to have in like 2015 or 16 about bridgewater which is like it's like a company where the machines go make all the money and then the people have to distract themselves with cult-like rituals and like maker has the same thing where like the code is still working and people are using dye but like all the people who kind of care about it have to distract themselves with cult-like rituals which is the current maker governance system so turn maybe you're best equipped to give the summary of what's going on and i i i don't think i am anymore because i i feel like every time i go to the post the forum post things keep changing and and like honestly maybe maybe we cover maker next week because like it actually is like a crazy situation but i will say there's just a lot of debate about how makers should distribute funds right now there's this question of like should maker spend money on being more efficient versus should it should it like keep to this like credible neutrality aspect of like having no one sort of like manage its balance sheet and then on the other hand like they are apparently gonna also buy a lot of treasuries but like they're using some weird centralized third party to buy treasuries maker just like has too much money and too many cooks in the kitchen and sort of this is why i was saying there's like a lot of like infighting um and i don't totally understand all the politics involved there's clearly some stuff but like the point is the protocol just works and like it's this thing is like a side side show next week we should have our guest be a maker dao community party has money we could have we could have run on as well roon doesn't ruin work for you guys that's true as event isn't ruined a venture partner at dragonfly he is he is a veteran part of dragonfly well you can get your own venture partner to come on the show next week yeah i i think i think i think like someone who's actually well steeped in the cult like rituals oh we should get we should get roon plus hasu and get him duke it out that would be very yeah we could host like a presidential debate that would be that would be pretty sick get them like little podiums that they could stand on yeah definitely let's make them presidents while they learn how to run or an organization or not run or talk about nobody runs it that's defy right nobody runs organizations to robert's point maker now is the least run organization in the world we don't have we don't have a good enough explanation i think a lot of people are lost as we're kind of vaguely insinuating something's going wrong and make it out to be clear make it house fine please nobody you know go run start pulling deposits from dire because you think that it's in trouble uh there's just some drama in the governance it's just the maker maker has a lot of money to spend and they're they're very confused as to what the point of yeah which is normal which to be clear is normal right that's what government's supposed to look like when you have big decisions to make right and that's by the way that those conversations happen in in all sorts of organizations all the time it's just that now you have more people that are actually empowered to participate in the governance decisions uh and it's gonna it's gonna be messy right instead of happening behind closed doors it's now gonna happen on exactly i actually think it's great i don't understand why people are so well there is some closed door thing here which has to do with like the older maker down maker foundation members versus the new ones and that that's that's where i don't understand what's actually going on there there is some some there is there is some like there is a freemason cloak somewhere hidden here well it's like even even like countries right that have diplomats you have to allow the diplomats to go behind closed doors then come out and like we'd ought to communicate and then the people back home decide whether they like that or not you know like you i'm just saying i don't understand it i just i get this feeling that there is that i understand no i get i get it it's very opaque it's very opaque okay let's talk real quick about soulland uh because i i want to get at least one good pot shot in against d5 kind of [ __ ] the bed a little bit so um tom do you want to give the soul in somebody so i should i should caveat that we are investors into soul land yes that was a good good call out um yeah so solend um they are the largest lending uh money market on solana they encountered an issue recently again talking about managing a loan book and thinking about concentration risks specifically they ended up in a point where they had a massive whale on soaland who was borrowing 20 of all usdc on soulland basically this this whale had put down a bunch of soul bought a bunch of usdc and they were getting to the point of liquidation because seoul had been drying down so much and the concern is you know with these uh you know on chain money markets a liquidation happens on chain happens automatically generally you have liquidation bots who are atomically selling some of the collateral for another asset using like an on-chain dex and and then you know re-collateralizing the system in order to secure profit the issue is that there just simply isn't enough on-chain liquidity for seoul on solana to effectively liquidate this position and the concern was that you know if this amount of soul would be liquidated which would have been i think 150 mil or so um that basically soul end would incur this huge debt and they would have to figure out some sort of restructuring uh maybe they'd go to zero or there'd be some sort of issue basically would be not have enough assets in the system to pay back your uh creditors and so the team had been trying to figure out you know what do we do about this whale um that is soaking up you know so much of the money market they've been trying to of course everybody's autonomous which is maybe the one one of the pot shots against you know d5 which is you have this one address you have no possible way to identify this person they tried all these different ways to try to get in contact with them there was no real way um this this position was sort of slowly winding down and so the team was trying to figure out ways to resolve this and the solution that they initially came up with was basically to effectively raise the collateralization rate for this this position and then when the assets uh when the collateral supposed to be liquidated allow the solen team to liquidate otc with the market maker so there's more liquidity off chain by taking over the account and transforming that i was getting to that that's the centralized component that's why it's so bad but um yeah they would be taking over the account and basically describe you know at their discretion selling this soul to re-collateralize the system and so not so good i think you know a lot of the feedback a lot of the criticism was basically it was sort of like a uh with like like a you know was it like a friday night massacre they just like said hey we're gonna do this thing you push through this governance update and then you know uh just sort of take it over they sort of spun up this dab that's the thing they're like wait like this isn't real governance you can't do a governance vote in you know six hours like this is ridiculous and so they basically unwound it and luckily ended up getting in contact with the whale in this span of 48 hours who would then you know start to wind down the position and spread it across some other money markets but you know it is again sort of an issue with with on-chain governance where it's not often as decentralized as you would think oftentimes a team maybe still has a multi-sig or you know a small number of people hold on a large number of the tokens and they can therefore often unilaterally or you know amongst two or three parties basically forced through changes um and so i think you know when a system is sort of in this infancy it is defy in a sense and that is transparent on chain permissionless to access but maybe not defy in the sense that you actually have decentralized governance and it's it's immune from the perils of man i would say the root cause is not an issue with their governance which by the way is absolutely god-awful the root issue is that if you're afraid that the protocol is not going to work that's the root cause the root causes they were afraid of their protocol being unable to handle liquidation earlier we talked about black thursday 2020 and every single d5 protocol on ethereum going through the grinder and coming out stronger imagine if march 2020 every ethereum protocol said oh shut it down change the rules like we gotta like you know like you know take over the users accounts because we don't want to see them get liquidated and like we don't trust our own systems that we built like i would say another thing is like the difference between soland and and other solana lending protocols is they were probably one of the only ones that didn't have borrow caps and you know kind of had a slower development angle to like making sure things worked before they kind of like increase the amount of net leverage in the system so i i do think like they they at trade everyone has to make some like growth versus risk trade-off when starting these things and they went on the full growth standpoint and their treasury didn't grow fast enough to account for that so i i would say like that there are some things they could have done earlier that would have maybe mitigated having such a large position over a protocol that did not have enough assets otherwise i'm surprised they even had the ability to requisition an account from governance like that's like a crazy thing to be able to change directly it's just like they can just decide to take over an entire account with like no notice i have to like check how they're actually going to do that but i mean i think in practice like a lot of the you know development patterns that you see like a proxy pattern right where it's like the implementation contract gets swapped out over time and so it's like you know you could imagine a version of implementation contract that like you know does allow some people or some things to do something and so it's like yeah i'm sure you can hack it together somehow i'm just surprised that that's even like realistically possible yes i agree and i it's it's super interesting because i think we do forget sometimes that like the blockchain is not actually immutable like at all like in any way shape or form you have to convince the majority of people to be on board right the majority of participants how you define who is a participant whether it's coinbase or influence based or whatever changes i think there's gonna be a lot of growing pains around this but like this goes all the way to the core level like if we wanted to if anyone got a majority of the ecosystem on board with any change at any layer basically anything can be changed i think that with the newer protocols and the ones where like you can really get this rapid ascent of fear that's where we're gonna see these messy outcomes right like everyone's scared and like this big looming scary thing can really easily convince uh very easily convince the majority of people that like this is the best route and you're you're so short-term focused you're so focused on preventing this loss preventing this thing that you're scared of that you fail to like take a step back and look at the long-term consequences look at the precedents that are being sent right like these this is the law like we're building the law right now guys like this is this is the choices we make today is like gonna shape everything right and so yeah be mindful of that please i mean the the flip side of that like look i can very much understand why in a moment of just absolute fear like literally you know that weekend nobody knew what was going to happen nobody knew where this stuff was going soul drew down from 230 something dollars to almost 20 right an absolutely like a mind-boggling wind down in one of the most robust platforms that we've seen over the last year and i can imagine like everything that you have built everything that you've worked on everything that you and your friends and your sacrifices whatever and you see it flashing before your eyes and you're just like it's it's friday night everyone else is like you know off crying about bitcoin or whatever and like our protocol is about to explode and not just lose money not go into debt but also take down solana like their fear at that time was that uh the the competition over trying to to snipe the on-chain liquidations was going to overwhelm solana itself and take down the network as has previously happened beyond just you know crashing the price on chain by like 30 40 percent the best thing was my dad my dad because like they wrote a bloomberg article about the stolen thing my dad messages me it's like solano's gonna like steal people's assets and so there's some there's some detriment to naming your protocol uh sharing a prefix with the layer one because then everyone thinks the layer one is also just cause like oh i thought that was really funny because like i guess bloomberg that weekend was actually writing a lot more articles than normal and they they wrote this salon one and it was actually really i thought that was pretty hilarious that's amazing um to chacha and what what has he said though like you're 100 correct like it was scary like it is scary still to be frank and that fear is is 100 legitimate and we should expect that when when situations happen like there's always some potential for the environment to change rapidly and to for fear to strike the hearts of all the people that have power over your protocol and so then the question is like how do you react in that moment and if you're not prepared if you've never thought about if you've never discussed it if you don't have a plan in place the answer is they're gonna do whatever makes sense in that moment and not think about anything else one of the most interesting things i think about maker back in march 2020 was like they had actually talked about this they actually had a plan where if the vault my words are going to be off but if the vault gets screwy and under collateralized then the maker the mkr holders right mk are sold on the market yeah their system debt there's a there's a debt debt auction yeah yeah so like but the most impressive thing about that was like not necessarily like the exact technicals of it but the fact that somebody had thought about this and planned it so that in the moment of fear they could kind of like point to that post right and like that helps settle things it also you know when your head is not in a clear place it helps clarify things right you can rely on your past self that was thinking about the long-term consequences the short-term consequences you know in in a more prudent and mindful space yeah to to also you know tying it back to the first part of the conversation it's nice to have it codified in the smart contract that like die holders are senior to mk holders right we have to have a you know one-off negotiation i hope everyone's in a good mood like it's just like no that is how the smart contract works that's a great point yeah i wrote this tweet that the the d5 3.0 of whatever this bear market whatever i'm using i'm making fun of d5 2.0 with that moniker but um it is going to be about is going to be about encoding paripasu clauses which is like a certain type of how debt settles in these protocols because i actually think that's the main thing that's missing is these kind of like edge debt settlement maker has one form of it but i i'm not convinced that that's like the that's not this next generation of protocols will have way more things like that so i definitely i definitely agree though that maker probably the only ones who thought it through which is why they have a system so great that all they can spend all their time fighting on well look at the end of the day one of the takeaways from me is that any time that there's lots of things that go wrong people immediately jump to figure out whose fault it is and who behaved honorably and who behaved dishonorably and i think there are some people who did the wrong thing and there are some people who did dumb things and i think there's is an important difference between the two soul and did really dumb things it seems like three arrows did really wrong things and i i think it's really really important that we divide we make a really thick divider between those two and the people who did dumb things will learn like god they learned that is one of the that is one of those lessons that you cannot pay enough money to learn soulland is going to figure their [ __ ] out now because the entire world has has taught them this lesson in a way that i'm sure is is impossible to otherwise receive but the the the important thing is to make sure that people cannot do wrong and um that's one of the one of the values of crypto and d5 and smart contracts is that you don't need to trust people to do the right thing you you trust the code is going to work you know to your point taylor is that nothing about the blockchain makes applications immutable you have to decide to make them immutable you have to decide to write your contracts or write your code or write your applications in such a way that they cannot be changed without going through legitimate processes to change them and that i feel like is going to be one of the biggest takeaways from all of this one actual positive i learned from from the solon case is i i just the first time i'd ever run into solana's dao tooling of any form i gotta say their ux is better than than than most e things uh i i was actually extremely impressed by the by the ux of the islamic dow tooling that's been the i think the top sort of like cited reason for people like getting on board with solana like especially people that were like die hard and etheds that are now have like sizeable positions right it's like that they seemingly care about the ux and the end user and like the usability of the system i'm not 100 sold on that narrative yet but i do think that there's something worthwhile there i think that ethereum in general i'm definitely guilty of this is like a little bit i don't know focus on the principles over the over the ux details sometimes all right well we're running up on time but you know it's been i think for everybody in crypto a pretty harrowing couple weeks so tay do you want to close this out give us some last words for everyone to take home about uh how they should feel yeah so i think that personally i've been in a very weird headspace because i'm simultaneously like like saddened by all the loss that we're seeing and the impact that we're seeing it have on actual people and like sort of the these seemingly like existential threats right that are circling around and like when's the next shoe gonna drop and that is like coupled with this feeling of like oh my goodness thank god for a bear market and i feel like very guilty for feeling that way but i've done this before like i got in the space in 2013 right before mount cox crashed so like i've i've watched this now and been through it i will say it's not just about like sort of like shaking out the weak hands like that's not what it's about it's about truly having a moment to like catch our breath to be reflective on what worked and what didn't work to clean up some of the tech debt or the social debt or the governance that that we have accrued over the last couple years and to really think about what and why we're building the systems that we're building and if we're being successful at that right like it's it's a chance for us to be honest without sort of like the world looking on and like kind of cheering us on to fail you know in six months to a year we're gonna be in a very a much safer environment right where conversations can start to happen in public without this like looming fear that you're gonna be in the new york times tomorrow um and i think that that's massively important and i would encourage everyone who's building or thinking about building or participating in these systems to think really carefully about why we're building the things that we're building and then be honest with yourself about like if if we're on the right path to get there right because that's the only way that we're gonna course correct that is an awesome message taylor it was an absolute pleasure having you we look forward to following all your many hot takes against both the um the people doing wrong things and the people occasionally doing dumb things so for those of you who don't follow taylor go follow her she's i think tavano on twitter she's absolutely amazing she's we're very lucky to have her in this bear market alongside us i'm here for the long term thanks for uh thanks for joining us and thanks for tuning in everybody awesome bye have a good one
