hey all before we begin my book publishes in less than two months i've been sending it to a few early readers to get blurbs and also for ideas for nfts and i just wanted to share with you one early reader's reaction this person quote absolutely devoured the book in two days which is pretty crazy because it's a fat book they also said they were enthralled their word and that they felt the book really brought to life the various players included in the book this is someone who has been involved in the space in the past but wasn't right in the middle of the action and they could not put the book down so if you're looking for a good read that's all about crypto pre-order the kryptopians idealism greed lies and the making of the first big cryptocurrency craze today at bitly cryptopians that's bitly bit.ly cryptopians c-r-y-p-t-o-p-i-a-n-s the book comes out on 2 22-22 and so you'll have it just in time for that spring break that i'm sure all of us will be jonesing for by then again pre-order the cryptopians at bitly cryptopians and now onto the show hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the show that reveals how the marquee names in crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines i

for 12 years why did you start doing that and then how did you get into nfts wow that's a long story so strap in well 12 years it'll be it'll be 13 years as we're recording this we're about 12 days or so 11 days from january 1st and on january 1st it'll be 13 years of song a day complete so that's like a every every january 1st is this big moment for me the turning over from another year of song a day it started in 2009 at the height of the financial crash actually it's funny enough um three days before bitcoin's genesis block bitcoin um's genesis block was i think january 3rd of 2009 and the story of song a day basically is that i was unemployed it was the height of the financial crash i was sort of just out of school living in berkeley california i had been making videos on the internet and doing various things working odd jobs here and there doing a little bit of songwriting work for different companies and things it was a tough time as i'm sure you can remember and i got a flyer from a friend for a thing called fun a day which still happens it's just a an invitation to make one piece of art every day in january so i decided that since i had nothing really else going on that i would start making a song a day and shortly after i started making a video day as well so it was like posting them all to youtube youtube was very new at that point it was only like three or four years old and uh i set out to do 31 days and the end of january came and went and i decided for a year i would aim for all of 2009 and then i got to this crossroads at the end of 2009 where i just sort of like had to decide whether i was going to keep going or stop and um i just keep going and so now here i am nearly 13 years later that's that's that's the story of song a day in a nutshell and then it was so out of curiosity because obviously i'm sure you're aware of people or like mike winkelmann has a similar story with his digital art during this time how are you monetizing that if at all similar to people um and i i met people actually at a um a conference we both went to in toronto in 2015 and we were scheduled both to speak i spoke one day and he spoke the next day and we both basically like said all the same stuff like we're all we're like talking about making things every day and since we both do that we all have exactly the same things to say it was very funny it's sort of a mishmash you know i'm a typical millennial i guess in that way like just like anywhere i could get it in those early days in like 2009 2010 there was a website called i think that still exists called onlinevideocontest.com and i would go to that website and i would find different video contests where the cash where the prize was cash and i would enter over the course of 12 days doing song today i would enter 12 contests and i would win like one or two of them and that literally would feed me and be my rent for the month and so i did stuff like that and then i would get random odd jobs making songs for different things eventually i start i sort of stumbled into this career of what i called the conference troubadour where i would go to different conferences i actually did this at devcon in 2018 i would watch all the talks and then recap all the talks at the end of the day with a song that i wrote and there's a whole long story about how that came about but but you know it's just a sort of very like mishmash of things patreon youtube ads spotify revenue all that kind of stuff just like hustling to sort of make it make it work and so when you were doing things like attending devcon and recapping the day's material in a song what was your reception by the crypto community really great i mean i mean one of the things is that um you know to go to your the second part of your first question of like how did i get nf and into nfts you know it was sort of in 2017 that i that i fell into this world and um and it was it was sort of shocking and and really wonderful to me to find that there is this like very artistic and open-minded and sort of fun-loving group at the heart of ethereum that i found you know there was there's a lot of people who just like to make stuff and build stuff and and create essentially and that's the sort of the early nft crowd that i fell in with in late 2017 you know there was there was a time back then when like you could know everybody who was in who was into anything having to do with nfts before they were called nfts so i was making a lot of songs i wrote the like i wrote the very first song any of anyone ever wrote about crypto punks in in like in september of 2017 and i made a song for my cryptokitty back then and like i was just making songs this is what i've been this is just sort of what i do is anything that i'm interested in anything that i get sucked into ends up being fodder for song a day essentially and so you know that's sort of how i'm sort of make my way into communities and that's that's how i ended up i met um ayamiya gucci from ethereum foundation at another conference in san francisco and she saw me perform and that's and she invited me to perform at defcon that year which was super thrilling and really fun i got i was able to get vitalik to come up on stage and like sing it was sing a whole thing it's very funny you can see it's on the internet awesome we will have to point people to that and so you were doing this but at that time in terms of monetization again was it you know in crypto or like yeah just why don't you talk a little bit about your transition to nfcs yeah yeah so so so it was when i when a friend of mine pointed me to i got interested in crypto for the first time at this conference in toronto actually different conference and uh and i put out a tweet just saying like hey does anyone know anything about ethereum like i'm really interested in maybe putting my songs on the blockchain like not even really knowing what that meant or what that would be nfts didn't exist right so it was it was crypto punks that got me interested my friend had showed me crypto punks and immediately i was like oh this is what you can do with the blockchain like that's cool that's something i'm interested in and so starting from that moment i when i when it when i realized you know for the first time that we could have these digitally scarce objects that just set my mind on fire and and um it's it's the idea of of putting my entire song a day project onto the blockchain as nfts uh is something that i started back in 2017 and i've been working towards pretty much pretty much ever since and you know the first song i ever sold as an nft was the song that i did with vitalik at devcon um that was like october 31st of 2018 was that that very first thing that i sold it sold for 2.5 eth which at that time was like 500 bucks right and that was thrilling that was super fun and then you know and then i didn't sell anymore for a long time because we had this crypto winter and i was still building i was still doing my podcast about nfts but like you know the interest in it was was very low both from people inside of crypto not to speak of anyone outside of crypto like forget it but then over the last year you know with the explosion and everything i've been selling i sold out i i tokenized the first year of song today i tokenized the second year of sangha and i sold those and um yeah i mean like so many other artists and musicians and people uh it's been completely life-changing money-wise and and for me the goal has always been just to sort of make enough where song a day itself like the time that i sit down every day to write the song is the only thing that i really have to worry about i don't have to worry about hustling or taking gigs or working for someone else i can essentially just work for myself make the songs i want to make and you know make them into nfts which gives them this sort of weird different kind of value yeah so that's always been the that's always been the dream um from the from the very first time i saw crypto punk space basically okay so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about how this has changed your world but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible there's a new cryptocurrency made for mobile that you can earn by downloading the nodal cache app it's free easy to use and there's no hardware to buy the nodal cash app allows you to earn crypto whether you're on the go stuck in traffic or even while you're sleeping noodle cash is the crypto you earn 24 7. go to nodal dot

your validator on the latest version through auto updates one-time investment 100 profit go to avato that's ava.do back to my conversation with jonathan so now that you are in this nft world do you find that you're tempted to make more songs about crypto related things rather than just any old topic that's a good question and i would say you know i'm very stubborn in this way where i won't i sort of almost almost like i can't make a song about something that i'm not really interested in which is sort of funny because you know for a long time my job was to go to a conference about like lumber or something and like sing a song about lumber right but the way that i got through that or the way that i would do that is that i got interested like i would sit there and listen all these talks about lumber and by the end of the day i'm like interested in lumber because i've like learned about lumber all day you know what i mean and so anything that i'm like anything that i'm actually interested in is the thing that i end up writing about so i never i never will like very often people will be like hey you should write about this project or you should write about this you should write about that it's like that almost will never get me to write a song about it but because i'm so enmeshed in this world now and um you know having been here for so long and seeing some of the stuff come to fruition that we could only sort of dream of back in four years ago it's so exciting and so you know just for instance like throughout this year especially earlier in this year you know building on the song about the crypto punks that i made way back in 17 2017 i started writing songs like when crypto punks uh were selling early this year for like these new all-time highs it was very exciting and weird and i would write songs about that or like for instance when visa bought a crypto punk like i wrote a song about that or like you know there's just all these different things that happen that i'm interested in that i do write about and i wouldn't say that i'm like necessarily it's obviously an external force that's having me write these songs but that's not any different than like than how i approach it all the time if that makes sense yeah i mean i i get you in the sense that it is also difficult for me to write about something if i'm not interested in it but i do feel like if i were in your position then the fact that i would likely be able to make a lot more money from a song if i were to make it crypto related than if it were about okay like for instance listeners in my show will know that i'm really into meditation so if i were you know if i made it about meditation i'm pretty sure i wouldn't earn as much and so so you're kind of nodding as if you you feel like that does influence things a bit well and totally but also the wonderful thing about song a day is that it's every day right so so i can make songs about meditation and crypto and video games and you know what i had for breakfast this morning and everything and the fact is that there's just so many songs that i have to write that it's like not like i'm ever you know at a loss for something to write or that i have to worry about it you know like and if and and i'll tell you too it's it's sort of strange is that what i found over the years with song it is that the songs that i the way the way that i keep song of day going is by is by giving myself room to phone it in whenever i need to like i wouldn't be able to keep sangha day going if every single song had to be perfect and had to be a banger you know i give myself room for some songs to suck and for some songs to just be whatever and then what happens is that invariably and this usually happens on youtube but when i share them on twitter it happens as well often like the song that i'll share that is phoning it in for me someone else responds to it totally differently and there's this kind of like there's this disconnect between what i feel like i'm putting out and what other people feel like they're getting and so that just having that play out over and over and over again has given me confidence to be like well i may as well just like whatever comes out today like that's what i'm gonna do it doesn't really matter what it's about and yeah probably if i wrote about how apes are more uh expensive now than crypto punks like maybe clearly that would be a more valuable song in the eyes of many crypto holders and so you know and that to me is and and it just so happens like that does intersect with my interests right i am interested in that phenomenon you know or if eth were ever to flip bitcoin like these things these things are interesting to me so i'm i have no problem or you know i wrote about eip 1559 or about the um upgrading the beacon chain like these things are inherently interesting to me so it's easy for me to write about them even though they're also clearly you know gonna gonna be more popular in a certain crowd and out of curiosity from a technical perspective where are you uploading the data for the song itself yeah so that's a great question so you know song a day traditionally has lived on youtube and i upload every single song to spotify as well um it's not under my name it's under song today so if you ever want to find a song bae song on on spotify it's under song a day moniker and but of course i'm sure you're aware i was asking for if you make it to an nft yes yes yes yes no totally so i'm just giving you the sort of the the pre-history there so for the nfts it's interesting because i've i've over the last two weeks been struggling with this to figure out the best way to do this because obviously the the the most popular answer is ipfs right ipfs and filecoin are where all of the songs are going to live and uh it's taken quite a bit of doing to try to figure out what the easiest way to upload 100 gigs of videos is 37 3700 videos um over 100 gigs need to be uploaded but we figured it out me and me and the team that i'm working with so i'm actually i like just finished all of the videos all of the images and all of the metadata lives on ipfs and filecoin and we're using a great site called nft.storage which is free made by the people made by protocol labs who makes ipfs and uh it's a free alternative to to hosting stuff on on ipfs is really wonderful and they've been really great so you've also created something called song a dao tell us about that yes so song a dao is a was inspired by two other dao projects very directly and i took these two other dow projects and i smushed them together and i because i got so inspired um the first one is a project that has launched but hasn't gone to their second phase yet called the song that owns itself and the idea their sort of innovation was we're going to form a dao that is a legal entity in their case an llc based in wyoming and that legal entity is going to own the copyright to a song so if you become a member of the dao then you become a part owner of the song that blew my mind that like excited me to no end because from the very beginning i'm talking all the way back to 2017. even just normal people non-crypto people if you got through the processes of explaining to them what the blockchain is explain to them what an nft is even though that word didn't exist yet digital scarcity the first question they would have about selling a song as as a digitally scarce object would be does it come with the royalties does it come with the rights what do i get and this idea of an organization owning the royalties and everyone who is part of that organization sort of being co-owner is a really great and amazing sidestep of the issues that will arrive that will naturally arise from the complications and the byzantine stuff that exists in the in the music royalty world like that stuff is so complicated you don't want to touch it you don't want to have anything to do with it because it's too much so that's one that's one side of the thing and then the other side is a wonderful project called nouns dao where they make these cool little 8-bit looking characters and they're all on chain and one of them mints every single day forever and they're all unique and they go up for auction and and then what happens is as soon as you buy one you become part of the dow and as that as part of the downs down you get to um direct their funds you get to decide how they deploy the funds in their treasury which is cool and then and then once you once you look at their treasury after you know after like 130 days of making downs they literally have like 60 million dollars so now now you can be a nouns owner and deploy 60 million dollars worth of it's very inspiring and very interesting so i took those two ideas and said okay here's song a dao song a dao is a legal entity that exists in colorado it's a co-op not an llc which brings with it all sorts of really interesting legal things which we could get into but the basic idea is the dao owns and controls the copyright to all of song a day just like the song that owns itself and one any song a day nft that you own uh makes you eligible to be in the dow and just as you can control the the the treasury of downs by owning a noun in the same way you can do that by owning a song a day nft it's a bit more complicated than that but that's like the basic that's the basic idea all right so today is the day of your song a day drop why don't you tell us what you're doing there yes i'm so excited it's been four very long years of like up this moment i can show you documents from four years ago where i lay out exactly what i'm about to launch today which is just like mind blowing to me it's very exciting to me so i've dropped years one and two of song day already so those are claimed that leaves roughly 3748 songs to go so i'm dropping all of those songs today it represents years three through thirteen and what the drop consists of is obviously the song and the video which are just sort of the basic building blocks of song today every single day i sit down i write a song i make a video i upload it that's going to be every single song that i've made from 2011 to today actually the 31st every single song is going to be in there with the exception of songs that i've already sold or the songs that were in the first two drops there's also this really fun element of the illustration i hired 13 different illustrators who then created 13 different variations of layers that created these illustrations of each song and whereas you know this is like a very tired idea now basically because you have you know you have crypto punks and you have the board apes and you have the kitties and you have the alligators and the rhinoceroses and the whatever but uh this from the very beginning has been my idea we're all inspired by crypto punks the layers in my project are not random the layers are the traits of a given song so if a song was written in new york city and i was feeling sad and the topic was apple computers those are the traits that you will see in the image and also another one of the traits is my beard the status of my beard is it a beard is it a shadow of a beard is it a mustache a goatee that's another trait and then so there's like extensive tagging that goes along with this and then each year looks completely different because i have these different illustrators do it it's really fun and interesting and then of course each song is also makes you eligible to become part of the dao so i'm really excited i have no idea how it's going to go we've been working so hard on it it's point to eth for for a song and that gets you eligible to the dow gets you into the discord where you can start talking and you know i think about it this way like you know people had his big sale right he had this moment where he he got to 5 000 every days um and he went through christie's and he sold it for 60 69 million dollars to medicoven right you know my 5 000 song is coming up on september 22nd of 20 of 2022 you know which is not far away at all if you the way time moves we'll be there before long and what i'm so excited about is like can this can the can the will the dow can can the dow coalesce enough that we can create something together around this 5000 song and and rather than the money going directly to me the whatever money comes from these daily songs that i make starting on tomorrow january 1st all of that money goes back to the dow it doesn't go directly to me so my 5 000 song in in you know just over what nine months or something is whatever comes of that the money goes to the dow and then we all decide together like what are we gonna do with this money how are we gonna use it which is super exciting to me the idea this this is a wider idea that i have of what if you can build entire ecosystems around artists like like put the artist at the center put them creating their work in the middle and then rather than having a label or rather than having a publicist or anything you put fans and people with skills around them and give them you know give them real agency that's the other thing about songa dao is that the way that the voting works everybody has one vote everybody who is becomes a full member of the dow of the co-op including me has one vote so i don't have any more more or less power now obviously as this as the artist i have a lot of soft power to sort of try to steer things but my whole goal is to give as much power as possible to the people who are interested in building this project you know so that everybody can sort of build together and hopefully you know um benefit not just not just creatively but even financially in the end you know and that's the power that you can have with a co-op is there's a sort of legal framework there that sort of sidesteps any um this sort of i think leads in well to the song that we're gonna that we're gonna showcase here but it sidesteps a lot of the um legal implications of securities and things going the co-op route it's completely legal for anyone who's a member of the co-op in fact that's how co-ops work is as a member of the co-op you're entitled to the to any of the surplus that's left over in the treasury at the end of the year it legally has to be dispersed back to the members of the co-op so that's that's part of what's so exciting to me all right well i agree with you that this is kind of a perfect segue to um the closing of the interview which is that we're going to play a song that you created out of the little speech that house representative rad sherman made during the house financial services committee hearing on crypto recently um can you remind me of the name of that song yeah it's i think it's just called i don't know i forget what is it called let's look it up well maybe it says it it's called mongoose coin mongoose coin called mongoose coin because yeah i i didn't know brad sherman before this apparently he's quite a character but when i saw that footage i knew it had to be i knew it had to be turned into a song it's quite what yeah he he did quite a good job rapping in this song i would say yeah and i also think it's a perfect way to close out this interview because crypto regulation was one of the top stories of the year of 2021 so we will now play that for people um but before we go jonathan thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you thank you i really appreciate it and for those of you who are going to listen to the song i just want to let you know that don't forget to stick around afterwards because we will have your 2022 crypto predictions after the song crypto is culture crypto is alive

recap we've got your 2022 predictions i will start us off with a few of my own my first prediction is that a spot bitcoin etf will be approved in the united states it was kind of an easy one unless it turns out to be wrong my second is that crypto will become much more of a political force in the us in the midterm elections and that politicians will wake up to the money that is to be had in this constituency and third i also predict that dows will become the overarching trend for both d5 and nfts and basically for the year all right now on to yours the first one comes from matt cutler at block native looking back i think in many ways uh 2021 proved to be the year of real time in web 3. real time is where gas prices get set and we all know that that was a major trend and major issue this year it's also eip 1559 hit this year which fundamentally changed the way gas prices are calculated uh mev hit in a big way and that all happens in the mempool and in the real time layer and there were big strides in usability this year as well but as we look out at 2022 i think that real time is going to continue to be a major trend in that folks increasingly understand that that's where uh crypto usability challenges are rooted people need to know what's going on with their transactions uh before during and after their life cycle and that's all rooted in the pre-consensus layers of the mempool we're also seeing the rise of multi-chain both protocols and training and experiences and it turns out that different chains make different assumptions about what's going on with your transactions in real time so visibility there will continue to come to the fore we at block native are super excited about some of what we know is being built right now and will be released in the first half of 2022 we think there's some really exciting new developments that are coming as it relates to the real-time layer and its implications for understanding fees improving usability predicting what's going to happen next and acting and reacting with confidence so thanks so much for having me and best wishes in the new year this next submission comes from gene washington and though her prediction starts off with the final days of 2021 she ended up basically getting it right so we will see how her 2022 predictions do okay so my end-of-year prediction for the crypto market and specifically for bitcoin is i think it's going to be kind of boring um i think we're going to kind of especially with bitcoin go between high 40s maybe hit 50 go down to low 40s and just kind of be a little boring like that until the end of the year um i think a lot of the institutional investors are um trying to keep their balance sheets looking good for the end of the year and so there's not going to be a lot of activity and so that's kind of how it's probably going to go to the end of the year um and then i think in 2022 first quarter second quarter um things are going to look great for crypto um and i have a couple reasons for that um one is i think the sec may approve a spot etf for bitcoin which would be fabulous and i think it's really gonna um help bitcoin to increase and get a lot more participants people who maybe just wouldn't invest directly through the platforms out there but might do it through their investors through a spot etf i also think another reason why crypto's going to go up um specifically xrp is i think the lawsuit between the sec and xrp um is going to get settled or maybe finalized in xrp's favor so of course that's going to help xrp tremendously as it gets on all the other platforms um but it's also gonna help the whole crypto market and then finally i think congress is starting to see um the crypto market is real and it's gonna stick around and um also hopefully sec will see that we need some clear regulation around crypto and some regulation that's going to be favorable for the u.s to be um able to compete globally in the crypto market so those are my three reasons why i think uh cryptos are going to do great in 2022. um i think uh bitcoin is going to go up to maybe 120 maybe 150 and then it's going to have a corruption maybe not as much of a correction as in the past it'll be less volatile but then all the altcoins will follow and also have their um time to really um go up so um i think it will be volatile but we're going to see a lot of good things the first and second quarter of 2022 and um laura i love your podcast and i love it that uh you're a woman taking um part in this space because there's a lot of young guys doing this stuff but not a lot of women and so um i love your podcast um so that's my prediction from this crypto grandma have a great 2022 and merry christmas to everyone and now we have several audio submissions hi laura this is fahim from new york i'm a big fan of the podcast my prediction is focused on gaming and was inspired by your interview with gabby diesen from ygg um we have to remember that ethereum was the result of vitalik's warlock in world of warcraft getting nerfed and him crying himself to sleep while cursing at blizzard so i think we'll come full circle and play to earn will become one of the biggest defy categories in 2022 people usually need to experience utility to understand a concept and gaming is the one area right now that is probably bringing the most utility to nfts i think once people experience nfts in games their perspectives will definitely change but they need to be offered that experience in an easy to understand way so i think we may start to see competing l1 and l2s fund and support gaming projects even more to attract users to their platforms and ultimately more tvl we may even start to see partnerships between crypto payment products and play to earn games for in-game nft rewards or in-game currencies so games will expand to offer players multi-chain gaming experiences with new opportunities for staking nft interoperability and gameplay on each chain increasingly complex in-game mechanics will definitely push the transaction limits on these networks i think engineers will start to come up with novel solutions to offer the best user experience and some of these solutions may even help the wider crypto ecosystem find more efficiency and since almost every action in these games can be seen as a transaction i think we will have to come up with better accounting tools for tracking and reporting these complex multi-layered in-game activities and finally within the play to earn category i think defy kingdoms may overtake axi as the number one play to earn game in 2022 thanks laura love your work really excited for cryptopians happy holidays and see you in the new year hey laura this is crypto lala i love your show i learned so much it's interesting it's fun never a dull moment my crypto prediction for 2022 is that ethereum will never go below at 2 000 and bitcoin will never go below 35 000. it's a different landscape now the whales are in the institutional investors hello my name is alexander pollard and i'm from london in the uk and i'm new kind of new to the crypto space i've been involved since august this year but i'm really enjoying it and my prediction for 2022 is social tokens um in particular chiles and rally and hive i'm really excited about um the kind of opportunities that those um coins and ideas have for the future of crypto and finally here are the written submissions which i will read the first comes from noemu95 and let me just tell you i do believe this is very likely to come true especially the out of body experience part laura in 2022 you will have an out-of-body experience during which the exact date and time that bitcoin hits 147k will be revealed to you and afterwards you'll finally cave in and buy bitcoin you guys i need to dispel this notion that i don't want to buy bitcoin of course i want to buy bitcoin um all right this next one comes from steve head of solution engineering at immutable x he says my crypto prediction is that sidechain users are fair weather friends oh okay who will swing back to mainnet ethereum as zero knowledge rollups and eventually eth 2.0 start to solve the gas problem obviously i'm biased but still confident of the premise that high gas is a vote of confidence not a technical failure all right well we will see i have a feeling yeah that is probably directionally correct right raymond hamilton of alaska sends us these predictions and they're really bold he says my 2022 predictions there will be some u.s legislation giving better clarity but it will be too late and favor the big incumbents the us government does not know how to act any other way okay that's that's a slightly depressing statement on the state of our country and our government but we'll see if he's right his second prediction is adao will do something to provoke the ira of authorities and government will try to censor slash sue them it won't work and the failure of the legal system and regulations to deal with this new type of corporation will become very apparent that's that's a you know good take actually i think the next two more nations will successfully adopt bitcoin as currency several will try and fail with their own and here he used a term that we are all familiar with that i can't really say so i will use an euphemism which is the word altcoins moving on his his last predictions at least one major economy will launch a cbdc it will flop interesting then he says the bitcoin price will increase dominance will continue to fall maxis will stay angry okay well those all seem well the first two seem directly correct we'll see about the last and then his last is that he gives three price predictions oh oh and actually the list he's predicting what the top five coins will be as of december 31st next year he says they will be bitcoin at 150 000 ethereum at 6 800 very specific saul or um solana at 425 avax or avalanche at 250 and finally matic at six dollars and fifty cents okay and our last prediction is from ben who says i'll focus my 2022 predictions on healthcare and pharma since those are the worlds i know best is first nfts will rise out of the current bear market by expanding beyond the art market into smart nfts where nfts extend functionalities using underlying assets such as data access rights loans and other digitizable asset ownership then he says crypto will extend beyond finance into other opaque markets in healthcare by being a better health insurance smart contracts could build on earlier works like claros decentralized arbitration protocol to collect records of agreements transactions and then linking together using insurance approval using smart contracts these communities could grow out of existing models similar to mutual aid okay that's it for your predictions it's been super fun hearing what you all think will happen
