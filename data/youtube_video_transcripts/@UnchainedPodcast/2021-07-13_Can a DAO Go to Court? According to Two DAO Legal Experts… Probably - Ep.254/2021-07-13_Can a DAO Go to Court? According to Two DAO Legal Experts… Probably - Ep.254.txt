to hold and exchange value in a digitally connected world discover how people are re-imagining the world around you on tezos today's topic is legal issues with daos here to discuss are aaron wright co-founder of open law and professor at cardoso law and ross campbell core developer and sushi swap and contributor at lex dao and open law welcome aaron and ross happy beer yeah thanks so much for having us laura excited to dig in before we dive into this very intellectually meaty episode that has actually kind of been a flash point for the crypto community over the last year so let's start by having you each describe your experience in crypto and with crypto legal issues erin why don't we start with you sure uh so uh thanks again laura i'm a professor of carter's law i fell down the bitcoin rabbit hole very early about 2011 and have a background in law and technology before joining cardozo's faculty i started a company and sold it to a for-profit sister project to wikipedia called wikia so i fell in love with open source technology fell in love with bitcoin uh was fortunate enough to play a small role helping to launch ethereum and i co-authored a book uh on blockchain law and policy that harvard published about a year or so ago and then i've been building out some tech along with ross and others called open law which is trying to kind of bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional legal contracts and that's called open law so that's a bit of my background and ross what about you sure um so i started in crypto coming from i guess a corporate legal background my first real job at a school was as an associate attorney with a law firm called andrew's perth now hunting interest growth after two mergers that's a whole other story but in terms of the canonical crypto rabbit hole i think it started with me studying uh risk around ransomware attacks and then i learned about ethereum smart contracts um and then from that point i actually kind of fell into open law worked for consensus for i think about two years on that project i had the opportunity to also work with aaron on the launch of the lao which i hope we uh cover on this uh you know call um and generally you know just thinking about how smart contracts can be used for company formation uh to improve deal flow and transactional efficiency and then more recently uh kind of uh working with d5 contracts with sushi swap as a solidity developer um so that's kind of my journey it's been kind of uh level on the nose uh through curiosity and probably uh overwhelming professional fomo very interesting work i would say great um so yeah why don't we start with maybe one of the more recent uh what i would call kerfuffles in crypto and this one involved curve last month in the governance forum for curve which is an automated market maker there was a governance member who asked whether the d5 project should try to enforce its intellectual property in court and it specifically mentioned that saddle finance had been accused of copying curves code wholesale although by the way um some people did point out to me that i think saddle's code is in a different language so it's not like directly copy pasted um and in the curve forum 67 of the 64 poll respondents that said that they thought curves should assert its ip rights against infringers so what do you guys think of this proposal aaron i know you have a ip background do you want to lead on this yeah yeah sure i mean i think all these issues as you know lawyers or other folks that have been in and around the crypto space have kind of prophesized for a while they eventually come to roost right so issues related to intellectual property uh issues related to securities laws issues related to liability issues related to enforcing rights it's not surprising that as we see crypto continue to mature and continue to push into the mainstream that these are beginning to come to fruition um related to the claim at hand this is a vexing problem even outside of the crypto ecosystem for all open source right if you have open source code and other people use it they have you know the ability to create forks to create modifications and depending on the underlying license that will really dictate whether or not they have the right and ability to do that what i think makes this story the most interesting though is that it kind of goes to this root about daos and what curve is as an organization right um and it's a bit incoherent right now as to what curve is like legally so they call themselves a tao uh depending on which jurisdiction looks at it let's say the u.s or possibly another jurisdiction and it's probably going to be considered a partnership of some sort and partnerships can enforce their rights so if curve wanted to do this not advocating that they that they should or not you know it opens up these interesting questions about how these online groups that likely will be considered partnerships in some sort of way can enforce their rights and there's a second question of whether they should enforce their rights given that it's an open source project right maybe what saddle is doing is fair game or many folks that really believe in open source technology would consider that to be fair game um you know those are questions that are above kind of my uh you know my ability to comment on but i do think that they they raised some really interesting challenges and it's not limited to curve right we've seen this also open source licensing issues begin to emerge in the uniswap ecosystem and we've also seen you know kind of dow related legal questions emerge in the maker ecosystem so some of these questions are really coming to fruition you know as the ecosystem continues to mature yeah i i guess if i could uh append to that um i agree with aaron that using you know legal tools like ip enforcement rights will force these dows or these uh right now sort of uh loosely coordinating groups to actually choose a legal identity i assume that there is some sort of centralized group developers they might even have you know a legal name you know maybe curved labs um it might become more apparent how things are centralized in their system if they choose to use legal tools like enforcement rights so um it feels premature for a lot of these organizations in my opinion to make those hard choices but um they will be forced to um and the least we can do as sort of crypto lawyers and people in the space is to provide templates to make that a bit easier more predictable you know i don't know if this is a good segue into wymcdow and sort of uh statutory frameworks for uh having you know code-based organizations and rights enforcements that are kind of typical to you know traditional companies but i think we are trying to make it a bit easier once taos face these questions they want to avail themselves of legal rights and option enforcement what is the least intrusive way to do that that's still uh you know cypherpunk um so definitely something we're watching but i think things are a bit better now and that um i do think that they can achieve a legal identity and not lose their sense of an open organization but yeah culturally i think it's also very problematic and that taos attract talent by being you know open source uh champions um they're very permeable you know merit-based uh you can rise in the ranks of dow by the work you do and i think a lot of people that want to contribute to those and kind of grow this economy on ethereum they are wary about people being protective about code because that can constrain kind of the growth of this system so it's very political as well so i think i can see how curve might want to uh kick this to the community and see how they want to proceed on legal rights we see that with unit swap as well um and that seems like a way to have uh it both ways that you can still monetize code and support uh talented coders but you can also allow people to make it easier to use um if there's like community spirit there so that's something i'm watching as well do you want to talk about uh you know wyoming the context here and maybe you know not just not just yet because there's so much more i want to ask about curve but i first of all want it as so you know it so it's not clear exactly what entity um you know would sue but let's say that curve really was a true dow then is it possible for a dow to sue like can a dao own ip yeah i mean i think um you know if a group of folks and just to caveat it i think a lot of this discussion will be very u.s centric and there may be different jurisdictions that view it differently it gets too complex so just for simplicity's sake and harass i i know your roots at least legally or in the u.s but maybe we can constrain it to here but um you know from a u.s vantage point um curve and and possibly many other dows presumably would have you know would be considered a partnership of some sort if if they're viewed as people that are working together to make some sort of profit so i guess there's a question as to whether or not you know all the curve token holders are trying to make a profit let's just assume that they are at that point they'd be considered an implied partnership um and partnerships are a recognized entity and partnerships can avail themselves of of course so it's conceivable assuming somebody had the uh ability and agency to bring a cause of action that curve could walk into u.s court and assert that um they probably they probably wouldn't i don't know a ton about the saddle team i don't know if they're in the u.s right there's lots of like nitty-gritty questions that lawyers would like to sort through about where to bring a cause of action whether to bring a cause of action whether they could enforce but uh assuming that those issues were sorted out i don't see conceptually why they wouldn't be able to enforce their rights if they so chose well if curve then went that route then would that make crv or vcrv its governance token a security so that's an open question you know this is one of the vexing questions around daos and some of the legal issues is what is an interest in a dao itself uh and folks that have been around the crypto ecosystem for quite some time this will bring back memories of questions about what a utility token was or their securities or they're not securities which are really fun conversations i think we've gotten some clarity about as much clarity as many folks would would hope and when it comes to taos i think the answer is going to be again not surprisingly very loyally it's going to depend right um there's some interest in daos that likely would not be considered securities they'd be considered either commodities or not really even representing potentially you know some sort of write in an entity um and then i think depending on the structure of what the folks want to do together and to the extent that there's fees that are being distributed or some profits that are being distributed or other forms of distributions those interests are likely going to be considered securities and there's a whole line of cases in the u.s that courts will lean back on involving partnerships and limited liability companies and interests and partnership and limited liability companies can be considered either as securities or not securities depending on whether or not there's folks that are in charge if there's a group of managers that are in charge llc and partnership interests are more likely to be considered securities if there is not a manager in charge uh then they're less likely to be considered securities but frankly it's a little bit of a gray area it's something that courts have sporadically addressed in narrow contexts and these are the types of questions that i think we'll start to see navigate through us regulatory bodies foreign regulatory bodies and ultimately courts just like we did with some of the token related questions from you know the halcyon days of token sales in 2016 to 18. okay but actually but from what you said earlier where you said you know when i asked you if it's possible for a dow to sue you said well if they're a partnership and they i can't remember how you phrased it but essentially you know if they uh like the goal of that is to make a profit then that it's then it does sound like then the tokens associated with carve would be a security right it again depends right um it's going to depend on the partnerships can make a profit right so if you have a partnership uh interest that where there's no manager there's folks that are actively participating the information is freely available then there's arguments that can be made that those interests are not securities that would be drawing on some of this case law and other folks that have looked at characterizing and classifying partnership interests if there's a manager if there is a board if there's more hierarchy then it's more likely to be considered a security the reason for that is the kind of core fundamental purpose of securities laws it's about you know narrowing information asymmetries like laura if you were a manager of a company you're going to have all this information that you may not be sharing with other folks that are stakeholders or investors or participants in that company and that's what securities laws fundamentally are trying to uh you know target you know how to get information that's being held closely that could be important to other folks more widely available so flatter structures i think have a better shot but these are very unfortunately like nuanced um questions and that's going to drive developers mad but uh that's in many ways kind of how the u.s approach to these questions has historically been applied and i imagine will continue to be applied for the foreseeable future and ron see we're going to add something oh yeah i was going to kind of go to this issue of management and you know what is actually providing value to token holders if in the curve context we see licensing and the defense of the license by a sort of core team you know or centralized entity um you know that value creation by defending the license could be suggestive of you know securities and i obviously don't want to give a legal opinion on a podcast but these are the trends we see in that if you hold an instrument and it's expected to increase in value because of the efforts of others that's the fact pattern that applies to tokens like any other instrument or you know a ticket to an orange grove or something so these legal tools like i said can pose these uh sort of and like related legal problems and that you are identifying uh value streams that almost necessarily have to be centralized um we are seeing like i said cool examples where the permissibility of a license and you know grants of a license are put to community vote and in that sense you know management of that sort of value source the ip um is distributed in a more flat way and i think that is helpful uh for teams to consider um you know not trying to retain the crown jewels and a core team uh because that can be suggested of management uh another kind of interesting aspect of the law is that you know it gives and it takes right you know there's always extra considerations and this is why crypto law is becoming a robust profession probably yeah unanswerable questions that are context-driven right i know when i was researching this i was like wow this is this is quite the rabbit hole within the rabbit hole um well you know one other thing i wanted to ask about was at the top of the contract source code for curve it says license copyright curve.fi 2021 all rights reserved so who is it that has that copyright is that the dow or is it like maybe some kind of llc that represents the company behind curve or is it individual devs or what what does that say to you and is that is that a typical thing for a d5 project to do i mean you're in finance uh the name of their token i think is yearn.finance it's a hyperlink i think that is a way to kick the can on responsibility in a way you know from the contract to deployer to you know maybe people that are running a website and a product but i think you know good practices if there are legal entities associated with these things is to put them you know in the privacy disclosures on the website itself um you know those are the rabbit holes that they're kind of forcing us to follow to determine you know if they say this is licensed and has restrictions you know who's going to enforce that it seems like they didn't quite have a name they wanted to associate at that point but yeah i do think that's typical in d5 that they don't want to think too much you know beforehand about the legal structure they want to apply they just know that they want to sort of plant that flag um so yeah there is a bit of uh you know digging involved in d5 i think we're seeing but the copyright yeah more on the copyright owner question so in the u.s again uh person or groups of persons right you can have more than one person that creates ip the folks that create it and once it's fixed in a tangible form which would mean like saved on a computer and there's a copyrightable work which generally means something that's has a modicum of creativity and is not functional nature that group of folks would be the copyright holders with the license that you put together assuming that all those initial creators are kind of captured by curve dot phi that would kind of vary those initial copyrights so the you know these are you know copyright is a very complex part of the law as well so there's lots of questions that kind of need to be answered but that's a general framework so i'm assuming there was some group of software developers either one or more that wrote the initial smart contracts and a related software that helps power curve and those folks would own the copyright they may have varied it with an open source license of some sort which could give people the rights to use it and and they would have to assess based on their ownership rights and that license whether or not they uh have a cause of action that may be with the tao itself to the extent that the tao has some rights in it it could be with those individual developers to the extent that they retain some rights those are complex questions that would have to get sorted through by competent counsel and yeah i mean one other thing about this uh just to go back to the copyright uh and the ip issues here so i saw somebody tweeting that if curve were to try to go to court to enforce these that court curve should then also be subject to money transmission laws and those are you know that requires projects or companies to go to every state to get a license um what's your sense of whether or not that's correct i mean that's a whole other body of law right but to the extent they want to be recognized or avail themselves certain courts you know then it can open up a whole other can of worms so even though they may have the right to do that they may choose not to for other reasons possibly reasons related to what you'd what we were discussing before you know what are the interests and curve and what should they be classified as you know questions related to aml know your customer that's a very big issue when it comes to defy it's a very big issue when it comes to crypto more generally we're seeing you know fadiff get more involved and our are beginning to kind of meander towards clarifying rules related to that it's up it's just a huge can of worms uh so legal issues with taos is you know a rabbit hole of a rabbit hole like you described before but there's plenty of other rabbit holes that um that get opened up when you begin to dig into some of these quite these projects and issues that they face and ross did you want to add anything oh sure yeah i think kind of what the legal system is still trying to get acquainted with is this idea of you know money robots and you know that developers can create a almost fully functioning exchange or market and then kind of leave it and not have any overhead and just walk away um you know who is transmitting value in that case you know code or is it the lp providers who are you know facilitating those markets um it's so complicated that it feels really um uh you know like in knee-jerk reaction just say like the people who have docks themselves usually developers like we should just make them uh get all these licenses i i know this might uh this this is more an aspirational notion you know versus legal reality which you know has precedent is very structured and requires research based on state by state but um kind of more the point is is that i i think that the legal system is you know maybe trying to uh you know move too quickly in assumptions about responsibility and control and that kind of goes to this issue of not understanding how this uh technology really functions for markets so yeah i i would be reluctant to make any sort of firm opinion about money transmitter license requirements but um that that seems like a misplaced uh regime especially for uh what we see happening in the space with curve and amms and ross actually i just wanted to ask um for sushi how do they do a copyright if if any or any licensing at all for the project that's an interesting uh you know issue of course uh you know for sushi swap at least what we consider you know core contracts you know the sushi swap organization on github um that's all mit and uh more recently we're using gpl licenses um so it's open source you know free to modify um but we do have outside teams that we've funded with grants that have used licenses on their code um and that has been um interesting in terms of unifying this idea of sushi swap as a completely open source exchange you know um you know bento box is a product that we're using you know for our uh lending contracts and there is some uh licensing involved with that so that's more the sushi swap perspective of like you can have a plan uh you know among a developer group to open source the code um and see where that goes but sometimes um you know you can't take uh you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube if something's already licensed in some ways or you don't necessarily hold the rights there so yeah it can be difficult and expanding rapidly to coordinate the legal regime which i'm sure anyone appreciates in a high growth startup regardless of it being blockchain related but we have good outside counsel okay yeah let's now also talk about uniswap um because and this directly relates to what happened with sushi swap um back in march when uni-swap launched its v3 it launched it under what's called a business source license can you explain what that means and why this caused a little bit of a stir in the crypto community yeah so i mean unit swap released uh v3 under the the business uh you know licensing you know the the immediate reaction is um you know what are you worried about um in terms of releasing ross can you just explain define what that is for people who maybe don't know yeah yeah totally so it's like commercial with a plan to open source so um in their system i believe it's you know a two-year time period before it automatically converts to gpl and then anyone can use and modify it but right now if i want to use any of the uh license code from units swap v3 i would have to get a express permission from them or you know we'd have to have a commercial license so um yeah it's a blend of open source and commercial i guess that's helpful and aaron you're actually you know a professor for these things so um you probably have a better more scholarly uh way to describe this but for me it's opens uh open source but with an immediate uh you know sort of pause you know but yeah yeah i think it's super fascinating um and i think it really kind of hits at this core that that many developers are trying to balance when it comes to you know crypto d5 or blockchain projects right they want at some point for the code uh to be managed by a whole bunch of stakeholders i personally believe that's a very healthy exercise to have a whole bunch of different folks that are maintaining it managing it and i do strongly believe in the open source ethos but there's windows where that's difficult to do right you you need to have a dedicated team that's focused on it to push it forward to make sure the quality is high enough and and to make sure that you have the opportunity to test out the market and so i think unit swap was trying to blend those two two competing uh ideas together and did a pretty good job doing that obviously uh with the the looming fear of a roving band of sushi fanatics that that may decide to take some of that innovation and uh apply it into into their ecosystem too so you know i think it's great that and i don't know who on the unit swap team if there's their outside counsel or or their internal counsel but i i do think it from my vantage point it's it's wonderful to see that form of innovation i know that may bristle with some folks that you know are true open source believers and and a little bit more religious in their approach but i think it's it's a fair trade-off overall like we want to incentivize teams to develop new things to work on it to feel incentivized to do that while at the same time knowing that as it's mature once people feel secure about it that stakeholders or other folks that are part of it that can begin to support and make sure that it's operating and developing in a productive way yeah and just to be totally clear for people who missed it um this is probably a direct response to what happened last kind of what was it summer slash late summer slash early fall when um sushi swap basically forked the code and then launched a liquidity mining scheme that involved unit swap and to get users from municipal over to sushi swap and so um to my mind this is pretty much uh their way of being like let's make sure that doesn't happen again um but ross since you are part of the sushi team i just wondered you know what's your reaction to oh yeah this move so yeah to clarify you know my earlier comments were meant as criticism but more to maybe help explain the reactions of the crypto industry at whole i know there was a lot of criticism to licensing or you need v3 but personally like i'm agnostic to what is going to make ethereum development sustainable and secure over the next decade it's a very very uh young industry and there's clearly different stakes at play with like open source code that also controls like financial assets so um you know if uniform wants to try and innovate and have it both ways i don't necessarily want to discourage that i want to have more examples in the wild you know more boats in the water to test things out and see what developers really congregate around and it's an open market um you know some people you know see that as moat and that's respectable for their tokenized community others might see that as a sort of challenge to growing ethereum as a whole but like i said i it's not clear to me you know what what approach once the day or provides the most value to like you know dex users so uh yeah i i definitely maybe that's a lawyerly answer in about itself i don't know having it both ways but i respect that they're uh trying to protect their uh uniswap uh community and product uh using what some might call law fair but i just see it as like kind of normal for any startup to do and they are very open about being a startup you know they have uh universal navigation inc i believe it's a delaware corporation you know they're based in new york they have they have a clear physical presence you know offices they have a founder who has a uh an identity reputation at stake as well as most of the developers are also uh you know doxxed as they say in the industry um sushi is trying to do uh maybe something different there by um you know being a bit more impermeable for developers allowing people to have their uh anonymity uh if i can pronounce the word right yeah so i think there's definitely um some competitive uh advantages to being fully uh sort of crypto anarchist but you know i don't know if that's necessarily uh what we need to have over the course of the decade so yeah i think we um definitely appreciate that the licensing was a response to sushi swap the vampire attack um it also was you know quite clear that there was migration tools provided to go from sushi swap to unit swap um very similar to how sushi swap was launched to migrate from munich swap to sushi so in my mind you know people see that as like negative competition but for me it's like yeah let the the best exchange went you know and let the the best legal regime win um you know it's all kind of code that we're trying to like improve right um so people are like creating notes and they're open about it and it's obvious how we could change that mode you know through governance which uniswop has done that seems interesting too you know so yeah all right so in a moment we're gonna discuss a little bit more about the uniswap license issue but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show

campbell so just out of curiosity for this license uh that uniswap has its v3 code under since it lasts for two years i just wondered is that kind of like effectively the time period in which anyone might actually want to use the code for business purposes you know because like with the pace at which this technology is uh advancing i just thought this is going to like kind of cover all uh you know potential competition yeah i mean that's like 100 years in my mind of like crypto that's like several growth phases or something so i think effectively you're right that they see this as covering the concentrated liquidity idea as they've implemented it which is fine you know i think you know it's it's all arbitrary but you know anything past maybe a couple months is probably like far in the future in a lot of cryptic people's minds so yeah and and i wonder just for this particular license you know it's it's not something i'm super familiar with but um is this something that has ever come up in court before like if someone were to fork the code and test this license do we kind of have a sense of how the courts would decide i don't know if this is the singular use case of that license that's part uh to know if that came up from the unit swap team or maybe they leaned on another example that may have emerged somewhere else some other former president when it comes to questions around open source licenses courts move very slow so even widely used licenses like ross mentioned a couple before like an mit license or a gpl license uh not many courts have addressed issues related to the validity of those licenses and the scope and questions related to it so at least in this instance it's not like this is a license that's been well litigated number one at most if it went to a court um i imagine courts would have to look at the kind of sporadic cases involving open source licenses to a affirm that it's enforceable and b kind of define the the scope and boundaries related to it i think you know more practically i imagine what why the unit swap team did this was not to walk into court at some point i know that that's in many ways like how non-lawyers view it but it's just a little impediment right so whatever folks are thinking about possibly using that code they may pause and that pause may just give them enough time to you know to see if this idea works which they obviously built and you know obviously put a lot of thought and time into it um and hopefully that gives them a little bit of space to um you know to grow the ecosystem or support the ecosystem in a way that they think is appropriate competition is always good i mean i think in many ways like what we're seeing this dynamic between sushi and uniswop outside of being very dramatic and entertaining in different ways is also kind of you know one of the advantages and really one of the the reasons why governance tokens are important i think the fact that uniswap did have a vampire attack by sushi which introduced a token uh i i imagine that that fact probably uh weighed in the minds of the initial developers when thinking about that i think it also points to the value of why tokens are important to kind of rally people around a project and have them feel like they have a say and can actively participate in governance to improve the ecosystem i think that's healthy and i think even here you know when we're dealing with new updates or improvements and enhancements i think it's reason my view it's reasonable for teams that come up with that to have like a little bit of breathing room to test it out before it gets immediately uh copied i think that creates kind of perverse incentives for innovation if you want to optimize on that that front to say that a team that develops something shouldn't be able to at least like uh try it out see if it works uh at least get some recognition if not more uh for that i think that that's healthy and and uh i'm pretty reasonable all right so now let's talk about the wyoming dow law uh what does this law do yeah it's a great question so dows are really interesting as a concept um you know there's different types of taos and daos have kind of animated the bitcoin and in particular the ethereum ecosystems for quite some time just to give like a quick history lesson there dan larimer of eos fame i think is credited with the first reference or kind of uh article talking about daos he fashioned them as a decentralized autonomous corporation and the notion was how can we use bitcoin and an emerging uh project on bitcoin called color coins at the time to represent a bitcoin as let's say a share of stock and a company um and he posited and i think he's right that you know by doing that using blockchain technology to represent interests and organizations we get a whole bunch of different efficiencies uh the ethereum ecosystem in particular kind of took dan's concepts and vitalik uh and others kind of ran with it and it played a prominent role in the concept around um around the ethereum white paper there was lots of use cases but one prominent one was diaz and so the ethereum ecosystem has kind of been geeked out about dallas for quite some time and because of that there's been lots of conversations about how can daos operate in the real world so these conversations started way back even before ethereum launched at events that mit put together where we get we began to think about legal issues related to bitcoin and blockchain technology more broadly this notion emerged that one possible path forward would be to wrap a dow in a limited liability company to use a limited liability company which is a structure in the u.s that many businesses use um to account for certain risks that emerge when you mush people together and they try to do something productive and what the wyoming dow bill does is it extends wyoming's llc act and enables you to create a dao and it attempts and aspires to do that in a way that will work with what some developers want to do with dabs so it's not never was intended to be kind of like a universal solution its intent is to a provide legal recognition to this new emerging structure where we're seeing a lot of excitement around and a lot of folks that want to innovate around and two it was to align existing laws a little bit closer um you know to to how people are actually operating within within these these dials so one way that i like to think about a dao it's like an online group with a bank account and lots of rules that are related to it um and under the existing law as an example if you form that and that group of people wanted to do something productive like make a profit or build something or engage in some sort of commercial activity it'd be considered a partnership and you'd have to owe what lawyers call fiduciary duties to all the other members of the dow fiduciary duties is a fancy legal word that basically means like a heightened responsibility like you owe more than you would other folks when you're engaging with them but in my mind that's insane like imagine if you're part of an online community and some synonymous person that you don't know that you're communicating with you owe some heightened obligation to that makes absolutely no sense but that's the way the laws are currently written under the wyoming bill we soften that and you're permitted to do that in the u.s so we waive these fiduciary duties to the extent permitted by law uh we addressed issues related to conflicts because it's presumed as ross mentioned before that dows will be more porous in nature that people will go in and out and we also streamlined the process so you only have to really have one document instead of a handful of documents that are that are necessary today if you want to kind of explore this structure so the idea is to legal recognition to kind of align it with what we're seeing uh right now with daos and a little bit forward leaning there too and then also to kind of hopefully over time lower the cost and that's exciting right i think we've seen tremendous amounts of growth with dows whether that's defy related protocol dows some of the investment dows that folks are forming or more service-based dows which are really interesting as well and that's exploded uh over the past year it's gone from about 10 million dollars in assets in these dials in february 2020 or uh yeah 2020 and to today you know depending on who's counting it's either roughly a billion dollars or even more than that and it's gone from having thousands of people participate in these structures to up to 200 000 people participating these structures rough right it's hard to get clear metrics on blockchain and so it's i think it's admirable that wyoming is taking the first step forward um and trying to really tackle and and recognize these entities but there is still a lot of work that needs to be done there's like uh valid criticisms that came up even beforehand uh related to the bill structure some of those issues were known beforehand but were products of the political system you know others kind of emerged from comments um but i i think you'll see this as a first step and then over time either additional legislation or additional amendments to to kind of clarify and make sure that it's in a really good spot but i do think it is really a notable moment and i hats off to the folks in wyoming for helping to to push this forward and before this um wyoming llc or dow llc law um there were other dows that were organized as delaware llcs so what can a wyoming llc dow do that dow organized as a delaware llc cannot do um so they're very similar right the concept was if you wanted to to put together a rap dial so you wanted to root a dao in a legal entity let's say like a delaware llc to do that today you would have to in all likelihood pay a lawyer tens of thousands if not more dollars to put together a structure that would work for the project it's incredibly expensive um and that's uh that's not something most developers can afford that's not something that most developers since they're focused on software uh actually are equipped to kind of manage the nuance related to it now there's some folks that can and you know that's awesome but most folks can't do that the idea was to to set the default rules in a way that was a little bit closer to how people are actually operating such that the costs over time can go down so you don't have to pay lawyers tens of thousands of dollars to do something that is more and more routine and so not surprisingly when lawyers saw that that occurred they got grumpy lawyers like to take their cut out of lots of these projects and are not happy about that but in reality it shouldn't cost you know tens of thousands of dollars to set up an entity it shouldn't cost tens of thousands of dollars to set up a dow and so this is a framework that enables that incentive structure and the cost related to it to eventually go down um but in many ways it kind of preserves that same spirit which is using a limited liability company is kind of like a shell to defer to software-based systems for governance you know and for you know member managed structures to the extent that that applies for various different use cases the other thing that it is contemplated although i do think the language will change you can start to clarify which portions of your organization are going to be run by an algorithm like which smart contracts are going to be used which i think is important for the public to know if you're going to be building and intend to aspire to build something that's really meaningful i think it's nice to have a public identifier that people can refer to like the smart contract address or some other public identifier the code that you're using and i think that's a nice thing to have an additional reasonable requirement that we kind of put put in place um and the other thing that you can do with the wyoming law that you can't do with delaware is call yourself adapt and i know some folks may want not want to do that and i know it's very subtle but it's a big deal you know lots of folks want to call themselves you know abc dao they don't want to call themselves abc dao llc it just kind of has a a different feel to it so that's another important difference as well yeah well i actually wanted to ask about the algorithms um so as you mentioned the wyoming bill does mention these algorithmically managed dows quite a lot but i i don't quite know what that means because um if a dow is managed by an algorithm rather than the members of the dao then how is that a dao sure so it contemplates two different things a member met by default all the dows remember managed what that means is by default unless it's varied by the agreements there's not going to be imputed a manager of some sort i think that aligns with what we're seeing with lots of d5 projects there's not some central group or central persons that are in charge of it around the edges there may be a software development team there may be folks that serve more ministerial functions but there's not like a centralized leader in some sort of way you can though under the existing law decide to elect to be an algorithmically run dow and i don't think we've actually seen these forms of taos yet but it's something that's been contemplated and theorized uh by legal scholars for quite some time so yeah what does that look like i mean since we don't have one yeah like i was kind of like why why we yeah that's that which would be something like bitcoin uh so many folks have analogized that bitcoin itself is a dow or dalek structure and they've gone through the mental exercise how could uh bitcoin or bitcoin like project get launched and how could it get launched in a way that would align with u.s law there's a scholar from the university of southern florida named sean bynum who's who's theorized and put this together and thought about this exact question and the way that he thought it could all get lined up would be first you form an entity that has members so those members form it they begin to develop it and then they assign over into that entity all the intellectual property related to the algorithm and then they quit they leave and then at that point you have a legal entity that only has an algorithm sitting at its core and that fact was something that the legislators and other folks that provided commentary wanted to account for whether that has manifested yet or whether or not that's a perfect analogy it's you know it's too soon to tell but i wouldn't be surprised if we see more and more structures over time that begin to resemble that um and because of that that's why it was put into the law so and um is there any group training an algorithmically managed dao i think that there probably will be groups that try to create this we saw groups try to create an algorithmically managed dao or something that uh is pretty close to that in bitcoin um and that is something that folks wanted to account for i mean bitcoin in many way is an algorithmically managed data it has a core software protocol that's run it's operating and you can participate in it but the core governance is in the algorithm itself so it's a way to kind of position that type of a project and one way to do that and you possibly could do that you know today in wyoming using this legislation like if satoshi didn't want to be anonymous if if you wanted to set up something where you really are putting at the center of the organization a set of software you would have the ability to do that under the wyoming data legislation today and wait so in bitcoin what is the algorithm that manages bitcoin is it the sha 256 what like what it what what algorithm manages bitcoin uh proof of work right yes sorry i mean yeah it's the core software yeah yeah yeah it's the entire package that you need proof of work well it's more than proof of work it's the entire node and the software that's dealing with validation it's a software that's dealing with everything that manages bitcoin it's a core group of software so you can imagine that being owned by an entity and that entity having no members and while that may seem kind of like an odd construct it's something that's accounted for in the law and something that we wanted to account for since a we're starting to see prototypical examples of it in things like bitcoin and b it was something that legal scholars in the us have contemplated and since it takes some time to put together laws it takes time to pass them we wanted to make sure and do our best to try to future proof it in some sort of way so if there's some folks that don't think that that future is going to come to pass it doesn't really matter you are by default a member managed entity so you can decide who is going to be in charge of this operation if that you know idea of an algorithmic dow doesn't fit for your project no worries no it's really no harm off your back or off your back if however you want to explore something that's a little bit more future leaning you have the ability to do that and i think that that's an important thing to kind of contemplate so um okay and beyond that even beyond that just to give a full picture uh some of the language related to that piece is something that folks have flagged and even before the law was passed there was a handful of amendments that were hopefully to get put into the original bill but due to different reasons including some issues related to wyoming parliamentarian issues those amendments look like they're going to come in a second bill that hopefully will go through the appropriate committees and get presented to the wyoming house and senate and what are those it's just a cleanup bill yeah so it'll clarify some of the language related to uh designating yourself as either member managed entity or an algorithmically managed entity go clean up a couple definitional issues that folks flagged and then also clean up some other you know minor points that that people have identified or have provided feedback on you know since the bill was presented and proposed it's a process right legislative process is not um it's not you know a one-time thing and then the bill is done particularly at the state level there's usually opportunities to clean things up and tighten them and amend them but it's notable that we were able to get something there to a recognized house to be give people the ability uh hopefully to form these at much less cost than they would if they wanted to set something up in delaware and see we've begun the conversation around this to start to have some of the productive um you know the productive conversations that i think are necessary to make sure that at least in the us we have kind of the right approach here right and so for the manager managed dows um which you know under the with this new law that you know you can't have a manager manage now some people were interpreting that to mean that a dow could not be managed at foundation which is by a foundation which is how some of the dow started out so why is that why can't they be managed by a manager yeah well i think because i mean they could conceivably just decide to be an llc at that point i don't think it's contemplated that dows will have managers so i was trying to account for kind of that reality but i mean but but people are saying that a lot of doubts do start out with a foundation managing and so they're saying this sort of like doesn't account for they could form as an llc and when they feel like uh their structure is in place or they could form as a software company they could convert into the staff or they could to designate themselves a dao at that point in time i was gonna say that i also don't think that uh manager managed really speaks to the use case of daos and that they are almost entirely about being flat and uh you know real time with uh you know membership management um so i i can't appreciate you know maybe you know daos that have you know managers might not be the best uh use case to design around or um to promote um but there are a lot of protocols that are bootstrapped by foundations which are you know really core teams of developers um i don't think a lot of these developers really thought carefully about you know making a dow or the implications of like token governance um so maybe you know things like wyoming dow bill uh you know co-deference approaches like that can make this bit simpler but there is an advantage though to conversion and like aaron said that if you're situated in a jurisdiction and they have an escape hatch into a more you know dow 5 version um that seems like an immediate advantage um and kind of my idea with the dow bill um is you know kind of it's a celebration of like llc's which is like a celebration of maybe uh you know libertarian notions of how we should like own businesses together um if dao's existed um way back when i assume we would have something like the dow bill before we would try to do an llc bill because um i think anyone who's exposed to this technology or has been in dao is um they they see like these are actual like real systems versus a traditional company which is whatever the government and your bank and all these other third parties can agree upon um so it's very much i think in the train of uh the experiment that wyoming had originally with llcs and promoting something that's more flexible i am also aligned in just automating lawyers out of a job and i think there's probably too much histrionics about code deference and how difficult that is um so i i think it's you know worthwhile to have experience at the legislative level as long as we can also promote um you know private organizations that you know try to use operating agreements um you know there are templates for that but i think my my biggest pain points in terms of like you know dows and llc's and uh these sort of statutes is how do we really celebrate smart contracts and digital currencies how do we remove the need to pay fiat um you know to the state uh how do we avoid the need to hire a registered agent that merely just receives uh mail that's very alien to a dow like noticing a dow because like somebody sent some mail to it like feels very archaic so there's aspects of company formation as a whole that you know i think we're leaning in here and i i think it's going to be an iterative process and a lot of sausage is involved you know with getting something passed so i think that's probably why there's you know there's controversy and you know i i definitely think that you know lawyers as our job were meant to criticize like that's almost like how we get our supper but i think this criticism has been productive for ethereum um in that we're you know as a culture as a community we're very experimental and we are able to upgrade and fork and do things that are you know necessary um you know so um i'm optimistic though you know on the normalizing impact of dow bills um anyway i think that's right yeah no but i think it's a good one ross i think it is that experimentation one it's the validation and the which is notable right it's nice to be able to actually have an entity that's recognizable so going back to even what we were talking about before if curve was organized as a wrapped owl in some capacity and there's lots of reasons why they may not choose to be that but there's good reasons for them to do that if they wanted to walk into court that would be a lot easier for them to do that if they wanted to get tax id numbers and start paying taxes they can normalize and actually grow to something that's not kind of on the back waters of the internet but really front and center and prominent mainstream they have an avenue and a path to do that and beyond that you know i think for existing structures this may not work right maybe you formed a private foundation before converting into this may not work but you can always start as a member managed entity which could be a group of software developers that are managing um you know some open source project or something else like that and then you can convert that you can amend your documents and decide to have that entirely run by an algorithm if you want or once these amendments pass you can have some sort of hybrid of the two and just articulate that and i think that's great and then to ross's point about automation what i'm hoping we do see is you know lawyers or other folks increasingly come up with standard off-the-shelf documents that teams can use so that they don't need to pay a handful of crypto lawyers you know 60 000 or more than that to put together a dow i think that that's just wrong and i don't think that that's the direction that we should be uh pushing towards it should be just as easy to set up a dao if you want to as it is to set up a company for venture capital financing or as it is to um you know to set up a small business which it shouldn't cost uh tens of thousands of dollars to do that and hopefully this lowers the requirements uh to do that uh and we can continue to see experimentation to make sure that the different forms and shapes and structures of taos that i imagine we'll see over the next couple of years uh increasingly are accounted for in different ways kane warrick of synthetics wrote a great blog post on how dao should finance themselves and in it he wrote this description of a dao daos also forego reliance on external courts of law the dao controls itself from the inputs of dao members alone it is by definition self-contained and need not rely on any external arbiter to determine control of course there will always be the necessity of meta governance but the dow handles this through stakeholder inputs controlled by its own internal rules what did you think of his description here i think there's a point to it in many ways he's just describing private ordering which at least in the u.s and in parts of europe there's strong historical messages and support for that notion the idea is that different parties can agree to order their affairs if they're deciding to order their affairs using code as opposed to legal agreements i think that there's a strong argument for that to happen unfortunately law doesn't disappear governments don't disappear the course of impact that governments have doesn't disappear just because you've self-proclaimed yourself a dow and just because you've decided that stakeholders have decisions if the activity of what you're doing is unlawful if the activity hurts other people you will be held accountable for it we saw you know glimmers of this with the original the dao and its implosion you know fortunately because of the ethereum hard fork and because of the fact that ethereum ramped up in value after that fact people were not wiped but if they were wiped i am sure that we would see one or more of those members enforce the rights in courts so even though there the you know folks that put that together said hey this is entirely run by code you know where it's code as law and it's pure sense and you know many folks are cheering that on in reality something goes wrong people get hurt they get grumpy they go to court they hire lawyers and people that are involved will be held accountable for it uh in structures that don't have a legal backing in some sort of way they will likely be viewed as partnerships and the way partnership law tends to work is that partners have to account to one another if there's some sort of damage in some sort of way and your liability for any damage that's been caused is not limited so that means the deepest pocket is going to be responsible for it so if uh you know some of the venture capital funds that have backed these projects want to participate in governance if you know folks that do have deep pockets because they've acquired a number of digital assets over the years want to participate in daos they can definitely do it and i'm sure that many of them will not run into issues but there will be some that get knotted up in some nasty situation involving a dao that isn't organized it doesn't have any limited liability protection and they'll be on the hook for it and that's gonna that's gonna probably push more and more folks as they mature to begin to explore these types of structures yeah let's kind of flush that picture out a little bit more so let's say that there is a dow kind of more the way that kane described it here where you know they're not an llc and um maybe let's say there's venture backing or it doesn't have to be it could be whatever um but you know i imagine that for the foreseeable future we are going to see this range of doubts some will you know become llc's and others will not so um let's say that we have two they're doing the exact same thing the same like blow-up happens it's parallel universes like uh sliding doors or whatever and um you know after the blow up then what happens to the dow that's not an llc and what happens to the dow that is an llc yeah so let's say that there's some damage that somebody can quantify let's just put numbers on it 100 million dollars in damage which is not unheard of um the individual members if it's in an implied partnership would uh be responsible for making that party whole and if you know one party uh was brought and ordered uh to make the damage party whole they could turn around and then seek an accounting from the other folks to get their money back so it creates an incentive uh when you have a pure partnership to find the deepest pocket to bring a cause of action against the partnership and that deep pocket to pay for it and then to turn the partners internally so that they can deal with the internal accounting on who should fully pay for this so it creates a huge mess if it was a legally wrapped entity then only any amounts that were contributed to that entity in general with certain exceptions would be at issue so the entity itself would only be responsible for the damage you as an individual member or owner or participant likely would only be responsible for your individual contributions to it so all your other assets are not put at risk and that's a big difference right if you have a lot of assets if you're a mature player if you're a traditional player you're not going to likely want to participate with some of these dow structures until you have the certainty of limitation liability until you have the certainty of legal recognition so right now as we see d5 kind of scaling up it's awesome right like we can stay as an insular community but if you believe in this vision that blockchain technology ethereum bitcoin at some point is the norm it is mainstream you cannot avoid the fact that traditional actors and players are going to need to participate and play around with these structures so at some point it's going to have to get sorted out right you're going to need some of these these protections these this legal recognition in order to move forward and that's why it's important because it's not just going to be an insulin bubble forever at some point the weight and gravitas of what's happening in this ecosystem will become large enough that it's going to have to pull in the rest of the world and it's going to need some of these legal protections to do that so i applaud kane and you know for pushing and kind of taking what i call like the more wild west approach but at the same time unless you lay down the foundation with what's happening in wyoming and other places that eath and uh the crypto ecosystem just gonna hit a wall it's not gonna be able to get the adoption that i think many folks are aspiring for it to uh achieve yeah and if i could add there um i would say that there could be an intermediate step uh you know for kane's version of a dow and maybe you know what corporate body should be um you know adding a simple membership or a constitution to the mix that at least makes it predictable how members will treat each other in the case of disagreements i think is always you know a very positive step and we're seeing open sourcing of templates for that but yeah there is this issue with private ordering um through smart contracts which you know smart contracts are like almost you know the end goal of private ordering which is like true enforceability by agreements you know code is law but then you know private ordering still has externalities of course you know the agreement i make with aaron i can't say you know aaron you and i agree that nobody else can sue us based on what we're doing together that's not exactly how the law works the law is a remedy system for the things people do that affect each other however you know smart contracts while they're good for private ordering you know uh you know down member to dow member um the state provides these uh you know public ordering things like llcs where we can then coordinate with other people that aren't in the dow and try to reach some agreement about who holds the bag if there's an issue um these are kind of tools and fictions made up things the state provides us so we can like actually coordinate and like make productive businesses without like losing our house every time right so there's kind of this um reality that you know i think is a very important um addendum to keynes i would say pure and you know very uh i ideally sufficient of dao is in that members are humans and what they decide to do on the blockchain will affect people off the blockchain and we have to grapple with that reality if we want mainstream adoption people are grappling with it by going full crypto anarchic and you know going private you know using tornado systems to hide value flows but i can't see that being the immediate adoption point um that that feels like it will always be an area for people to do uh maybe more censored uh businesses you know and but there's more ordinary use cases for ethereum like fundraising for startups that like we want to make sure that it's predictable um who can get sued if we decide to do these things so mostly just rephrasing what we just talked about but i think it's important to also understand that you know we shouldn't rely entirely on smart contracts we should try to define our relationships amongst each other as daos and then if we want to have a relationship with the public we want to own businesses or you know put up billboards and do cool stuff off chain it's very helpful to have a coordination mechanism with the public like an llc um so that's kind of where um i see coda's law and laws code like converging is like it's a coordination technology ultimately and trying to get people to not go full vigilante if they have a bad business deal we want people to be civil right that's ideally the goal of all this is that people cooperate um right right and part of cooperation is taking risks and that's why limitation of liability is so important right so that's the one of the core innovations of a corporation right which folks like sam altman and others uh you know have commented that that may be the greatest innovation of all time right this this legal innovation of creating a way for people to limit their liability uh just to the actions of what's going on inside of an organization that's you know enabled so much uh human output human creativity to to kind of meet its most efficient endpoint and that's what's missing with you know dows right now when they're partnerships you have unlimited liability when you participate in them so that means you put your personal assets at stake for anything that's going wrong in those groups arguably and and being able to have doubts that have a limitation of liability means that more folks can participate having dials that are legally recognized and you can call yourself that gives them you know an actual degree of validation which means that they can interact they can acquire land right they can start to move into areas that are outside of crypto which is in the long run going to be important being able to you know articulate that you're going to have part of your organization not managed by contracts but by software it's subtle but important there's nothing precluding that but having that clearly stated i think is helpful and hopefully can resolve disputes and then beyond that you know you can start to get things like tax numbers you can begin to interact with the real world and that's going to make regulators and other folks that are worried about crypto understand this technology a thousand times better so if uniswap wants to be as large if not the largest exchange ever you know how is it going to do that if it can't interact in any way or talk in any way to the traditional world they're just going to be skeptical they're going to have their backs up and it's not going to fulfill that vision but maybe through these structures or some innovation on these structures we can get to that point where we can really see crypto emerge and become the global force that many developers and advocates and other supporters really believe it can be so we're taking steps in that direction yeah so we'll have to see how all this pans out i feel like we could have gone another hour to discuss the many many other issues that pertain to this subject but um i'll have to do that in another episode so where can people learn more about each of you and your work i'm at our underscore ross underscore campbell apologies for how confusing that is but people can find me on twitter um and see what i'm working on um erin yeah sure twitter a twitter's a great place and
