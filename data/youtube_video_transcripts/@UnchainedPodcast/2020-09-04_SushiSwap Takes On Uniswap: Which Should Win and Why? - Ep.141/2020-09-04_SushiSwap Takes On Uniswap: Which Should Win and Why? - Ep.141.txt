quite a number of developments in d5 this week let's talk about one of the biggest ones which involves uniswap and sushi swap for those who missed the unchained episode earlier this week we talked about all the category of decentralized exchanges known as automated market makers these are not order book based exchanges but instead exchanges in which listed token pairs are priced according to an equation in which multiplying the prices of the two tokens in the pair will always equal a constant uniswap is the dominant amm or automated market maker it's so dominant that it recently overtook coinbase in 24 hour volume however it does not have a token so an anonymous account forked the code to create sushi swap which is pretty much uniswap but with a token it garnered 700 million dollars in total locked value within three days of announcing the project and as of the time of this recording the total value is over a billion dollars do you think that this is a positive or a negative development and which of these projects are you rooting for and why oh wow okay um can i give like a hedged answer here um i can give you a multi-dimensional answer here i think that conceptually um the fact that we're in a place in d5 where um uh these sort of these sorts of adversarial experiments can be spun up super super easily um and the community is frankly like robust and technically knowledgeable enough that um you know within a matter of days if someone does a fair launch um the community will build a ui and they'll be um you know like heavily populated discords with various people you know volunteering their efforts the fact that we're at a place in this ecosystem's maturity where like this is possible where fair launches like actually like are a reasonable possibility is like i mean it's it's crazy it's it's in in a good way honestly i think it's very very positive and like look like with regards to like whether or not this is fair to the uniswap team or whether or not this is um you know positive for um the liquidity dynamics of um of automated market makers you know i personally find to be less less relevant here i think like um like as uh operators in the d5 space like you always have to design things in a highly adversarial mindset with this notion of like everything's open source anybody can clone what i'm doing um the only quote-unquote mode um is you know really providing value to users and so and so really like uh i would say that like conceptually um i think that sushi swap is like a positive development um and i and i actually think that there is um as an experiment you know like i as as a as a contender in the various sort of experiments that are happening right now to figure out the best way to community manage and operate um automated protocols for trading lending etc um so that's great uh and i think they have the best of intentions um where i think this is a negative development is that you know you can call me a a defy boomer or an eth boomer to some degree here but um i feel like you and i were of the uh generation of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who experienced things like the dao um and kind of saw the fallout that that generated and and saw how much that kind of like frankly like um set back the entire crypto space like there was like you know full multi-page spreads and magazines about like this crazy dow story and it and it really tainted the space for a long time um and that was with like a tenth of the value of what's being dealt with right now the lesson that the community kind of like learned is like i feel like the the ethereum community really like galvanized around this like kind of like very conservative security mindset from there after like like there was this culture of like if you're gonna release a project it needs to be thoroughly audited you need to have a bug bounty program you need to have the code very like um meticulously documented and manicured and um like out there in an open source repository for a long time for people to review you needed to you know like to some degree like there's this culture that like didn't normalize the idea of like just put something out there and like see what happens because this stuff's dangerous and like when you're developing smart contracts it's like you know the closest analog in my opinion is like it's like building like a nuclear reactor like it's not it's it's really really difficult and the consequences when you get these things wrong are like immense so my point here is that unfortunately i think like there's this culture brewing in in the defy space right now um around fair launches where people just kind of like fork a repository change up a couple small things and then just deploy it and then um within a couple days there's like you know 100 million dollars in one of these in one of these systems and and just to be clear the the fairness of it is that there isn't a pre mine there is no vcs that you know have a kind of a stake allocated to them same with even the founders they don't have anything pre-allocated so it's just it's fair for everybody to get in at the scene yeah they all get in at the same level yes i mean we can we can debate whether you know the extent to which this is actually like these things are actually fair they they tend to be um instead of dominated by vcs they tend to be dominated by um cryptocurrency whales so it's it's not exactly the um the most egalitarian thing but um but regardless you know it's like i conceptually i'm here for it like i i i get it the problem here though is that like there's this culture brewing in this in this fair launch world where people just like launch these like pieces of high stakes financial infrastructure with very little review often very very sloppily and it's wildly dangerous right we saw only a few weeks ago um a project called yam was deployed garnered a massive amount of value locked up in a short period of time and then a critical bug was discovered um that you know led to pretty significant loss of value and so this brings me to sushi swap because for all of the positive intentions of sushi swap and for all of the um you know in my opinion like net positive effects of us experimenting with new governance models for amms and so on and so forth everything that i have seen and that what many other security researchers and smart contract developers have seen with regards to the entire execution of this project it's like you know there's a term as an engineer of like a code smell it's like uh where it's like it's just like something's just off here like it's it's like an everything smell right like like the code looks like it was sloppily written in the matter of like a day or two issues keep getting kind of like identified by community members and then kind of like haphazardly quickly getting get patched um this thing is being rushed out of the door extremely quickly and you know like at present moment i wouldn't say that there is like a um identified clear like major red flag that is saying like you know like pull your money out now this is gonna like this is definitely going to to explode in some capacity but there's also not a lot of assurance that that won't happen um and like if you're developing smart contracts the biggest thing that you have to be aware of is that like there the space of known unknowns is massive like it doesn't matter how many audits you get it doesn't matter how many eyes look at things like smart contracts are like radioactive like they're so difficult to build um that you have to move really really really slowly and i'm seeing the exact opposite from this community right now right like the uh actually just this morning a proposal was put out by the uh pseudonymous founder of sushi swap to actually accelerate the timeline um of migrating all the liquidity that is being staked from uniswap and sushi swap into a native automated market maker and so again like it's like it's it's really really concerning um because it feels like if not sushi swap the next derivative of it or the next whatever like we are we are sort of driving ourselves as a community towards a place where an explosion is inevitable and i think there's just too much potential in this space for us to set ourselves back with with another dow essentially yeah yeah and just to clarify you know how big and how i guess uh overheated the trading was getting so um larry cermak of the block tweeted on tuesday that there was 175 million dollars of sushi volume on unison on monday which he noted was more than the volume of bitstamp poloniex and bitsharks combined over the same time period and you know as he tweeted digital sushi that didn't exist four days ago has a higher 24 volume on decentralized exchange than the entire bitstamp and then you know one other thing i wanted to flag about this um rushed migration i did note somebody else saying oh you know again it it feels a little suspicious that they're moving this up and doing it over what is a holiday weekend in the u.s almost it's like a little sneaky yeah so and you know as you mentioned more than a billion dollars of total value locked in this so it's definitely much bigger than the dow and yes to rush um it is a little scary but so let's in a moment we're going to discuss a little bit more about sushi swap and some of the issues there as well as what all of this activity is causing to happen on ethereum but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible how much in

the end of september back to my conversation with nadav hollander so one of the actually like weird aspects of this whole tussle with sushi swap that i wanted to draw out is that it's actually driving up the total value locked in uniswap so can you just explain why that is for listeners yeah i mean a big reason for that is that essentially what's what's novel and interesting about this sushi swap experiment is that it's effectively a instance of what's been dubbed a like vampire attack or basically the protocol incentivizes people so so let me take a step back really quickly when you deposit your funds into uniswap you get um as a as a liquidity provider you get what are called liquidity provider tokens or lp tokens that entitle you to basically withdraw both your original principal and any sort of fees you've accumulated as a liquidity provider so the way sushi swap works is that it's essentially in this sort of pre-launch period which it's in at the moment users are incentivized to deposit their uniswap lp tokens into the sushi swap system where they continue to be operating in uniswap um but they are earning rewards um in the form of sushi to to their address essentially and the idea is that at some point uh a switch is going to flip and everybody who has their uniswap liquidity provider tokens staked in this sushi swap system their liquidity is going to be kind of pulled out of uniswap and put into the um uh the sushi swap system um so it's kind of like this like um this big incentivized system for forking liquidity away from uh from uniswap this has for two reasons um created a dynamic in which more and more liquidity is getting locked into unison number one you know it just so happens that this sushi meme has taken off like significantly enough where this token is valuable and um you can actually make a lot of money um just providing liquidity to uni-swap and taking your lp shares and putting them in the sushi system and farming these these sushi tokens moreover the second reason why it's caused the uniswap liquidity to balloon so much um is the sushi token itself right so the the way that the sushi swap system works if you provide if the lp token that you stake is um of the sushi eth pair you essentially earn uh i'm not sure what the exact multiple is but it's like either 2x or 5x the amount of rewards essentially so as to incentivize liquidity in this like sushi token and so as a result for a variety of reasons which is a whole conversation a topic of its own a yield farming token designed as sushi swap is if it takes off enough as a meme can very very quickly like accumulate a lot of market cap and the vast majority of the sushi market cap right now is like sitting in uniswap lp tokens for sushi eath because it's extremely valuable um as a yield farming asset as a result like there's this crazy weird like self-referential derivative thing happening here where essentially like a massive portion of that liquidity that has now entered uniswap is actually just sushi tokens that are being staked in or rather that are being used to generate lp shares that are being staked in the sushi swap system in order to generate more sushi um and sort of repeat the process over and over again and then will eventually be used to suck liquidity out of unisof which is correct i mean in theory we'll see what happens but that's the goal yeah and that's what you know he was the chef nomi the creator of sushi swap who's trying to make happen a little bit faster this weekend um and i just wanted to know what you thought was going to happen because uniswap is planning to come up with its own version three perhaps by year's end do you think it will happen in time or do you think that sushi swap could really take off before they're able to you know kind of come back and and make a counter move i think that ultimately look they're they're it's hard to open on what will happen on like a short-term basis with regards like what's going to happen over the next couple weeks like i could give you like five different outcomes here ranging from like the migration completely fails um to like uh you know a big chunk of liquidity gets migrated over and um you know sushi swap kind of starts to you know garner some sort of uh popularity in terms of trading fees and kind of operates as this parallel system to uni-swap for a while like there's a lot of different possibilities on what can happen but i think like we all need to take a step back and just remember that like when you add a token into a system it is it needs to be a token in service of the protocol and not like um just a protocol in service of coming up with a reason for a token and it seems like the the sushi swap system at the moment like the fundamental end user value innovation that it's providing it's it's just community ownership and at that you know debatable community ownership in terms of how much is actually necessary um given that uniswap is already a governance minimized system and so it's you know like the point that i'm trying to make here is that like the end user value to the to the trader to the person who's actually like paying the service who's paying the fees is identical between these two different systems and ultimately the system that will succeed is the one that garners the most trading fees and the the fact of the matter is is that like the uh it's easy to fork uniswap and add a token to it it's much harder to make uniswap v3 and come up with like you know a more novel and extensible or interesting amm design that provides more value to end users and so ultimately the point that i'm trying to make is that like the protocol that's going to win out is the one that provides the most end value to traders and you know will sushi swap be able to build the community that uh is able to to innovate in that capacity maybe um and i i'd love to be proven wrong here and i think um the wi-fi community is kind of demonstrating that um fair launches can really sort of attract a lot of the greatest minds in the space to contribute um so so maybe that will happen but um my personal bet is probably going to be on the uniswap team uh there given that yeah they've demonstrated a track record of being rigorous of being innovative and um and delivering so yeah yeah i was i was thinking more of that mindset kind of like a vc mindset that um you know it's it's probably more about the team if the products are not that different and obviously there's a lot of risks being taken by one side and there's a lot of money put in so you know if you get burned then um you're probably not going to be super loyal to that um to that team but we'll see what happens so one of the other big issues to come out of this yield farming craze is that the blocks are extremely full on ethereum which is pushing fees way up some people are paying things like you know 40 for a trade on uniswap and i'm sure there's a lot more uh you know that people are shelling out to do yield farming which is you know takes more complex transactions your product dharma is a solution for the high fees tell us how that works yeah so i i mean i i wouldn't quite say that it's a it's an end-all be-all solution but effectively what for what dharma does is that um instead of you having to like basically our moniker is that like you shouldn't have to think about gas you shouldn't have to like um worry about gas you can just use dharma in order to make a trade um and you don't have to deal with paying any sort of gas fee now to be clear that doesn't necessarily mean that we are just shelling out money like and giving it away for free in order to pay for the actual transactions themselves um effectively the way that we're able to offset that is that we take what's known as a slippage fee meaning uh essentially uh we calculate what we believe is kind of the slippage buffer on the trade that is most likely to make it go through but is also kind of most fair for the pair given its liquidity and then whatever slippage is actually realized we take the difference between that and the and the fee that we quoted you point being here um essentially what we're able to do is that for you know for many traders especially smaller traders um if you're using dharma you're going to pay way less in gas fees than you would um on a uh you know interacting directly with uniswap and you are much much less likely to deal with you know having transactions not go through correctly or having your metamask get jammed up for whatever reason and so on and so forth and so effectively like the tldr here is that like um we take what is like a uncertain and highly technical process in which you need to kind of dial your gas price knob uh in order to make sure that your uh your transaction actually gets mined um and turn that into a basic trading experience in which you just see a simple slippage fee and your transaction goes through the vast majority of the time and for most users um you save a considerable amount of money yeah i did see some of the stats that your um company released on that and it looks like maybe it's not the whales that are using your products but kind of a more everyday person who finds it useful and is able to take advantage um all right well this has been such a fascinating discussion i'm sure we will see what happens with sushi swap and unit swap and um there will be more opportunities to discuss what's going on with dharma in the future so thank you so much for coming

nexo dot io slash token that's nexo dot io token thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline dex volumes hit new all-time high as uniswob overtakes coinbase decentralized exchanges saw 11.6 million dollars in trade volume in august up from less than one billion dollars in january this sets a third consecutive monthly record index volume up from 4.5 million dollars in july as dennis vinakura of head of research at bequan told coindesk it indicates that the d5 flipping is real and already here uniswap is leading the charge into centralized exchange growth with a reported 283 percent increase in 24 hour trading volume from july to august and more than one billion dollars in trading volume on tuesday and wednesday of the week which was roughly 50 higher than the 24 hour volume on coinbase pro at the time to illustrate just how massive the increase in training on uniswap has been larry cermak of the block posted a graph on twitter showing the staggering increase in unique trading addresses on uniswap alone in the last few months frank chapparo also of the block posted a diagram showing the exponential growth in google searches for uniswap this year which began shooting up in april but have since but have quadrupled since july it's not all unicorns and rainbows however while the surging volumes on decentralized exchanges present a challenge to establish centralized exchanges like coinbase they've also increased fees on ethereum due to congestion next headline why earns why ethevalt makes it easy to yield harm why earn finance has launched a vault for yield farming with e as the recently departed chief of oracles at maker dao mario nakanti explained to the bankless podcast put simply this will make it easy for anyone who holds these to get involved with yield farming think betterment but for yield farming because why earn utilizes the automated market maker curve stablecoin deposits won't be required as has been the case with previous yield farming projects anthony sasano in his daily gui newsletter explained how the white falls works after a user deposits his or her eve it is put in maker down to borrow dye which is then deposited in crv to withdraw its liquidity provider tokens and earn crv tokens the crv is then recycled into eth by buying more on the open market because wyonet uses smart contracts to find the best yields gas costs for multiple operations are ostensibly spread across several users saving on transaction fees on tuesday's bank list conti referred to the vault as the smart contract equivalent of quote set it and forget it because quote you are earning a lot of money on your youth without losing exposure to your eat but as the host of thinkless as well as cesano noted this does not come without risks as the creator of wiren famously tests in production which means putting your money in smart contracts whose level of security is unknown for those of you who are watching on the video this image which if you have some background in how maker down works in how curve works in you know all these different yield farming projects work is pretty easy to follow and it breaks down exactly how this vault in um wire net works all right next headline gas bees on ethereum reach all time high putting focus on scaling with all this yield farming activity on ethereum it's no wonder that according to the block research the theory miners generated record fee revenue of 17 million on september 1st which is almost four times higher than at the peak of the 2017-2018 frenzy however ethereum's exorbitant fees highlight the limitations presented when it comes to scaling d5 on the xerox blog remco blowman argued that at present ethereum has become a place for the rich as only whales can profit from trading with such high transaction costs however he says simply raising gas limits then creates risks for ethereum security he analyzes whether it's possible to scale at layer 1 but concludes the only reliable solution aside from focusing on layer 2 is quote to tear everything down and rebuild it from the ground up ethereum creator vitalik buterin posted a lengthy twitter fred r thread arguing against trying to solve the problem of high gas fees by artificially setting gas prices higher or lower which he calls naive he advocates for increasing transaction capacity through scaling citing migration to the scaling solution zk rollups by tether bitcoin and other apps as the best solution next headline has d5 reinvented the fair launch in case you haven't noticed everyone is excited now about fair launches many crypto projects have attracted criticism over distribution mechanisms that favored early adopters enter the fair launch a trend kicked off by y earns yfi token which launched without a premine without founder equity and without venture capital at darebit insights hassu analyzes the fair launch looking at previous altcoin launches and noting that projects that on the surface look fair are often not so he says investors should scrutinize any coin advertising affair launch as a core feature to see if there are any possible exploits ian lee the managing director of ideoco lab ventures wrote in his email newsletter synthesis a post titled fair launches will disrupt crypto vc he says quote if fair launch has become more common sophisticated and successful they should scare the out of crypto vcs he believes they will become more fair and not advantage whales as much as current fair launches do and reward people not just for short-term activity but also for longer-term actions and other forms of participation such as voting and proposals he also thinks that returns will not scale one-to-one with the amount of liquidity one has again in an attempt to keep wales from earning a disproportionate amount of rewards in a subsequent post he argues that fast follower forks such as sushi swap will become more common and that projects without a token have a higher risk of having their project forked tokenized and fair launched he also said that projects will now have to be careful to not take on too much venture capital next headline the sec is keeping a close eye on d5 in an interview with the block securities and exchange commissioner hester purse said the sec is taking notice of d5 and the questions it's posing saying quote i think it's going to challenge the way we regulate while purse admitted that defy regulation isn't at the top of the svc's list of priorities she concedes that the agency is following the space closely purse who is known as crypto mom has shown a keem interest in the cryptocurrency industry and stated that the delicate line between fostering innovation and protecting protecting investors will become even more precarious with the rise of defy next headline how patosi mines strategically to protect the bitcoin network sergio demion lerner the researcher who has looked into early mining habits of a minor he believes was bitcoin creator satoshi nakamoto and who discussed his findings on a recent episode of unconfirmed has discovered that this miner used mining algorithm not included in the release of the first bitcoin client lerner not being 100 sure of the identity of this miner has nicknamed the miner patoshi lerner recently reminded bitcoin's first 18 000 blocks and discovered that patoshi's miner did not mine the way the early public software did while the public software which is ostensibly searching for a number that will enable it to mine the next block would do one sweep for this number potoshi would do multiple sweeps additionally patoshi reduced the hash rate of his or her minor several times that first year plus likely shut down his or her minor for five minutes every time putoshi mind a block so as to foster competition and create a diverse set of minors on the other hand potoshi would also turn on his or her minor when there wasn't a lot of other computers on the network lerner says quote i conclude that the most plausible explanation is that he was protecting the network time for fun bits how dan robinson lost someone's money to a front-running bot this week's unchained guest dan robinson of paradigm published a blog post about a conundrum he was posed with last week someone had accidentally sent their unistock liquidity tokens to the pair contract itself where anyone could grab them if they realized the tokens were there the challenge for dan was that because of front-running bots that scoured the memphis which is the area where pending transactions wait he realized that once he submitted a transaction to rescue the funds any front-running bot could see the money which as we put it would be like quote would be like flashing a free money sign pointing directly directly at this profitable opportunity he entails all the machinations he went through to try to obscure the transaction and stealthily secure his friends money read his post to find out what happened and to learn why you should never underestimate a front-running bot thanks for tuning in to learn more about nadav and dharma be sure to check out the links in the show notes of
