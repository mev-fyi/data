legal advice my guest today is robert leshner founder of compound welcome Robert hi Laura great to be here on the compound website you described compound as an open-source protocol for algorithmic efficient money markets on the etherium blockchain what does that mean sure so what this means is we allow people to exchange the time value of an aetherium asset a token similar to the way that they exchange the time value of currencies and assets in traditional financial markets and what i mean by that is we allow people to borrow and lend an asset at a specific interest rate for us for a specific amount of time if you look to the way that money markets operate in existing financial markets almost every last dollar or unit of currency is earning an interest rate somewhere in some way whether you see that as the end user or whether that's you know accounted for through multiple series of middlemen every last unit of currency is earning an interest rate because there's demand for the currency because there's a use for the currency and that doesn't fully exist yet in the etherium ecosystem and what we're trying to do is we're trying to bring that concept to a theory and how does compound earn interest for the money that is in the system so the way it works at a really high level is that users can supply assets into an ethereal money market and they can borrow assets from this money market and the interest rate that everybody is interacting at is actually set by the forces of supply and demand so when there's a lot of demand for an asset the interest rate is high and when there's very little demand for the asset the interest rate is very low and instead of users having to negotiate or trade or speaker out what the interest rates should be you know they don't have to use any math what we do is our protocol sets the interest rate in an optimal fashion such that every market participant has an interest rate that they're comfortable with so one thing is you're seeing that the protocol assists the interest rate but as far as I understand I think at least to start compound the company itself is setting it is that correct that's right so what we've done is we've built a an economic model or an interest rate model that determines at a high level the way that interest rates behave we're basically setting a series of interest rate curves and then the markets themselves on any given day in a given moment and you give an hour based on supply and demand the interest rate is a product of the interest rate model and over time we're actually able to upgrade these models were able to work with professional economists were able to source data from the community and from the market experience and actually improve and upgrade the models that are used so that the model that starts when we first deploy the protocol will probably not be the model that's used two years from now so when you say that the model of years and I won't be different are you talking about the fact that you guys will be kind of like tweaking the model as it goes on and improving it based on what you see happening in the protocol yeah that's exactly right so over time we're going to be using a lot of the data that gets generated all of the information that gets created from the usage of the protocol as well as additional input from the community and from economists we're going to use that to over time upgrade the interest rate model so let's just go back to how this work when I put money in a compound where does that money go and then how does the borrower obtain it sure so when you supply a token into a compound money market it's actually being swept into a smart contract that acts as a financial marketplace and everything is handled programmatically by a smart contract there's no discretion involved it's all based on lines of code and borrowers are able to access those assets simply by requesting them and proving that they have the collateral necessary such that their borrowing is not considered risky so in order to borrow an asset a user has to actually supply assets to the smart contract as collateral and from there they can simply request any asset that they would like on demand oh and so in this sense the borrower's don't have to kind of prove their creditworthiness or anything like that it's just they're dealing with a smart contract and as long as they put up enough collateral they can take out a certain money or a certain amount from the money market is that correct that's exactly right we've seen credit based systems in crypto not exactly work ideally because crypto is an irreversible transaction and it's anonymous it doesn't suit itself well to credit based transactions whereas it does lend itself extremely well to collateral based systems because smart contracts are very capable of enforcing rules programmatically and our approach a compound is actually to use you know entirely collateral based system with no credit to any individual user or address the money markets are pools of the lenders tokens so does this create a centralized honeypot for hackers in a sense it does we believe that smart contracts are simultaneously much safer and riskier then call it traditional custodial approaches the reason for this is if a smart contract is built correctly and properly it may be a large honeypot for hackers but it can actually be able to resist hackers permanently it's immutable code and if it's built correctly we'll always be safe and if it's not built correctly will eventually be broken and so building a smart contract based system that holds assets requires probably significantly more audit and analysis than most approaches because you can't patch it and that's simultaneously the biggest strenght and the biggest weakness so essentially what you're saying is the security of this depends on the strength of your smart contracts that's exactly right and we believe that with a long enough time spent building the smart contracts and analyzing them and ensuring their security that we can build a protocol in a system that operates without incident for a hundred years interesting yeah I guess this is one of those things where we'll just have to see how it plays out in the wild exactly if we get it right and we'll always be afraid and if we get it wrong we'll find out relatively quickly or maybe not I don't know I feel like sometimes you or not you in particular but just people might trust a piece of software and then all of a sudden you know two years in realize that there's a weakness but anyway I wanted to ask also when the money is loaned so let's say when that money is loaned that the borrower is a short seller and they end up losing money while trading it for more speculative tokens then what happens so the borrower is always required to maintain a certain amount of collateral if they're not able to repay what they've borrowed then eventually the protocol will allow somebody to close out the loan and to cease their collateral we allow them at anytime to supply additional collateral which would repay what they've borrowed but as time goes on in the value of different assets in the marketplace fluctuates eventually if the value of the collateral is not sufficient the protocol can close out that loan and so the risk is really on the user's of these assets if there's a hedge fund that's borrowed an asset in order to short sell it they're the ones who are taking a financial risk in that action and ideally most of the participants are sophisticated actors and understand those risks and how is this value determined because if I did take out you know I'm just going to call it X coin and that's the one that I've lost or or you know I've lost money or wait how should i phrase this because is it just that like I just need to put X you know let's say I take out 10 of these ex-cons then do I just need to put 10 of them back even though the values much less we expect you to repay 10 X coins with interest you might actually owe 10 point 0 3 X coins depending on how long you've taken out the loan for but that's really on you to repay in kind you know the value of x coin might fluctuate you might have made money with X coin you might have lost money with X win but the protocol actually expects you to repay what you've borrowed plus a small amount of interest huh so so the dollar amount doesn't matter at all but I know that you guys use like a certain collateral ratio I think also to determine the minimum amount of collateral they need to put up so is that affected by dollar fluctuations that is so it's actually affected by the fluctuation of the assets that you're using as collateral so if you're using ether as collateral that might fluctuate in line with whatever you've borrowed if you're using another token as collateral that might fluctuate in line with whatever you've borrowed what the protocol does is it looks at the dollar value both of what you've borrowed and what you've used as collateral and it ensures that the value of your collateral is greater than the value of what you've borrowed and no so what is the amount that I need to put up is it like 2x or 1.5 or what so when we initially launched we're going to be earning on the side of caution simply because we don't want borrowers to take large amounts of risk so we're actually going to be requiring a 2x collateralization ratio that's a little bit high and over time our goal is actually to reduce it as low as we can if you look at repo markets that exist today you know in the traditional securities world you know people are borrowing pretty much what they're putting up as collateral and the ratio is a lot closer to 1 to 1 and that's based on the volatility of the assets and it's based on the sophistication of the market over time I think we're going to be decreasing the ratio from to closer to 1.5 and then over time eventually to 1.25 but that could be a series of changes over the next few years that's not going to be an short-term change in what happens if the value of the collateral dips below 2x then then what happens so at that point anybody in the community can close out a portion of what you've borrowed and take a portion of your collateral to return you to exactly that 2x collateral ratio so if you've borrowed you know a whole bunch of X token and you're using ether as collateral if over time the value of what you've borrowed is increasing or the value of your collateral is declining any member of the community can repay somewhat the X going that you've borrowed and take a small amount of your ether and you said that prior to that moment the borrower has the opportunity to put up more collateral that's right so the protocol makes it transparent exactly what your collateral ratio is and how much you've borrowed and how much collateral you have and it makes it easy for you to actually provide additional collateral or to repay your own loan at any time as a user of the protocol most people won't choose to be you know risking anything they'll hopefully choose to be you know minimizing collateral value risk and over collateralizing for their borrowing Oh meaning that you expect the minimum requirement is 2x but that they'll put up like 2.5 or 3 or something that's that's exactly right because people aren't looking to speculate to the maximum extreme you know we're we've been speaking with a lot of crypto hedge funds and large traders and you know they view this as a tool for supplemental liquidity to be able to short sell or to be able to increase leverage they don't want to use it as a system that increases their own risk so they might actually supply 4x or 5x the amount of collateral necessary to borrow simply because we're not looking to do everything to the extreme they're looking for you know the ability to short sell a quantity of tokens or the ability to buy you know new tokens you know in some degree but it's generally very sophisticated and responsible users and how do you determine what the value of any one particular asset is as we know exchanges can vary pretty widely and their prices and that's why so many traders are making money off of these arbitrage plays but there's also issues with you know flash crashes and things like that so how do you figure out what the value is so the way the protocol works is it references a price contract that exists on the blockchain when we launch the protocol we're actually going to be supplying prices to this price contract where we're taking prices from multiple different exchanges and we're posting them to this contract every time prices fluctuate by one tenth of one percent which is very often and so we're constantly keeping a contract address on the ethereum blockchain updated and informed with what we consider to be the most accurate prices over time we're going to be able to decentralize this and actually hand this responsibility to the community to provide this price information but to start with it's really a function of our company aggregating and averaging the information from a series of exchanges and posting them on chain consistently and so in the event of a flash crash what would you do in the event of a flash crash the contract will reflect us you know the speed at which we can update the price information is actually just a function of the ethereum blockchain it should take approximately 15 seconds to update the prices in the protocol and this is an entirely automated process you know there's not a human being with a paper and a pen you know writing an update everything is handled on and so anytime prices move they should be reflected in the protocol and the system's within one to two blocks or 15 to 30 seconds Oh interesting and when you said that you eventually plan to hand this off to the community what does that mean exactly so that's a complicated process and we haven't seen that many protocols evolved to be fully decentralized but our goal for the protocol for us to have absolutely no involvement whatsoever a few years from now and what that means is we would turn over a responsibility for the pricing to other institutions or the community you know over time if exchanges start posting their own prices on to the ethereum blockchain we could actually just reference those prices if you know groups form to take this responsibility and start voluntarily you know posting pricing information the blockchain we could use those prices it doesn't have to be our company that's providing this information anymore and that's our goal we don't want to be the ones responsible for this we want to have no one Falls - we care and to go back to how the protocol works in the white paper you also mention that collateral earns interest so borrowers earn interest on their collateral and know what do you guys do with a collateral how does it earn interest that's exactly right so by providing collateral to the market it's the same as somebody supplying an asset to the market in the first place you're making it available to other individuals and traders to borrow as well and so you know it continues to accrue interest just as if you had supplied it without any other action it just so happens that you're using as collateral to be able to borrow all of the assets in the protocol earn interest and all of the assets borrowed pay interest and then if the value of that collateral falls below the value required by the collateral ratio does it still earn interest like does the person who gets to liquidate it did they earn that interest or how does that part work yeah so if it's your property it continues to accrue interest if somebody liquidates you because the value of the collateral has fallen it becomes a small portion of it becomes their property and they'll begin to earn interest on that as well okay interesting so basically at any given moment in the system there are two types of money that are earning interest there's the money that was put into the compound money market and the money that was put up as collateral that's exactly right and they're they're essentially equivalent the protocol views then actually is the same thing whether supplying it or you're supplying it as collateral in both cases it's equivalent to the protocol and you're earning interest on that on those okay so what do you think are the primary use cases for compound so there's two sides of the marketplace so to speak the first are users that are supplying assets to earn interest today most assets are actually sitting idle on exchanges and in wallets and in cold storage and they're not actually being made available to other people to use and so the interest rate is zero the first primary use case are people earning incremental returns in the assets that they own so this could be an individual who otherwise would be keeping assets on an exchange whether it's finance it tracks for whatever it is and they're not actively looking to trade it or sell they just want to do for mental return the second could be smart contracts themselves that have token balances they can actually monetize token balances through compound and any on chain system that has a token of any kind can actually use compound as a source of incremental returns is actually a new business model for a lot of smart contracts because a lot of people you know are building smart contracts and don't actually have a business model of profit model in mind and simply the act of storing a token and managing a um is a business law one there's actually extremely popular if you look outside of crypto and so that's the first use case and the second use case is on the borrowing side and there's three reasons why somebody would want to borrow a token the first is to be able to use it as its naturally intended without having to buy it first so we can enable a developer to borrow ether to deploy or to execute smart contracts we could allow you to borrow a token such as Z or X or zero X to be able to trade without having to buy it ahead of time we could allow you to borrow the basic attention token to interact with a browser and advertisement yep and you're you're able to borrow tokens without buying which is actually a really interesting use case it enables more contracts you know not to have to stockpile tokens but to be able to access any other application on chain that's really cool the second reason that people would want to borrow is because it provides leverage when we speak to a lot of our hedge fund partners but interested in borrowing ether and stable coins because it allows them to buy other assets that are considered to be base pairs for all the other spectrum of tokens and so they're borrowing ether and stable coins to buy other assets to actually increase their own leverage and their own risk exposure you know if you borrow a bunch of stable coins and go out and buy token X with it you know if a more exposure to token X lastly it's actually B inverse of that it's the ability to short sell an asset right now there's very limited tools to be able to short sell tokens and the first necessary step in order to short sell an asset is being able to borrow it now compounds not in exchange we don't provide exchange functionality we don't think you trade but we provide in a trust less open source and transparent fashion a mechanism for traders to be able to borrow tokens to be able to sell them elsewhere so a very simple workflow is somebody would borrow a token from compound they would send it to an exchange and they might trade it on that exchange I want it go back to the first use case that you mentioned with ether or just any token that you want to use I almost I'm not quite sure I understand why you would do that but let me take a stab at a guess it sounds like so let's say you want to use ether to run a smart contract you borrow it from compound you've put up this collateral you know to borrow it and then you spend the ether but then you have to buy it again in order to repay a compound and get your collateral back is the point of that that then you've earned at least 2% on the collateral or whatever percent on the collateral even though you perform this function and ethers that why you would do that yes so the primary benefit is you don't have to hold ether or specific token in order to use those so I could have a smart contract that just holds a stable coin and yet it can operate any other protocol or network as long as it's on the etherion block team so I could hold just a stable coin which crews interest in I'm earning interest and when my application needs another token to interact with their protocol whether it's 0 X or whether it's augur or whether it's aetherium my application can just automatically borrow that needed resource on demand it doesn't have to predict its own token needs it doesn't have to outlay the capital ahead of time to buy these tokens you can simply operate other protocols on demand I just automatically borrowing them from compound when they're needed at the end of the function it has to buy them at the end of the return eventually would have to buy them yeah eventually on the other side you would have to repay that in some fashion but it doesn't Nabal new use cases ok I mean it's just like sort of I guess the reason is what's that expression about the monkey that it's like one banana in the morning versus in the evening and what's the difference something like that is that what do you know what I'm saying like it's sort of like oh well instead of buying it before you perform the function you have to buy it after right but that can give you actually a lot of flexibility it's the same reason why you know corporations have you know working capital versus you know permanent capital you know why instead of you know raising more equity or debt you might just borrow a short term in the market to be able to operate that that's really the biggest difference and as the marketplace for smart contracts and applications and use increases we actually think it's going to unlock new opportunities that haven't even really been thought of yet and I also want to talk about the third use case that you mentioned so I totally got the short selling use case here I I see how it would work but I want to know what are the advantages of using compound to do something like that as opposed to a peer-to-peer lending platform like Dharma or something yes so the primary benefit of compound and I truly believe there's gonna be many different systems that exists over time that will coexist and peacefully but the primary benefit of compounds is that you don't have to wait for a counterparty in order to be able to access the liquidity so with most peer-to-peer systems you actually have to find somebody with the exact opposite view of you at the same time if I want to borrow token X I have to specify I want to borrow token X you know in a peer-to-peer system I have to specify when I borrow a token X for this period of time at this interest rate and somebody else has to take the exact opposite side of that after negotiating collateral and all of that with compounds you don't have to wait for a counterparty if instant and it's machine operable and it's predictable you simply specify what you're looking to borrow and the quantity all the other parameters were actually decided by the protocol the interest rate is decided by the protocol and how long you're borrowing it for is specified by you you simply repay your borrowed token X whenever you feel like it whenever you're ready to and it makes it much easier to access the quiddity for a short sale then a peer-to-peer system I believe that over time you know both are going to exist just like if you look at financial markets you have both money markets and long-term loans and debt and there are different use cases and I think that there's customers who actually want both and might use both at different times and in different fashions but compounds designed to be the easiest source of liquidity for borrowers because it is entirely encapsulator in a smart contract and there's no outside interactions that occur there's no order book there's no peers that you have to find there's no online systems it's just everything is contained in a smart contract on the blockchain that anyone can operate we're gonna discuss more about the inner workings of compound but first I'd like to take a quick break for our fabulous sponsors interested in raising capital through a security token offering

this question actually goes back to what we were talking about about how the money is pulled so I just want to make sure so if I am somebody who you know is just holding Bitcoin or whatever but I want to hold or not Bitcoin I guess ether and I want to hold it in a money market account then when I withdraw the money I'm just withdrawing from the overall pool is that correct that's exactly right so rather than having a an account or a segregated accounting of it you're actually contributing your assets to the entire marketplace and you can see for your own account or address how much interest you're accruing and your exact balance at any given time and the protocol denominator your ownership but the assets are a collective pool that function collectively has a money market have you modeled what happens if there's a market crash we have actually so in market crashes you know the biggest and only risk to individual users is that there's a liquidation this risk first of all is only on borrowers it's not on simple and because of the over collateralization you know the risk is that people wind up having some of their collateral converted into what they've borrowed and their loans are closed this actually doesn't impact the suppliers of assets and it doesn't impact other users or the protocol what it does do is it exposes borrowers to risk and it's one of the reasons why we want to make sure that everybody using our protocol is incredibly educated on how it works and what the risks are that they face you mentioned in the white paper that markets can be suspended what kind of scenarios would cause a market suspension so this is something that we reserve the right for when a token might migrate off of atheria so there have been a couple examples where an etherium token stops actually being a token a great example of this is Tron they were a token on the ethereum blockchain that migrated onto their own blockchain had that been a market we would actually have to suspend it and remove it from compound you know one of the things that's required is that you know a token actually continues to exist on the ethereum blockchain if that assumption no longer holds we can no longer support the market and we're starting to see a number of token projects think about actually migrating the chain that they're operating on from aetherium to other chains whether it's their own blockchain or whether it's one of the new smart contract platforms etc that's always a risk that can occur and so in that situation what our plan is is to communicate to the community that we will be suspending a market simultaneously with a token migration and are there any other scenarios in which you would suspend a market no only if it no longer is accessible to users if you know there was an extreme situation which is no longer usable as a token such that if there's a bug found in the token smart contract you know we might suspend the market you know so if somebody discovers a flaw with token X there's the possibility it would be suspended but this is an extreme scenario that hopefully never actually occurs you know our goal is to list assets that will function permanently but in the event that the token no longer functions it's necessary to suspend the token you say that eventually this decision over whether or not to suspend a market will be turned over to the community and stakeholders who will that be who will the stakeholders be and how will you turn that over that's a great question so the stakeholders of the protocol are really the users it's those who are supplying assets and those who are borrowing assets and what's interesting is we can actually measure how much of a stakeholder a user is by the balances that they're providing to the protocol eventually one of our ideas and this is still a rough concept is that we could create a decentralized autonomous organization really a governance contract that can actually provide governance of the protocol based on the quantity of people's usage okay interesting and how would they be organized would you use a token to do that no we probably wouldn't need a token simply because the influence that a user has would be measurable which is based on their usage of the protocol and it's already contained on the etherium blockchain what we would have to do is to allow the community or developers to actually create an interface and a voting mechanism and a government governance mechanism but all of the building blocks are there so that eventually we can actually hand off control to the community interesting so you know obviously to start you are kind of or you have organized it in a somewhat centralized fashion does that run any regulatory risk for you I did see that according to Federal Regulations entities operating money markets are subject to a certain reporting disclosure as stress testing other kinds of requirements are you guys going to follow those rules so everything that we're going to be doing is completely transparent the operation of the money markets is interesting because it's all open source it's all respectable and auditable and transparent and so in a lot of ways the crypto financial marketplaces don't naturally conform to any one regulatory regime they're global in nature and they're decentralized but we are planning to operate them in such a way that it's as transparent and open as possible the markets operate themselves the only information that we're providing to the protocol to start with is pricing information and the interest rate model both of which we actually have plans to democratize and decentralized so that it's no longer you know a specific company that's even providing those pieces it's the community itself so you know the hard work that we've done has gone into making the markets operate without our company the flow of funds the rules the way that assets operate is actually no longer in our control when we deployed the protocol the only pieces that we're going to be interacting with are posting price information and defining the interest rate model typically regulators in the u.s. say that you fall under their jurisdiction if you serve US customers so it seems like you probably do have to satisfy their rules do you think being transparent and open-source and auditable will be enough to satisfy them that's a great question so there's two things that were approaching this with the first is that we are not serving customers directly the entire protocol itself is simply a smart contract that's been deployed to a blockchain that operates autonomously the second is that the smart contract only supports utility tokens the assets that we're launching with are the ones that are most likely to be true utilities and not securities and so we believe that while it's a global regulatory environment it should be compliant with every regulatory regime yeah and then around like I know you have you know obviously you have this goal to eventually decentralized what kind of timeline do you imagine that will take you know it's hard to say it and it's a little bit early there's a lot of teams that are looking to fully decentralize their protocols most protocols actually still have sponsor organizations in some way I actually don't know of any that are you know fully decentralized we're planning to sort of learn the best practices as the community evolves and goes down this path we're probably not going to be the first protocol that decentralizes but we're definitely gonna be trying to learn best practices as soon as they're developed and to go back to kind of what the different options are for people who want to engage in these types of behaviors and tell me if I'm wrong as far as I understand compound is somewhat competitive with the margin trading features on exchanges like BitFenix and plenty X how is dealing with compound different and why would someone choose to margin trade using compound versus an exchange that's a great question so there's two primary differences the first one is that compound is entirely on chain there's no sort of cloud systems there's no servers that you interact with there's no company that you interact with you interact with smart contracts on the blockchain and what this means for us is that it's available to any machine or human that wants to use the protocol it makes it much easier for somebody to integrate their own software on top of it to interact with it programmatically or to interact with it without having to sign up for an exchanges website the second thing that it means is that we as a user you don't actually have to maintain an account or position on an exchange so if I as a trader wanted to short sell an asset on an exchange I would actually have to trust the exchange with my assets and hold that position on the exchange for as long as I had it with compound you can actually borrow an asset from an open source audited protocol that can't run away in the middle of the night and you can take those borrowed assets and do the trade you want on an exchange but then move the proceeds off of the exchange you don't have to entrust any centralized party with your funds and I think that's really powerful you know there's a lot of you know history of exchanges you know having negative events whether they're deliberate or accidental you've been a lot of times where user funds have disappeared due to exchange ever and ideally you don't have to take those risks with an exchange and so you know even for the exact equivalent trade borrowing token acts and then selling it we think the interest rates should and will be lower through compound than they would be on an exchange because there's less call it exchange credit risk there yeah I mean I think this goes back to it's sort of like pick your poison because as you did mention there is a risk in you know whether or not you're smart contracts will be you know reliable enough and secure enough so yes I mean obviously I did get this example of well I give multiple examples but one of them Biffen X I did have a very well known hack I think at this point it might still be the second largest hack in crypto history I'd actually have to check that I'm not sure but but as you did mention you know it is a matter of whether or not you can trust the smart contract in the case of compound so right okay it's a different flavor of call it security risk I believe that smart contracts are the better risk because they can be proved safe over time whereas an exchange are always running that risk whether you know the code changes or management changes there's a perpetual risk with the centralized exchange whereas with a smart contract based system I think that a lot of the risk is up front when it's unproven and untested and over time that risk goes down until eventually the community realizes that it's zero if it was built correctly and so it is a different type of risk and it does exist for any smart contract based protocol but I think long term you know a decentralized protocol has a lot less security risks and who do you expect will be the most likely borrowers and the lenders you did mention earlier this you know the fact that hedge funds are interested in this so who else and well but you know how do they plan to use it and who else will be interested yeah so I think there's always going to be people who are hobbyists in the community who are looking to borrow a token just to experiment with it you know without having to sign up for exchange and buy a token you know different hobbyists have the ability to actually borrow pretty much any asset use the protocol experiment it reduces the barriers to entry of playing around with protocols but I think the majority use case are going to be the professional traders most of the interest that we have that's inbound our crypto hedge funds extremely small ones medium sized ones large ones who are looking for different tools that they can trust to add to their skill set and I think a lot of the sophistication that exists in financial markets is concentrated at hedge funds and the different people that are able to capitalize on what we offer really I think you know centralizing around the hedge funds themselves because they're the ones who are looking to put on sophisticated trading positions they're looking to borrow an asset and short sell it relative to an asset that they believe in and put on a relative value trade or to use compound as a source of liquidity to arbitrage between different markets um I think those are going to be the largest users and we actually recently announced that we had partnered with 24 different crypto hedge funds that are looking to move beyond long only by an old strategies that are looking to add a borrowing component to their operations and so I think that's the root of the demand and I think everything else is going to be you know a lot smaller in comparison I looked at that list of crypto hedge funds and they're all like at least less well known ones and I'm imagining kind of some of the smaller crypto hedge funds do you think any of the bigger ones that manage quite a bit more in assets will use compound absolutely so you know our initial partners are smaller crypto hedge funds because I think you know they're the ones who have the most upside to experimentation being able to differentiate and there are returns and the tools they use is really powerful for them but I think that over time you know compound as a protocol will be used hopefully by the majority of the industry once it's deemed to be reliable and trustworthy and the longer that the protocol is live the more likely we are to be in the hands of you know the largest asset managers you are one of coinbase ventures first invest and in total you have 8.2 million dollars in seed investment from Bain Capital Ventures injuries and Horowitz and Polly Ching capital but compound itself doesn't have a token so how do you guys make money so that's a great question right now we're a company that's sponsoring this protocol the protocol itself sets aside a very small amount of the interest that moves through the system for the protocol sponsor as we eventually democratize them to centralize the protocol that may change the excess interest might actually be set to zero but for the time being there's actually a business model for our company is developing the protocol which is we keep a small amount of the interest that moves through the system you know right now that's an adjustable variable it's gonna start off being very small but it's a natural business model that's not a token we're a little bit old-school and the way we look at this which is most tokens are unnecessary there are fund raising mechanisms they're you know arbitrary in nature they actually add friction on to the usage of a protocol and we decided to look at this in a very traditional fashion why can't we have a traditional financial business model which is keeping a very small portion of AUM and having that owned by the developer or the ones that are building the protocol and so for us you know that might be the only funding that we take it might be the start of a much larger company only time will tell we're extremely excited to have the caliber of investors that we have that are able to make a long-term bet on our company compound might be you know a trillion dollar asset management protocol one day or you know we can see that this is an experiment that leads to something bigger and greater only time is going to tell which coins will you be launching with so when we launch we're gonna be supporting ether because that's the primary fuel of the network true USD which is one of many stable coins and OH Astrix by saying I'm a huge stable coin fan and I think there's a lot of stable coins that we're excited about we're gonna be soon I just want to jump in and mention that trust token which does true USD was on the show so people should check out that so I'll link to in the show notes check out that one as well VXR basic attention token also a past guest and auger okay I guess I'm going through your guest list here but these are the highest quality projects and you know these are the tokens that we're going to be listing first and I think there is a lot of overlap with the awareness in the community and the caliber of the teams and the projects that we're going to be listening first yeah and also I do want to plug a few other shows cuz Joey Krug of augur was on the show recently and also of course Vitalik butterin was on the show back in the winter I think that might be my most downloaded episode so most people probably hope check them out one other thing I want to ask you about it was um you mentioned that one time while you were testing out how to set interest rates in one scenario your team blew up the etherium virtual machine what did that mean oh that's a great question so we've done a lot of R&D on how to actually even compute interest rates in smart contracts it's not a trivial problem you know if you look to Wall Street and Finance you know you would think that calculating interest is extremely easy and it is using traditional tools if you had a server and a cloud it's very simple but a lot of the approaches that we tried to actually create a interest rate system in smart contracts written in solidity on the ethereum blockchain didn't actually function and a lot of the approaches that a lot of the formulas that you would use don't actually execute efficiently on a theory and so we've had to spend a lot of time coming up with a series of formulas that actually works to accurately calculate interest for an entire marketplace in ways that doesn't use up too much computation and storage and resources and early on in our testing a lot of the approaches that we took weren't actually technically feasible on a theorem they you know so to speak blew up the virtual machine which is you know what's computing these smart contracts and you know these these were things that we weren't able to even deploy because they were too inefficient and so you know it took us a lot of work to get to a protocol and an approach that's deployable and I want to go back to the coins you're gonna lunch with how did you choose these coins great questions so our requirements for the first projects we are listing are that there are liquid that they're listed on multiple exchanges that there's a large amount of community awareness and that there are likely to be utilities and not securities and the projects that we're featuring are some of the most understood projects all of them are usable today none of them are you know which for the future tokens all of them you can actually use when we go live and all of them are what I would consider to be some of the highest quality projects in the space we're not taking too many risks when it comes to asset selection we're looking to be a little bit conservative on the projects that we create markets for and when you launch who will your partners be aside from those hedge funds that you already mentioned so we're launching with 24 and growing hedge funds we're gonna be working with a number of third-party developers that are looking to build on top of compound we've already received a lot of interest of people looking to build wallets that sweep balances to compound and interfaces that tie together compound and other protocols such as 0x we're Dharma or you know dy/dx and I would say that our partners really are going to be our largest users and developers that are creating new experiences with compound because for the first time you know developers can seamlessly earn interest or borrow towards right now compound only works on aetherium with ERC 20 tokens are you planning to work with other block chains and if so which ones and how will you incorporate them so I'll start by saying that you know there's no such thing as an ethereal maximalist but if there is I'm the closest thing to it you know I'm extremely enthusiastic about aetherium I think it's so far the most proven smart contract platform there's obviously a lot of new block chains that are being created in order to host smart contracts one thing that I'm going to be looking at as the founder of compound and as a user and as a programmer are where the new assets being issued right now etherium is about 95 percent of the ass additions it's where tokens are being created if another block chain starts to be the foundation for new token creation and issuance that's when we're gonna take a very serious look at it to decide whether or not we need to create a version of the content protocol on those block chains and so I think it's gonna be quite some time before other block chains gain critical mass where assets start to be issued on them compound wouldn't work if there's a single asset or the native token of a blockchain it requires a series of assets to exist but if another blockchain does start to gain significant traction on asset issuance then we're interested in bringing our protocol to that blockchain about the etherium maximalist comment that you made I imagine actually Joe Lubin might be in a there's a few of us out there he actually was gonna come on my other podcast at a certain point soon so um I will ask him at that point if that's what he would call himself so more about you you're a serial entrepreneur what did you do before launch and compound so my co-founder Jeff and I have founded two businesses prior to compound another one has been you know what I would consider to be a massive success but we spent you know years building software startups in Silicon Valley building teams of engineers and bringing products to market before that I was actually a professional economist which was a very large change of taste from the world that we'd have into hell but compound really brings both of those experiences together as an economist and as a you know Silicon Valley software founder and you know it's really exciting to be able to build what I would consider to be you know a very product driven company focused on blockchain in Silicon dollar today how did you get into crypto you know this is a great story and it's gonna show my natural skepticism I think so I remember vividly reading the Bloomberg article that said Bitcoin reaches parity with US dollar bitcoins not $1 and you know I scoffed at it and you know I've read the Bitcoin white paper I you know I brushed it aside I said this is never gonna succeed and I was proving a little bit wrong when just a little the etherium white paper came out I read the etherium white paper and I said oh this is too complicated you know it's an order of magnitude more sophisticated than Bitcoin this is never gonna succeed and I was proven wrong again and it actually wasn't until the Dow hack slash you know implosion that I actually got really interested in atheria it proved to me that not only did aetherium launch but that it was functional as really fertile ground for a whole new ecosystem of financial applications and use cases and I started digging in around the time of the Dow hack and I was just blown away by the fact that it worked there was a tragic incident that's fork to the blockchain but it was proof that you could actually really start to program a set some program you know new financial experiences and it was just so amazing to me that I immediately started you know getting involved started learning solidity even though I'm not truly a programmer and just learning as much as I could as quickly as I could and you know watching the ecosystem develop has been just so staggeringly impressive I think you know at this point I'm a completely true believer in what if your name is built and it really didn't start that way how did you come up with the idea for compound that's a great question so compound started from a thesis and the thesis that drove compound was the idea that if a theorem succeeded eventually more and more real-world assets would migrate to a theory and would be tokenized and securitized you know eventually you know at the extreme end of this thesis every real-world currency can every real-world security would become a token on the etherion blotching and the question that I posed to myself was you know if this is true if every currency and every security is on a theorem has a token what stops then what prevents that and what are the gaps that need to be overcome and actually the first thing most powerful one is as simple as an interest rate or the spot rate and the reason is the u.s. dollar yields 2% you know whether you're earning it or whether Bank is earning it or whether a middle man is earning it every dollar that's not physically paper in a wallet earns the same thing if you're not taking credit risk and you're not taking duration risk and until there's an equivalent interest rate in crypto a dollar is not going to migrate off you know capital flows to where it has the highest returns you know a traditional digital dollar their yields 2% won't want to become a crypto token if you yield 0% and that there has to be interest rate equivalency and so compound started off as a thought experiment of how do we create interest rate equivalency between real-world assets and aetherium so I know that you have this vision for what compound will look like and which types of assets will be trading on it so in your most idealistic vision what will this all look like if everything that you hope for comes to fruition in the most idealistic vision and this could be 10 to 20 years down the road but I think we're slowly working our way there and we're on the path I think eventually there's going to be 50 to 100 trillion dollars of assets that are tokenized they're not you know new utility tokens per se its traditional currencies and traditional securities you know every asset a venture will be a token and in that world you know compound is really you know interest rate infrastructure that powers all of these assets where every currency you know is able to behave like it's offline equivalent and every security has you know interest rates that are equivalent to its offline equivalent and we enable you know the individuals and traders and applications of the world to seamlessly monetize and borrow pretty much any asset and just out of curiosity I find this a sort of different take in the crypto world you believe that traditional as that's an in tokenized form will be larger than crypto native or additional native assets why is that well it's because if you look at the world there's already hundreds of trillions of dollars of real-world assets I think there's very limited room for new crypto first crypto native assets to compete there's so many new cryptocurrency is trying to compete on the same value propositions that you know I don't think the world is looking for 50 different crypto currencies I don't think they're looking for 50 different stable coins I think they're looking for better versions of what we have today that are more secure more portable more transparent and programmable digital versions of traditional assets are kind of the best of both worlds and it's kind of in my mind you know what is most likely to happen you know encrypt out mmm interesting well we'll see this isn't such a great discussion I've really enjoyed it where can people learn more about you and compound so if you're interested you can come to compound dot finance we have a white paper we have ways to learn more about the protocol and in late September or early October we're actually going to be hopefully shipping the very first version of the protocol for users to interact well well great thanks so much for coming on unchanged all right been an absolute pleasure thank you for having me on on change thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about
