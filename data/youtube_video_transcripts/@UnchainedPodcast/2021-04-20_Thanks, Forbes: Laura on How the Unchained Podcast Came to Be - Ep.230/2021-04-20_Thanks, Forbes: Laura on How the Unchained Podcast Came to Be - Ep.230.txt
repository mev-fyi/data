market conditions to optimize fees maximize returns and enable extremely high capital efficiency for liquidity providers i can tell like you've been uh both a student of journalism and just podcasting and you approach podcasting from more for journalism's point of view then a lot of people who are starting out now including a few of us um so welcome to odp thanks for having me i'm super excited to be here awesome so so let's get started um one thing we're like super curious about is if you look at podcasting in general crypto is probably one of the most crowded spaces and some might say and we've had other speakers talk about how being one of the top shows is usually just a function of being early and just consistent but i can tell like you you're there's this deeper like decisions that you've made that have made your show one of the top ones so take us deeper like on a broader strategic level how have you thought about positioning and differentiating yourself so i would say that in the beginning i actually probably did benefit from being early however i wasn't the first and i think at that time the way that i benefited was that i had this journalistic approach which was new at that time and i think it's an approach that can draw in a broader audience than the existing podcast at that time could have because many of them were maybe like a little bit more technical or they were just sort of like a kind of like talk radio or something and because i had the journalistic approach i think people felt that if they weren't totally new to the space that they could kind of have a little bit more to latch on to that it wasn't just people talking over their heads because you know if my guests said something and it wasn't something that would be obvious i would ask them you know what is it or i would jump in with an explanation and i still do that today so i've had different um audience members or fans come up to me and say oh you know yours your show is like one that i feel like i can share with my friends and they can still get it because you take the time to explain and i also would say that since then um there's just something that i do very naturally that i realized has distinguished my show and i realized this again by people's comments to me i didn't realize that this was something that i did any differently from anybody else but after a while i began to realize that people would talk to me about what they were calling my uncomfortable questions or something as they would say they were just tough questions or whatever and essentially it's you know what it sounds like where if i'm interviewing somebody and there's some aspect of their work maybe that they may not want to talk about or that you know is a little bit challenging for them i'm not afraid to ask about it and like i said i didn't even have an awareness maybe that i was making people uncomfortable i i wasn't even like thinking about whether or not the questions were tough i was just thinking about what are the good questions or like what's what would be an interesting conversation or what it is that what what is it that people would really want to know like those were the kinds of questions i was asking myself but then i guess it led to these questions that people perceived as being uncomfortable or tough or whatever and yeah i mean i don't know if anybody and audience says uh you know was like a philosophy major or anything like that but that part of my major was kind of in that realm and um when you you know spend hours a week in small groups just like discussing ideas and challenging what other people say or you know questioning things like i don't know maybe i'm just very comfortable doing that um and i think so my friends are too so um it's probably just not that different from how i live but i think also because i am a journalist i don't have any notion that the people i'm interviewing are like my friends or that i want to be friends with them or that i can be or you know i kind of know that my place is to be sort of like the stand-in for my audience and to just like i said ask what it is that they want to know and so i think that's another reason why i became known for that and i think that's why people really appreciate my shows i've had so many people come up and say things like you know just that they feel they learn so much more from my shows because i do that or that they feel yeah because i mean you know think about it in crypto like people oftentimes i mean it depends on who i'm interviewing obviously but a lot of these people um are or can be can i can be making money from everyday people and so it is kind of a good thing to to question them and and be a little bit skeptical and do that on behalf of my audience so in that regard i feel like that's how i distinguish myself once i became aware of it then yeah i i understood that that was what i brought to the table and i began to realize oh right yeah if i compare myself to the other shows like they don't really do that so you know and so in that regard i you know i do feel that's how i've been able to differentiate myself in the space and i think one thing that's so interesting about that is this applies across like interview shows or uh narrative shows because it's all about getting a good story i'm curious like what are other experiences or principles or techniques that you've brought from your journalism background into podcasting probably thorough research the way that i like to describe how to create a podcast is like writing an article in reverse and so for an article maybe you would actually interview kind of the main actors in it and then kind of fill it around by interviewing like other sources but here i kind of have to do everything up front and then like perform the article at the end with the person you know it's like i genuinely go in kind of like already knowing what they're going to say at different points for various questions and of course you know sometimes i ask a question and then like they answer three questions at once or you know whatever like you know it's not like i'm literally predicting what they're you know but i just mean i have a general idea in my head of like what i wanted to look like you know and then of course i mean yeah there are questions where maybe i won't know what they're to answer but it's like one of those ones where i'm like oh they haven't answered this before or i haven't seen anybody ask them this before or that kind of thing so in that regard like i think the way that i kind of synthesize all the news and when i say that i don't even mean just like what it is that they're working on but i will often also kind of zoom out and i'll like look at what else is going on in the space and how that interacts with like their world and so i feel like that often leads to more interesting questions so instead of just like narrowly focusing on like what they're up to like bringing in these other events that will affect them and i think people find that interesting as well and then the other thing is that i um also do like what i call kind of like topic shows you know generally i'll have kind of like two different guests and they sort of discuss this topic together and i feel like picking the right people and kind of like you know making sure that they kind of have slightly different viewpoints i mean i don't always do this but after a while i realized like oh yeah it is a little bit better if they're kind of coming at it from different angles and then and then they you know i'm not trying to make it like some like throw down or you know i mean if they do that great but but it's just like the more perspectives and the more that they kind of engage engage each other and push back at each other i feel like the more interesting the conversation is so that's another another way because you know obviously in journalism you do try to get different perspectives in an article and and kind of that creates a bigger picture of what's going on and so when you're thinking about who to bring in or like who the person is how are you sort of either like testing or filtering for whether they're going to be the right guest who are going to have different viewpoints and actually like push back against each other or just like what we see in most panels just like everyone just agrees it's the same thing so a couple of different ways it sort of depends on what is going on in my life or like how well i know the person ahead of time but if i don't really know them at all i will you know look at whatever it is that they've put out like it could be their tweets or their articles or their other interviews um you know i will check out their youtube like whatever it might be other podcast interviews other times i actually want to do like pre-interviews with people especially if i haven't heard them talk before but for certain things just because i mean now i've it'll be six years that i've been covering this space in the next six weeks you know that's like long enough where at this point i feel like i kind of generally know for not for everything obviously because this space is going so fast that it's like not possible to keep up everything going on right now but for so many things i do feel like i generally know like oh like that's the person who is like really good on this topic or like has that viewpoint or or whatever so yeah so in that regard it's like mental rolodex something i'm curious about i loved your articulation of why your audience likes you asking tough questions but i'm curious why the guest likes it or how you get around the fact that there are a lot of guests that don't enjoy tough questions as much i always think back to if you're looking at all the big clubhouse shows that exist right now if you listen to what people are saying in the subtext of the promotion it's that oh yeah with clubhouse it's just friendly and it's just chill and you're not trying to do gotcha or anything like that so there's currently a model for people expecting not to be pushed so you have all this credibility you know you're forbes you have so many podcast downloads it's obviously a valuable platform how would you advise someone who's new and doesn't have your street cred to think about pushing and tough questions when oftentimes they're gonna feel a credibility gap with their guest you know that's an interesting question so i really think it goes back to how i didn't know that i was asking tough questions like when i was asking those questions and even now when i do i'm not trying to put the guest on the spot i'm i'm not trying to make it a gosha moment i literally just want to know like like i'm just curious i just think it's a good question i i don't have an attitude about it like i it's really just a genuine sense of curiosity that i have and it kind of goes back to what i was saying about maybe how in college like i'm just so used to having these discussions where people challenge each other's ideas and statements in a very neutral way and like there's no hard feelings about it afterwards it's just like you just go back and forth and like you say something and the person's like well i disagree with you because blah blah blah and then you you point back well you know you're missing da da and then i don't know maybe just because i'm i'm so used to that and i have a lot of my friends and i talk that way to each other and and frankly i think we all think it's fun and so maybe when i have these questions from my guests and i'm not doing it in a way where i am trying to catch them in anything or or whatever i mean obviously now i do now that people have said to me oh those are you ask these uncomfortable questions or tough questions of course now i have an awareness but then when i do it i just try to stay neutral because it's how i feel i i don't have an agenda but i do feel like it's a good question i do feel like generally there's somebody who probably has some kind of position of power where they should be you know i don't want to say held accountable because that means like they've done something wrong but more just like when you have that position of power like it is you know something that you take on and that responsibility to answer questions where you know maybe you did something that wasn't you know totally toeing the line with with what your job should be or you know whatever um and i feel that that just comes with that role and i feel like a lot of those people know that that comes with that role and so to me it's just a moment where now they can have the opportunity to explain what happened then or whatever it might be and it is true sometimes people get mad i've definitely definitely had guests who were mad i have had somebody who threw a major tantrum that lasted over half an hour we had to spend that time convincing the person to go on with the interview and i kind of regret not just releasing the moment where this person was like i'm quitting i'm not going on for the interview but you know uh we i we didn't do that we just persuaded the person to go on because i i literally had a half an hour worth quite more of questions to ask this person and was genuinely curious to get the answers and so that's what i did in order to get the answers and you know i've had you know i'm friendly with some of my sources like you know maybe we'll go uh like get a coffee or a lunch or whatever it might be and one of them when i asked a tough question during the interview i think was really surprised because we are friendly and after we rap said like you ambushed me and you know that wasn't my intention as i said it's just i thought it was something that probably people in the audience would want to know and i thought it would give this person an opportunity to explain um what happened at that time and so you know my advice for people who are looking to do that is let your curiosity drive you don't have an attitude try to be neutral and um frankly i think the reason why people like my show is because i do put the audience first in that regard you know i understand that sometimes when i ask those questions that maybe the sources won't come back to me or they won't agree but you know there are many ways to do journalism and sure the podcast requires their participation but in the future if i like write an article or whatever then that won't require their participation so it's not like i cut myself from covering them forever you know i just feel like in that moment you know my duty is to do my the best job i can for my audience which is to ask the best possible questions and so that's just the way that i operate the show i i love that because it's sort of like you're being that audience advocate whether the guest likes it or not and sort of related to that i think currently like it's really hot on twitter to like get dunk on gatekeepers and editors but as someone who's been on both sides of the table what can sort of this new breed of online creators learn from more traditional models i mean i really consider myself coming from the traditional model and i know that i'm independent but i truly credit all the skills that i have from my traditional training i have worked with some amazing editors who i really really feel like i would not be as good as i am today if it weren't for them same with you know like a lot of journalists even make fun of people who go to journalism school and they say well it's not necessary and yeah okay maybe it's not necessary but for me i had such a wonderful experience i learned so much i had amazing professors amazing classmates i i just really i came away feeling like i'm definitely a better journalist now like this was worth it so i would say that actually for me what is a little bit challenging is that in this kind of new era um the journalist is kind of supposed to be or not the journalist but but see that's the other funny thing now that i'm not at a normal publication at a traditional publication sometimes people i see people calling me like a podcaster and like well okay i mean i have a podcast but i consider myself a journalist who you know writes and does podcasts and videos now and you know just kind of works in different mediums but the work is still the same regardless of whatever medium it is that i'm using and i also see that people sometimes say oh she left journalism to do her podcast and i'm like no no i'm still doing the journalism for me with the the kind of little struggle that i have sometimes is that i feel like because now my brand is sort of associated with me as a person that's just a little bit weird and and it's something that is just a little bit more challenging for me to navigate because obviously normally as a journalist like it's not about you it's about you know the story the source or not the source but the the uh guest on your in in your show or whatever it might be and i realize oh people do kind of want more of me i literally saw a comment like that on my youtube recently where i interviewed another journalist about the coinbase ipo and we made it a little bit more like a conversation because it's like two business journalists talking about the coinbase direct listing i should have said and um somebody commented oh it was so nice hearing more of your perspective rather than just having you ask the questions and i was like oh okay that's interesting also i feel like you know going back to how i distinguish myself amongst this crowded space some of the other people in this space um their show is more like about them or whatever and so i like a part of me is you know just a little bit like oh and you know should i go that route but then um yeah it i don't know because it's something that i'm not used to i i really like doing the work like that for me is super fun and i think the other thing that i find interesting about that kind of like new area or new line that i have to navigate is that it made me realize because people are often asking me my opinion or whatever and it made me realize oh i actually don't have that many opinions i know might be a surprise to people but i think it's because i am trying to keep myself open to whichever way the story might go so if i dismiss something too early and before i know enough about it then i might miss a big story or like there were times in crypto where people were like you have to do a story on how did it as a scam and for whatever reason at least there's one big one that i can think of i did not have time at that time to go look into it but people would ask me about it but you know i always just felt like because i had never looked closely at it i couldn't have a judgment on it like the reporter in me would want to see like the data and then come to a conclusion but just like from all the rumors flying around i couldn't say either way you know i would want to look at i would want to spend like a month researching it before i had any conclusions so yeah it's like for anything that i would say i would want to back it up and so if i haven't done the research then you know i'm probably not going to have an opinion so yeah so i think that's just another way in which you know when you ask me how do i take from the two sides i'm a little bit like like definitely a lot of skills from the one side but the other i'm like trying to figure that out right now laura here's something i'm super curious about you're writing a book right now comes out in november of this year um good luck i know but this is the tough process but probably a good year to write a book and have time to get locked down and focus could you talk a little bit about because i know you always had a journalism career beforehand so your book contract isn't fully attributable to your podcast but that being said podcasts drive book sales there's actually a lot of industry interest in this like my podcast is like mildly successful when i've been reached out to by a publisher like that being said like when i actually had the conversation i know there are some people in odp who are interested in this path for themselves i had no idea what to say the industry standard isn't being set yet with the expectation um so can you just speak a little about a bit about like the process of your book in the context of your podcast for me i would say probably they're not super related but i think what it did was it brought credibility that i know this space and i could deliver on what i was proposing if i were to kind of generalize my experience into advice for people who want to use their podcast to get book deals what i would say is that i'm fruit so i'll just say one quick thing up front which is that so for fiction books for like novels or whatever or short story collections you have to write that first uh you got to put the work in up front and send the completed manuscript and unfortunately that's the way that goes but that's how it is done i mean i think if you're a first-time author and and you would use that to get an agent who would then pitch i'm presuming people will want to do non-fiction books and the way that that works is that you write a proposal which is obviously a lot less work than than doing the full-on book but you have to talk about obviously what you're going to say give like a sample table of contents and maybe even a single chapter or two and uh include you know who you plan interviews stuff like that but then also you need to talk about the audience that you're and who you're gonna market this to because the book proposal is really about like selling this as a product and so this is where like for instance your agent whoever it is that you get will be just a godsend because they're the ones who know how publishers think about these things about selling books as products and what's going to sell and so for me you know i i was on the like well these are all the cool crypto things going on that shouldn't be in this book um but my editor or not my editor my agent you know kept kind of like asking me okay well how can we think about who's gonna buy this and who the audience will be and so i would imagine for podcasters who know who their audience is or uh what their interest in books uh is then that would also be something that would feed into the proposal and help and help sell a book so you know the more knowledge that you have about your audience like i i run surveys on my audience on my podcast very regularly actually for that reason so that way i not me not just for this but for multiple reasons because i'm actually i use that that's actually a really helpful tip by the way for people who want to do podcasts is to run surveys um because i have used that to like introduce new features and people love them it's like literally just whatever you can tell people are requesting like you should do that i i've been doing that um but through that you know i can also see like oh it tends to be people who work in tech and people who work in finance and you know a strong segment of people who already work in the industry that that's my audience you know stuff like that you uh can use all that data to make your book proposal stronger because you'll just have more knowledge about who it is that might write your book probably than the average book author uh or a book proposal writer will yeah so quick quick tangent one of the things we talk about in odp2 is like just the importance of understanding your audience and talking to them can you share some of your like favorite questions when you do the service with your audience and also what are some of your favorite learnings that have come from them i remember this is just such a silly one because it seems so obvious and i'm a little bit like duh why didn't i pick it up but one of the questions we asked the first year and and maybe we still do is you know just like how did you hear about the show and i didn't have you know i did a search in apple podcasts or or on my podcast platform as an option and like obviously that was like a huge percentage and i was like oh right i guess i just thought like people would hear about it from twitter or reddit or you know whatever um but no they just did a search in a podcast app um so that was kind of like a funny one but i think you know what has led me to make some changes is stuff like you know i don't remember the exact phrasing but you know how can the unchained podcast serve you better essentially and then it's just like a free-form thing that was how so at the end of my short podcast which comes out on fridays i do now what's called the weekly news recap where i just pick what i think are the top crypto stories of the week and then write up a little um blurb for each one kind of like a little news item and then i just literally read it aloud on the show and um people requested that in the survey and um then the next year i asked do you like it you know how like you guys requested this is the format that we're using good for you and like yes they they love it so so that was you know really good yeah i'm trying to think of what other questions um for people who want to look for sponsors we did also have some demographic questions which helps us then when we pitch our sponsors to say like this is who our audience is and help explain like why they're appealing to the sponsor so um so i think that's also a good thing to ask about question and we spoke about this for a second beforehand but you had a really interesting story about um how your podcast actually came about with your ownership and the way the forwards model works this is really relevant for people here because once again multiple people have had questions about forming launching a podcast where they're employed somewhere else and then navigating that relationship so i'd just love to hear your account for everyone the story there yeah so when i started the podcast what happened was i was a freelancer at forbes at that time and i saw that forbes had just come out with a bunch of podcasts and i said to my editor hey i want to do one and they had lunch with the season of 12 and so i became the 13th lucky 13. by the way let me just say that um so because i was a freelancer at the time i got the standard forbes freelance contract which is an unusual contract actually in the media industry so typically when you're a freelancer for major publications the most common contract you'll get is what's called work for hire where the contract basically says like all the work that you do for us will own it like we'll own the copyright and whatever but the forbes model is different where i'm sure you're aware people can become bloggers on the platform where our contributor where you are able to just publish your own column under the forbes brand on right on the right on the website and so the kind of contract that those uh contributors sign is not a work for hire contract in that contract they own all the work that they produce and forbes well so i don't know what it is now but at the time that i signed it it was something like forbes wanted exclusive rights for x number of days and then after those days you could resell your work and i used to resell my work actually so when the podcast came around the contract that they gave me was one in which it said that i owned the copyright to the podcast and the hilarious thing is so i have a lawyer now who that's all my contracts i didn't even have a lawyer look at this contract i just signed it uh you know i had such a good relationship with my by the way shout out to matt and janet i don't know if they still listen to my show but i love my editors at forbes they're amazing and um i just wanted to give a moment of appreciation for them but the point is that yeah i just signed it and what happened was after the first season forbes didn't want to continue my show and i then said okay well i love doing this so i'm going to continue it i'm going to find my own sponsor so i found a sponsor who took on the full year of sponsorship for the year 2017. that was the year that obviously crypto took off and by the end of the year there were way more downloads on the show than there were at the beginning and um by that point i was a full-time staffer at forbes and when i had joined there in the summer of 2017 i had said oh you know if you want you could run ads against the show but not until after 2017 because i promised the sponsor they would have the exclusive ads on the show for the full year well someone who was working for me at that time on the show at one point was like laura do you realize like now with the downloads that this is how much money you could make from the show and i had no idea and i was like oh wow okay this is more money than i make at my job and i had always wanted to write a book and i at that time had a good book idea already and so i was like oh this is perfect i can quit the job and the podcast doesn't take me five days of work a week so i can just do the pod in a couple days and then do the book the other days and so that's what i did so i quit and because i owned the copyright outright um i could just take the podcast with me and yeah i hired a sponsorship manager who manages all the sponsorships for the show and then i started my book proposal and the book sold in the summer slash fall of that year that whole process takes a little while so um it wasn't just like a one-and-done thing but uh it's sold and then yeah i've been working on the book ever since along with podcasts so yeah but i realized i totally lucked out because um i'm not going to name who this person is but i heard through the grapevine that another journalist who started one of the it must be one of the top 10 i haven't looked at the charts but it must be one of the top 10 shows like on a like across the world or something i don't know or maybe just in this category i'm not sure it's definitely a very very popular show i heard that he uh later said oh i will never do that again where i start a show and and the uh company owns it because i think eventually this person just had to walk away for anybody who does start a show under the auspices of another company i would definitely urge you if you have leverage to use it to retain your

blockchain.ey.com so another thing i'm curious about before we jump to sort of questions from the audience is um i saw on twitter recently that you've talked about not owning bitcoin and part of that is like so you can write for the publications uh from my understanding i'm curious like what do you feel uh sort of like along those lines in terms of like integrity and ethics what are other things creators should be thinking about that maybe they're not especially people who like maybe are young and just start a podcast and it blows up right like they're not really thinking through these things so can you talk a little bit about that decision and how that should apply to creators maybe one of the first things that comes to mind is that so when i when i said that i quit forbes and then i hired a sponsorships manager there was a period of like i think maybe one or two months where i didn't have that person or like six weeks or something where i didn't have that person in place and i remember one of the first companies that reached out to put an ad on the show was and i'm just going to say this outright because i did mention this on the show recently it was um some kind of bitcoin ira and i don't remember which company which probably is a good thing but anyway what i do remember is that i was like okay i'll check this out so i had a call with them and then they informed that the way that it works was that when they had this like special vehicle or whatever that allowed you to put like actual real bitcoin in your ira but then they charged a fee of 15 of the bitcoins that you were transferring into the account and i was like what and i just was like i i cannot put an advert like like i mean i was just like no um and you know that was like at that moment you know probably what maybe i i don't remember how early this was so maybe let's just say it was like one of the only offers i had a from a sponsor who wanted to like give me money to reach my audience you know you know maybe if i'd been desperate for a money no but even then i wouldn't have done it but the blindness uh for i mean it just goes back to what i was saying earlier like do whatever's right for your audience you know don't don't be like freaked out like i'm never gonna make money i have to take it wherever i get it no don't do that if you put out a good show it will work right um you just you just have to like keep going and yeah you know i had the advantage at that point of having already had a year and a half i guess by then of having built up the audience for the show and whatever so it it just was a matter of time i'm sure like if you're starting at zero and also trying to make it work financially then then there will be pressure but um you know that was one of the things for like i mean there was really no question for me about whether or not i was going to do it but i could see if i had been in a different place where i was literally just starting out then i might have been a little bit confused for a moment and been like what should i do um so you know for some of the fellows if they find themselves in that kind of position then as i said before do what's best for your audience i love that story because as i we kind of talked about your recommendation is usually as good as your weakest sponsor so thank you for sharing that um and with that we'll jump to questions from the audience hey laura just love your story thank you so much uh i don't have a journalism degree so for beginners like me how would you say how should they take a journalistic approach to podcasting like what does that entail so for me uh it goes back to what i said about how i think about if i were going to write an article how would i do that and for me that's trying to make it comprehensive not in such a way that it's so comprehensive you're kind of almost going off topic so you should have a vision in your mind of what it what what it is that you want to cover on the show and then when you do your research so here so here's basically what i do i read like a lot i i just try to inhale you know a ton of content about whatever it is because i know what's going on in the crypto industry quite well yeah i can spot like when i see something new like oh i haven't seen that before or oh you know like you kind of recognize when you've just heard stuff over and over again or you know and obviously there is an element of that on the show because like i said i don't know how beginners and my listeners are and so there will probably be a portion of the show where i'm literally walking the guests through questions that they've answered before elsewhere um just to have them speak about their story or or whatever and just to give my listener the background that they need to maybe dive into the more interesting or meatier questions but for that part if i see something yeah that i haven't seen before or that i know it's in the news a lot or that i realize is um kind of like yeah it just makes me curious like oh that could be a problem for them how are they going to solve that then you know i want to make sure to cover that on the show right and so um sometimes what i'll do is i'll create an outline where i just literally have topics like you know background uh problem they're trying to solve how are they gonna resolve this issue or how is regulation gonna affect it or you know what uh like i'm making these up but but like from reading you kind of see like oh these are all the things that could affect this issue that i should cover and then yeah then you just try to think what are the questions that will be the most interesting um and sometimes you know you you want multiple questions to cover that topic and sometimes you really just need the one and then you can move on so yeah i that's what i would say and oh and also sometimes what i'll do beforehand is i will reach out to different sources i'll be like hey i'm doing a shawn da da da like what do you think i should cover or like what do you think i should ask this person sometimes i even ask that on twitter like if it's somebody who i i feel like could get the audience very excited about the show then i'll be like hey i'm interviewing like vitalik buterin in a couple days what should i ask him or you know because but then also because then you get the people who who like spend more time on that person than you can because or that i can because i'm i'm trying to cover the whole crypto ecosystem right but then there are some people that they're like big eat heads and they spend all their time thinking about ethereum and so they're just gonna have like maybe a better question than i would right and so um yeah so solicit questions sometimes i go in different chat groups and i'll ask people like what do you think i should ask so and so or or i'll just read chat groups and i'll do searches for that word like what are people saying about you know this ico's issue with the regulator or what are people saying about that stable coin or you know whatever and i just kind of google around like what are people saying in the chat rooms you know what i mean because like um yeah because that's a little bit more um how do i put it like people don't know that they're being observed and this is what they're really thinking that kind of thing i love it now this is perfect it's almost like you're producing a movie that's the analogy of stuff like laughing because i had that bump in my moment in my head um quick watch follow-up question how do you conduct the service on your podcast services we use survey monkey which i'm just going to flat out tell you it's really expensive it's like i forget it it's close to 400 like every year when i have to renew that thing i'm like am i really paying this do a survey but um they have very good functionality and analytics so i'm just like but how do they get it like if i'm listening how would i get that link to that so yeah i promote it on the show and then they let you create a url that's like easy to remember so it'll be like surveymonkey slash you know unchained pod 2021 or something oh i see like i i can make up a url that's catchy so yeah and then i threw it in the show notes okay yeah thank you thanks jd alejandra you're up next tyler how are you hi good how do you choose um a good podcast title a good podcast episode title oh yeah yeah this is actually a really really really important step so here's the deal about podcast titles and and this this is something that comes from journalism too so if your uh headline or title or the subject line of your email or whatever it is isn't very good then all the work that you put into that show like not as many people are going to enjoy it right so so it's just kind of like like i remember right one time i was working at this publication and i really really really wanted this one subject letter subject line for the email newsletter which is how the vast majority of the audience got our content but for some reason one of the under less popular headlines was the one that was put on the subject line and i was so so so upset because there was like a really really good article in there and it was like nobody's gonna open this email and we like put so much effort into this article and you know and it just was like and it's a good article and i was like and it just was this feeling of like wow we put all this effort into this thing and it's just like a lot of it was wasted you know so yes it's very important so what i do is i actually use this online tool and um it's you can use it for free they they now suddenly in the last like week or two have a paid version of it i haven't done the upgrade because it's kind of expensive it's called something like coastschedule.com headline analyzer and it will literally give you a score for the headlines which i know sounds silly but um but through that yeah you can kind of see like oh these these headlines are just like maybe a little bit easier to grasp and even actually just from running your headlines through the test i feel like it just makes you it just helps you learn better like what works i do see that some other people because the other thing that you could do which i sometimes have done is i have a big guest and it's just like i know my audience is going to like want to hear that guest and i know they're going to be like excited if they see we discuss these different topics and so sometimes people just put like you know big headline name colon topic everybody's talking about like topic everybody's talking about you know that kind of thing i tend to do a little bit less of that now but those are kind of some of the the strategies i've seen if you do have a big name it's very very good to put that obviously in the headline and and definitely up front is is even better so you know big name colon blah blah blah um if i do that sometimes i'll put like a little quote of something kind of juicy that they said if it's short enough because you don't want to make the headline too long either if you make it too long then it you know gets cut off in google seo and you know whatever so you it needs to be like short but that's like another way and then um numbers can also do well like um i recently did a show about personal finance and crypto which i thought was super interesting and i i actually was excited because i used to cover personal finance i was like this is still in my wheelhouse and i kind of like was excited because i you know just felt like oh like i can ask all these questions about these things that i used to you know interview people about in the past and crypto which it was just fun but you know i'm well aware that the average person like per finance advice financial advisor like i'm not going to click on that so i um through in the headline that uh financial advisors control five trillion dollars of investor wealth because it's just like hey heads up listen you know pay attention this is a big topic like you know if we get this crowd on board into crypto then they could get a lot of money into crypto um and so you know things like like just think of things in that way um you know those guests their names would be recognizable to my audience so i didn't put their names you know i had just kind of like a catchy catchy headline that had that big numbers to to make people be like hey you know this it sounds important and interesting sometimes um if you have the space like i noticed that the new york times is doing this a lot where they have a headline that's like a two-part headline where um it starts with something and there's like a punch line so if you just go right on their homepage right now i bet you will see multiple examples of this like i can't really think of one off the top of my head but like you know maybe it poses a question and then the answer that they have is like something that you wouldn't expect or um you know i don't know if i've been able to do that on my show but you know i just noticed that for me it's effective that as a reader then you are times i'm like oh yeah i want to click on that you know um so yeah those are some of my tips and actually one last thing i'll say is um in terms of numbers i and i know this from like other work that i've done people love things like it like if you were doing a show that's kind of like tips for people people love the kind of thing where it's like the number one reason why blah blah or their number one tip to do da da da or or it can be the top 10 you know ways to blah blah blah whatever it is but like smaller numbers like that do can do well so yeah or the number like seven like people love the number seven okay thank you so much laura thank you so much alejandra and laura that was super helpful yeah you're up next i love what you said about number seven that's very interesting question on how i mean i'm sure you've interviewed a lot of people and how can you tell if someone is lying or not being genuine with their responses um are there things that if people are not journalists here how can you tell if someone's lying or not giving the most authentic answer that you want for your show that's interesting so i think it depends on what can i ask what kind of show you have oh sorry my my shows are about relationships but i'm just wondering if someone is like giving you a bs answer and you can't call them out that way and be rude but you want to push so you're literally just asking me for my show oh okay in general like i think people tend to say things and then it's not the right answer right away it's like a pr answer or a polite answer and you want to get the the good answer meet the answer okay so that guest that didn't want to continue on with the show that one time there was some there was like a technical aspect to what they were building and i asked them about it and they were describing it with this term that is kind of like a buzzword now in the tech world right like it's kind of like where the future of tech is going but then when i asked them to describe the mechanics of it it didn't set it didn't fit that description of what that technology is and so i was saying well how is that a blah blah blah hot buzzword thing because what you're describing is that's not it and um so i was just like kind of pointing it out factually that the description and the term that he was using to describe it were were not the same and so i think you can do that like you can kind of like stick to facts and just point out when something that they're saying is like a marketing buzzword that they've used but that the facts don't match that for other things i don't know if i've had people who've lied necessarily i have had instances where sometimes people are in a dispute and i ask them about it and then they say something about the other side i typically try to reach out to the other side and just get a response and like insert that into the show there is one time that i forgot to do that and then we had to do that later so obviously that was you know not my favorite moment of the of the podcast i i would say listen intently and in that moment when you feel um what it is that they're doing if you are listening closely enough then a question will naturally come to you that you can use to either call them out on it and ask them to be real with you or like if it's like i was saying a situation where you know the facts didn't support what he was saying then just point out hey the facts are x and what you're saying is why and you know they don't match yeah i think it really depends on what type of show you're doing actually um very helpful um okay talking to an another journalist and she was saying that sometimes people on twitter are in the digital world they're really good online but when you get them as a guest it's like you're trying to squeeze like a dry like i don't know a tea towel or something out of it and do you have anything that you do to warm them up because i know i hear people say like say more tell more if they're good on twitter but not good on the show so i so i like i said you know will google their name on youtube and other podcasts if i haven't heard them speak before but even if i find that in the other interviews i listen to that they're kind of like reticent or if i've done a pre-interview with them and i noticed that their way that they're that way i literally just write like way more questions so let's say that for a normal show i might have like one question for this one topic and that's enough to like launch somebody into the whole topic what i'll do is i'll write like five questions that are grouped together where it's like okay if they stop then i have a second one on that just approaches that from a different angle you know so it's like you know not only like how did you do da da but also why and when and who was involved and like you know just or whatever like i'm kind of making up like how how big was it how many da da da how you know who did this or that like like i'll literally just try to kind of like fill in what they might say and then make a question around it um but yeah the truth is it actually is better if you can just find guests who are good talkers here's the deal i'm sure everybody will already know this but um the people who work at the most important companies and have the most important positions they're going to be the most reticent but they're also going to be the the big fish names that you want to catch right so yeah just have like way more questions for them because you kind of know going in that they're going to be as tight-lipped as they can be well not all of them but it depends on what company they have and what their position is but many of them will be and so you know that just requires in a way even more research sometimes because sometimes then you'll want to be like very specific about like you know what you're asking them about like you might want to have numbers you might want to have like incidents of like hey when this happened can you tell me blah blah blah like you know if you want to have the big names then sometimes that's that's the best way to go i think it's really good and enlightening but the last question i have is that you ask you list a lot of questions and that's part of the curiosity that you're mentioning in the beginning of this session are there other people that you find have that same curiosity that you have like are there people that you look up to in terms of their curiosity that you've kind of emulated oh that i've emulated for my show yeah like other journalists or for example like i like looking at um amanpour because she does a documentary in relationships so her questions are fantastic for yourself do you look at other journalists or writers or okay so for writers for sure like literally for my book i took my favorite book and i analyzed it like i wrote in the margins how did this person do this and then i tried to like use some of that for my book for the podcast it's been a little bit different i would say that a journalist i really admire and who's whose show is similar to mine and yet i wouldn't say that i emulate her is kara swisher's show to i don't know if any of you listen to um rico decode even though i wouldn't say that i'm kind of modeling myself against her i learn a lot from listening to her it's just funny that i'm bringing this up because she's so different from me in her style like she states her opinions she has opinions that's that's like one big difference she has opinions and she states them um and then another thing is she interrupts her she will interrupt them a lot more than i do that's another thing for whatever reason i try to do that a little bit less but i do see that it's actually quite good the way she does it because she's like me and in that she she i think she also goes into the interview knowing what topic she wants to cover and she has a vision of like how this is going to go in her head so i can tell that sometimes what she'll do is she'll ask a question and then the person like basically answers it and she can see that they're just going gonna like wax on about it but but it's just like gonna be more of the same so she'll just cut them off and like move on to the next topic and a part of me is like oh i like i i kind of wish i could do a little bit more with that and and i do in a way but you know i feel like she's she's just like much faster oh another person who's very good at that is peter kafka who actually works for the same company he does a journalist it's like a media business show um but he does the same exact thing he cuts them off moves on to the next topic he's so here's the funny thing and i don't know how much sexism plays into this but if you look at the reviews on her show people constantly complain that cara interrupts her guests okay peter kafka literally does the same exact thing probably to the same amount and i checked out his reviews one time the only mention of interruption was somebody being like tara swisher should take a lesson from peter kaufman because she interrupts her guests way too much and peter doesn't i was like wait have you listened to their shows like they both do it but somehow the way peter does it is it like just seems smoother maybe but also i think the mavic air is a woman i don't know um uh the other person that i would say i probably model myself after a little bit even though again i don't so cara show i actually listen to you regularly uh terry gross i actually don't listen to that regularly but i've heard her talk about her method and when i heard her talk about i was like oh it's so similar to mine like she just kind of like reads voraciously and is like inhaling all this information and then just try to tries to be like okay how should this look and so when i heard her talking to how she repairs i was like oh that's so similar to what i do but yeah there you know there are other interviewers that i really like but we just have different kinds of shows so like for instance you know tim ferriss he's doing like tips and he wants her personal stories and he's like friendly with them and you know it's just a different kind of thing like i might unfortunately my show isn't like that i love his show but you know i'm not going to have that kind of relationship with the people that i interview so but yeah that's what i would say thank you so much that was so helpful awesome thanks via watch it i'm gonna toss it back over to you so so since you mentioned the uh sort of difference in reviews for um kara and peter i i think we remiss if we don't don't ask this which is like if you look at like both like crypto and podcasting um there's such uh like heavily like male dominated spaces as someone who's like operated in both areas and like really like risen to the top levels what can nascent uh podcasters from sort of like underrepresented backgrounds like learn from your experience oh gosh um that's a good question here's why i'm a little bit stumped from the outside but let me just get started talking i feel like the fact that i started having that platform at forbes already kind of meant that i already had like a little bit of a following like i already had people who are into my articles and so in that regard it was a little bit like they they already were interested in me for that reason and so um maybe the fact that i was a woman in in a field that's male dominated like mattered less because i'd already proven myself as a writer like i knew even back then that there were some people who already felt like i was the best journalist in the space and like actually i won an award now that i feel like i remember yeah within like nine months after i started covering this there was some kind of like blockchain journalist award or whatever and i remember i couldn't believe that i was even nominated because i was like i haven't even been covering this for a year and like there are these journalists who've been covering it for years and then i actually won and then i was like oh my god like whoa like people like my work and so again when you know later when i started the podcast then it it felt like they already knew that i did good stuff and so the fact that maybe some of them might have been surprised that i was a woman like that wasn't a factor anymore because i already kind of proven myself so for people maybe who don't start that way i i actually feel like it really just comes down to doing good work you know it's like chris let me put it this way the way that i proven myself with the articles forbes at that time had pictures of all the writers on the pages so even back then like they knew that i was a woman and that i was writing about it but despite you know maybe being a minority in that regard like you know it didn't matter they still because the work was good like they ended up following me and so honestly i would say have fun with what you're doing like follow your curiosity and then that will make your product good and that's really really so important like like even that question before about like who i admire remember i i said well i actually i don't even wan like i admire them but i don't want to watch them after them um so it's really just about like maybe having your own vision and having your own voice and just believing in yourself um and i feel like yeah that that's that's a huge part to making your show good yeah it's a calm of like being so good that they can't ignore you and just also being yourself exactly yeah awesome because you can tell if you're not being yourself awesome i think this would be this is the perfect place to end um thank you so much for just sort of like bringing such a different viewpoint to everything we've had so far um and then since we're publishing on both sides any last closing words from from your side no i guess you know i just hope that it's been helpful for all the podcast fellows and i'm really honored that you asked me to share my thoughts awesome yeah no it hasn't and thank you again so much for coming to odp um and with that uh thank you all thanks so much for
