operating officer of the Maker foundation welcome Stephen hi Laura thank you very much for having me today this is quite exciting this week maker Dow launched multi collateral die what is multi collateral die in short multicolor collateral die is digital cash that's it and what is so exciting about this launch is that multi collateral die really manifests the the total vision of what the protocol can actually do beforehand we had single collateral die and really what that meant was die that could be generated would be generated off of one collateral type but now as the name shows multi collateral die really expands the possibility to any collateral type that can be put into an ER C 24 and what are the benefits that the maker Dao system gets from having multiple collateral types so when we have a look at single collateral dial when you have to take a step back and have a look at it it becomes very interesting because you see primarily a stable coin being diet and that stable coin is generated from a single collateral type so in essence what this protocol was was creating was was really just a stable claim multi collateral die really brings the full spectrum of potential of the the protocol to the blockchain and what is that full spectrum well here's the interesting part about it dye is a stable claim really is a byproduct what is really important to understand about the maker protocol is that it is two tenets of an economic engine that being collateralization and credit generation so what multi collateral the multi collateral element brings is the ability to collateralize with anything that you can possibly turn into an EOC to any token but also more importantly you have recourse to in terms of caning against it so what it brings to the system is the full view of creating this economic engine that facilitates this blockchain economy they could possibly start augmenting with C with the traditional analog world that's really the potential that's been released right now and at the moment the system just takes one additional token as collateral which is Braves bat token and I noticed as of Wednesday afternoon only about 3% of dye had been created from bat how does make our doubt decide which new collateral types to add is part of it based on demand or weight like why was that the first selection so this is really interesting it comes down to governance and how governance works and what that really showcased was how governance brought a collateral type into the system the potential for you no further collateral types is really in the hands of maker governance and there is a long list that the folks are considering but essentially what has happened is a list was compiled and curated by the community by maker governance and by the internal risk team the discussion was had over a number of weeks if not a number of months once that list was was curated and put into a voter bill form then everybody ranked the the list and the the top token that was selected was was bad so consequently bad was then put into a governance protocol a governance proposal which is just yet another step in the the governance process which allows you to reduce contention and focus on what you really want to include in the system and when it passed the governance proposal it was included into into the system with the deployment of multi collateral die so that isn't just the one collateral type that was considered it was really the showcase of how any collateral type could be considered and brought into the system one other piece I want to dive into is how you make a transition like this a single collateral tie is has been the system for years now and obviously I mean you guys reached a big milestone I think there was like a hundred million dollars worth of ether locked up in single collateral dies so how do you move everybody over to this new system so that's actually the exciting point as well because releasing multi collateral dime brought really two new features the first one as I mentioned beforehand is the introduction of multi multiple collateral types the second part is something called the DSO the Daiya savings rate and this new feature is pretty much an important point to consider with respect to the migration in single collateral die you could generate your die and obviously use it as digital cash likewise folks in the community folks in the the ecosystem could purchase die and use it for transactional purposes but in order to be able to you know earn something on your diet you would necessarily have to go to the secondary lending platforms and stick it with them and they in turn would you know create a return for yourself with multi collateral diet the dice the diet savings rate allows you to take your die and simply stick it into a smart contract and which is absolutely amazing because you get paid for doing that but what is really interesting is that your die goes into the smart contract but doesn't get used so you don't have a central party conjurus a central party or counterparty risk or credit risk so what you've effectively done is just put your die into a system and you've got effectively paid for it so there's a lot of demand with respect to that so that's one reason you can see folks migrating from a single collector by it's a multilateral time the other reason you want to to move a costume a multilateral die is obviously because the ecosystem is going to become a lot more robust and a lot more scaled that's what the multi collateral component really brings to the system as well it allows you to scale the system and by including collateral types that are uncorrelated with each other you bring a robustness into the system that keeps the stability of the the dice table claim in check so there are very specific incentives DSR being one of them there's also a difference in stability fees so you'll find that the stability P is a lot lower with the multi collateral not a lot or but one percent lower with multilateral die and there's a dire savings rate so there's two economic incentives to migrate across but in terms of the structural features of multi collateral die the increased robustness and stability is another reason to my question multikill actual day well one thing I wanted to ask about the dye savings rate is so it is it's 2 percent now and I get that that's more than you would get from creating a sigh but what a lot of people are doing is putting cyan things like in compound or dy/dx and both of them are offering interest rates of over 5% and I saw like Camilla Russo in her newsletter the Defiant pointed out you know for a lot of those people they don't really have an incentive to switch which I agree with so you know I I see you know the comparison that you're making but within the larger ecosystem it doesn't feel like there would be an incentive well from that standpoint you need to take a bit of a step back and say well strictly speaking what is the diet savings rate and how is it comparable to what you see on the secondary lending platforms and this is where it really becomes incredibly interesting and very innovative so the dive savings rate as I mentioned to you you put your dye into a smart contract so that dye belongs to you that smart contract belongs to you and your diet does not get used so what you've got is this new interpretation of a risk-free rate your diet does not get used it doesn't get re hypothecated out and get loaned out there isn't credit generated on the back of the diet that you put into the system you literally lock up your your dye into a smart contract and you get paid for that now what's interesting as I just mentioned it redefines the idea of what a risk-free rate is what you're looking at is in a secondary lending platform your risk is the counterparty your risk is the organization that is effectively using your your asset to provide loans so you have counterparty risk you've got credit risk that you have to consider and you need to be compensated for that there's a premium that is required when you have a look at the DSR the risk-free rate I kind of like to now term it as the trust free rate because that rate is not dependent on us on a central party or a counterparty it's dependent on the decentralized protocol so what you're really doing is you getting paid by relying on a decentralized protocol as opposed to a central counterparty okay yeah so I see it is in a way a more abstract argument but obviously in this ecosystem these ideological or philosophical arguments do carry a lot of sway with certain people all right so we're going to discuss more about how the system made a transition like this in a moment but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto comms he's a future of crypto currency and every wallet have you seen the MCO Visa card a metal card powered by crypto loaded with perks including up to five prism back on all you're spending an unlimited airport lounge access they pay for your spotify and netflix too what's not to love with crypto com not only can you spend your crypto but you can grow it to earn up to six percent per year on the most popular coins like BTC XRP LTC and up to twelve percent per year on stable coins like packs or TUSD just a few taps before you start receiving interest every week join the over 1 million others in download the crypto comm app today will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations cipher trace is working on this vision of the future sign up to stay up date on the privacy enhanced compliance initiative and receive authoritative crypto AML reports quarterly WWF retraced comm slash keep crypto clean back to my conversation with Stephen Becker so um one thing that I also want to ask about was just because the maker DOE system is Adaro meaning that it's supposedly decentralized for you guys to you know essentially create this new system how do you kind of make the transition happen in a way where it is actually still somehow decentralized even though there were you know certain identical identifiable players who were creating this new system so the one interesting component of the space that I have found and I come from the traditional finance background the value that's been created in this decentralized world actually is at the intersection of you know centralization and decentralization if you think for a moment about Bitcoin and ether where does it get majority of its value from well it gets majority of its value from exchanges through price discovery and which are the main exchanges that bring up the the bring about the price discovery while there's a centralized exchanges so there's an irony in there that the true value of the system is really where the analog world meets the blockchain world and that really is also the underpinnings of what I think will generate a new sort of economic regime where you'll find the traditional world does sailing with the blockchain world so ideally what you what you're looking for is a clear use of governance that doesn't fall into the old buckets that everyone is used to so when folks think about governance they always think about representative democracy and then when they think about represented democracy they start thinking about well how can you influence it and then more from there you get to photography get to gerrymandering and whatnots where when you have a look at a dhow the thing that you gotta really focus on is well what are you deciding on what is governance focusing on now if you make it as broad as possible and say well governance can decide on pretty much anything that would like well you might find that there is a possible edge case with plutocracy that large whale comes in and says I would like to turn to make a protocol into an ice cream factory well if there had enough influence they could possibly make it happen but what makes the make a protocol so unique is that that governance is constrained within something we call scientific governance so you as an MPR holder gets you decide on specific parameters within the confines of scientific governance you don't get to decide on changing the maker protocol to an ice cream factory you only get to decide on the stability fee the debt ceiling the liquidation ratio these parameters that can use best practices and best models to figure out what those numbers should be so if you as a whale came along and you decided that the stability fee should quadruple and the community can see that there is no basis for that rationale it can be argued that that is an incorrect action to take and if the whale is insistent and decides that they need to move forward with this and I'd like to influence it against the better judgements or scientific governance they will be up against the community with the ability to initiate something called emergency shut down and if there is emergency shut down it is a recognition that someone even a large whale is attempting to you know sway the vote to their benefits and if that's the case there's a potential that that whale could actually lose their their MKR and that is what keeps it balanced and one other thing I was wondering is what will happen to sy going forward like how you know presumably the goal is to kind of close down that system but as we already mentioned people may not have incentives to move off of it just yet so how are you gonna get people to move off and what is the goal you know what is your ultimate goal of what to do what sigh well you know keep in mind that this protocol is decentralized so it you know from the Foundation's point of view we together with the community have a look at how the migration is is going and if we find that the migration is too slow if psy is not moving across then they're going to be obviously levers that you can use to keep to get the incentive going now as you pointed out folks on the secondary landing platform you know they may not look at my my ideological stance and say oh that makes a lot of sense you know therefore I'm going to stop winning 5 percent they're going to look at and say well that's five percent I'm earning it two percent doesn't appeal to me no thank you but what really is important here is that governance and the community and stakeholders can come together and say well we should then push the dsr up to five percent we maybe should bring the stability fee down considerably there are a lot of levers in place that will create the economic incentives for folks to move across the interesting aspect about economic incentives is that there's always the sense that folks just look at the the superficial numbers and that is effectively what's sufficient to them I think there are a lot of folks out there that are sufficiently they're proficient enough to understand that if you earn a high interest rate from a specific organization and you see a lower interest rate offered somewhere else you should be able to reconcile the differences understand why you are getting that extra premium so from this point of view it's really a case of saying well you can use those leaders to adjust where necessary so the superficial some economic incentives I am played to move folks across but ideally I think a lot of folks will rely on the stability and robustness of the the new protocol and migrate across so what happens to Desai well the two systems remain in place until a critical mass of Sighs migrated across what is that critical mass well that again is up to NPR governance which is a decentralized protocol but once there's critical mass that's been that's been brought across then what which remains could be there could be eight a nice sort of marketing campaign to say okay there's only a few folks left please migrate across and at one point governance will come up and say that's enough for us we're going to institute shutdown on single collateral die and folks that have size will end up with Ethan their wallets so that is in general the process that we got that the protocol is going to follow the timeframe again is up to to make a governance this could be in the next month well this could be something that you know stays running for the next six to six months to a year it really is dependent on governance and how the migration is going and you mentioned earlier that collateral types can be a de Arce 20 token but and and of course so far you guys are considering other crypto assets but do you foresee a day when maker Dow adds non crypto collateral types so the quick answer is yes because scaling is incredibly important and at the same time diversification is incredibly important so yes but this is my my data point make a governance also needs to you know confer on that and come up with what they want but essentially what we what we see now are crypto assets that could be potentially used as collateral types which is great but what are we doing in the protocol we rely on recourse for those collateral types and that recourse is price discovery in secondary markets so that means you need to look at this crypt assets and you need to decide two things one how liquid others acid two how curly-q's are those assets and I think everybody is aware of the fact that really the majority of crypto assets are quite correlated so there is a little bit of a diversification benefit to be had in including a lot of crypto assets but in order to scale the system and really get the benefit of diversification one would need to have a look at tokenized real-world assets and bring those onto the protocol as collateral I think that's just a stepping stone though I think you'll find that a lot of the tokenized know initially tokenize real-world assets will start seeing the benefit of putting operations and processes on chain and they will see the benefit of the transparency the value in the transparency that it provides they'll also see the the ability of realizing liquidity premium through exchanges by not only tokenizing their real-world assets but also bringing the operations on chain so I do see a world where the protocol starts accepting a tokenized real-world assets but only really as a step to showcase the analog world how blockchain can dovetail with it and start bringing full processing operations on chain and when that happens then I am of the opinion you'll see folks start issuing you know debts and equity on chain and really transfer a sort of transform their risk profiles of those particular instruments from a centralized to decentralized form and thereby realizing a lotta value so again the answer yes I see it coming but I also think this is just an intermediate step to the full transition of the analog world dovetailing with the blockchain world yeah yeah I mean I I do see the potential there but already even just this initial milestone you guys have reached is pretty exciting so we will see how all of these plans play out thanks so much for coming undone confirmed thank you very much appreciate being here don't forget next up is the news recap stick around

quick note before we begin which is that there appears to be some kind of intermittent construction going on in my building so if you hear some noise I apologize in advance first headline aetherium and VT ratio low currently enjoying diverse token activity coin Metris coin metrics released an in-depth analysis of key stats on the etherium blockchain showing that that network value - token value ratio or envy tv ratio is quite low at 1.9 hovering near the all-time low of 1.5 7 on April 1st the firm says token valuations on aetherium have been gaining relative to the value of ether with most of this growth fueled by stable coins and most of the stable coin increase driven by tether plus transactions in the tokens on aetherium have now surpassed transactions in ether itself on top of that ER c720 ones this is the non fungible tokens have also increased their activity surging past the numbers hit during the crypto Kitty's paise pit craze and even surpassing transactions in ERC 20s and ether almost all of this activity in the non fungible x' is due to the card game gods unchained if you listen to the recent episode of unconfirmed with them then you know that they saw a spike after Blizzard Entertainment's punishment of a winner who made a statement supporting the protesters in Hong Kong so all these indicators weren't enough to show that aetherium is doing pretty well nowadays coin metrics also points out that aetherium contract halls have hit an all-time high likely pushed over by the current enthusiasm for God's Unchained next headline Federal Reserve weighs pros and cons of a central bank digital currency this isn't brand new news however what is new is that Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell wrote a letter in response to a a message that he received from representatives French Hill and Bill Foster in September in his letter he details how the Fed is currently weighing thoroughly weighing all the costs and benefits of a u.s. CBBC including impacts on commercial banking implications for privacy and surveillance risk of cyber attacks etc he wrote quote in analyzing the potential costs and benefits of general purpose CB DC we are carefully monitoring the activities of other central banks to identify potential benefits that may be relevant in the u.s. context to date our observation is that many of the challenges they hope to address do not apply to the u.s. context including dis use of physical cash narrow reaching or highly concentrated banking sectors or poorly developed payment infrastructure more generally next headline developers spar over how private nimble Wimble is dragonfly a capital capital published what seemed to be a pretty devastating post on the weaknesses in member women's privacy with Ivan Bogut E claiming that he was able to unmask 96% of transactions this has big implications for grin beam and Tory and others that have begun to use the nimble Wimble protocol grin published a rebuttal and in an article the block quotes both sides saying that grin is closer to Bitcoin than other privacy coins and concludes that the two sides are actually closer than they appear next headline finances Shanghai office reportedly closed after police raid the blog reports that finances Shanghai office has been closed after a police raid which has forced employees to either work remotely or to relocate to Singapore finance however denies the report next door in case you missed it the big bitcoin heist in iceland Vanity Fair had a rollicking feature on the theft of 225 Bitcoin miners in Iceland and the story is replete with characters like the mysterious and potentially non-existent mastermind mr. X the drug smuggler javi the pink and a henchman named Victor the Cutie Jonathan who eventually had a tattoo artist testified that he'd spent the night of the theft with her as an alibi it even features an escape from prison and cute Icelandic details like people just believing that something had been stolen finally fun bits loans Heather whale who pumped Bitcoin found to be Barak Pierce another coin Jazeera gem begins quote our reporters watched closely as Brock Pierce meticulously cloned combed over the University of Texas teather report line by line his face concentrated as he chewed his fingernails nervously he was focused on one thing and one thing alone making sure he got away with it after what felt like an eternity the hippy king of currency closed his laptop lid and breathed a sigh of relief they don't know it was me all at once the room erupted in celebration as streamers popped confetti rain from the sky and chants broke out Viva Puerto Rico Viva LeBrock mr. Pierce had just escaped being exposed as the sole whale responsible for the biggest financial pump in human history alright that's it for this week's news to learn more about stephen and the maker now transition to multi collateral time as well as to read about the stories from this week's news recap be sure to check out the links in the show notes of your podcast player if you enjoyed this episode please give us a top rating a review on Apple podcast that helps other listeners find out about the show I'm confirm is produced by me Laura Shen without from Proctor recording Anthony noon Daniel Ness Joss Durham and the team at CLK transcription thanks for listening you [Music]
