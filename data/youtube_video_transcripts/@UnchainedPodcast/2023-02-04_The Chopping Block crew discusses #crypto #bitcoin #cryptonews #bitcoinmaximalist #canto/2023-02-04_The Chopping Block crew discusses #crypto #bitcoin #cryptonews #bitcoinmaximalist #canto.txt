look I I do I do respect having some governance level Innovation I think that's something that has been underexplored but I just think like all these ideas are not where it's at um like I I don't want to go on too much of a rant about the the last piece which is the uh the uh as you were mentioning the sort of the tokens all being under Kanto as opposed to having their own kind of native applications but to me it's just sort of the the blockchain playing favorites and deciding that these applications are enshrined in the blockchain they're sort of nationalized quote unquote it's kind of like this blockchain level industrial policy and which implies that it's like okay we're done we're done with dexes we found the right one it's this and nobody better try out innovating us because we're going to support this at the protocol level same thing with the lending protocols right if anybody comes up with any more Innovation around lending protocols you we already figured it out we know this is the one that we want and you know what else is there to do like we already have the end result
