Liu CEO of dapper labs the company behind crypto kitties and Benny yang Deborah labs head of Asia welcome row home and Benny thank you Laura thanks for having us thanks Laura row home let's start with you your original company axiom Zen which is the company that started crypto cookies has been around since before the crypto craze what does axiom Zen do accents aventuras to do so I started the company about six years ago with my brother and the focus was building companies based on emerging technology and and really we realized that when when the platform shifts happen when new technology comes around developers designers sort of individual a small group of folks working at a start-up have a very outsized impact on shaping the perception of that technology and on impacting societies basically acceptance of it and curve bikinis is a perfect example with blockchain so in the past six years we've built for different companies to venture funded to profitable and most kind of circling around the the new platform shifts that have been going on so AI machine learning and not watching well I really like the insight that you mentioned about how a small group of people will shape these emerging technologies I hadn't thought of it that way before Bennie how did the company get into the crypto space yeah so it's being as Rahab said it's been very interesting journey I think that we started off with the money 2020 hackathon and some of the team members were kind of dabbling in that area of at least digital virtual currency and not only that as Brian would probably mentioned our CTO dieter he kind of mind Bitcoin very early on and he's been a big fan of this space for a long time so all of us kind of started getting very very interested in the cryptocurrency space especially around the cerium and around smart contracts really and so that's kind of spurred our interest into actually experimenting with smart contracts and crypto Kitty's was one of those experiments and how did you come up with the idea for crypto Kitty's so being from axioms n it's a venture studio so we kind of we had this place called the jungle and in the jungle we actually had a lot of plants in there and Mac who is our chief creative officer and dealer was in there and Fabian or smart contract developer and a few of other developers and designers were in this jungle and the premise of the jungle was to pump out experiments on a weekly basis some of it could be a our experiments with the new AR kit and some of it was you know the early genetic simulations of crypto cadiz but I think the origins of the idea kind of came from our interest in crypto collectibles we saw kind of the early stages of the spells of Genesis the rare peppe's and the crypto punks and we're really inspired by it because I think it was one of the first projects that were putting art onto the blockchain and it was talking about is creating a around collectibles and what does it mean to have scarcity and collectibles on the blockchain and for us we kind of like you know cats kind of are the Internet of the the memes of the Internet and they're the logos of many Internet companies and so we kind of asked herself a silly question really why couldn't we could put cats onto the blockchain and so that's kind of the origination of the idea so obviously crypto Kitty's has been pretty popular it's even entered mainstream consciousness which not a lot of crypto projects can it claim so for listeners you don't know why don't you guys tell us what crypto cadiz is how it works what people can do with it just in case there are any people out there who are still unaware yeah so cryptic case is the world's first in the world's biggest blockchain game essentially it's breathable adorable digital cats that are on the blockchain and the way that people play with this game is they could adopt cats that are available on the web and soon very soon actually on mobile and they could sell these cats in the marketplace or the really cool thing is these cats have genetics so just like humans they have dominant and recessive traits and if you can have to think about it in a way where maybe your grandparents in this funny situation where they have purple hair I don't know and when you have your son or your daughter or your grandson that the purple hair kind of emerges and in a similar way these cats have genetics in them and dominant and recessive traits and when you bring them together in the right combinations and new genes emerge and really cool thing about this game is that when you get the right genetic combination you get to unlock newer and and really cool cats that we call fancy cats so kind of that's the premise of the crypto kitties and what is a fancy cat it just means like a kind of higher priced cat because it has more unique and rare features yeah fancy cats is a unique image so for example fortune cat or the vamp Dracula cat is a fancy cat and they look different from these other cats that have maybe purple spots and yellow fur and essentially it's a genetic combination or a genetic puzzle that combines to create a fancy cat and the cool thing about fancy cats is that there is a scarcity their scarcity with them so some of them have you know the maximum amount that it could be issued from the smart contract is 80 88 of them and there couldn't be any more and so fancy cats are just as that they are much more fancier and it's a very priced collectible to have in any kind of cryptic tivities player so basically users can essentially break towards cats that of their own design and and one user put it really well if they said we buy the paint from you guys and then we make the art and these are these are cats that sort of like Benny was saying stack different genetic traits and you can you can basically design and breed towards a a kitty of the appearance you want but the color you want the features you want so on and so forth and then through the throughout the genome there are these hidden limited edition custom art cats that where we created the art for them and they're they're all limited edition sort of on the on the blockchain as Benny was saying and so that's the folks can breed towards them and discover them what's really cool though is you know the the the because the breeding game is is reasonably complex we've had a whole series of tools and products built on top of crypto keys so the first series of tools were things like kitty calc and and spreadsheets and sort of breeding predictors and tools to help users decide how best to breed towards the cat they want and there was a second series of tools that are around accessorizing your cat you can buy hats for your kitties you can buy art from Dada NYC and give it to your kitties and but but now you have a whole series of more kind of casual play games that are being developed folks like kitty races Kitty battles card collectible card games you have therefore cats you can pull your cat and give it a personality and sort of treat it as a social avatar and that's that's sort of the rich ecosystem that's coming around the kitties as assets and so you no longer have to you know play one game you can actually hold on to your cat and and play the kinds of games that you want to play almost like a sort of the cat being a entry ticket into a theme park and and the rides being owned and operated by different entrepreneurs building on top of you know this open permissionless sort of API interface that's that's essentially our smart contracts so I wouldn't understand these other games but before we go into that I actually also want to understand so people are trying to breed the kind of cats that they want but that probably costs money right I you know obviously know that a lot of people have been making money from cryptic kitties like Benny and a previous conversation mentioned to me that there's somebody who makes a living from cryptic kitties I read another one of your team members mentioning that somebody made a million dollars trading crypto kitties so how do people make money with crypto kitties essentially because crypto kitties is a decentralized game we've we've decentralized aspects of running the economy so so there are folks that come in breed towards the cats they want but there are others that come in and just buy the cats that they want and and the way that the folks that are making a lot of money they're kind of predicting what are the highest value traits so when a new trait emerges they they buy the generation zero cat they breed some they breed towards the sort of higher level traits and then they put those back on the marketplace so that the kind of the collector archetype comes in and finds the cast they want and purchases them rather than doing the work of breeding towards them well it's like flipping a house I guess so yeah building flipping or okay so then so then I want to know more about these other games that you mentioned like kitty Cal and the spreadsheets and the racing and the hats what are just maybe give me a fuller description of what some of these how some of these work sure so I mean I think taking a step back one thing that we when when building crypto kitties were sort of trying to bake in all of the values that we saw in decentralization and and trying to think what is native about blockchain so how does a game look like on the blockchain of course one of the decisions we made that was maybe controversial was we put all of our game mechanics into smart contracts such that you know all of the breeding happens on chain the cats are born on chain and that's actually what led to a lot of the congestion on the theorem network but we wanted to do that because we said well this the transparency and the immutability what it really means to consumers is fairness and and the fact that you know they know their cats are never going to be taken away from them and the rules are never going to change what we what we did kind of we consciously realized at the time but didn't realize how big of an impact they would have how quickly was that all of those same values apply to developers as well as in platform risk is one of the most insidious killers of startups in the past few decades as you know the platforms have gotten more and more powerful and and by kind of putting our smart contracts out in the open we basically removed platform risk from everyone that's building on top of them so if you build a racing game that uses our genetics as a component and it's game design you know that we can't change those and so you're building on solid ground and so there's a lot of the whether it's the calculators the accessory ization games or the actual sort of full of gameplay stuff the reason that they're building on top of this platform or rather these assets as a platform is they know that no matter what happens in fact if we go away that's probably a bigger opportunity for them than if we stick around so they're they're tapping into our community and and that gives that basically gives more value to other individual consumers so the games that are being developed are really early right now and what we're doing through we've essentially created this program called the key diverse and what we're doing is we're bringing all these folks putting them in a disc or channel and and starting to both provide mentorship connect them to our game designers our tech our engineers and help them build sort of build their games into full-scale experiences so you have several collectible card games where people each each of their cats sort of give them different strengths and defense and all these things and so people collect cats almost like a card deck you have racing games that are more like you know you you you take your care you take your racing it it's genetics are essentially a factor and how well it does but then there are also games where the cat is learning new things by going from one smart ground track to another almost like going to racing school or going to two dojo school and kind of packing on skills and then coming back to to the main main spar contract so there's there's basically anything you can imagine one of my favorites is a as a project the less users import their cats and then essentially make the make sort of a Facebook profile but with the cat instead of themselves and and give it a personality and start talking to other users cats and and it's you know it's it is a small group of people I don't want to you know over overstate it but that's what we care about you know we care about the group of folks that are in there not to you know speculate or you know buy and flip and make a lot of money but to sort of play the game and if they need to you know did the cool thing about watching games you can play it and you can actually you can make money but but we want folks that are crazy about the kitties so we've had you know folks get tattoos of cats we've had folks make carvings and custom dolls and sell them on reddit and in our discord we have folks that are making kind of fan art a little kids are drawing things drawing pictures of their parents cats and and and folks are posting them to Twitter so that's the kind of community that we've we've been trying to build over the last few months as everything else in the crypto space is sort of both crashing and burning and maybe sort of trying to look for the next quick fix and that's what we're excited about I don't know if I'd call it crashing for an IV guess I would say cooling off but I love what you just described I honestly so many ideas popped into my head as you were speaking what you were describing about the breeding and the racing I was reminded of my favorite book Seabiscuit which everybody should read if you haven't read it it's by I think the world's best writer Laura Hillenbrand she's just a master but obviously in that book it's about this popular racehorse in the 1930s and how it was so popular that it generated more headlines then literally Franklin Delano Roosevelt or Hitler like anybody else and it was in the year in 1938 by you know obviously people were really into horse racing and when you were describing the cat races I was like oh if people really get into the genetics of this the way that they did with the horses and still do today then you could end up with a little betting culture around the cats and just from what you described all see what just felt like people were sort of using them as avatars and I know that worlds like Second Life have really taken off so I could see just a ton of different ways that this could become a different thing in many different directions so I found it really interesting I do know that before you launched you had a goal of creating a consumer friendly blockchain app what so what were your expectations for crypto kitties before you went live like do you remember did you expect it to take off or were you kind of thinking like oh this is me but we're not sure if it'll gain traction what were your thoughts right before you launched it I still remember before we launched one of the things that we created was this spreadsheet and we pass it around where we would kind of estimate you know okay by month 3 by month 6 by month 9 how many expected users would we be hoping to reach and you know I would say that we never expected we never fully expected that the entire world would be so fascinated by cats onto the blockchain so that was kind of like in the early days of we were speculative and kind of figuring out where how big can this grow how big can this experiment grow do you remember what you were projecting and what the actual numbers ended up being yeah I don't think we've looked at that spreadsheet since we've started I think it within a week or less the numbers went way past like the the six-month goal so I but we were quite conservative they some team members were and then some we're quite aggressive so you didn't expect it to take off not as wild as it did okay and so what were those initial days like how did you feel at the time and what do you remember happening where you were just like oh my god I can't believe this when we started out with crypto kitties we certainly our ambitions were were more about demonstrating the possibilities but by the time Benny and and the rest of the team got back from Earth Waterloo we knew we were sitting on something that was that was very very interesting I mean our entire office was completely addicted the eath waterloo test went really well there was really no UI to the game but everybody was just having fun with with with with mechanic itself which which which tells you tells you you're sitting on something something valuable but at that time you know we expected average cat prices to be to be I guess it's sort of a multiple of how much it costs to create the cats in the sense it's the values being being baked in but you know gas fees were cents for for breeding cats and transferring them was was super cheap super quick but very quickly after launch we we and stilted a state it the game has become much more expensive and so I would say you know we knew we had something that was that was exciting and interesting we we didn't anticipate the level of speculation that would enter the market you know December January of last year but but it was it was clear that the but by October is clear we had something cool on our hats and Benny just I want to hear your response like you know what were those first few days like and it was at the time when your title was fortune cat yeah I mean so there is Ron outline there's different timelines right there's this timeline where cryptic kitties was in the jungle and the incubation period there was a lot of genetic simulation that was being run that allowed us to get to the 256-bit genome that allows for an upper limit of 4 billion variations in the genetics and so that was the time period before we went and shipped in alpha version for etherium F Waterloo which is one of the world's first we fear in pakistan's and as Rohan alluded to at the hackathon it caught on fire we I remember that we bought a bunch of pokemon cards and slapped on cryptic UT stickers on the back of it and we did a lot of guerrilla marketing there and that was the first time we actually met batalik in person and we made a custom t-shirt for him that was a cat with a unicorn we knew that he kind of liked this style he has this question of t-shirts and so that was kind of her one of her first exposures to some of the projects that are very well known now like such as been a mask in parody and a lot of projects now that are grown in a very big way and so at the hackathon yes there was a lot of people who started playing with it people actually kind of stopped it was a hackathon right so that people actually stopped hacking to play crypto kitties and they just came to our table to kind of like ask questions about hey like how does this work how do you breathe and that's I actually brought up a very interesting perspective we had a lot of people who are and are in this hackathon to learn and they haven't actually interacted with the blockchain at all they haven't signed a transaction they haven't adjusted the GRA for gas they don't even know what gas is and throughout the whole hackathon we were sitting there basically educating quite a lot of people about here this is how you sign the transaction here's how we work of course all of this was on test net and so when we came back from that we already had a few thousand people who you know spread to the community who had signed up for the actual launch and we knew at that point that we we had a really strong following and a lot of people were interested in what we were going to do next and so when you did launch like what was that like and do you remember what some of your kind of crazy oh my god I can't believe this is happening moments where so when we launched I remember that we had this timeline of launching before Thanksgiving American Thanksgiving because we thought that people are still at work and that they would have they would see the email and would be willing to kind of play cryptokeys or test it out and what had happened is that at that same time we were doing smart contract audit and Nick Johnson and a few others from the etherium foundation found a very serious bug of which we decided to delay the entire launch for a few days to fix this bug and I think that was probably one of the best decisions we've made as a team as a company as a whole and we actually then lost it on American Thanksgiving that's when we sent out the email to the community that we gathered from efj Waterloo and that kind of worked in our favor in a very very odd way because everybody went home to their families and I didn't think that they would go home and talk about Bitcoin in an ether aetherium and the third topic I think at the dinner time was crypto kitties because they received an email and they started to teach their moms and dads the uncles and aunts while they're all home and having Turkey so that kind of became the the central topic around the initial launch and then it just started picking up steam slowly but slowly and not only that we we had June from quartz and now it's back at coin who kind of we've been talking for a while and I remember that when when I was contacting you Laura I was telling you about we're putting castle above Jay it's super exciting and you were just like I don't know about this I think a lot of it no I was busy I had something I had a huge project I was working on I couldn't I I couldn't even look into I had like no time okay well that's fair that's fair that's fair and so essentially yeah we we were able to get into the courts and into TechCrunch and a lot of people then started getting very interested in and you know what is crypto kitties I also think that it's like an overall sentiment in the community there were kind of three overarching headlines that were consuming the crypto space and this is these headlines also kind of flooded into the tech space as well it was the price of Bitcoin it was the the hacks and scams they're happening and then the ICS right there's just so many Isis that were happening yeah I think a lot of people kind of felt that they wanted to see a tangible product they wanted to see a team ship something that they could interact with and not do an IC o---- which you know of course we didn't do an IC o---- we just ship the product as we deal with any of the startups that we build in here and we focused a lot on user experience so we have probably one of the best teams to build the best user experiences both in the enterprise world but in the b2b world and even on the consumer side so we we have the best team centered around it to build crypto cookies and make it super polished and easy to play with and that flow included kind of like the the flow that is really well known now in the industry which is coin coin base to crypto CDs to meta mask and then that's how you play a html5 blockchain game and now all of the blocking games are using that flow it kind of established a standard but as Rohan's alluded to that flow is not good enough it's still kind of like a 10-step process and it really leaks a ton of users every single states so it's not very ideal it was ideal eight months ago when we launched but it's not ideal anymore if we want to grow as an industry and to bring on onboard more consumers to the blockchain yeah I agree we're gonna turn back to this question about user experience but before we do this little ad break I actually want to ask you guys a couple of really quick questions so at this point how many users have sign up for crypto kiddies or how many people own a cat I believe there are 68 thousand people that own the cat Ben you may have more updated numbers than that okay and are they who are they demographically like my age and gender and geography like where are they located are they mostly Americans or it's mostly North America and we we don't collect tons of we don't collect much demographic information on our users somewhat for obvious reasons but the the what anecdotally to my a lot a lot of the players are actually crypto curious folks that were introduced so some of my favorite stories are folks like as folks that say hey listen I've been crazy about crypto but my boyfriend never got it and now he has a series of cats or my girlfriend never got it and and and now she's into it and she understands why it's important so a lot of our current users are folks that identify more as gamers and it's crypto people I think that it's still mostly males but but a much higher percentage of female players than they encrypt or more generally and but mostly in North America and I think that's a missed opportunity for us in the sense that there's there's when we go to Asia and when we talk to folks that know about us they go crazy but they're not enough people that know about us and that's one reason Bennie's and Shanghai and and and one reason we partnered up with HTC and we're going to you know the next few months are all about sort of you know we've spent the last few months preparing for scale making it easier for folks to understand the game get into crypto and and the next few months are going to be about expanding the doors expanding the markets and and trying to get to Krypto curious folks because it's still incredibly hard to onboard into this world by yourself so almost always you need someone to to help but you know our interest is is the is the folks that have been left out by the conversation over the last few years that's all about investment all about risk taking about sort of you know Hotaling and and and and a very kind of financial first approach to what really is a conversation about you know freedom and and and sovereignty over your own data and and and kind of being having a relationship of respect with the businesses that you that you work with and being treated fairly and and and transparently so that we're trying to change the conversation we're trying to change the low calorie and and with that it's a change in demographics but at the same time you know this the core are crypto enthusiasts and and that's the those are the folks we need to be working with to expand the movement and and and bring others into the fold I love how you took a philosophical turn there because that's the turn that we will also take after the ad break I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsors imagine this you dedicate countless hours of hard work to creating a smart contract only to be hacked in mere minutes if you think that can't happen think again we hear that ten billion dollars has been raised through smart contracts but over three hundred million of that has already been compromised hackers are hungry for more so security is not

roham Geragos Liu and Benny yang of crypto kitty's before we started recording I was checking out a transaction volume in crypto kitties and at least recently it's only there was a 24-hour period where it had only about 300 users the transactions totaled less than $9,000 in 24 hours I also looked at the site crypto Kitty sales and saw that all the most expensive cats had been sold in the first couple of weeks with like nearly all of those sales occurring literally in the first two weeks after the game launched so do you ever picture kitties trading for such high prices again how do you plan to kind of like grow traction again and you know keep this going yeah I think that's a great question and so so for one thing the three some users are those are unique users that have been hitting the smart contract so that's not obviously folks that was visit the website do things that are off chain in Iraq with other key diverse experiences you know drink coffee out are there crypto kitties mugs so on and so forth so that's that's one piece of it the other piece of it is I would say the the entire sort of decentralized app and game market has followed the same downtrend and activity in the in the crypto world so you know that 300 users is still by far the most active community in terms of transaction volume in terms of even even dollar spent so there there's and but but really the most important fact is we have we're actually happy that the players that are playing the game are not focused on speculation in fact you know we what I said earlier is you know that the despite the sort of public perception or and which we haven't really addressed there there's a group of folks that are that love the cats that are building products on top of the kitties and and that's our current focus is saying well let's double down on these teams and and not only help them build more utility for these same tokens that will attract different kinds of communities but also try to understand the this core user base of folks that are coming back day after day spending tons of money and and also being very active in discord creating new channels going above and beyond in in even policing the community itself that that kind of demonstrates what the point of a blockchain game is it's not sort of ponzi schemes it's not gambling it's not any sort of though that's just the cryptocurrency trading market you can already get that by buying your favorite latest altcoin what blockchain games are about is about community and so we've been focused on let's let's simplify things let's not focus on growth and I look after this core community and understand what makes a blockchain game different and special and then we build on top of that so that's what we feel like we've gotten at this point I think we we've we have a lot of learnings a lot of understandings about what are the values of decentralization how can we explain the the why to a new user and and those are the kinds of things we're building into a new onboarding flow as as many saying and and first applying it to crypto kitties and I'm sort of this universe of apps we call the kitty verse but then we want to work with all the best folks out there that are creating great content and we don't see other game companies as competitors we see them as partners and we want to give them the the learnings that we've had because once once we do that then we want to turn on the taps for for growth and bring in new communities you know with HTC the U 12 phone is one of the best phones on the market it has I think an installed base of of almost 2 million you even today and and the the app is going to the crypto Kitty's app a new Android version of the product is going to be pre-installed on all those devices and and more importantly the by giving more utility to the tokens by deepening and having sort of a solid core of players rather than traders and speculators that's how I think the flywheels going to start getting going again and once the new wave of users come in and the old wave of users come back it's really not about buying selling flipping it's about going on a journey designing your own cats building things you love and then being able to paint them throughout the rest of your life so you know using crypto goods you can order a mug you can have a iPhone case where you're kidding that you can take it in various games both from indie developers we're working with some of the world's largest and most respected gaming companies as well to build full scale experiences that are that use these assets so that's I guess the short version of some of some of what the team is cooking I totally get that when you have a dedicated core fanbase there's a famous entrepreneur who I'm just blanking on who it is who says that all you really need get a business going is 1,000 dedicated fans but you know that's not really the kind of thing that you can build a venture back to business on where you're probably I'm sure your investors Andreessen Horowitz Union Square Ventures digital currency group and these big-name people in the space like Fred are some the co-founder of coinbase who's a former gamer in the Val rava Khanna the co-founder of founder and CEO of or former CEO of AngelList built I William movie are all three of those by the way were people who were previously on the show you know I don't imagine that they're that when they back to you guys with twelve point eight five million dollars that it was because they were like oh they've got 300 people that are still into this so do you know do you feel like you can grow something sustainable because I just wonder the past history with a lot of these games is that they take off and then they die down that's like the story of all of them right well definitely games are hit driven business what we are creating with crypto kitties is a brand and and I think the key sort of I guess distinction with a blockchain game is that unlike a normal game the assets and the mechanics are out there and they're getting better every day so the game eight months ago was you buy a cat you buy another cat and then you breed them together you create a new cat the game today is is a hundred different things you can do with well I guess today it's more like five five or ten different things you can do but with with the teams that are working on new experiences with the team that we've built over the past while those same assets can be used and reused and so the affinity that people build for the characters can persist throughout the throughout their experience so but it didn't want to make the point I mean the our investors are very grateful they're fantastic folks and and I think all of them are we chose to work with because they understand this is that we are actually very early in this platform shift and and our purpose a company is to think long term and to build a like you said a sustainable business not necessarily a sort of chasing quarterly quarterly numbers and and and whatnot so you know to to be clear the 300 folks aren't the only people using crypto kitties we have thousands of daily users that come to the website thousands of the users that are active in our discord and the 300 purchases of cats on our smart contract our users spending an average of between 15 and 25 dollars a day on their kitties and that's that's that's unheard of in sort of the mobile game space and and certainly a you know the the the pretty a pre-internet game so there's there's something very special here and and and specifically when we were fundraising you know at that time given our numbers well actually we weren't fundraising what people were just coming to us and and there were a lot of folks that are willing to give us capital at frankly unreasonable terms the reason we chose to work with fred and Chris and-and-and the folks you mentioned are it is precisely what what I said I want I want folks that know what they're getting into and understand that you know this is a the we're extremely early and even the public's perception of this I think the vast majority of companies out there are are misdirected I think most founders don't even understand sort of their own space much less how everything's going to click together and so there's gonna be a dramatic falling out I think there will be another downturn before the the vision we have for a decentralized future is is is really in the mainstream and so so I I would hope that none of those folks are sort of you know refreshing that radar and seeing that even though we're still the biggest game and there's there's just it's it's a it's it's we scratched the surface of what's possible with the blockchain experience we built something in a matter of months and shipped it sort of at it in a very and very like many was saying gorilla manner and the whole purpose was we're starting a journey we're not finishing journey and and if you think about the evolution of how games are made you know 20 years ago you you would finish a game put it on the CD and ship it out to a retail store with a mobile game you're essentially running you know the missed advent of LiveOps right where you ship a game and then a lot of the player experience is actually in the events you run the the campaigns you develop the new content you add on their weekly or daily or monthly basis and and with blockchain games it's I think a supercharged version of that where you you sort of create a theme park and then you invite others to contribute to it the the community itself can can submit art for Kitty hats and they can design their own hats and then make money when people buy it in in in future games you'll have the community able to design levels you have the community able to run leagues for collectible card games and and those are the little things we want to test and a microcosm and understand and then scale up because building a scaled game is is incredibly challenging it takes it takes time and so we're in the learning mode at the moment and and don't forget the theorem network still can't handle much more than what what folks are throwing at it yeah actually I want to discuss that in a second but when one more question before we move on from this topic you guys recently or well actually was a few months ago ethereal auctioned off an exclusive kitty for $140,000 do you think that that Kitty was worth that amount absolutely a celestial but so I want to ask you about that in this seem you know context in which you were kind of deriding the speculators and saying that you know that's not necessarily activity that you welcome on your game so so to be clear that $140,000 went to charity and and it's it's designed to support artists and sort of it's designed to support artists and create kind of business models and for digital artists specifically so there there's it was worth it because the the the buyer was supporting a cause that he cared about and and getting a thing that he valued in return so he all of his social profiles I won't disclose his name because I said my permission but all of the social profiles have the cat as as the as the avatar he's pretty proud of it and he's a well-known entrepreneur and investor in the space but even in this kind of situation where everybody still can see like you know you can look at a I had a copy on the web of what this looks like you know like maybe people don't own it but they can still see it anytime they want it's not like a painting that you hold in your house right so how does it have that value what gives it that value why do you think it's how do you think it's worth 140 thousand dollars well actually we designed a custom hardware wallet to hold this exclusive kitty if you see in the photos the celestial slider dimension cat was actually loaded into this hardware wallet and this kind of glass cube was displayed at the Christie's auction house previously before it actually was at the ethereal summit for the auction so in this case it was a very experimental thing that we did kind of trying to see that you know these cats are digital they do live on a website and as you said they could copy it the photo and you know do whatever they want to do with it but in this instance as you said like they can they can't physically hold it well they they can physically hold it at least at the in this instance no I want to add on top of that though I mean Laurie I mean you cover technologies so it's obviously a you're familiar with the same that the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed yet and I think that the for for many people what happens in the digital sphere is more real than what happens in in the physical world and you know you have a painting that's supposedly 400 years old but you don't actually know the full story behind it whereas we're we or at least technologists and certainly folks that work in the cryptocurrency world can look at something on the blockchain and say yep that that is that is a thing that happened and so so the the fact that that just forget about the art forget about the physical device the that token itself on the blockchain and the stories around it if you hold that token that it's the it's more verified that you own the real thing then if you have a painting of whoever and whatever at your home and so it's kind of I mean I think value is accorded by different people differently right and and the perception of value is changing generationally and I certainly there's certain folks that that live a little bit further in the future than then the most of us but every generation thinks in a more digital world every generation is looking increasingly at a screen rather than in in sort of the the the quote-unquote real world and and if you imagine kind of AR and VR technology improving at the pace it is then then you know what what is what what is real what is real and and as long as you sort of trust then the property rights of a a certain blockchain it's it's a better a judge of reality in the digital world than anything we've had previously and and I think that that's that that's that's really the the point here I guess you know you can say well what's the point of Bitcoin it's just numbers and and can anyone for kit and there's Bitcoin gold and there's Bitcoin cash and and and all these sort of things but you know it's the the power is in the collective story and an agreement among humans that hey this version of truth is the truth that we agree to and and if if that and for now that version of truth is what's recorded on you know the Bitcoin de Syria and and and maybe just just those two sort of primary block chains then what happens on those things what tokens are traded what things are purchased what sort of stories are told or just as very first as real as or maybe even more so as something you see with your own eyes which you know as every every every kid knows can play tricks on you rather easily yeah I find that interesting I definitely agree that obviously we've seen these news stories about fakes in the art world so clearly that I think that can affect the value of an artwork to not be certain of its provenance but I do by the same token feel like handing down a physical object from generation a generation or through the decades there's something much more difficult and therefore more valuable and that but anyway I take your point I find it really interesting so I've got to go back to what you were saying before about the user experience in crypto I know that you guys had that goal of creating a good experience a good user experience with a crypto project and then in a conversation I have with bunny prior to the show he was mentioning that as you were working on this you feel or you guys noticed that crypto cookies kind of physics was exposing some of the problems that the crypto space has over all you know in trying to reach a mass audience so what would you say those problems are and how do you think they can be fixed yeah so I mean if we take a step back and zoom out from the entire user experience from somebody who may stumble on this podcast and become interested in well what is cryptic is let's check out the website all the way to getting the first script or kitty that that's a very huge job because there's so many you know points touch points where they firstly need to understand you know this is my money that I'm putting in here that converts to some digital money called Bitcoin or ether and then somehow this gets cents sent to a Chrome extension that it's not readily used by many people and that's gonna be holding now my money and then I get to play a game and not only that through this process I think you to map the emotions of the person kind of going through this it's ultimately skewing towards fear and frustration and not knowing exactly what's happening and you know soon very soon after when people get excited about by looking at the cats and hearing about it they kind of come through this huge roadblock right where they find themselves extremely frustrated and this is what we've seen and not just from what we're saying but from the data we see that a lot of people just give up halfway or even to the point where oh I need to go and visit ok I give up even though coinbase is relatively easy to use compared to some of the exchange accounts that needs to have a selfie in a passport it's TYC process am not so we see that that's a significant blocker and the other thing that we've also seen is around distribution so right now like well up until quite recently most of these mobile the most of these games that are web-based we couldn't use any user acquisition strategies that were quite used to which means like basically digital ads now that being said we can you know Facebook has just open the doors again but they're really clamping down in terms of verifying these accounts and ensuring that the legit and these projects aren't just ICO scams using Facebook ads but you know distribution and discovery for some some actually more amazing games or even for cryptokeys was very very difficult so in combination of those two elements is this extremely hard for more moms and dads or uncle's to kind of want to experience the blockchain to get into it yeah I saw something that's so interesting to me about what you said is that when you go to the crypto kiddies website it looks so slick you know the kiddies are really cute like the whole thing just seems like a really well-designed web experience but then the user ends up bumping up against all this back-end stuff that normal users don't have to think about so I find that really interesting and fascinating it's like you you know approach this thing and it seems very 2018 and then when you're trying to use it it feels like Creole one the bigger problem is there's no there's no expression of the value so when madam asked is you know terrifying you by telling you to write down your seed words or or your children will be kidnapped if it doesn't actually tell you sort of what's the point right it doesn't tell you why why you're going jumping through these hoops and what's the value of sort of being able to be self sovereign over your over your money this sort of assumes that by the time you come you already understand those things and and so for for us it's really kind of the that's representative friction because unless someone is already in the crypto world their crypto is something that they read headlines of and they shake their heads and they're kind of you know what's going on over there and there's there's not a clear sort of expression of behind me on again like like many was saying fear okay your government will take the thing from you your your your bank will change your rules on you there's no sort of expression of why do I you know make more for most consumers they've lost more money than the bread their bank is stolen from them right so so it's how do we how do we actually get users to feel the value and understand that there's a point towards to jumping through all these hoops yeah I I actually just want to go back to when Benny was describing how through the flow a lot of people probably would would just not end up following through do you have any stats on the attrition due to this friction I think it's close to 99% oh really so this could literally be like a hundred times bigger you think correct and and the problem is like even when you get in it's it's bad right like when you submit a transaction you don't know how long it's going to take that's that's odd and we have to message that in the UI and sort of make it almost like a fun thing like hey you don't know when your egg will hatch on top of that when a network is slow there's no indication that the network is slow other than hey you're your price is somehow higher and so we've put in a traffic light sort of symbol that that says oh the network is congestion so we're having to message all these things too to the user and when I said you know we're preparing for scale I didn't even mean from sort of a technology a standpoint although we're trying to have as much off chain interaction as possible now but I meant from me just just trying to tell the story of hey what's going on behind the scenes here and and and why is it important so you've been doing all this on the etherion blockchain but obviously you're having all these issues with the scaling and everything are you guys looking at other block chains so we are I mean we have but the problem is that there's no real there's no good alternative frankly you know people people talk about iOS but for us the the thing that matters in blockchain is decentralization that that's the whole point and so in a sense a blockchain is the digital jurisdiction and so we have to be comfortable as as businesses in that jurisdiction with the laws the the the community the approach to changing those laws the government's so on so forth and I theorem has proven that it gets a lot of those things right what what we're trying to do with crypto kitties in terms of preparing for scale is is a with the core application trying to move as much user interaction off chain as possible so you know we have a collections feature we have you know likes and and and we're starting to build in more kind of a much deeper sort of UI traditional game experience that that uses the blockchain tokens without actually moving them around and then with the kiddie verse we want to explore the different scaling solution so in kiddie battles is a good candidate for some like state channels or potentially Plasma same thing with things like kiddie races kitty Kitty hats much of it can be done off chain and then committed once back to the change so so a lot of the time an app won't load on the blockchain so I think there's while the core breeding has to happen on the etherium blockchain and and that in itself you mentioned something which is the difficulty of passing something on makes them more valuable and I think that that's a that's a curious thing but it is true and so because the ethereum blockchain is is because the cats need to be born on chain there's no way to actually use any of the scaling solutions development to to simplify that that actually has in an odd way will limit their number and and give give them value as well as you're trying to kind of grow all this and do it on aetherium which of course has scaling issues and you're saying that you're trying to kind of do more off change transactions does that risk centralizing that game or since you've been talking about how kind of the purpose of the game was to build something that was decentralized the purpose of the game is to teach the values of decentralization and so for me for us I should say we talked about this a fair amount the the fact that you as the user you have your token we can't ever take it away from you and that the core rules of the game are completely transparent for everyone to see and that they're immutable and we're sort of working through the process of once IP at once we can put the art on ipfs that means that if the game goes away or if we go away rather if all of the centralized infrastructure disappears anyone can put up a competing UI or even that as you know right now someone can put up a competing UI and and essentially our community can very easily fork to two alternative sort of providers of the same service and so all of the off chain things we're building are or sort of the cherry on top if you will and so so anybody can anybody can can build that on top of the the core token now what that means for the user is the is choice right and freedom as an if we ever end up being a bad actor misusing their information building in futures they don't like complicating the interface whatever it may be there's there's always going to be alternatives available to them and that's the point of decentralization it's not that the actual code all of the code needs to be running on the public blockchain it's that the the user has the ability and the freedom to just simply take their business elsewhere and what that does is it narrows the sort of between price and marginal costs and and gives the value back to the user oh this is super interesting and I actually also just want to circle back to when we were talking about the funding that you guys received you also mentioned that you're exploring these different things like kiddie races and stuff in order to test some of the more experimental technologies is that kind of like another layer of kind of or another a second part of your mission with now dapper labs that you've spun off to I guess to do things with crota kitties and why you got this funding from Andreessen and the other investors well the mission is to bring billion people to the blockchain and to really teach the values of decentralization in a way that people can feel and not not sort of be lecture that and if we the the hoops we have to jump through in order to get there are are just that their means to an end it's to serving the consumer rather than saying hey we're a platform company or rora we're a kind of scaling blockchains company and there's so many smart people working on the various parts of the stack that we're trying to be as collaborative as possible there's there's the l4 team in Toronto working on state channels and and and you know the etherion foundation obviously leading to charged with with charting and whatnot so we're trying to be collaborative as possible and and you know part of our frustration is that most of the developers in this space don't think consumer first and they sort of want the technology to be almost aesthetically perfect rather than functionally useful so it is a kind of back and forth of of hey we need do we need this and it's a lot of well why and no we want it to be this way and and we're just like that's that's that's not not the point so it's a little bit of a interesting back and forth yeah if you haven't listened to more recent episode that I did with meltem two mirrors and Jill Carlson they were seeing kind of the same thing and Jill had a really great comment she was like well if it's developers all the way down then you know it's not going to take off so you guys should check that out you both you as well as listeners who may not have listened to it well this has been an incredibly fascinating discussion where can people learn more about you and your work so crypto kitties Co is is where that Co is where the folks in that I can can try the game and axioms and that Co is where they can get to know our team and maybe some of the background behind the company perfect well thanks for coming on the show thanks for having us for thanks Laura appreciate it thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Rohan and bunny and crypto kitties check
