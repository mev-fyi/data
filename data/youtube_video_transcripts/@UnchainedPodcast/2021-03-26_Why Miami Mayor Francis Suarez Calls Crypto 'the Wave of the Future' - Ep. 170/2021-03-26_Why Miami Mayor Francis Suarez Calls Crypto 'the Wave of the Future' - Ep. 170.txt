get twenty five dollars when you download the krypto.com app with code laura the link is in the description today's guest is miami mayor francis forest welcome mayor suarez hi laura it's a pleasure to be with you as we record miami looks poised to approve the first cryptocurrency exchange sponsor of an nba arena friday which is the day this episode comes out the miami-dade county commission will vote on whether or not to approve the deal in which the current american airlines arena would be renamed ftx arena how did this deal come about well it was an open bid and they bid i think 135 million dollars for the navy rights so they put in a very big bid but i think it wouldn't happen if it wasn't for the fact that miami um is trying and striving very very much to become the crypto capital of the world and we're doing that uh frankly by doing some things that i think are very easy right the first thing we did was we scoured the united states to find out what are the most crypto friendly laws uh in in this in the in the us we found out that it was wyoming so we promptly copied their laws tried to improve them and now have a bill in uh in in the house and in the senate that is making its way up to the governor um which would make florida the most crypto friendly state in the nation and then as a city we implemented uh you know a resolution that would allow our employees to get paid in bitcoin that would uh allow our residents to pay for fees in bitcoin and that would allow the city or at least explore the possibility of the city investing in bitcoin so we've wanted to sort of own this space because we think that cryptocurrencies are the wave of the future and we want to be known as the city of the future and how did you come to that conclusion and to have that desire to make miami a crypto uh a capital part of it was work that i had been doing prior to this moment i was on the florida blockchain foundation and also on the florida blockchain task force that was established by the governor and and the cfo of florida and so for me uh you know i i knew about this technology early i'm a finance uh undergrad so i have a degree in finance so i understand the financial concepts and mathematical concepts that underpin it and and i understand people's frustration with government and government overspending and government trying to manipulate uh through policy um a variety of objectives and i think that's what has uh you know attracted people to a system that is decentralized that is of untethered to a central bank and and i think that's what makes it uh exciting especially when you see some of the actions that are being taken by governments across the country and across the world well that's interesting um to have that take when you actually work in government so how do you see the two blending together i think they have to interact like everything in life i i'm hoping that that there's some benefit uh benefits and some positive byproducts of of this sort of cryptocurrency revolution i think one of them will be um hopefully the elimination of of of deficit spending where hopefully governments are going to now have to tether themselves to uh to crypto as a currency as opposed to the other way around and and so they're gonna have to borrow money uh like everybody else borrows money they can't just print their own money you know they borrow money at an interest rate and if governments uh don't behave fiscally uh they're gonna have to borrow worse and worse rates they just can't invent their own interest rates and invent their own currency which manipulates how markets work and so i think that's that could be a tremendous future benefit um we in the city of miami just to give you an example we're forced to balance our budget so it's very natural for us we actually have a surplus we actually have about 150 million dollars in surplus and and we have some of the lowest tax rates uh in the history of the city so there is totally a space where government can be small can be nimble efficient deliver services without taxing people to death or without deficit spending and so just the future that you described it basically sounds like a future in which people transact in non-governmental currencies and fiat is not dominant the way it is today is that what you think will happen i can and totally see a a a future that that that happens um in fact that's really kind of a regression to our past uh the you know government fiats are relatively recent in terms of human history and you know it's it would not surprise me if uh you know the democratization of technology allows for people to come to a common understanding as to what they think has value and exchange from there which is essentially what bitcoin is or cryptocurrencies right it's it's a digital mechanism where people have agreed we're going to assign value to this you know you know mechanical um technological uh piece of data and and that's what we're going to trade and and and and then of course all the benefits flow from that so um as long as regulation doesn't impede it unnecessarily or there isn't like some sort of a main a big hack or anything like that um i see that the tr the trend in the trajectory uh particularly as you see governments implement monetary policy that creates a tremendous amount of inflation i see the trajectory as being one that's on the upswing kind of like this crane right behind me [Laughter] right which uh for people who are listening on the audio there is pretty much a near vertical crane right behind his head and so just a quick question uh back to the ftx sponsorship since it's a 19-year agreement and the crypto markets are known to have these bull and bear cycles is there any concern amongst the commissioners or other city officials about signing ftx for such a long-term sponsorship not really i mean we'll know on friday for sure but uh i don't think so i mean i think that it's a very generous agreement it could very well end up being a very inexpensive agreement for them if the price of bitcoin continues to go up uh in the way that it's gone up when i when i put the resolution on the commission meeting it was trading at 47. um i don't know if it's at 55 now i was at 55 earlier um so it's already up you know almost 20 what's that up to now 56 there you go so somebody in my office is 1056 so uh so it's up up you know almost ten thousand dollars um it could that 135 million dollar price tag could look paltry um in uh and that's probably what they're banking on frankly in the next five years forget about 10 years yeah yeah it is true obviously over the long term it has been pretty parabolic and um i was also curious because obviously as you're probably well aware a lot of people in kind of what we would say the normie world the non-crypto world view crypto as being volatile or associated with criminals and so i just wondered like were there any perceptions amongst the other city officials that you had to overcome and if so what arguments did you find effective and persuasive with them well the answer is yes of course there were um people that we had to convince and some people that weren't convinced we had you know not everybody voted for it was a four to one vote one of the commissioners voted against it and my argument was the currency on which the most illicit activity in the world in the history of the world has happened is the dollar okay so we're not taking the dollar out of circulation because illicit activities have you know have have have used the dollar uh to uh you know to transact business i mean there's all the famous stories of you know colombian or i shouldn't even say the nationality but drug drug dealers who are you know stuffing 100 bills in their in their drywall uh so i i mean that that part uh to me it's it's kind of nonsensical to make the argument that no no we should go to dollars because crypto has a tendency to be affiliated with criminal activities when dollars are are the are the fiat currency that has most been used in the history of humanity for criminal activity i mean it's kind of a silly argument okay so in a moment we will discuss the possibility of miami transacting in bitcoin but first a quick word for the sponsors who make this show possible with over 10 million users

subscriptions download the crypto.com app now and get 25 dollars by using the code laura the link is in the description back to my conversation with miami mayor francis suarez so as you mentioned earlier the city may uh pay city employees in bitcoin and also have the city's corporate treasury invest in bitcoin and i wondered where is that interest coming from are city employees demanding or requesting to be paid in bitcoin or what has their reaction been to this possibility no they're not not really um you know this was just something that we thought was an interesting way for us to continue to be innovative uh to get to give our employees options um you know none of them are forced to do it it's completely voluntary at whatever level they want they could theoretically do it already on their own i mean they could get paid in dollars and go to an exchange and buy bitcoin so it's just sort of a mechanism that allows them to do it instantaneously but it's it's exciting because it it it also helps bitcoin on what i call their their ascendancy to mainstream and i think a big part of bitcoin's success is it being uh approved by and used by governmental agencies because that's seen as one of the biggest threats to bitcoin so i think uh from uh from a branding perspective um and from a uh ascending to uh you know to mainstreaming perspective uh it's a really significant uh event for the bitcoin community and the crypto community and for the um possibility of the city treasury investing in bitcoin what needs to happen to make that possible well we're doing um some legal research to see if we can even hold bitcoin um that's something that uh we have to first figure out whether it's a legal investment asset if it is then the second thing the second threshold i think is you touch a little bit on its volatility so we're only allowed to invest in certain kinds of assets that have a certain volatility threshold well even if they're going up completely right it's not about uh you know their direction per se even though it should be it's more about their movement and and and what kind of an asset class can you invest in so those are the analysis that have to take place before we can decide and then of course you know i've thought about some creative ways to defray the city's risk by maybe getting some big crypto holders uh to co-invest with the city so that it becomes less risky for the city and it becomes something that's more easily accepted by by the residents and how would that co-investment make it less risky for the city well let's say for example that um let's say for example that the city invested 250 000 i'm just making up numbers and the co-investors invested 750 um but uh on the on the gains right on the gains the city first gets back it's it's it's 250 right and then the co-investors get back their money but their money stays in right they get back their 750 but their original 750 stays in so the city ends up making you know back its money plus plus the the balance so their upside is significantly greater um and then you know obviously if there's a if there's a downside loss the loss gets gets born first by the the co-investors um and last by the city so that's that's just an idea that i've had that i've come up with um you know i'm not sure if we're going to be able to do something like that but i think it's a creative way of defraying the risk so that you can sort of get your feet wet and dip your toe in the water without creating a tremendous amount of risk that your residents might be afraid of and how long is this study expected to take hard to say i mean we have uh you know like government and nothing ever is as fast as you want it to be and you know we have a lot of big projects that we're working on we just came back from las vegas talking about a boring tunnel um so we're working on a variety of big projects it's going to take whatever time i'm always i'm very anxious and sort of uh impatient so but we want to make sure that everybody's comfortable we want to make sure our council is comfortable you know at the end of the day this is not done by executive fiat you know it's not like i can just wave a pen and make it happen so you know you have you know you have to study it and then you have to get your commission your counsel comfortable with it so that they approve it and last topic there's been a lot of controversy recently about the environmental impact of proof-of-work mining which is what's used by bitcoin and miami will be probably one of the city's hardest hit by climate change so how do you reconcile your interest in bitcoin as well as its potential impacting the environment against your love for miami and your interest in mitigating the effects of climate change there extremely easy um extremely easy to reconcile those two things because a part of the problem with bitcoin mining is 90 of it is not done in the united states 90 of it is done in countries that have dirty energy so that's that's the reason why it's it's considered to be a dirty uh uh activity but for example in miami we would love to be a mining a hub for a national security reasons we don't think 90 of mining should be outside of the us and b we get nuclear power so we have clean energy a clean energy supply that's essentially unlimited and so we have the ability to have to supply mining centers and data centers uh in in in perpetuity uh with clean energy so it it actually would be to the benefit of the crypto community if we did more mining in the us because we by and large produce clean energy so that would it would change that narrative and that dynamic and i also think in the future you're going to see uh you know solar and other kinds of clean technology hydrogen as as a technology that propels mining as well as you're going to see mining happening in different forms you're gonna you're gonna they're gonna be bigger hash blocks uh they're gonna be um uh you know more efficient in terms of authentication uh changes in terms of how uh you know bitcoin and other transactions on the blockchain are authenticated that's gonna that's gonna be that's that's gonna reform so i think technology is gonna make it more efficient less expensive and less power consuming and then just one quick question on what you said when you were talking about mining in the us miami is very hot and obviously bitcoin miners generate even more heat so were you saying that you would want to do the mining in florida or you mean just like in a colder part of the u.s no no i think it could be anywhere in the us but certainly it could be in miami as well i mean i don't i don't think that the mining activity itself is going to contribute to the heat of the city i've never heard or seen of a study where the mining activity itself or data center which by the way i don't know if i'm sure you've been to a bunch of data centers i mean their insulation is incredible because they have to be basically bomb proof right so you could drop a huge bomb on a data center and they're they're they are uh guardians of the infrastructure the technological infrastructure of a city so it's it's very unlikely that they're um pushing off a tremendous amount of heat uh from from the source itself well okay well actually i mean they do generally a lot of heat but but also then it takes energy to cool them down and whatever but anyway okay well i mean what is that happening in internal is that happening internal or external well i mean some of them are you know like you said kind of i think under underground or in bunkers but then others i think are you know just like in normal buildings so it sort of depends on what the setup is um this is for discussion maybe when there's like an actual plan in the works and we can to talk about it then all right well thank you all right well thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you so much for having me don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break meet interpop a super team redefining the future of nfts and fandom from comics and trading card games to digital collectibles and everything in between they are building the architecture of an entirely new landscape of fandom using technology built on the tasos blockchain to drive their vision visit hello interpop dot io to learn more [Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline fidelity files for a bitcoin etf an affiliate fidelity filed for a bitcoin etf with the u.s securities and exchange commission on wednesday the proposed etf notes the application will quote provide direct exposure to bitcoin and track the price of btc through fidelity's in-house bitcoin price index which adjusts for the trust's expenses fidelity digital assets will custody the underlying bitcoin fidelity's etf will be named the wise origin bitcoin trust a subtle nod to bitcoin's pseudonymous creator on twitter alex thorne head of firmwide research at galaxy digital pointed out that in japanese satoshi means wisdom and nakamoto means origin in a statement to the block a fidelity spokesperson expounded on the filing saying quote the digital assets ecosystem has grown significantly in recent years creating an even more robust marketplace for investors and accelerating demand among institutions an increasingly wide range of investors seeking access to bitcoin has underscored the need for a more diversified set of products offering exposure to digital assets fidelity's interest into the bitcoin etf race comes right on the heels of similar efforts by van eck valkyrie nydig wisdomtree and first advisors slash sky bridge next headline coinbase's direct listing draws scrutiny to the firm's prospects brian armstrong's net worth and customer service mario gabriele founder of tech newsletter the generalist along with well-known crypto analysts such as jill carson ryan todd and catherine wu wrote up a comprehensive piece on the paradoxes of coinbase as a centralized exchange championing the rise of decentralization the article is too long to summarize here but i recommend it for those looking for a thorough analysis on coinbase ahead of its direct listing some choice highlights include the correlation between coinbase's revenue growth and bitcoin price has been around 70 for the past few years institutional trading made up 64 of coinbase's trading volume while only accounting for five percent of revenue transaction fees made up 86 of coinbase's revenue in 2020. cnbc reports the much anticipated coinbase direct listing is poised to make co-founder and ceo brian armstrong a very wealthy man at the latest valuation armstrong's stake in the company is worth 13.6 billion dollars which would leave him in the company of recent tech founders like zooms eric yuan at 16 billion dollars twitter's jack dorsey at 13 billion dollars and shopify's evan spiegel at 10 billion dollars in net worth in coinbase's virtual ama or ask me anything on reddit armstrong made headlines by acknowledging that coinbase would support central bank digital currencies if and when they met the exchange's listing standards in response to a question about coinbase providing special blockchain based shares to early customers allah a crypto airdrop chief financial officer alicia haas put such rumors to rest saying there will be quote no opportunity to invest in the company prior to that direct listing she revealed however that coinbase had researched the idea of a security token a digital representation of a stock instead of a standard ipo haas cited a lack of opportunity for institutional investors as the reason why a blockchain native security never materialized the coinbase news cycle was not all positive last friday the cftc fined the exchange 6.5 million dollars for allegedly providing misleading information about the trading volume on its platform gdax now rebranded as coinbase pro between 2015 and 2018. the cftc pointed out two in-house software programs that traded with each other inflating the asset prices and volume on gdax the agency also alleged that a former coinbase employee participated in wash trading using litecoin bitcoin trading pairs in a tweet thread evan lorenz a deputy editor at grant's interest rate observer speculated that coinbase which now based on his revenues would not be defined as an emerging growth company quote skated under the emerging growth deadline based on when it filed this means that along with other emerging growth companies it is now only required to disclose two years of financials in its s-1 he riley noted that the period of time for which it provided financials quote begins just after the cftc said that coinbase stopped conducting wash trades to give the illusion of more training volume the nft looked into how coinbase struggles with customer service by following several customers who lost five and six figure amounts of crypto on the platform after their accounts were hacked they say they received little to no customer support for long periods of time the coinbase said that only 0.004 of its users had experienced such an attack the company said it has added 2 000 customer service reps to help in such circumstances but the story is a reminder to secure your passwords and always use second factor authentication services such as google authenticator or a ubi key next headline uniswap finally unveils v3 plans uniswap was introduced in true crypto fashion via an announcement of an announcement in a dramatic 46 second video featuring three unicorns and a hidden message written in the stars a few hours later unit swap released a blog post outlining the v3 plan and setting may 5th as the target launch date uniswap v3 aims to be quote the most flexible and efficient amm or automated market maker ever designed and will quote provide liquidity with up to 4000 x capital efficiency relative to uniswap v2 the heart of the update is centered on the concept of concentrated liquidity which allows liquidity providers more control over the price range their markets trade on this version of uniswap will launch with a business source license that delays the commercial use of the code for up to two years perhaps in response to sushi swap a rival that previously copied and pasted uniswap's code to create a competitor the question now becomes as jose macedo partner at delphi digital asked on twitter how do you enforce a license if an anonymous and decentralized team forks the code on a related node google search volume for uniswap reached its highest point since september 2020 next headline fat f changes the definition of nfts and dapps the financial action task force or fat f the intergovernmental organization tasked with developing anti-money laundering and other financial surveillance policies released draft guidance with two changes that could transform d5 first it expanded the definition of vasps virtual asset service providers to include many defy applications or dapps that could require decentralized platforms to conform to the same anti-money laundering laws traditional financial institutions follow secondly fat have changed the phrase quote assets that are fungible two quote assets that are convertible and interchangeable the new terminology would lump certain nfts under the same regulations as virtual assets if the tokens were used to facilitate money laundering or terrorism peter van valkenberg director of research at coin center a blockchain advocacy organization called the proposed changes problematic in a blog post he wrote quote classification as a vasp would obligate these non-custodial persons to register with a local regulator collect and report to government masses of information about their activities and the activities of others and to know the names and physical addresses of everyone with whom they interact those requirements may be reasonable for banks and other financial institutions where most money laundering takes place but they are absolutely inappropriate for private persons participating in open computer networks ian taylor chair a trade association crypto uk also criticized the changes saying fadef are recommending to the governments that they do everything they can to stop digital asset related financial relations that aren't intermediated fadiff will be accepting public comments on the draft language until april 20th next headline elon musk minds btc through tesla sales you can now buy a tesla with bitcoin elon tweeted out on wednesday earning 762 000 likes his announcement comes just over a month after tesla revealed a 1.5 billion dollar bitcoin investment and vague plans to accept btc as payment musk went on to clarify that quote bitcoin paid to tesla will be retained as bitcoin not converted to fiat currency designating tesla as a corporate hotler he also noted that pay by bitcoin capability will be available outside the us later this year time for an nft roundup after his historic nft sale at christie's digital artist beeple received 53 million dollars in ether and promptly converted it to us dollars in an interview with fox news he called the recent search in nft prizes a bubble though he does believe that the technology behind nfts will outlive the bubble much like what happened with the internet time magazine offered up three non-funchable tokens inspired by time's most iconic covers this week one is god dead two is truth dead three is fiat dead the nfts sold for 241 eth or 385 000 on super ware thursday jack dorsey sold his original tweet as an nft for 2.9 million dollars dorsey converted all proceeds from the auction to bitcoin and donated to give directly to africa response the new york times released a recent column as an nft and is auctioning it off for the neediest cases fund the article ironically about nfts sold for 350 000 eth or 550 000 on thursday time for fun bits bitcoins energy consumption rationalized as criticism over bitcoin's environmental impact heats up the community has banded together with ways to rationalize the energy used to power the proof of work blockchain nick grossman general partner at union square ventures views crypto mining as a battery transforming electricity into value in the form of digital assets he believes bitcoin as battery will shift the narrative from quote crypto mining is a dangerously large consumer of energy two quote crypto mining is driving the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables square crypto also chimed in releasing the first volume of a bitcoin mythology series the pithy introduction reads quote since there are no more prominent or prevalent myths about bitcoin than those having to do with its environmental impact we started there while thought-provoking and quirky both the bitcoin as a battery concept and the idea that bitcoin's environmental concerns are mythological lack a quantitative foundation which will be necessary in the coming years for the marketing war over the environmental impact of proof-of-work this week i will allow bitcoin's creator the last word on proof of work quote the marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold gold mining is a waste but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange i think the case will be the same for bitcoin the utility of the exchanges made possible by bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used therefore not having bitcoin would be the net waste all right thanks for tuning in to learn more about miami mayor francis suarez be
