not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so first quick intros we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound then we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at gauntlet and finally I received the head height man in dragonfly the we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block that XYZ for more disclosures so gentlemen it's been a pretty quite weak in crypto um we're getting a few of these now it seems like volatility is low change volume is low people are really reaching for headlines these days there's not a lot that's super happening the one thing we were just talking about before we started recording was uh there's there are people now who are just like begging for money from Twitter and Twitter is giving them lots and lots of money for no reason which I feel like is also a sign of collective boredom like there's nothing else to really do but to manufacture stupid things to happen on the internet I don't know what's your what's your guys take about what's going on these days first off if you're thinking about sending your money to a stranger over the internet without any specification of what to expect don't do it um this used to be a scam back in the day where you know people would say hey send me money and they would have a really good excuse the same scam exists today and they don't have a good excuse so don't fall for it don't send money to just ethereum addresses because someone on Twitter told you to I see the thing is I can't tell so just for just for background the the setup basically is that some guy um so there's some guy Bend out of Youth he's you know there's a bunch of meme coins and stuff that he's raising money for um some other guy was like you know what I'm not even going to create a meme coin I will do nothing send me money I need money for our Collective IQ is going to drop so much if we talk about it I don't want to bother but this other guy right I forget his name whatever he's some guy uh and he's basically I'm gonna do absolutely nothing I make no promises no guarantees of anything I'm telling you explicitly I will do nothing and here's my address and he got like a million dollars in ether over about 24 hours um which I feel like is in some way an evolution where like in the bull market you would say I'm gonna you know like Andre would be like I'm gonna create a new you know uh a ZK Oracle for you know construction work or whatever oh great let's throw money into this contract and pre-buy the token as aggressively as you can and now in the bear Market it's like you know what I'm why even pretend that you'll get anything from this well people are smart though that there's a coin called nothing coming that that's the I think scam is like you think that's what people are doing no but this is the whole point there's no expectation of profits you know and that's uh he's trying to get around Securities laws there cannot feasibly be an investment here because uh you know I didn't I didn't promise anything you're just giving your money away okay so so you think people that was a joke that was that was I I don't actually think that's why what do you think people are actually doing because I'm confused now do you actually think people expect to get something from this yes I think people think that this is just a cool alternative approach to releasing yet another pointless meme coin this one called dollar sign nothing okay and if he doesn't do let's say let's say that he actually doesn't release anything what do you think happens I think people will feel like hey what are you doing with the money I think they're gonna accuse him of like you know wasting their money but yeah I mean they wasted their money yeah like do you have a claim against this guy who's explicitly said he will do nothing and I don't think it's funny I feel I feel like this is one of those dyor type of things someone's gonna come out and be like you didn't dyor and do your own research I mean what research is there to do this I mean it's really kind of an open shot case here I don't know I'll just say don't fall for it please don't send any money yeah in general it's a bad idea to send money to random addresses regardless of whether they're promising you things like this is generally not a formula for success in life we generally don't get invested advice on the show that is the one thing I feel pretty confident in giving investment advice about so anyway all right we we asked the viewer because it's been kind of a slow week besides this stupid meme coin stuff um we asked the viewers like hey what do you want to see us talk about this week because there's not a lot of like really glaring news stories in uh in the media these days so uh one of the things that people asked us to comment on is uh so one they wanted to know what is Tom's favorite video game Tom do you have a favorite is that was that actually on the list that was actually one of the one of the questions that was given okay it used to be done at all times to be a big DOTA guy all time okay I've been playing a lot of valorant lately like Valerie because I used to play Counter-Strike basically like Counter-Strike Age of Empires I don't have a favorite favorite just I like I like PVP games you know it's like crypto but it's a video game it's PVP got it okay the next question what is tarun's Favorite Drug this is not life advice okay wow that one came out of nowhere yeah I mean these were these were back to back and so I feel like somebody was looking at the two of you on the show and it's like okay that guy's a favorite video game that guy's a favorite drug you know all I got to say is I am waiting for the day that Red Bull calls me up and sponsors me to be an extreme sugar-free Red Bull drinking athlete because I I probably drink like 40 to 50 ounces of sugar-free Red Bull a day which is probably bad for you but I still do it how many cans oh my God eight ounces so it's like it's like 16. it's like five cans a day of Red Bull yeah six wait wait wait wait wait yeah yeah how much listeners might not know this but like the Rune actually consumes five cans it's only it's only 80 milligrams per can you spread it throughout the day it's not like you're like okay yeah it's not that crazy that's that's a lot of sugar oh sugar free okay so that's a lot of what aspartame what is in there yes so my favorite drug is some cancer inducing sugar substitute oh beautiful beautiful okay wait so and you're just like you're just like titrating this throughout the day to just like keep your aspartame levels up or whatever yes you know just like a baseline of caffeine and artificial sweeteners basically okay I don't know it just it honestly it's just you know I feel like when I was in college I was uh I was much more of a an [ __ ] coffee snob person and like oh like if it didn't come from like blah blah blah siphon from this particular region uh I'm not drinking it and then you know over time I just like fell down the cliff of like so how do I get that caffeine faster how do I get caffeine faster how to get caffeine and then eventually sugar-free Red Bull was the optimal just like titration curve I would have totally pegged you for a coffee snobber and I'm I'm surprised I I was but then I just like it just became just like I have to wait I have to prepare it you know it's like that literally was the latency yeah exactly it became a latency thing and and I think I started really drinking it before all the like random coffee in a can things you know like the like Nitro cold brew coffee in a can that wasn't there when my my cycle started so I I'm just and I've never been able to like those because now I'm just so used to this taste of this thing it's like I got it I used to drink it it must be like smoking right you just like you don't even notice the The Taste anymore after a while no it's true you just acclimate to it I mean I I when I was in college I used to drink a lot of a lot of coke just to keep myself caffeinated but I haven't I haven't drank any caffeine in like 10 years which is maybe 10 years well I'm drinking yours for you yeah that's that's right no okay so the next question we got the next question we got was uh why is there so much tension between haseeb and tarun so I I didn't know what they meant by this but I'm curious Tom Robert you guys perception of the tension between me and to ruin I feel we never talked about this on the show okay I think the tension is haseeb you have like no hair and tarun has lots of colorful hair tarun is trying to Inception you into growing out colorful hair and you're trying to Inception to ruin into going shaved head I think that's the core tension honestly I feel like with the headphones on I can kind of see it I can just see what it would look like if tarun were to come over to my side yeah I could see and also just different working Styles you know see on time running the show Troon whatever I don't even know that we're recording a podcast it just thinks we're hanging out so there's a lot to mentioned there but you you know it needs I need the seventh Red Bull of the day to get to the on time you know it's it's like Maslow's hierarchy of needs is like in cans of Red Bull okay okay got it well so I will say from my perspective I don't feel any tension with Drew but I do feel like we are probably the two most cantankerous people on the show is that we're just the first to complain about something that we don't like and so we'll we'll get into it very easily but I think both of us are also very um uh we're just pretty Brash people and so I think you know I it's funny because I have I have the same kind of relationship with my brothers is that um I remember once I was I was hanging out like when I was very young I was like 18. I was saying that with some with some folks from college with my brother my older brother and uh we started arguing and we just argue all the time it's just kind of our relationship and the guys who were sitting with us were like holy [ __ ] are you guys like about to fight and I was like no that's just how we are like we we didn't feel any heightened feelings but we just had this like super I don't know like hyper aggressive Dynamic with each other that we just we just grew up with I don't know why but we just had that and we didn't feel anything about it but I feel like that is maybe part of what people are detecting is that like I think I just kind of do that but we don't have any feelings are not really flaring up yeah there's no beef when we're going back and forth on something The Only Exception might be when we're talking about anthropia or EA or SPF because it's the only place where tarun will really get worked up in a very serious way yeah I agree I think it's just like a form of directness uh and being kind of like very uh direct I'm gonna say something I'll offend many of our listeners so I'm excited to say it in res you know as as an homage to this question which is uh I think that like every cycle in crypto brings new people but I have to say like this last like I would say like the first cycle you know of like huge let's say 2013 2011. brought very angry Libertarians into crypto right like it was like Roger or Satoshi dice like people are generally a little bit you know on the anger management versus like vipassana Spectrum they're definitely on the anger management side and then like 2015 it was kind of similar it's like you had Mount gox people lost all their money they're they're angry if they had the emoji with the the the the cursing in the mouth they would have used it more but didn't exist then and 2017 again same thing people were that was actually the first time it got a little weak sauce right like people started being a little less like on the the anger anger you know say my they say my thoughts unfiltered Direction and there was a little more like drink the Kool-Aid socialism Vibes kind of like what we talk about with Aragon and then this last cycle it was like I mean that on steroids in some ways and so like there just wasn't like as much you know that that style there's fewer of that style of person I think maybe haseeb and I come from that kind of old generation of angry people I think wait aren't we both 2017 vintage yes neither one of you should be angry but yeah yeah yeah so that's not the angry we're not like the 2015 2014. we both are kind of around like I don't feel like it was as organized right like how long you were actually paying attention for a long time right right like I I had Mount Cox deposits so I like definitely was like I was angry in that way you know right okay fair enough fair enough I I that's an interesting it's an interesting way to describe the generations of crypto I actually like that I like that concept I think it's definitely true like the 2020 event like if you came in during defy as opposed to you came in during the nft boom I feel like there's also a difference there and defy a lot of Finance people a lot of folks are just like this is the coolest thing happening in finance and those people I think tend to be more more Brusque more um utility the more adversarial and uh they're less idealistic right whereas almost everybody who came in during the nft Boom super idealistic very kind of socialist Kumbaya like hey blockchain is going to make everything better and um I think the 2017 vintage was a lot of people who were very idealistic who then got jaded which I feel like is the best kind of people you know who like know what it is to be idealistic but also realize why it's stupid because you know everybody who came in in 2017 they were like oh everything's gonna get tokenized the entire world is going to live on the blockchain blockchain is going to take over governments that that was what that was what we were all force fed in 2017 and it was all [ __ ] taking over government's for the record was always the goal though yeah well so you take over government since like all government software whatever is going to run on blocks on blockchain all that stuff right and that just died it just died in a way that it was never going to come back and so everybody from that era like had a Dark Night of the Soul about what is this stuff and does it matter not me I'm still on the ethereum rainbow side are you yeah okay Robert you might be the one exception but I feel like most people like you got you got some like Gnarls in your gut after going through 2017 2018. and it makes I think people like you know they can take a couple more punches if they went through the 2017-2018 cycle we'll see what happens to this you know this 2021-2022 vintage but I I right now I feel like a very snowflakey vintage I agree Tom what's your take yeah I can kind of see that it also feels uniquely kind of um very consumer facing or very like web 2 in some ways like when I think about things that kind of defined it was like there are applications and there's a lot of people and it's it's like friends of mine are asking me how to use it and I feel like that was not true in like you know 2017 or other Cycles where it's like way more kind of like nerd Dev uh focused yeah the only thing in 2017 that in my world view and circle ever reached Mass knowledge of you know kind of existence was somehow like the Brock Pierce es thing like somehow that they're like the Mighty Ducks guy raised four billion dollars like someone said that's something that's like what the [ __ ] like how the [ __ ] is that the thing you know the Mighty Ducks guy I forgot about that that's still the craziest Ico of all time and nothing will ever Eclipse it period full stop for sure that hit the level of like random friend asking me I think compared to everything else no that is that is true it was that was it was a weird time okay well the one of the other things that people suggest that we speak about was this whole roll-up ontology debate so this I before we actually talk about what the debate is about I first want to comment on the fact that this debate is happening why don't we do what we did last week where you went through the five levels no of what a role what a roll-up is what a roll-up is uh who wants to start who wants to give the I'm going to take the five-year-old answer okay okay Robert you do the live five Okay so do you know fruit roll-ups there they're delicious and they taste like strawberry well inside each fruit roll-up is like a hundred thousand strawberries that's what a roll-up of a train is you have like a hundred thousand transactions in one uh first of all you know just like the SEC like suddenly said tries to say something to the security by invoking it into trial you just southerly in invoked some fruitism where you just said apples and bananas aren't fruits because the only Fruit Roll-Up was strawberry I'm not trying to be prejudiced against apples bananas or other things that could be a fruit roll-up maybe it's like a fruit leather you know any anything can be a fruit level yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we should have an ontology of Roll-Ups uh okay perfect I feel like a five-year-old would get it okay let's let's keep going all right Tom you're um explaining to a high schooler I I was gonna say remember plasma it's that but we put the data on shin and that's it that's it that's gonna explain to us that's not the high schooler definition yeah I don't think anything any high schoolers that know what plasma is unless they worked for omisago yeah some very precocious high schoolers okay so you have a confusing explanation to high schooler um all right I'll give I'll get that's fine I'll give an explanation to a day trader um uh a roll-up it's like an L1 but it's more levered so it's got its own token and you can trade it it's got uh uh and it settles slower than the old one that's that's l2's for day Traders uh all right tarun you explain it to uh a Dev yeah so you you know how it took 10 years for Linux to go from single core Linux like you could run it on a single processor and the entire kernel would work to multi-core Linux where you know you could write code that you didn't have to know which processor was running on your machine might have had 32 but you just hit like run my code and it would figure out how to you know allocate your which processor around your code where the memory was all of that stuff imagine that change for a blockchain where you deploy a contract instead of deploying a contract once you're able to kind of separate a the state and the availability of state of that that kind of program from where it gets executed and the dream kind of in the 10-year vision of Linux is and in my mind what the long-term vision of for Rolex was even though people who are making Roll-Ups may not want to hear this for their token price is that the end developer doesn't need to actually really care where it gets run right they they post the data on somewhere that's trusted and the the actual state is the valuable part state is money TM and then the execution gets done wherever somewhere else and the execution has some guarantees that it's run correctly or not some of them are use cryptography like ZK some of them are purely economic-ish like uh optimistic but but in some sense the dream of this world is you just send your program and you say hey I want my user state to be really really safe and really secure it's like money but the actual who actually executes the state transitions it can be somewhere else with different security guarantees okay this whole debate maybe it's also useful framing the debate before we kind of go into the actual size of the debate so the court debate is critiquing this this the way that Roll-Ups are often described or the way they're often kind of this shorthand that we tend to use for Roll-Ups which is we often say Roll-Ups inherit the security of ethereum right so if you have a roll-up whether it's truly trustless and it does all the things it's supposed to do on the tin then you can trust the roll up just like you can trust ethereum and it's all of its state is sort of a function of the state that's on that's you know posted to ethereum ultimately it's sort of a compression technique uh for for stuff that's that's put on ethereum that's the sort of canonical um state-approved vitalik you know stamped it and said yes this is what Roll-Ups are and this role of ontology debate is basically people saying that's a simplification that's not really the way Roll-Ups are because Roll-Ups are really just they're basically an L1 that has a special bridge and a spec you know sort of social contract with that bridge that says hey we're going to follow what the bridge does but the roll-up itself and the way in which it offloads um data availability or the way it offloads consensus uh and the way that it enshrides this bridge are two totally different things and it can decide to basically Fork away from the bridge and uh if that happens it's not as though like the universe explodes or the roll-up just you know dematerialize or something there are real things that happen when a uh or alternatively when a bridge itself upgrades to keep some kind of consistency with the way in which the blockchain is changing or so the roll-up is changing and so this idea of a roll-up as being ah it's about this like Bridge with L1 and that's what the roll-up is and the roll-up is kind of stuck like affixed to the layer one and it can't really move and it's sort of that's kind of how we imagine roll ups is like some velcro you stick a blockchain onto ethereum and that blockchain is now stuck and can't really move and ethereum basically controls it all these people are basically arguing is that really true is it not true that actually there are more degrees of freedom to the roll up uh and maybe we should stop oversimplifying the story around Roll-Ups as being this like inherit security from ethereum sing that in Broad Strokes is how I perceive back and forth in the argument true would you say it's a good encapsulation of what people are going back and forth about yeah I mean it yeah you're right it's it's mainly focuses on this idea of like does the bridge need to be agreed upon by both of them and if it's agreed upon by both of them does that make it kind of its own chain in some ways only other thing I would add is that like there's definitely a debate of like how much the developer needs to do to maintain their application and how much this user needs to do to maintain the state and like that's also another place where people are fighting about what it what it actually you know how much should a user be required to think about for instance yeah so the the first thing that really came to me when I was reading all this is like why are we arguing about this and I mean that not in a like derisive sense but in a more like sociological sense of like why is this suddenly the thing that all these smart people are arguing about one it feels to me like there's very little going on right now like any time that like the main conversation is about philosophy it's like wow we are really not making problems like do you remember do you remember the 2019 L1 consensus Wars like between like near Solana eth Etc and they were all bike shedding on like particular nuances of their consensus charting versus vertical scaling versus all that stuff yeah totally and a lot of the bike shedding actually didn't matter because the Practical thing they implemented didn't really like it added a lot of duct tape and baling wire around those particular details or I'm not saying that like some of them didn't Implement what they claimed as much as like the precise things they were attacking each other on were not these like sharp Like A and B are completely separate objects but they actually were like fuzzier and overlapped a lot more I think that that's the same thing here I I definitely agree with that I feel like though going back I keep coming back to this theme of like blockchains as religions and I'm gonna do that one more time here because I feel like it's it's constructive like so why why are people thinking about this like who cares if oh people are kind of using the word roll up a little more Loosely than they should like what you know like Robert what I would say is that the reason why people are arguing about this is that Roll-Ups have become so fundamental to the teleology of ethereum basically it's like look the end like the story of how ethereum you know the the sort of uh what's the what's the what's the revelations right that's the book where the world ends or whatever like the sort of the the revelations for ethereum is that there are Roll-Ups Roll-Ups are the way that ethereum will see the future it's the way ethereum is going to scale and these guys are basically going in and like attacking the high Priests of ethereum who are claiming that like ah Roll-Ups are this beautiful kind of uh Transcendent way this like golden bridge to the promised land of unlimited scaling and they're like aha no not so fast there is no Promised Land because in the future every roll up can four can do whatever we want it's just another blockchain there is no magical way to scale ethereum without making ugly governance trade-offs and it's like okay well what's your point like why bring that up do you want people to not use Roll-Ups should people do something else should they like change the way they do ropes there's no real recommendations in any of these arguments people are not saying like ah so we should you know make the bridges immutable or we should do I feel like the takeaway from these arguments is all we should educate people and it's like okay we should educate people about what exactly to do what I I agree to an extent I think it's a little bit kind of like Bitcoin in the early days when people are like well you know all money is a social construct so like why can't Bitcoin be money and it's like if you you kind of have if you're attacking like the incumbent you kind of want to you know unravel them a little bit and there's obviously a lot of people pushing modular blockchain and uh you know uh stuff like that and so it's like well you know actually ethereum isn't that important because you can do da somewhere else and the bridge actually isn't part of the roll-up so in reality like nothing is is actually happening here and like my other company and thing that I am also trying to sell conveniently fits into this narrative and so I think that there's there's definitely like you know something going on for the sake of our industry please do not that's what you're saying the whole this whole thing is manufactured by data availability layers to just get attention yes uh yeah kind of or anyone pushing modular blockchain it is extremely in their benefit people are like oh actually you know you're right that uh the bridge actually isn't that important and we don't have to use you know uh now one like ethereum to do da um there's actually other stuff out there and again I would say the same way people are like oh money is a sort of a social construct what's so great about you know currency XYZ here Tom can you define modular blockchain because I think a lot of people listening may not be familiar with the term sure so modular blockchain is this idea that you can basically separate execution from data availability um so you don't have to for example you know on ethereum we all agree there's a set of State transitions that occur and then the chain itself is used to actually store historical State as well as what the current state is modular blockchain for example you can make your own roll up that might have its own uh evm that's using to sort of set State transitions but it's actually storing the state and storing all the data you know on some sort of decentralized file storage system or it might be using a different type of VM but also storing um the data actually on ethereum itself so it's not using the EDM it's using um something else and so the idea is sort of hey you can pick and and place different parts of this stack to suit your own needs and that's what these these companies are working on so if I can analogize it's sort of like you know today or like you know today we might be in the pre-history phase for modular blockchain people where everybody has their own verticalized stack they store stuff they execute stuff they do consensus they do all this stuff in-house right but in the future it's almost like Cloud providers You'll Use Somebody for storage you'll use somebody else for execution and you can kind of mix and match vendors quote unquote and this is better in the modular blockchain world because it leads to I don't know specialization or something I don't know whatever this is what will happen yeah I mean if you if you if you believe this and you think ethereum is literally just going to be used for da data availability in the future you can argue it's probably not uh optimized for data availability and it's probably a cheaper better more robust way to store um State data and call data and so um why not build a blockchain or some sort of other system that exclusively does that is optimized for it and that's kind of the benefit of modularity is is you can sort of have different parts of the stack optimized for the thing that they're trying to do there's a famous quote which is completely unrelated to crypto and blockchain which says that in I think it's related to the media industry but also more generally most businesses are either bundling things or unbundling things and I feel like when it comes to modular blockchains it's like the unbundling of all the things that make up blockchain and blockchain and saying basically oh no you had all of this in one place let's rip it apart and do each thing independently and maybe that's better for whatever reasons I I personally think that blockchain's in a bundled sense work pretty well right now I you know at a really high level don't know how much better it'll be if you like take a blockchain and just you know turn it into its like individual components but so maybe it's better I think so you guys invested in Celestia right yes um so you guys what is your take then on the modular blockchain thesis like do you think modular blockchains are going to become a bigger thing why give us the pro argument yeah so one of these arguments and this this is sort of my historical analogy argument at least initially it was that Linux actually went from losing to Windows quite substantially to really dominating in the server Market when Linux was able to actually do multi-core multi-processor multi-node operations a lot better than Microsoft was actually allowing and part of that trade-off came from Linux actually modularizing itself and people specializing in different things like people specializing in open source drivers or even in the case of Nvidia closed Source drivers but for Linux the Linux NVIDIA drivers are a million times better for doing machine learning with them the windows ones in 2023 that was not true in 2008 and the Linux kind of the way that it actually was able to kind of beat out the incumbents was allowing for the components of Linux to be separated and for the operating system to like only Act in a shrinking manner as the intermediary between different components like between the graphics card and the processor between memory and the CPU between the hard disk and memory it kind of acted more and more as a choreographer and less and less as like I'm doing everything all at once and it took a long time to get that right and it also took a long time to get the user the developer apis and interfaces for that to become a lot cleaner and one thing you're sort of seeing in the roll-up World in general is that one of the reasons there's many different styles of Roll-Ups different you know whether they're optimistic like Optimum optimism arbitrum whether they're ZK like CK sync scroll uh Etc stockware there's sort of this sense in which they're all making these slightly different trade-offs but all of them are converging to this idea that there are some subsets of applications that really want to separate concerns for their users and those applications for instance the number one application of that form is gaming um blockchain games the really valuable thing is to state that the users own like their items or like some some subset of their history but the actual game engine gameplay itself doesn't actually always need to be posting to the the place that the valuable state is right and so now you can have this hierarchy in which the most valuable things stay at the bottom and the the sort of Da style layer and then the the less and less valuable things can be further away and and they can all be running in concurrent fashion just like you know a cloud system and so if you believe that that architectural shift of the world computer into the world computers happens then you sort of inevitably come to this point that the specialization of the modular world is is key to getting there now there's a lot of other weird stuff though that comes with it which is like the ux is crazier right like designing wallets to keep track of all of this is a lot more work so I think the real thesis is that this is what happened before and there's a lot of reason for certain types of applications that basically are non-economical right now for this to work but the the con is like there's a lot of ux change that will happen but the thing is the ethereum roadmap is if we really believe it's mainly the roll-up roadmap and not the you know any of the previous road maps is already moving in that direction anyway so this is just you know I think I think it's just people are choosing a different slightly different version of it and and in a way in a way I feel like the modular blockchain hypothesis is an evolution of the app chain hypothesis yes what's your reaction to that yeah 100 I think Cosmos sort of you know it has some of the the best developers in the space but it also has some of the you know and it comes up with all these Amazing Ideas first that get copied by everyone else right like staking derivatives first ever implemented in Cosmos I mean they kind of messed up some of their initial implementation but it's still a really good idea and if you look at who made it successful as Lido right it was not there's certainly not a cosmos staking derivative and I I think the same thing might end up being true at the app chain thesis where actually in order for the Apache thesis to work you need to have a really valuable State layer or data layer that is the that's the money and then after that you start building the apps but you can't you can't start with that first and then hope it turns into money or if it treated like money so let me let me maybe pose devil's advocate of sort of the anti-modular blockchain thesis is the picture you painted was like well um there's a specialization that's gonna occur at different layers and that's why you know like just almost every other business you have a certain vendor who's really good at X so you use vendor X instead of building it yourself this is kind of the natural way that software evolves um or that almost any economy evolves is it towards specialization and then kind of comparative advantage if I can paraphrase the argument would be that like well yeah but blockchains are like these really complex distributed systems that carry giant quantities of money and it's all open source and those two things are make blockchains fairly unique in that like one if somebody else really solves data availability right and they're actually open source then you can just say like great well you're already trusting you know the my node set my validator sets to do XYZ whatever trust assumption you have because I'm doing a b or c for you um you're already trusting me right and then you also have to trust this other system you trust this other system when you have a distributed system that has lots and lots and lots of points of failure the the the likelihood of failure and just degraded experiences goes way up because any single thing can go wrong and that'll degrade the entire thing right and so as companies get bigger their products get more important and more robust they start in housing more and more things to make it so that you know because these uncorrelated failures are very fragile because if one thing fails right if the right fails or if the persistence fails or if the you know uh consensus fails or whatever it's like it doesn't matter oh only one thing fails like the whole thing failed if just one component of a field and so you'd rather feel like look I'm already trusting this set of nodes I might as well just like Fork the best data availability thing Fork the best virtual machine Fork the best whatever and just bring that all in-house and you just trust my nodes to run it it's not as though it requires significantly more expertise on the behalf of my node runners or my validators to you know run this software we can Upstream whatever changes is being made at this data available data availability player But ultimately like I want both the value the trust and the work to live inside of a single system and if anything I also probably get better latency guarantees because now it's all happening within the same node network instead of this node Network needs to talk to that node Network and there's like some extra latency that's going to be imposed by two different systems talking to each other they can't share a common format so I think if we look at the history of computing applications historically like yes there's a huge amount of value that has been created by extremely latency sensitive things you know like both in trading as well as real-time systems like for airplanes or spacecraft or things like that um on the other hand if we look at a lot of where the big boom of like 2010 to now came from it really did come from sort of like horizontal scaling and bandwidth scaling rather than purely in C scaling in the sense of like you know machine learning only works because you can do horizontal scaling across many gpus across many nodes across many fpgas whatever a lot of the database stuff if you look at the history of databases like yes we've had really good acid compliant acids sort of like a set of Standards a database might need to follow databases like MySQL and stuff forever but yet at the end of the day mongodb is still uh you know x billion dollar company and it just a commonly used database that just doesn't have that like doesn't have the same latency guarantees or safety guarantees which at least with blockchain you really do get and in some ways people really love using it because it's kind of easy to to bootstrap certain types of applications with so I guess my argument is like crypto spent a lot of time on the latency Spectrum in the monolithic layer and moving out on the bandwidth Spectrum I think effectively forces you to go down the modular route moving down the bandwidth Spectrum meaning that if you want to scale blockchains horizontally you need modularity yeah to some extent yeah yeah like I'm not saying I'm not saying like right like like the L1 thesis of like Solana sweet Aptos that's much more focused on the like latency thesis right that the applications really want this like instant like responsiveness property but I think the modular stuff is actually going for something totally different it it really is going for this like separation of like the money stuff which hopefully doesn't need to be read as often versus the actual raw application logic execution then I think it might end up just being that both survive in the same way that right now in the modern Cloud era we have both really low latency applications as well as high bandwidth applications I do feel like there was you know back when I was a professional software engineer like I mean this is what like eight years ago or something um there was a lot of excitement around I guess what you would call in blockchain parlance modularity which is you know service oriented architectures micro services basically like there was this there was this strong backlash against the notion of monoliths which basically this giant giant piece of code that runs is just one thing right that's ethereum ethereum is a monolith it's just one big ass piece of code and that's all you run you just run ethereum and there was this almost like fetishization of microservices and kind of decoupling and all this stuff and I feel like in some sense things have reverted back toward being more in favor of monoliths just out of this reality that like actually when you break things out and you decouple and you modularize all the stuff um it doesn't like magically produce these beautiful you know perfectly you know shorn edges and these these great beautiful boundaries that don't you know these these abstractions that never get perforated that in reality like it kind of sucks and it's annoying and you like lose context and things don't talk to each other and you need shims and translation layers and like things just kind of end up getting um calcified that stick in between the the holes and the layers and it's never quite as beautiful as it sounds and in reality like these things if they end up becoming successful they sort of become monoliths whether you want them to or not where it's like if you if you've got one chain let's say it's you know let's say let's say binance margin just for Simplicity binance smart chain it decides that it's going to use um you know some it's going to use our weave as a state availability layer okay whatever which is not a good idea but let's say they did that um so buy this Fortune uses use or leave as data availability layer our weave has so little else going on that basically our weave is going to become like staple to binance Smart chain like there's just no there's no way that our weave can Fork without buying that smart chain also forking like if if you force something you have to test it on by a smart chain like these two things become so coupled because they're the dominant applications of each other that it's almost like a monolith except that it's a poorly coordinated monolith that I feel like that is in many ways the reality you're going to brush up against in this idea they're like well you know you go ahead do you know Costa you know Ronald Coast's a Nobel Prize winner yes and so Coast is theory of the firm right is like imagine you have n agents who are each individual contractors and they have some economic interactions with each other and now suppose that they have transaction costs for engaging in that so think of like when you sell your home you incur you and your swim transaction costs now imagine groups of people start saying hey we'll work together because we get to distribute our transaction costs between us and the coast theory of the firm is really like hey there's some carrying capacity some natural size for a firm based on its cash flow generation for how much it matters for you to actually reduce your transaction cost by sharing and that gives you a natural size of that particular company industry or whatever there's a sense in which modular blockchains are trying to trying to achieve something in the middle of of kind of those two extremes like that and I think in in the same way that if you if you in 1986 were you know trying to work on like non-monolithic Hardware you would have been kind of laughed out of the room because that was the time when Moore's law was happening and basically like single system on chip type devices by Intel we're just like completely killing everyone and you you know all these people making custom supercomputers custom chips with different different forms they weren't very successful at doing that and intel was just able to have this like exponential growth and then that kind of caused the like monolithic CPU era of the 90s and early 2000s but eventually Moore's Law petered out and you had to innovate at the architectural level and that's arguably where say Nvidia really kind of shined um and so you know having worked in hardware and you heard all the War Stories from people who who lived through that era where there was this transition from this like purely you know low latency type thing to the high bandwidth type world I just all I want is caution is to to not throw the baby out the bathwater there might be that transition when that type of application is found that actually is this like is on a different part of the trade-off Spectrum yeah I I agree with that and to be clear I'm not um uniformly against modular blockchains like you know we invested into ZK sync which is a ZK roll-up um which also is trying to launch you know the CK Porter thing which is a you know cross between a ZK roll up in a validium which is a modular blockchain right that's the that is exactly the description of what a modular blockchain is which is that you're not putting the data availability in the same place or you're putting consensus so I do think these things will exist right clearly and there's there's it's it's broadening the universe of choices one can make about architecture and I think that's that's a worthwhile goal in the same way that I think app chains will exist you know like I was sort of uh you know I remember arguing with like sunny and Zaki back like five six years ago about the theory was was not just that app change will exist of course app change will exist the question is will app genes become dominant that's the question and in the same way I feel like the modular blockchain hypothesis is not that oh well we'll modular blockchains exist of course they will the question is will this become the dominant way that blockchains are architected and when we say the dominant way we don't just mean like okay some random startup that that some people are starting it means like where is most of the money is going to be where is most of the most important value or the most important blockchains how are they going to look in five years there I have more skepticism about the modular blockchain story even though I do think that modular blockchains will exist and like you mentioned games and other things that don't have as much of a of a vested interest in rebuilding these different parts of the stack will probably be big beneficiaries of you know the ease of modularity with things like eigenlayer and uh um eigenda which is their data availability layer or Celestia or what have you yeah and and I think that there is kind of this interesting thing and again it's I I really respect a lot of people working Cosmos land they've just like somehow socially found a way to shoot themselves in the foot 500 times and part of the reason for that is that there's no single substrate religiously for them in in back here your your your religious view in the sense that they have a leader that they assassinated uh effectively in Jay I don't know what else to call the excommunication it's like it's a little bit like he hasn't quite he has he's been in Exile hasn't quite come back he's still suing people I guess who are developers in the ecosystem or something I don't know there's all sorts of drama yeah Cosmos land is like it's very drama-filled opposite of salonland which you have to give them a lot of credit for which is they did the opposite they they weren't they were just like yeah we're just all going to like kind of like Pretend We're gonna like move in this One Direction and in the cosmos world it's like anyone who got success immediately someone would like who would have IBC transactions would try to undercut them and and it's because everyone had their own token and so like any there was no like correlated incentive Cosmos is really like the EU I feel like it is it is just uh it it's a seed of civilization in so many ways but it's so [ __ ] unfortunately prior to having a ton of value in it endogenously right right the big Advantage for ethereum if it basically copies the app chain thesis via op stack or arbitrary Nova or whatever I think it's like oh any of these different visions of the world that actually do kind of look like that is that they're starting from a substrate that's valuable people care about and people are just fundamental Believers in versus like Adam is Dogecoin for nerds like you know all the other random Juno like the founder is dumping it you know evmos like evmos had to have this really ridiculous tweet about how like we we are aware that a Founder a former former founder is dumping all of the tokens and there to write this amazing I mean that was like crypto history tweet it's very funny and and my point is like that that lack of like substrate that's like sociopolitical substrate that for ethereum is is eth for Solana it actually is soul it just doesn't exist there they they all everyone's always just out to cut each other and like like it's like a knife fight constantly there and in some sense it's very hard to do this type of modular thesis when everyone has their night everyone's trying to backstab each other hmm yeah it is it does feel like the problem with with Cosmos it's not rowing in the same direction and it's very true of Solana and now that you mention that I have to give them props as much as I've given them [ __ ] in the past like even post all the FTX Calamity and all the all the horrible stuff that they've had to deal with over the last six months like Solana's been super no drama they're just focusing on the goal they're just well they're only drama is [ __ ] on Roll-Ups are they shooting on role they love though they love the like modular versus monolithic debate obviously so like like but my point is that they're all they're like if everyone's a vector they're all kind of roughly pointing the same direction and Cosmos it's like all other random directions so the the magnitude of the the thing is like nothing because they're all kind of like pulling in opposite directions in some ways and it I think that the the lack of socio-political substrate whether it comes in the form of like an asset whether it comes in the form of a leader a philosophy in ethos is is kind of their biggest lacking biggest hole in some ways come what's your take on the uh kind of Cosmos political scene yeah I was gonna say it's kind of like um like protestantism where it's like you know if you wanna if you have a different view you can go do your own thing and like everyone's kind of cool with it and therefore you get a million different [ __ ] branches or versus like you know ethereum or month is like Catholicism it's like you got the pope and here's the rules and like that's the thing and Like You Gotta Be You gotta be with us you know and um so I I agree I mean I there's a bunch of other issues with Cosmos but when we get into them today I think going back to kind of the debate around or sort of arguing by analogy about these other parts of computing in Tech and how they've gone from bundling to unbundling or modular to monolithic um I think the question in my mind is just like how how much utility are you going to get from the specialization of these different layers to sort of justify incremental transaction costs and overhead and like that's kind of ultimately what it comes down to right is like that that equation that trade-off and so far it doesn't really seem like with any of these other architectures any any of these other blockchains there's like a huge clear benefit that results in some sort of like user story um like even on Solana people are still doing the same [ __ ] they're doing on ethereum it's not like oh here's this amazing new application that people can do on Solana that they can do an ethereum it's still people trading on amms people trading nfts like it's a lot of the same stuff and so I I don't unless there is some bigger sort of story around oh here's this thing that is so uniquely enabled on on you know chain whatever that you can't do on ethereum it seems like kind of A Hard Sell and so far I think we should run a story around cost which is true like I was just looking at the uh ltu economics dashboard from a couple apps ago guess how much money arbitrum spent this month on um on on settling on on ethereum uh million dollars eight million four thousand each almost eight million dollars um so yeah so okay maybe this argument that you take you know cost down and two orders of magnitude and maybe that unlocks something new but it feels kind of kind of nebulous right now well okay I think I think for the the modular blockchain story a lot of also what makes it attractive is uh not just the cost of operating but the cost of starting up right so if you want to launch a game you want to launch a blah blah whatever e-commerce something um so we're investors in a company called Caldera which does like this roll-up as a service stuff these are these are popping up everywhere because you couldn't really do blockchain as a service right it's kind of there's just too much of a lift like getting 50 validators and getting them to the token and having to be worth enough value and blah blah blah all that stuff it's just a lot of [ __ ] that you gotta handle which is why we had so few you know blockchain launches uh even in the even in the era when people really were incentivized to launch blockchains not that many people could actually launch a fully fledged L1 um it's just the overhead is really high in the world of Roll-Ups and modularity there's a good argument to to be made that is just easier to spin up something off the ground there's fewer pieces that you have to have for yourself but it also seems true in the same way that like look if you want to start like some very simple app and you just you know grab the twilio API um you like grab some Amazon Lambda functions and like you just you you pin something together maybe you grab zapier as well well and you don't really have to run that much infrastructure yourself it's great for creating small things getting them off the ground but ultimately like I mean as you were as you were describing this time of like okay how does this affect the user story how does this affect the actual user who's using the blockchain and the answer is that if you're in a modular blockchain then if one of those systems is upgrading or one of those systems has downtime the whole thing has downtime right and if one of the systems upgrades and the other one has something incompatible like things like things just get [ __ ] more when you have so many dependencies inside of your what should be a mission critical system that's custodying money you know and that that I think is one of the things that makes this the most difficult to imagine large really valuable blockchains that have significant sums of money taking on this modular approach that that I think is probably the Crux of why I think this it's hard for me to imagine a Solana or an ethereum or a you know a polygon uh like the the layer one polygon not the ZK VM stuff um becoming modularized quote unquote oh I don't think an existing in-flight major L1 really it's going to modularize I think new competitors to it will be modular from the outset like I I think it's really hard to take a monolith apart I think it's really easy to build something new using Legos right so you know I don't think polygons like you know or ethereum or Solana or whatever will be that pattern I think you know widget chain you know 2032 is like the thing that's going to be you know completely modular from the outset and designed for like a very specific application or use case or pattern but so do you do you think maybe let me ask both you and uh you and tarun do you think that we will get to a place let's say in five years ten years where one of the dominant blockchains like the the polygon or the binance smart chain or the Solana of the day will be a modular blockchain yeah I think so obviously polygon is trying right like I think the polygon ZK VM version of the world especially with the multiple different ckvms already is sort of in that world Avail exists which is found out of polygon to do data availability so yeah I think they are committed to it in a lot of ways um but do you think they will that's the question do you think one of the top four chains in five to ten years will be modular top four I feel like the answer is no the fact that you're taking so long to answer this time I I think I think they will get somewhere in between creating another version of themselves or kind of making step chains that are modular and specialized for applications that start there but then can't exhaust resources or don't aren't able to actually work on the mean that sounds like no is that can I summarize that is no I I heard I heard it not really yeah that's what I feel like I heard I I yeah I think maybe that's right unless there's a you know you need that you need the uniswap of modular blockchains right but you need a killer like magnet that like just gets everything using it like oh my goodness like it turns out we needed you know incredible data availability over here and we could detach the execution layer and like what we were building is perfect for that you know right maybe it's a game maybe like some crazy ass game is like you play in the virtual Warcraft world or whatever and like it's separately is storing your items and like that's some game is like the perfect use case that just like gets crazy throughput on both of those systems yeah I think that's kind of the story I actually expect to play out more where it's an app that gets too big for an existing chain and instead of doing a ronin or instead of doing you know a cosmos chain as you've kind of seen the past approaches they do their own uh roll up and that's sort of the the new ammo yeah I mean another way of viewing Roll-Ups is like the Rodin chain without without with better security assumptions than any of the Ronin validators made right like like it's like you don't have to figure that stuff out on your own as like yield application Dev right and and I think that is actually very powerful in the long run for applications I find some product some form of initial fit but then outgrow their initial substrate and that's why I think like it's hard it's hard to say for these big L ones because like they haven't had applications that have really exhausted them like other than sort of spam mints how can you say that they didn't get it no no I mean they have they haven't had like full game type things right like like Dark Forest was on X die it was not on you know things that actually have like Dynamics these games are on these other chains they couldn't possibly be on L1 without exhausting it correct correct but my point is that they there's sort of this thing of like I do feel like people are trying right now the design pattern is so you try on test night you try on mainnet and then you figure out if you need more resources but I think the the question of like when when the transition is so like you try on testnet you try on your own chain and then you have some of it you know some of the the logic back right that that design pattern we don't see yet and like if we see that I think that's you could view them also in some ways as like a a in between Tesla and mainnet that's like continuous continuously it seems yeah yeah I think it's it's more likely maybe that it's like okay you start with test net you start with a roll up then you decide whether you want to go mainnet or whether you want to go to your own you know roll up or your own modular or something something or other uh whatever we're calling these things now it's apparently roll up it's not a not a not the preferred nomenclature interesting I guess the the big thing after all this conversation um by the way I'm surprised we spent so long talking about this because I thought this would be a very short I didn't think there'd be much meat on this bone but it looks like there's quite a lot I guess the biggest thing is like look guys you're all very smart talking about Roll-Ups and whether Roll-Ups are really Roll-Ups or not a blah blah blah but like to Tom's Point like please can we get our Collective brain power focus on applications because right now like blockchains still suck we we still don't have anything to do so uh that'd be awesome if we can refocus on the like let's find things to do with blockchains we just have to put a hundred million player game on top of you know a modular blockchain and we're good that maybe that maybe that's it maybe we're just waiting for the modularity before yeah tell us tell us what game it is yeah yeah Tom what's your favorite game again and how do we get that onto a modular blog I think we're probably still a few years away from from something like that happen yeah I'm optimistic I I yeah I want to say my my friend is uh one of the early Engineers on Valor and Ed Riot and he despises blockchains so I don't think valorent is uh is uh is coming right yeah yeah I was gonna say it is funny people love doing the whole like oh we'll make a market for trading skins uh for you know game XYZ which is I mean it is a thing for Counter-Strike because Steven steem and valve allow that but it's not a thing for Valor and it's like a touchy point where it's like you spend money on it skins and it's gone forever you don't get it back hmm interesting okay all right guys well hopefully next week there'll be a little more news for us to dig into but uh I think we're up on time you know I I gotta say um sometimes these random episodes are good because they draw out the animal spirits and and just to close this out with one final thought if you know anybody in the Red Bull marketing department or an advertising agency that works with them and you have an ability to get them to sponsor tarun or The Chopping Block get in touch with us um we we don't run ads on the show but we will run Red Bull ads I will 100 Run Red bullets look thank you I appreciate it this would be amazing okay awesome well I'm glad I'm glad we were able to end that with with the you know addressing the tension between you and me tarun I think that's a it's a good note to end the show on it's good I'll send you some red bulls for your birthday so that you can you two can you can learn give it give me addictive that sounds great all right see you everybody [Music]
