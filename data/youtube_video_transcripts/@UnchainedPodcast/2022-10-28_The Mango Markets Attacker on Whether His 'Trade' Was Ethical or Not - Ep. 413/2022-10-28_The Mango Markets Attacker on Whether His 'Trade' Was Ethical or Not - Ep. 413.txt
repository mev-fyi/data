Avi hey so I should let listeners know that Avi agreed to chat with me as long as I did not ask him direct questions about what happened on Mango markets so I'm just going to give a little bit of an explication for those of you who don't know what happened here some people call this a hack some of them called this a market manipulation Avi uh tweeted uh that he believed it was a highly profitable trading strategy essentially what happened is that Avi and a team he was working with took out 114 million dollars on Mango markets that was not meant to be taken out by them um the way that this happened was that he essentially had a loan and he drove up the price of the collateral so that he was able to take out much much larger loans which effectively wiped out all the value on Mango markets um you know a slightly more detailed description is he just funded One account with 5 million usdc then he offered 483 million units of minko perps he founded a second account with 5 million usdc collateral and then took out a huge long position that moved the price of the mngo spot market and that was what enabled him to take out the huge amount of loans and effectively drain mango markets Avi this kind of thing happens a lot in D5 where there's kind of an intent behind the code and then a way that the code actually works that differs from that intent and as we just mentioned some people would have said what you did was a hack or Market manipulation you called it a highly profitable trading strategy so in general how do you view these events when the way the code actually functions is different from the intent so first of all I think a lot of these uh just speaking in generalities sometimes it's very unclear what the intents might have been sometimes the codes doesn't match the docs sometimes attacks say something and it's just not implemented and uh sometimes the code does exactly what was intended it's just what was intended isn't what anyone wanted which is which there's a couple of different lines like for a learning platform they're willing to lend whatever the price of the token is there's no intent that this it kind of explicitly depends on what the current price of the token is there's no intent that the price of the token should be non-volatile there's no it's hard to say oh the intent was that the token pressure never change I mean crypto prices change all the time so it's kind of hard to even Define where your intent is in somebody's partly reject the premise here so you are saying that essentially because the loan was taken at the time that the price of mngo was reflected you know at what other people perceived to be this unfair manipulated price that you are saying that was the price and therefore taking that amount of of loans was like a fair and square deal or or any situation that resembles this well I think in general you'd have to Define if they if a protocol uses for example the 12 then their intent is that the average price of a particular token over a particular period of time is what they're going to price off both protocol uses a spot price twop is time weighted average prices I forget what that's right okay an average price over a period of time um or some protocols we'll use the instant price it won't take an average but whatever methodology they use to determine the price um that's what that tent is now if if you were able to get it to recognize a price that didn't reflect what the actual average price was or what the actual spot price was then you could then it could be said that you're doing something that doesn't reflect the intent but it's actual price was that way um under whatever rules they had and it's not clear what it means to say they're not it doesn't reflect the intent it sounds like I mean again this goes back to how in your Tweet you said that you felt that this was a highly profitable trading strategy and maybe this takes us to sort of the next kind of event in this story which was that you then made a proposal to return 67 million dollars to investors as long as they agreed to a condition which we'll talk about later but just overall like when because it's you know this isn't the first time that a hacker has returned some of the money so why do you think that people who are in this type of situation offer to return some amount of it back um I mean I can't speak for anyone else in this case as I stated publicly or wanted to ensure that other users weren't hurt and so I helped uh negotiate the settlement and make sure that everyone all the users of the platform would be able to withdraw even though the platform was technically insolvent and so why not do something a little bit more similar to what someone like Samsung does where you know you identified something in the code that would enable one person to you know kind of profit from it at the expense of others and with Sam you know as I'm sure you're aware he often will either warn the community about these kinds of potential attacks or he'll try to more often he'll try to rescue the money before someone can exploit those situations so why not approach it that way instead um I think he's mostly looking at different kinds of stuff I'm like I'm also looking at arbitrages and trades and he seems to be looking more for exploits so I don't know that it's Darkly comparable you know also if you believed that what you did was legal then why is it that you decided to return some of this money uh for what I said before earlier on that I wanted to ensure that the uh users would be able to with withdraw and access their funds okay well one other thing I wanted to ask was there was a condition that you had on returning the money which was that mango should repay some bad debt that it used to save soland in June yeah that's a misconception I think some some wanted some firm told us to one of the journalists and just went everywhere and it has no reality the the uh as far as I know mango did not have significant death debt as of a couple of weeks ago prior to whatever happened someone's think it's just a uh working from yeah the the settlement was just was related to um the the current insolvency or or the insolvency uh as a few weeks ago um it was trying to make sure that users would be able to recover funds um deposit at the time had nothing to do with so and nothing to do with the the the the account that moved over from there that wasn't below okay and so in general when we see these kinds of situations you proposed what some people view as an extremely high Bounty amount and I was curious for your thoughts on how these kinds of bounty amounts should be decided I mean I don't really view it that way I think Bounty is kind of more relevant to different situations so what term would you use the ultimate agreement as I said was a settlement to ensure that users would be able to recover funds and the exchange would remain capitalized to continue operations but it's not uh it's just something that all the parties were able to agree on okay yeah and ultimately it was 47 million that was decided upon that you and your team would receive is that correct uh it's somewhat more complicated than that because of initial capital and other various things and I can't really comment down to specific numbers okay right I think I saw some commentary that you had spent about 10 million on the attack therefore it would ultimately be 37 million um okay so in a moment we're going to talk about some other conversations that were happening around this event but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible for years you've heard about the promise of blockchain technology and yet High fees security risks and unreliable chains have been the reality it doesn't have to be this way Avalanche believes innovators deserve web3 infrastructure they can count on with the flexibility and tooling to build anything they want any way they want chosen by global leaders like KKR Deloitte lemonade and MasterCard Avalanche has built a strong reputation as one of the world's fastest most reliable blockchains to learn more about Avalanche visit avox.network or follow on Twitter at Avalanche avox explore the platform millions are using for its speed stability and scalability Avalanche create Without Limits back to my conversation with Avi [Music] um so I was curious you know one of the conditions was that the Dow agree that no criminal investigations would be pursued against you or your team and I was wondering what your thoughts were on how much influence Dows really have over that kind of situation yeah I I can't comment uh on the on the legal aspects of this and we've just said I'm an agreement and the terms of that are out there so it will account beyond that okay and I was also curious and this is probably also for other people in a similar situation to you but what are your thoughts on you know people who I guess perpetrate these types of economic attacks or these um you know types of arbitrages what are your thoughts on how comfortable they should be about coming out and claiming that they were part of those trades I mean I think when there's any uh profitable Trader is going to attract some jealousy and some hate and like you look at uh some of the stuff people say about Sam um and uh he's obviously made billions of dollars uh with various other profits yeah yes and he gets lots of hate uh wrecked had a whole had a whole article Colin came out recently yeah if you're out there in your public you're kind of painting a Target at yourself but uh here's what it is so you feel basically people are going to hate on them anyway so they should feel comfortable just owning who they are is that the conclusion yeah I mean I have a post uh for almost a year ago talked about something like some of my uh profitable arbitrages nft swipe sniping and uh interest rate arbitrages and other lending protocols and uh yeah some people aren't happy remember when I was when I was hoping nfts people who are annoyed because uh the Bots which I was running about was making it harder for people to to to win their own gas Wars and so I was getting ahead of them and there's a lot of things for that for for scalpers just like if you ever look through the Farms there's always hate for like ticket sculptures well there's some some selection of people just don't like seeing other people make money is what it is that is true actually I'll I'll definitely agree with that so I was curious can you just talk a little bit more about your history with crypto and you know how you came to be so just highly skilled and knowledgeable about defy so I've been coding for a long time just kind of as a hobby and I got it to crypto uh early 2021 I was thinking of prediction markets a lot of fun on poly Market back in the day uh their their prediction Market on polygon um and then I started looking into yield farming I started looking into nfts back when they took off last year and I just kept researching and get how Erp 1559 Works which is which was key to uh the nft sleeping you have to figure out you know how to cut the cheapest gas possible I had to figure out yeah how different chains worked it's everything moved so fast last year that it was everything was kind of happening at once and you just have to learn all the protocols um and then over time you kind of just get used to it and there's less and less novelty and every new protocol is you know a copy of the same three protocols so it takes less and less time to pick up oh and then you just you find the loopholes you find the Arbitrage is oh and uh if there are very wide variety of Trades as a you can see from my blogs and my tweets you know I have to say that I'm absolutely amazed that you only got into crypto in early 2021. yeah well that's when I got really serious when I was like 19 I think I was doing arbitrages between coinbase and circle back when Circle used to sell Bitcoin was like you would buy Bitcoin for 500 and then you would sell it for 5005 and circle and and send it back to the bank this was I don't know 2014 2015 something like that and then I gave it all up and I quit and I sold all my Bitcoins um and now they're uh way higher um and then I kind of got back in uh last year when was that period when you sold like 2015 2016 or something or I was doing this Arbitrage and let me think I remember looking back at my emails like at one point I had 13 Bitcoins when they were worth two hundred dollars and then I think I had like three Bitcoins kind of left over and then they had this incredible pump and I sold only because of 2500 so that would have been I guess early 2017 during the first kind of oryx that's the second Bill run the first kind of institutional one and then I I said no okay yeah I'll take my eight grand or something and uh and uh I went into other other areas um and then look at crypto for a few years where the crypto went down I would say hopefully it goes below 2500 so I can feel good about uh you know self and if we never went like the lowest I went was what three thousand in in March 2020. I hope so uh well I you know so you talked about how you've been a coder all your life and I was curious because when you tweeted that you were taking responsibility for this maneuver Ari Paul tweeted a friendly suggestion to you that you quote spend your talent building instead of playing zero sum or negative games and then he said that he felt you would have a lot more pride in what you had done with your life in the future you responded something about how you've already thought about this can you elaborate on that um yeah so I mean I talked about uh my earlier e-commerce business which uh was building but that kind of got destroyed how uh so it's there's still some active litigation so I don't want to get into too much detail on that but basically uh we were selling uh two million dollars a year on Amazon in one of our competitors just shut this down and build Amazon false things about uh the the quality of the products and got that camp shut down and that business was over basically very nasty world out there so basically that kind of made you feel that it was impossible to make a living in you know what Ari would call like a a not zero-sum game is that what you're I think it's definitely possible it's just very hard to actually enforce your rights legal system is extremely slow I guess I I feel that once I had that experience I'm just gonna if I'm happy to get into any industry any any area um and of nuts so concerned about building distinction just doesn't feel that I need to care about that I care about running um my business and trades and whatever properly and make sure everything's by the book but I don't see this kind of artificial filter distinction doesn't really seem relevant to me so I mean you know you've argued in our conversation you know that what you did was was just a trade or an Arbitrage but as I'm sure you're aware a lot of people as I mentioned view this as Market manipulation I mean you're here on this interview but like you're wearing sunglasses you know I'm sure you're aware that people would at least view what you're doing as being more like a gray hat hack if not you know flat out black hat hack and and like you said you know you would do this interview as long as you didn't have to actually talk about the event so it doesn't that sort of show that you understand that there's some risk here and that maybe this isn't fully on the up and up I mean I can't talk about that because there's a settlements agreement that I said and go to details on that unfortunately okay well let's talk about something else which is that this week compound decided to pause four assets that have low Market liquidity and basically that was because they didn't want to um have the kind of uh event that happened on manko markets and I was curious to hear your thoughts on the fact that you know essentially what you did with mango markets is what prompted this change I guess that and maybe I mean I I was also tweeting uh various potential trades and other and others I think that it's good that uh the various big protocols have taken a closer look and decided to clear off some of their lower quality collateral um I'm a heavy user of some of these other particular if you severally many good trades with other and uh I'm happy that they're they're starting to clean up their risk exposures even though that basically removes these kinds of opportunities for you well I've had many other trade Arbitrage on info from a year ago if you have to power UST extremely profitable um recently I I did this great uh FW um airdrop play without a uh just borrowed a few Million worth of F and then before the mortgage after the wars I got this free FW that I could tell you're like a mini Kevin Zoe there's uh I was just had a lot of cool opportunities over the year I want them to get trained all right well last question is there any particular message that you have for the D5 Community or the crypto community in general I don't think sorry no oh like nothing about maybe I guess shoddy construction of these smart contracts that enable these opportunities nothing like that I mean I have opinions on and all the stuff but I don't have this any kind of overarching narrative all right well is there anything else that I didn't ask you that you'd want to say no okay well thank you so much for coming on Unchained

the launch of reddit's nft marketplace in July users of the platform have created 3 million wallets according to Reddit Chief product officer polybot the methods by which the social media platform achieved this adoption in such a short time caught the attention of many the company's strategy was to avoid blockchain terms like crypto or nfts Reddit refers to nfts as digital Collectibles and only briefly mentions that they will be available on the blockchain with some more user-friendly approach trading volumes have soared over the past few days reaching a sales volume of 2.5 million dollars on Monday Kane and Linder co-founder and CEO of gaming company Stardust told the block I think that decontextualization that these are just games these are just Collectibles these are just items you can take from one game to another it's going to make this technology so much more accessible updated policy terms give Apple a hefty cut of nft app purchases Tech Giant Apple updated its app store policy terms to give more clarity on how to sell nfts and crypto within the iOS ecosystem as per the new terms applications offering trading of nfts will be restricted from including buttons external links or other calls to action that direct consumers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchases although apple is showing interest in working with crypto assets it seems determined to get its share which is 30 of all in-app purchases a fee that has long been criticized Daniel Mason partner at framework Ventures tweeted that this decision harms nft marketplaces like openc and Magic Eden or quote anyone trying to get in the payment flow Mr Mason also mentioned that the winners are likely to be crypto exchanges web 3 games and infrastructure providers nft royalty drama continues looks rare an nft Marketplace on ethereum decided to remove mandatory royalties from its platform joining others like pseudoswap x2y2 and Magic Eden instead each quarter the protocol will distribute to creators 25 of the platform fees charged by looks rare the pseudonymous looks rare co-founder known as guts said with this change looks rare wants to Buck the trend with our solution that actually enforces income for creators while still remaining attractive to Traders with an effectively zero fee offering it's a way to turn all that zero royalty volume into something that still benefits the creators in related news a new research report from Galaxy digital showed that Nike and Yuga labs are the entities that earned it the most in nft royalties raising the question of whether small creators or big corporations benefit from royalties maker dial partners with coinbase but not everyone is on board OG decentralized lending protocol maker dough had some interesting developments this week first the community ratified a coinbase partnership which consists of depositing 1.6 billion dollars worth of makers usdc into coinbase Prime the exchange's institutional arm in this way maker will earn a 1.5 annual yield which will account for a 24 million dollars of Revenue per year the decision was not supported by everyone in the makered out Community Chris black a recognized delegate and Community member tweeted The Proposal quote will permanently end maker Dow's claims of decentralization and censorship resistance second a governance proposal was passed to support the end game plan of roon Christensen the founder of makerdale as a consequence the Dell will break into smaller units called meta-dows with the intention of building a more decentralized project lastly the community also voted in favor of a plan to accumulate staked ether or steath lydo's liquid staking derivative of eth a jump in prices triggers talk of a bull market the crypto markets experienced some relief for a couple of days after weeks of falling prices ethereum jumped by 20 in the past seven days reaching pre-merge price levels meanwhile the price of Bitcoin Rose eight percent in the same period and the total crypto market cap surpassed the one trillion dollar Mark once again this rally wiped out almost 1 billion dollars worth of short positions and already triggered talks of an incoming bull market a potential reason why Eve has outperformed the market is that the token has gone deflationary over the past few weeks with its Supply getting close to pre-merge levels the market share of Bitcoin against all coins hit a two-year high this week some believe that this is a good sign for all coins since BTC usually leads the way prior to an altcoin pump cryptotrader and analyst Arthur Hayes thinks this pump in the markets has to do with the possibility of the U.S treasury quote supplying the market with more short-term t-bills to alleviate a shortage other people mentioned perhaps jokingly that the reason the prices spiked was the publication of Matt Levine's 40 000 word article on crypto however that seems quite unlikely since other Assets in traditional financial markets also experienced massive gains despite prices rising in the past few days there's still a long way to go to recover all these losses recently news broke that VC firm a16z's first crypto fund is down 40 percent in the first half of the Year additionally Pantera Capital One of the big players in the industry has also suffered significant losses Pantera's early stage token fund has lost 71 percent of its value since the beginning of the year according to the block the debate about how to regulate crypto spices up last week FTX CEO Sam binkman freed published an industry Norms manual in which he proposed enforcing regulation on D5 protocols via their front ends thus setting off a heated debate on crypto regulation in a long rebuttal Eric Voorhees founder and CEO of shapeshift said that benkman Freed's proposal would put crypto on a path to tyranny however SBF claimed that his plan is quote better than the status quo and better than we're likely to get Gabriel Shapiro general counsel at Delphi Labs disagreed with sbo's take on the difficulty of determining whether a website is a broker saying mere websites must not be regulated broker dealers Shapiro and bergenfreed have agreed to come on Unchained to debate everything about crypto regulation if you have any questions for them slide into my DMs speaking of Regulation this week's Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler claimed there is centralization in the crypto Market speaking at the annual meeting of the Securities industry and financial markets Association he said we've seen even centralization in the crypto Market which was founded on the idea of decentralization this field actually has significant concentration among intermediaries in the middle of the market moreover lawmakers Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria ocasio-cortez sent a letter to several agencies with concerns about former Regulators working in the crypto industry in particular 28 SEC officials and 15
