based on those more slimmed down indictment I would say several weeks definitely obviously more than a week will take a while to select a jury here you know this is a complex case in the sense of you know it's sprawling and I would suspect several weeks a lot is going to hinge on whether Sam testifies because if he testifies that's going to be probably several days two and they might have their own experts so it wouldn't surprise me if this trial was you know two to three weeks I don't know what the estimates they've given now they might give some new estimates based on the new indictment that's something the judge will be Keen to know because when they call the jury and they're going to have a large jury pool here they'll probably do a questionnaire they're going to need to know that people are available for those periods of times most cases don't last weeks and weeks right um and annika's high profile this is you know setting aside the Trump case which is consuming all the oxygen in the room this is one of the most high profile criminal trials have me
