with the code Laura Link in the description today's guest is Anita Posh Bitcoin educator founder of Bitcoin for fairness and author of learn Bitcoin welcome Anita hi Laura thank you very much for the invitation I'm honored to be here I'm excited to have you you work on so many different things related to bitcoin why don't you just give us an overview of your work yeah I guess it's almost too much sometimes for my personal life so yeah I my main focus is on bitcoin education and I founded a non-profit initiative called Bitcoin for fairness which brings uh knowledge or shares knowledge with people on the ground in the global South and um the last year I spent around eight months in southern African countries to support local initiatives with building Bitcoin communities meetups and of course uh to share knowledge there and and build knowledge on the ground and um two years ago I published a book called learn Bitcoin which is a book for beginners which basically speeds you up from zero to a self-custody um Bitcoin holder so a real Bitcoin holder and um yeah and besides that I'm part of the C4 cryptocurrency um certification Consortium uh Bitcoin professional um how is it called committee so I also helped there to establish standards of education and knowledge of uh Bitcoin for people in the professional space and at the moment I'm just building a online learning program maybe we can talk about that later so I do a lot of things and also I'm testing wallets for instance in in your rural areas in Zimbabwe and see if they are working or not and um yeah so I I try to contribute my part uh to to the Bitcoin adoption and Bitcoin education and yeah that's what I actually spent on every day on almost and how did you get into Bitcoin but it was early 2017. and I was working in web development and web platform development and online products for about 20 years online marketing and built little businesses I was an entrepreneur and I always had the feeling or um I was looking for something that I'm really really really interested in I mean internet marketing Etc I liked it I loved it but then after 20 years it felt boring and I also we we built we built online platforms uh for designers for people who have small businesses so we had something like Etsy in Austria when Etsy wasn't even in Austria and when we built that tool I realized how difficult it was back then to let people pay over the internet in your shop and we had to pay upfront like 3 000 Euros or something just to get the possibility to do that so I learned how complicated that is and how much yeah permissions you need basically and how many much friction is in that system and how much how expensive it is and so um in 2016 I thought to myself how I I want to do something else and something that's a little makes more sense for the world than just sell stuff and then I stumbled upon Bitcoin and I was uh drawn to it because very early I I think I understood because I had a great teacher in Andreas Antonopoulos for instance that Bitcoin is a tool for Freedom um and it gives people like me for instance I'm a lesbian I was born in Austria 53 years ago already and the first 30 years of my life I didn't have the same rights as all the other people and also my grandparents came from Bohemia you know they they passed borders they became austrians we had hyperinflation a hundred years ago in Austria too and also they told me a lot about the Nazis in in Austria and how life was for them and how shocking the change was suddenly when when when the Nazis came to Austria and all these kinds of things I think came you know sort together my life story what I experienced so far and that Bitcoin can be one of the solutions for people who are disempowered who are outlawed The Misfits you know basically Bitcoin is for them because no one can take it away from you it gives you the freedom to interact without anyone that can hinder you and and that's what I saw and that's what I thought is a a life-changing tool basically we didn't have that in hundreds of thousands of years an invention like that and so I was greatly drawn to that and that's I think where I take my energy from from that um discrimination that I felt here and I think that for many many many people in other countries life is much worse than for me and so I think even more for them it's a tool for Liberal Liberation and that's why I work so hard and how did you like when you first got into Bitcoin like you said you had been doing uh web development and so how did you go from that to bitcoin education because I think your initiative in Africa I think it only started in I don't know 2021 or 2022. yeah you just started it when I met you in 2022. that was Bitcoin for fairness I just started that uh half a year before okay so so so from 2017 on I had to learn myself that was the first thing so I still did the marketing stuff and the web design stuff and um um at the same time I taught myself and I learned a lot about Bitcoin I did the University of Nicosia online uh how is it called curriculum and course um to learn more and I very early started to write my first book my first learn Bitcoin book because I thought you can learn the most if you have to understand everything to write it down for other people to learn it and also I had a lot of good feedback I I asked people who were much more knowledgeable about it back then as I was and they helped me and then one of the first things I also did was I translated Andreas Antonopoulos the internet of money to German and learned lot with that of course and I very early in 2018 end of 2018 or something like that I did my first Bitcoin seminars in Austria and then also a online course in German so and then I took on the podcast because that was actually the first bigger thing where I think people in the English speaking World got to know me so I did like 160 interviews with all sorts of people from the Bitcoin space Edinburgh Andreas Antonopoulos James lope yeah on and on to learn the Anita pass show which I apparently have suspended or paused or something it's paused because because I was in Africa and in Zimbabwe I didn't have internet I could not record something like this it's just it's not possible so I stopped doing it but I want to start again and um so and in 2020 um or let me let me go back a little bit like I said in 2017 2018 everyone was talking about how Bitcoin can be a tool uh against hyper inflation a hedge against inflation for instance in Venezuela or in Zimbabwe and I always was like aha that's interesting and I have a friend who's living in Zimbabwe and then I thought okay so if I think that Bitcoin is a tool of Liberation for people in these countries for people who are living under authoritarian leaders and against inflation then I have to go there and see if anyone is really using it because the bitcoiners are talking about it so I focused also in my podcast uh on the global South and on Argentina Venezuela I had guests from these countries and then in early 2020 before the pandemic started I visited my friend for four weeks in Zimbabwe uh to understand the problems there in real life because you know we're always talking about it yeah and it's like if you're not there and if you don't really see it if you don't feel it if you don't have to calculate each day the price of goods again and the next day it's different than the day before um if you don't feel that yourself I think you can't really understand the problems of the people and that was the first time I went there I also went to Botswana to meet with alakanani tiriling who founded the Satoshi Center in Botswana I think as early as in 2015 or maybe even earlier so she's a real Pioneer also also and then I went back to Austria because I still had my my place here my apartment and everything but I knew uh that I want to go uh into that direction and um like after the the travel plans were lifted I started traveling again to El Salvatore when the Bitcoin was introduced there and then I realized you know I mean podcasting is awkward good and fine but um whereas the real education happening I mean podcasts are great for Education yeah but there are so many now I think it's even also difficult to to get to to have an audience there and when I saw in Zimbabwe that uh there is some sort of adoption yes some people are knowledgeable about Bitcoin and are using it but the vast amount of people is not and there are so many scams down there everyone knows Bitcoin really if you you can ask any any they know it but everyone will ask you but is it not a scam because everyone has been scammed but at least knows someone and when I was there the last time I was living in a house and the maid there's still people have mates there came to me because she saw a Bitcoin flyer on my desk and she said to me ah can you tell me what what is this Bitcoin you are doing something with it and I said yeah I mean it's it's imagine it's like cash only digital and your government can take it away from you and and she said now and I said why are you asking and she said I'm in a WhatsApp group and suddenly someone sent me a message message saying to me give me fifty dollars now and in three weeks you get a hundred dollars oh my God and she said yeah and she said that can't be right can it and I said no yeah so people are bombarded with emails like with messages like that and I have seen so many people who've lost money and that's really sickening and um I think that's also why I try to get more and more and more education on the ground there so that people can share the knowledge with their own peers and things like that wow and so is your sense that the efforts that you are making are I mean you know obviously I'm sure what what you're doing is true Bitcoin education in the sense that you're educating people about the technology and like understanding you know what this is um but is your sense that a lot of the activity in those places is yeah more of like using it to perpetrate scams uh I mean yeah that can be I mean I I but I can't I can't estimate that I mean using the name Bitcoin to do scams of course yes they are using yeah all using that name uh but it's not Bitcoin what they sell of course I definitely also a big amount of like um exchanging dollars into Bitcoin because people who have dollars and no Bitcoin know uh that Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation of their own Zimbabwean dollar and also the US dollar also has inflation yeah um but I also saw that a lot of people want to get hold of Bitcoin is a sort of a small investment for themselves and of course um the the writ of usage as um it means to be able to uh to send money in and out of the country is uh going up as well because Zimbabwe for instance is a country where you have very strict uh Financial exchange controls and also you can't easily easily send money in and out of the country I mean first no one wants to Zimbabwe dollar I mean I wouldn't want it you know uh the U.S dollar is mostly in in banknotes they only have banknotes so I mean that's the next thing you only have one dollar notes and when you go into a shop and something is like 30 US dollar cents you don't get 70 cents back you get a small goodie or something um yeah so they are using like like in the war times in Austria when people use cigarettes as money you don't get any cash back so I know people in Zimbabwe for instance who have Freelancers in other African countries and it's not easy to send money in and out of the country and they told me you know when I send my freelancer in I say Malawi three or four times money via uh mobile money or other providers the government comes and asks me what I'm doing with that money why am I sending that money out and with Bitcoin I mean she immediately could send the money from her wallet to the guy's wallet and no problem yeah uh less cost less less friction can't be censored nobody is questioning why she's doing that and another big story in Zimbabwe is foreign exchange control also means that if you for instance a business in Zimbabwe and you want to buy goods from South Africa or another country you can't do that with Zimbabwean dollar so you need US dollar and then you have to go to the Central Bank of Zimbabwe and say I would like to buy let's say 10 000 US dollars because I need them to to buy the goods from South Africa and every week is an auction in the Central Bank where the Central Bank decides on the value of the exchange rate from the Zimbabwe dollar to the US dollar so it's decided it's totally controlled and then when you get your US dollar granted so you are allowed to exchange it it's not that you as the business owner get the money and you pay your partner in South Africa no the central bank is paying you on your behalf huh um wait so they sort of like function as almost like a PayPal or something yeah basically they're like the intermediary yeah the central bank is then the intermediary and sometimes they they don't pay in the in the in the uh in the time that's been needed you know they don't pay fast enough and then you are your partner in South Africa says okay I cancel your your order because you didn't pay so it's so many problems there with money that Bitcoin is definitely a solution to that yeah but the knowledge is very small still yeah but I I mean I do have a question though because in that in some of these instances where you're talking that you're talking about it seems that they would want to be paid in their local currency so why not use something like a stable coin because like what if the value Has Changed by the time they receive the Bitcoin what and like what if it's less than the agreed upon price what happens in those instances the thing is first to to the topic of stable coins um I was told that a lot of people use stable coins they use Teva so they do either when they say crypto or they they want crypto they either want tether or Bitcoin they want Bitcoin as an investment to save it and they want tether to use it that's effect right yeah that's what I meant like if they're paying yeah they okay they definitely also use tether yes uh but to the topic of uh volatility um I mean yes sure Bitcoin is volatile but it gets less and less you know like at the moment it it said I don't know seven twenty seven thousand or so since weeks or months so if you would in that period of time receive it and then use it immediately then you have not a lot of volatility because also what's also a thing is many people receive Bitcoin or maybe tell them from abroad and then they exchange it to US dollar because um everyone takes US dollar but not everyone accepts tether or Bitcoin of course right yet right so then you also don't have volatility you know if you use it as a medium of Exchange okay so tell me more about the different Bitcoin communities and the different countries in Africa like I think you focused on four countries correct me if that was incorrect but you know like how big generally are these Bitcoin communities what is the demographic makeup like and I think you said you were focusing on rural areas which seems counterintuitive no no no no okay that's a misunderstanding no I'm not focusing on rural areas because okay you can't do that because there's mostly no good internet connection it's I mean where I lived where I said before I stopped using video calls because it was not I couldn't do podcasts anymore but still in the capital in Harare for instance you can have very real internet you know like for sending text messages and using WhatsApp and things like that um okay but in rural areas of course it's more difficult um so we were also in a rural area and we had to buy a a certain an extra dish to an extra receiver to receive uh mobile data and it wasn't working so it would be I don't I I I sometimes see people doing these educational efforts in rural areas trying to build a local uh circular Community a circular economy with Bitcoin and to be honest I don't think if you're too far away and there are not enough people um it might not be working at the beginning in at this time you know so I focus on the urban areas so on people who in general have much less than we do in general yeah like it's a generalization but on average uh like let's say maybe doctors or teachers in Zimbabwe I mean a doctor in Zimbabwe working in a hospital earns three hundred dollars a month and most of them they don't they don't get it in dollars they get it in Zimbabwe dollar I focus on the people who understand money in that sense and also however understanding of the problems that they really have and and and are open to Solutions and they have a smartphone and they can afford to have internet because otherwise uh it doesn't make any sense but describe those communities like um you know do they tend to be younger people or you know why are they interested and like how big are these communities and even if there are differences between the different African countries in terms of their Bitcoin communities that would be interesting um there are definitely differences between the countries I've visited so South Africa Zambia Zimbabwe and Ghana so I I would like to start with South Africa maybe South Africa is the most western African country they have a very Progressive or um they already have installed regulations on bitcoin and um there's a guy in Mossel Bay Mossel Bay is about a few hours uh on the Garden Route um from Cape Town and um he has a soft school and uh where he has been educating children from a near Township um with where like 5 000 people are living he always invited the children to the surf school so uh and they did um lectures when I it's like like sort of school and then uh he found out about Bitcoin and then he heard about Bitcoin beach in El Salvador and um he thought so if I'm doing education already and I'm convinced that Bitcoin can help also the poor people why don't I start an educational initiative in the same surf school and that's where Bitcoin ikazi started and Bitcoin and Cassie is now a community where I think from let's say about 15 uh shops these small shops inside the township I think 12 except Bitcoin now and the great thing is that it's not only education um the the senior coaches who live in the township themselves they not only teach surfing they also teach about Bitcoin and they went to the shops and tried to onboard them and the first person who accepted Bitcoin in a shop uh was a woman she's called no sihle and she only got uh convinced because lusando said to her look I show you I can buy something with this digital money and then he showed her how how she he can buy mobile phone credits via betray Phil I think that was what he did and then she said okay you really can buy something okay I try and she was the first and now it's I think 12 shops out of 15 and the coaches earn their salary in Bitcoin so they go up where they live they spend the money on groceries in the shops in the township or they go to the barber and things like that and in May this year I think or maybe it was a little bit earlier um Pick and Pay which is is the biggest supermarket chain in South Africa started accepting lightning Bitcoin and that meant that the people in the township also the shops they now can go to pick and pay and restock and use the Bitcoin if they want to for me it's uh one of the greatest Community uh showing that um Bitcoin can also support poor people in a in a circle economy the people there of course they are very young um that the children get taught a little bit you're like playful they sometimes get some satoshis when they did something very well to motivate them to learn more and then they go with their wallet to the small uh spasser shops and buy a Coke or something like that so they really use it then so it's young people there in Zambia we started a community because I was approached by a guy who is living in Zambia and he knew me from Twitter and he saw I'm going to Zimbabwe and he wrote me a message and said can you please also come to Zambia we need your work here and then I thought yeah why not so we communicated a little bit and then I decided also to go to Zambia and it worked out really well because uh we did a a talk at the University of Zambia they even organized a real media tour for me so I was at radio stations TV stations speaking about Bitcoin education and from that um the community grew and we have a group now I would say about 70 people or something um and they're doing monthly meetups in Lusaka and now there's even two young ladies who founded Bitcoin panamayo which is a educational Initiative for women especially because they said uh I mean yeah Bitcoin is great our friends told us but why are there are only men and they are like 20 or 22 Yeah so so and Bitcoin for fairness we want to support them in in doing that like with connections with uh showing them hey here is giza.com you can ask for donations here for your educational work you can do it this way in that way and and so forth so it's mostly young people they we also have some people would say more my age or something but more uh younger people in Zimbabwe it's a little bit different in Zimbabwe everything is more difficult because in Zambia you already have uh registered and official exchanges for instance so the the regulation is they are friendly and people are okay with saying I'm using Bitcoin in Zimbabwe not so much because the regime of course doesn't want you to use Bitcoin because then you basically Escape yeah from there um yeah cruel regime let's say it like that they can't steal your money anymore um and it's also a very young Community but I also met with people who are also more my age but I think they don't really get the thing that Bitcoin is really a money or can be used or is being used in exchange for something yeah they are more into the investment thing I want to make money with it or something like that but that's that's not my focus so and and it's always good to know the people you know um Bitcoin in Zimbabwe is very much in many African countries but especially in Zimbabwe it's very much peer-to-peer there is no official exchange you can't exchange Bitcoin anyhow because there is basically a a let's say a half ban on bitcoin uh in that the government and Central Bank said Banks and financial institutions are not allowed to use Bitcoin or interact with Bitcoin but people are allowed to but still with that regime you never know I know of someone they used Bitcoin we worked together and that was a little bit she had a little bit of publicity with that and she got arrested by the police and questioned where the donations came from that she got um for buying computers for the school she's working in wait I'm confused so but you said Bitcoin is half banned so literally just for transacting in Bitcoin she got arrested yes it's basically like when you uh somehow are able to to get a hold on money with anything you do people are getting jealous they don't want you to and the political regime is asking you where did you get that from because yeah it's it's really it's really very dangerous yeah from that aspect and so that's what I wanted to say is so um you won't see a lot of Bitcoin communities out in the open you know I always say to people um yes I mean you have to be aware if you're on a picture um and someone might know you that might come back back badly for you yeah I hope it doesn't and and all these use of pseudonym don't use your real name when you use Bitcoin um and and be careful but I think also in in Zimbabwe Bitcoin is there to stay because even relatives of the president basically or foreign minister excuse me uh Bitcoin Traders wow yeah so that's really everyone is using it got the scoop here on Unchained um so in a moment we're going to talk about Bitcoin and human rights natural Segway from this topic but first a quick word from the

arbitrim.io today back to my conversation with Anita so I you know this is I really think the perfect segue because um I know you have a lot of thoughts about how Bitcoin enforces several of the 30 articles that are mentioned in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights so can you walk us through you know which ones and how you see it doing that sure yeah for instance uh take the the right to privacy I mean I to be honest before I started the convention of Human Rights I didn't know that this is written down in the convention I mean it's not a law nothing but in principle it's a human right to have privacy and where is that on I mean once in the day when we were using letters and sending us letters yeah it was the law that is the secret no one is allowed to open that other than you today we are an open book uh started with like years ago on the internet and and culminated a little bit with Facebook uh but today it's even worse you know with uh now we're on our way to connect Financial transactions with people's identity out in the open and I think that's very very dangerous um a lot of people then always say to me but I have got nothing to hide yeah that's right I I really I hit it very very often and I also say yeah I know I mean I also got nothing to hide and do you know the gay and lesbian people in Zambia also have nothing to hide but nonetheless they are targeted by the government they are thrown in prison their bank accounts get closed and they can't do anything about it they don't have anything to hide too and the same thing is true for 40 54 of the global population who live under authoritarian leaderships they won't be able to exercise uh their freedom of speech which is the next and their freedom of Association when they don't have privacy for at least their communication and their financial transactions I did a which was a highlight for me to be honest in Zambia in April I did a human rights uh Workshop like a sorry a workshop for human rights activists 50 activists from all over Africa came together to get to know tools about activism how can you do your thing you know and one part was uh Financial Freedom and that was the workshop I led where we were talking about Bitcoin and how it can help them um that the money is not being seized anymore that they can send it in and out that they can accept donations from abroad yes that the knowledge is it's sad but it's very small um some of these 50 people already had some Bitcoin but they they the funny thing was they heard about it they used it but they didn't think of it that it's a tool for their work and after the workshop uh like three or four people came up to me and said oh my now I understand because do you know what's happening to us we are flying luggage suitcases full of US Dollars into our countries because otherwise we wouldn't be able to get the money into our countries um or if we get it via bank then the next day the government declares us as a terrorist organization and sees our funds oh my gosh and that's the way how they have to work under these circumstances and if you then have a really uncensorable money that you can in via the the usage you can make it very private at least very private compared to the financial traditional Financial system then you have a tool that enables work against authoritarian leaderships and so on and for your personal rights for your personal freedom so privacy is basically the core of everything if you don't have Financial privacy or privacy in your communication you have nothing it's nothing left we Have No Gray spaces anymore where anyone can fight for their own right or against oppression from anyone you know and and then some people say yeah but okay I mean we are but we're good it's not it's not like that here and then you know I remember the stories of my grandparents saying to me no one believed that this could happen and from one day to the other we were the enemy yeah and China the Nazis yes yes yes so so so they were not they were against the Nazis always so privacy is the core yeah and I have seen you also talk a lot about how Bitcoin could be used to help women specifically um can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on that yeah for instance there are still I think 75 countries in the world that restrict the right for women to own property so and they are not allowed to inherit so they never will have a basis to build upon yeah because you need Securities for instance to get a loan um and I mean it's outrageous and and uh how unfair yes they are not allowed to own money and and property um I mean in Kenya for instance I think it is uh the the women to 75 of the work but earn only like I don't know maybe 25 don't do me that I don't know the exact numbers I can look it up but it's something like that so and I believe that with Bitcoin um these women could not only save small amounts because with lightning you can save like one dollar a month and in the future I'm sure there will be possibilities for micro credits when you have for let's say you have fifty dollars saved in Bitcoin and you have Bitcoin as a collateral because it's a commodity like a property and you can uh use that as a security for let's say a loan for a hundred dollars where the woman then can buy new um how is it called produce or seeds you know to to grow uh their little small business or do anything with it and invest and um there's a very very high rate of these small businesses these women entrepreneurs who pay back these loans and then they can get their security up to 50 in Bitcoin back so I believe that Bitcoin can give uh women property in that sense and also it's a way because a lot of people have smartphones already to hide their own money there uh so that it's not being stolen excuse me by the uh Partners who maybe drink or whatever I mean everyone knows these stories yeah I mean it's not every guy is like that of course yeah but we know these stories um and so I think I think just in that sense uh Bitcoin gives you uh women a lot of power back that they um have been stripped off for thousands of years I would say yeah I think you know Roya my boob who yes yes um she's an Afghan entrepreneur and when I first met her she told a story about how her initial blocking platform where eventually they ended up paying the contributors in Bitcoin because it was in Afghanistan and the women often either didn't have bank accounts or their Partners or family members would confiscate any money they earned she said that once the women learned how to receive Bitcoin and store it in their own wallets you know manage their private Keys Etc there was a woman in an abusive marriage who saved up her Bitcoin and then used it to eventually um yes and file for divorce so you're right you know these things happen and they're um they're hugely empowering for women especially women who are in these kinds of situations um so let's talk a little bit about some other related topics um obviously worldcoin has been in the news a lot recently and I saw you were quite critical of it um you were kind of saying that you felt that they were preying on poorer countries and um I was wondering you know to hear a little bit about your thoughts on what's happening there yeah I I understand to that and I think um it's it's a little bit like for me it's really appalling what they're doing um and I'm very sad about it um because I I have for me it's like you know it's a VC packed it's a company basically yeah um and what they say is they want to bring Universal basic income we are AI to everyone and make the world a fairer place but what we see from reports is what they do yes they offer this 25 World coin tokens and many people exchange that immediately to money like to to the National currency and you know people in African countries are very poor they will take they will do almost everything for 25 tokens and I think it's like they get I don't think I think 30 or something it is uh what they when they exchange it get at the same time I know from from my uh experiences down there and from what I learned uh that people they don't have the time you know the education they don't know what they are giving away and um yes it's been said the uh yeah someone tells them and it explains it I don't believe that and I don't believe that they understand what is meant by that and also the way um that it's a centralized uh organization doing this they give out tokens what's their value um I I heard a clip from one of the co-founders on on your show uh when he said yes and when because of volatility we will do this and that so that is no there is no volatility uh then you see clearly someone has control over that sort of money over that token and as soon as someone has control over it it can't be really fair because people are deciding on it there are VC Founders who have tokens who have invested in that company now they said they are opening it up for governments and other companies therefore what for money of course the goal is to make money and um they might have this um also altruistic moment they might really believe they help someone but I think it's a dangerous path we're on uh and they are exploiting poor people they are also exploiting not to poor people like people in Tokyo and Norway I think they are also going to the orb but it's because I believe they don't know about the the fact how important privacy is they don't see it that way you know they don't understand giving away all this data making us really transparent and connecting every financial transaction that in the end um it will be like in Hong Kong or in China when you do something that the government doesn't want or whatever you are against the political leader or what whatever you're okay then uh you can't buy a ticket for the train anymore uh you are basically free but you're a prisoner in your own country three and this is going to happen with these tools and combine that with some Sam Altman's AI where I also recently uh realized that there are already companies like Zoom for instance who are using our data without telling us to feed the uh to train the AI so it's it's really it's I don't know where this will stop I think it will the problem is I think it won't stop because people really feel that they are not doing something wrong um and that's a big problem yeah he did say on my show that their eventual goal was to decentralize and that's why they have a token it was such I mean I asked him pretty much about all the criticisms I realized later I I did miss one which was about open sourcing the technology but he had an answer for every single thing um which was interesting and yeah even like the amounts allocated to the VCS he was saying that that was low compared to other projects that the VCS need return on investment he had he had an answer for every single question I lobbed at him so it was interesting you should listen if you haven't listened to the whole thing um you should check it out because he seems to believe in what he's doing yes that's what the thing is and did you just mentioned open source because that's also one of my arguments against is that it's not open source now I read they want to open source it now but on the other hand it's really still a centralized entity they can open source what they want maybe they don't open source a part of it you know and we never know or what happened with the data in the orbs um was this really deleted and on the other hand as soon as you have a hash of something in a database you have a hash of Iris and yeah no I I totally get you yeah you if you listen to you'll see I asked him about like pretty much every criticism I had found um I also wanted to ask you about ordinals and BRC 20s because obviously I saw you getting into a little bit of a tiff online about that and the funny thing is I can't remember who it was um but I had I had somebody on the show earlier at that time to discuss uh the brc20s taking off and um I mentioned your criticism and they they kind of like dismissed what you were saying saying like you were just determined to be against what they were doing or I don't remember exactly what they said but it was just funny so go ahead and yeah just talk a little bit about you know why you were unhappy I I was unhappy because uh it really um doesn't help in onboarding people and I told you before I was at that human rights workshop and we gave everyone so we we we should we installed wallets with the people and we also sent them a little bit of Bitcoin and they then used it within the group and sent it to each other like a light like like a torch and they were like fascinated by it and loved it and it worked because the transaction fees were relatively low and also uh the time uh until uh the transactions were confirmed were low and two weeks later the ordinals stuff happened and I could not have done this this course yeah I mean thinking about it afterwards you know many tweets also teach you yourself something and I read all the criticisms of what I said and um I I reflected on it and I still feel I wanted to say that you know because I think a lot of people don't think about the the fact that it hinders many people to use it who can't afford like three dollars for a fee or five dollars for a fee only because they only have two dollars I mean we have lightning now which is great even for me I don't I feel like I would be a little bit against being three to five dollars just to but but the thing is that this will come either way so the more people who are using Bitcoin the higher transaction fees will be that's a given yeah um but up on the till that time I hope that lightning and self-custody lightning wallets are so much adopted that everyone is basically using lightning and there we don't have that problem but at the moment it's just a critical time where the technology is evolving but it's not there yet yeah I mean lightning is super usable really I mean compared to like uh 2019 where it started it's fantastic how it works um but we still need to to onboard people in general to bitcoin yeah and on the other hand in Bitcoin we see these things every year or every phase you know uh was a collared coins where they are and uh all sorts of things when the fees Spike and then they go back again and then there's a war on Twitter about it and I also only thought to myself okay this will go away and um the good thing is most people are not on Twitter and the third thing is you can't prevent things uh on the Bitcoin blockchain if it's technically possible and people find a way it's okay you can't I mean that's the Bitcoin basic principle you don't censor things on the blockchain everyone is free to do what it's possible yeah but I think that's what the people who are arguing with you were saying that they felt that you were saying oh you should only do certain things and they were saying you can do whatever yeah yeah they can do whatever that is true and I tried just to tell them please why don't you use side chains when there are side chains already like liquid or rsk where you can do your nfts and ordinals and whatever but I also understand for them the fun is to be on the Bitcoin blockchain of course I understand that but you know it's also a little bit for me I'm honestly it might sound arrogant of me but when I'm coming from eight months in Africa and then I see uh us little uh spoiled uh people here playing around with jpegs on the blockchain spamming the blockchain in a way and spiking up the fees um and people in African countries can't use it anymore are turned off then yeah I'm a little angry yeah and and that was basically the reason maybe why I wrote that tweet and I know now from that perspective I should have maybe formulated in another way or I don't know well but I also wanted to ask because you were saying that this was interfering with your ability to onboard people but I think the people arguing the other side felt that what they were doing with the brc20s and the ordinals was onboarding people yes because yeah so it's yeah they are also right yeah I mean I'm onboarding people for different reasons maybe but maybe the people they are on boarding also will find out about other reasons where they can use Bitcoin for you know um so yeah it's how should I say people are going to build what they want to build and that's actually good because okay but because what a lot of people learned and I have to give that to them is that the fees can go up and that the fees will go up a lot of people don't know that and so I give it to them that they at least reached that uh point where people again were thinking okay um this might happen what's my my strategy for that um and also maybe other developments in the lightning space Etc maybe they are faster now that they were without uh ordinals all right well and you know we mentioned a few times you're also interested in lightning so are you working on that in any way or you know I wondered like yeah what you're seeing in terms of the newer developments there um I'm not I'm not a developer or something so I'm not really working on Lightning I'm working with lightning I'm using it uh on a I would not say it daily basis but almost daily basis um and I'm I'm using I'm testing wallets I I'm testing them to see which of the wallets is the most convenient for total newbies and because I want to onward people to self-custody um for instance a lot of people say oh just let them use wallet of Satoshi it's very easy um and I think that's maybe good if you have a contact to that people later on as well and can later tell them now switch to a self-custody wallet because that's better basically for you otherwise you are not really using Bitcoin um and I I'm against the wallet of Satoshi approach of many people because I see a lot of people going somewhere and on orange peeling other people in African countries or somewhere else and then they are very proud when they onboarded them to wallet of Satoshi sent them 100 satoshis uh and then they never see them again and what I think what happens then is that these people don't know what to do with that uh in most cases in some cases it might also be really good for them um but they will never change to another wallet because a lot of Satoshi is convenient and no one is going to tell them uh why this might not be such a good idea and no one is helping them along the way um and so that's why why I hope and I see now Phoenix wallet and Breeze wallet they are very uh convenient and easy to use you can use it with for on-chain and for Phoenix you have a unified balance so you don't need two wallets anymore where you have the the on-chain Bitcoin balance and the lightning balance there are more and more uh easy and cheap ways to exchange lightning onto to bitcoin and the other way around um I see a lot of developments in the lightning space with new um how should I say uh software being built and projects being built and um also making self-custody easier and also making project development easier like with with green light from Breeze foreign for instance and I'm also waiting for um a few wallets like the green wallet from blockstream they I um also integrating lightning now um the blue wallet finally enough they have names of colors they're also doing that and um I'm I'm pleased to also see that um there is more will be more privacy in the future for recipients of lightning uh Bitcoin so there's really a lot going on in this space and I think um in the near future or even starting now a lot of people will on be onboarded basically to lightning and they don't uh will even they will even don't know um what's the difference between lightning and Bitcoin it will just be Bitcoin great um so you mentioned earlier that you're working on building a Bitcoin learning program tell us about that yes thanks um so the idea came from my work in African countries with Bitcoin for fairness so I was speaking at universities we held workshops for journalists for the human rights activists and it's really very important to be on the ground um and to speak with people because that builds trust and the thing is but I can't live there and I don't want to live there somewhere in lusakawa so it's not my thing so and I also want to support the Educators on the ground with their work so it has two um sites basically the one is the people who are coming to a meet-ups and uh uh there that that they are onboarded to bitcoin that they can come into uh a online learning program so basically where I left them I picked them up again and they come into my program they can learn everything about Bitcoin that they need to know to be able to educate their peers to build their own Bitcoin communities and that we do that in a one-year program um they can pass the the the the course faster so they can make the course in I don't know three weeks four weeks then they get a certificate of completion and with that certificate of completion they can do uh the certified Bitcoin professional exam from the cryptocurrency uh standards uh certification company how is it called organization it's a long name um and with that they have basically a a professional exam where they can prove they are knowledgeable of Bitcoin and they can apply for jobs meaning my my idea or vision is that people who are going through my program and have the CPP they then can for instance apply for a job in the US online so they are sitting in in Africa somewhere where they don't have any possibility to earn money and they can earn it with their Bitcoin knowledge basically globally then so that's the approach in educating aspiring Bitcoin Community leaders and Educators so that they have a sustainable form of education and not just me coming uh being very clever and going again that program is basically enabled by donations so they are all by sponsorships in a way from companies there are companies like Haiti or the NGO built with Bitcoin uh they have expressed a commitment to support that work and um I'm very um looking forward to starting it and the the second part of that program is that it's also open for the general public um but then they don't get a scholarship for it they have to pay for it so people from countries where they can't afford can apply for a scholarship and for the others it's open uh in a membership form or in a course form and they can also they also prepared to take the certified Bitcoin professional exam then and um yeah that's basically a whole a holistic program with live calls where people can ask me questions and um yeah that's that's what I'm building at the moment and then I will launch it soon okay and it'll be called crack the orange exactly that's the title yeah might be a little confusing but I didn't want to call it anything with Bitcoin um I wanted to make it a little bit mysterious and also make it censorship persistent love it all right well we will all be on the lookout for that where can people learn more about you and all of your work thank you yes um so at my website which is Anita posh.com I'm on Twitter very active also on master I try um and um the program is at correctyorange.com and yes thank you very much for having me thank you it's been a pleasure having you in Unchained thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Anita check
