trade reimbursed up to 100 today's guest is kyle simani managing partner at multi coin capital welcome kyle hey laura good to be back on the show nice to have you so solana has been on quite a terror this past week it's now ranked 10th by market cap and the price of the token is up to about 70 at the time of recording and that's up from 1.50 at the start of the year up from 23 a month ago and up from 43 dollars a week ago so what happened yeah i think this has been kind of a culmination of a lot of things happening there's a lot of ecosystem as you're starting around the beginning of the year you really started to get together and take off you had um in addition to serum mango launched uh saber launched mercurial marinade a whole bunch of other things so the only one i knew was mango the dex or crm obviously the yeah why don't you just maybe describe what those are yeah so these were all various kinds of d5 protocols that i mentioned saber is like a way to trade uh stable coins um it's kind of like curve finance from ethereum uh mercurial is a competitor there's a whole bunch of borrowlend protocols now like solend and there's probably four or five more and and so what i think has happened in the last nine months or so has been that a lot of these teams started raising money starting about nine months ago and building and deploying and then this past week last week two kind of i think really important milestones happened and i didn't foresee them happening kind of next to each other but mango did their their fundraise so mango is a margin trading and uh perpetual derivatives trading uh thing built on top of serum and mango is one of the very first things to launch on top of solana and they've been iterating and the product is actually very very good and it's kind of like uidx but actually i think it is already more functional than the new idx and in terms of what it can do and they did a token sale and they sold off five percent of uh the total mango tokens uh the team kept five percent and then the remaining ninety percent were kept for the dow so really interesting structure they were the mango team has been very publicly anti-vc uh we've known them and spoken to them you know for a while but but we have no allocation they did an auction and over 500 million dollars went into the contract and ultimately the auction cleared at 70 million and so at five percent of the tokens that's a 1.4 billion dollar valuation and i think that really opened up a lot of people's eyes of hey you have a brand new contract people are aping into this like this is what ethereum i remember last summer people were like they threw a contract down and then a hundred million dollars would appear in the contract in within a day or two and that happened on solana last week and then this uh uh the d-gen apes uh nft drop you know happened i think it was friday night or saturday night and it seems like 50 100 000 people tried to get out onto this thing the salon blockchain actually kept running perfectly but the front end to mince the apes like kept going down they couldn't like keep the servers online but they ended up they did launch the apes and everything ultimately worked out and i think kind of those two things happening like three days apart four days apart has caused a lot of people to realize and say okay there's real d5 happening here um the phantom wallet is amazing um and you can already start seeing a few drops happening and the user experience um as far as the blockchain goes is really just magical and so i think that kind of combination of things is really kind of what's causing this new wave of interest okay i'm glad that you answered that question about the dhn ape academy because i was trying to figure out if it was the blockchain or if it was the front end um i do think some people are still saying look like oh i spent a bunch of sol and i i didn't get an ape um but i who knows how they'll resolve that or do you disagree with that i i i don't know specifics um i i do know that the chain has been fined talked all the validators and everyone they were they didn't care they didn't notice anything there may have been some bugs in the contract for the ape specifically uh i'm i'm not i'm not familiar with any but um it's possible okay multi-coin obviously is invested in solana and um you know i i think you guys also you know our supporters and investors in eth um so what types of projects or users do you see being drawn to solana over ethereum or do you think like you know there are specific types of categories that are especially saluted suited to one blockchain or another or do you just think they're to keep coexisting and competing directly i mean they're going to coexist for the foreseeable future there's a tremendous amount of inertia around ethereum that you know and i'm saying it will be displaced but if it were to be displaced that would take several years at least so that they're not it's not going anywhere i think right now on solana you're seeing a few different kinds of things happen so one is you're seeing something from ethereum or being cloned over serum was kind of the first so you need a way to trade tokens now serum is different than uniswap and kind of the structure but obviously it's a way to trade tokens you have people now doing stablecoin amms you have people doing regular amms you have people doing options and derivatives and margin trading and borrow lend protocols all of these things exist on ethereum b5 today right and and like these are just basic primitives that kind of everyone knows need to exist and so those are all being rebuilt right now in fact most of what i just mentioned is already live that's all good and well but where i think salon is really interesting is to try and unlock applications that weren't possible before and i think that that's gonna insert getting into up things that are more uh complex complicated um that you really can't do on ethereum so i think there's kind of a few areas of that that are somewhat obvious today so the first is if you want to do a real d5 derivatives trading protocol you can't do it on eclair one the because of the risk of liquidations in cascades you need to have kind of high frequency low latency system and you just can't do that on ethereum moreover if you want to really make derivatives work you need to make sure they all cross margin against each other and so you need to kind of have everything in a single venue work and so like if you look at today mango bonfida uh there's drift there's a few of these d5 derivatives themes high options they're all making their systems uh composable so that like potentially you can have you could have a position with banfita and you could have a cross margin with uh perpetual protocol or with drift or something they're not there yet but like you can see how that's already coming together and all those teams although they're competing are also recognizing they all need to play nicely and so i think that's going to be that's still a couple months away from being you know really visible to the public but if you look at how it's coming together it's super super cool to see that i think the other really interesting area is just going to be anything that really faces a large number of retail users and i think probably the first category of that's going to be some combination of nfts and social tokens like this the eighth thing happened i think there was ten thousand apes um the salon blockchain was fine whenever the pudgy penguins launched a new thing or there's some new cats or whatever gas on ethereum goes to 200 really quick or 300 and it's really unusable uh but now just imagine what if you multiply that by 50 and you wanted to do 500 000 nft drop you know like you just can't even do that on a theory like it's not even possible i think those kinds of things are going to get unlocked on solana that'll be really interesting and especially if you have influencers you know people with tick tock two million followers on tick tock starting to do all kinds of stuff with social tokens and nfts i think that whole design space of creator monetization is going to get really unlocked on solana so i think we're really excited about that and i think probably the first just early glimpse of that is is just now kind of coming online it's called audios they have about five million or so users the audio streaming thing we invested in about a year and a half ago and uh you know they've talked publicly that they're going to do nft drops um in the audience app i think we're going to start to see the first versions of that where you're going to have you know well-known celebrities and djs you know doing interesting kind of nfc drop things and i'm excited to see all this play out well there's so much to unpack in what you just said um but as for the three problems the first one where you were talking about how certain things in d5 just are not possible on ethereum because of collateral and liquidations are you talking there about um what we did see kind of early in the pandemic that black thursday where there were like a bunch of liquidations and um the blockchain itself kind of like couldn't even keep up with the the you know how quickly there were these liquidations happening is that what you're talking about yes that problem is worse is even more acute um specifically with uh like perpetual personal contracts because people like people who are levering up on compound the nave and maker are levering up 2x maybe 3x but if you're levered up 20x on ftx or binance or if you're going to do that in a decentralized setting all of that stuff becomes just much more sensitive when the leverage ratio goes from 3x to 20x and so yeah it's just paramount that the blockchain is humming that price updates are fast and that liquidations are happening in an orderly they need to be happening in a quick way okay so in a moment i want to ask you about the cross margining thing you mentioned but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible with over 10 million

with passion and earn weekly prizes [Music] back to my conversation with kyle simani so um earlier when you mentioned the cross margining possibilities on solana are you saying that uh when ethereum goes to sharding that that won't be possible and so that's why solana superior in that regard yeah so i mean the problem you so i wrote i wrote a thread about this maybe three or four weeks ago pretty pretty widely retweeted about d5 derivatives but basically like eclair one is a venue and then arbitrarily optimism is a venue um starkward is a venue salon is a venue in the same way that binance and ftx are venues where that's where your assets are you know my my theory is that if you're gonna make like the like decentralized ftx get to that same level of functionality you need to make sure these things all cross margin the really big problem in ethereum right now is that you have all of these protocols are built being built on different technologies so optimism is a different flavor of the evm than ethereum one which is different than arbitrary which is different than starkware and so these things literally they don't even technically compose with each other and then they also on a liquidity basis don't propose because they're separate venues and so you're seeing the system get further fragmented and that means you know developers could try and rebuild all the pieces and functions of their competitors and complements but it just makes everything harder and more complicated and more slow what's really nice about solana is it's a single venue and you can support all of the users and all the liquidity in one place and so all of these all of the teams building through this protocols also understand that they need to cross margin with other protocols to make their own protocols better right if you're building an option system you want to be able to have a perpetual contract as collateral in the option they're all designing their systems with that kind of core understanding in mind and like you're seeing you're going to see something that looks like a decentralized ftx emerge over the next probably three four months as all those guys launching and tweaking bugs and stuff um and that's really just not possible in ethereum yeah i was also surprised when you um for the third category you said social tokens because i don't you know i don't feel that's like truly taken off on ethereum so is that simply because of what you were saying about how there are just certain things that are just not possible on ethereum but you feel like if the capability were there then we would see that phenomenon and so that's where solana comes in yeah that's correct i mean bib cloud here is instructive you know they could have built on ethereum and they chose not to you have to ask yourself why do they go through all this extra headache and the answer is scalability like they just you know they were like okay if we're going to get justin bieber to talk about this thing and get 20 million people to slam the system you know like it's just it's not going to work from that vantage point i think the cloud you know was thinking correctly i think it was wrong to build their own chain that the utxo based and has some other problems we've invested in one team that's not yet announced that's building social tokens on solana and the great thing is is stable coins are already there there are usdc usdt already there and some other ones and then coinbase and ftx and binance all the major exchanges are on-ramps those are all available now you have all of the stable coin swaps all of the serum all of uh amm primitives like all this stuff is already there right and so it's just really really easy to make it all play together in a very cool way nfts are all already there and so i think that the opportunity set for developers to build on top of these kind of core tools and then for creators to experiment with different amm curves with different nfts with different social tokens and different risk sharing and whatever right like we're only a couple months away from all of that just kind of like magically working again you just you can't do that in ethereum because everyone knows if you have a million people slam the system it's just not gonna work ethereum tends to get clogged when 10 or 20 or 30 000 people slam it at the same time like if you have a million people slam it you know it's just a different scale well this is so interesting because i almost feel like what you're saying is so like if the last crypto bubble was driven by the ico craze on ethereum then this i mean right now we're basically in a bull market but you know it's kind of uh in a somewhat of a holding pattern i guess now i mean we're starting to see it tick back up now but but it's almost like you're saying like it could be that solana is the basis for it i think so i think um in about six months time like today i can say all these things and like i'm talking to all the developers and i can like see the beta versions of what and it's all still theoretical in the sense that like retail can't play with it yet but like i think in six months time it'll be very very obvious to kind of everyone in the space like hey like this is what we've been all waiting for cheap transactions it's scalable it's all composes you don't have to worry about the layer two stuff just everything just magically works you have default you have all the on-ramps you know like salon is probably three four months away from just you know all of that stuff magically magically working together but you can see most of the pieces are there now and if you have the fortune uh the privilege that i do of being able to just talk to the developers working on on the early stage stuff you can see you know kind of where those last pieces are what about the fact that ethereum 2 is going to have its merge you know probably roughly i don't know six months from now like in q1 how do you see that affecting kind of any competition between ethereum and solana so yeah the ethereum is supposed to move to proof of stake at some point you know timelines are challenging with theory and people they they tend to miss them by a pretty large margin even when it does move to proof of stake it doesn't really change the throughput of the system in a meaningful way there may be a 10 boost or 20 boost year there but it's not a 10x boost or 100 extra thousand x and and so i don't think this meaningfully kind of changes anything that we just talked about so in general then how do you see the competition between the two playing out because i mean ethereum at the moment has such a strong community so how do you see that affecting kind of like the development of you know i guess both of the chains so i think communities are essential to make any open source things succeed but they're not enough they're not all that you need and actually beyond a certain point they kind of stop mattering like you know how many people are actually building like core ethereum tooling like core ethereum client code it's like 100 like not even like 50 maybe i don't know but it's not 10 000. if you look at you know how many smart contracts on ethereum today are really really used um it's like 10 or 20. again it's not 5 000. the number of core things that that really matter here um is actually a lot smaller i realize there are a lot of people who are learning solidity and i agree there's a lot of people who hold ease but if you look at like the really really important things there's actually not that many of them and i think more or less all of those are either replicated or will be pretty close to being replicated on salon over the next few months and once those pieces are in place then what that does is it just opens up the world for people to to go on and experiment from there i think there's a ton of people who looked at crypto 2017 2018 and they looked at ethereum and they said we can't use this um for what we want to do i think the two most obvious examples are bitclout um and helium which like they tried and they couldn't make it work and so they had to do their own thing and flow um is another dapper and flow they literally launched cryptokitties which was the most popular thing in 2017. you know i think if you replay 2017 you get this massive excitement and if you assume that you have a scalable platform that can support hundreds of millions of users i think that like there would be a ton of companies that would be excited to build on top of that that have distribution i think what's going to happen over the next six to 12 months is people are going to say okay great we have a blockchain that we all know how it works now when we can actually see a path to support 50 million users on this thing and those people are all going to start to tinker with and work on solana and i think that's just like incredibly exciting and then what about the fact that solana is more centralized in terms of the number of validators do you feel like that will matter to people or or do they not care or yes so decentralization is a spectrum it's not it's not binary and so it's gray i think it's not a question at all that ethereum is meaningfully more decentralized as a whole than solana is i don't think that's really debatable but the degree to which it is more decentralized is i don't think that much like it's probably like three or four or six x but it's not 500x and so yeah i think the delta is actually not that large um if you look at probably the most important metric is who's controlling consensus um today on ethereum it's like three or four mining pools get you to 51 and then if you look at the e2 staking distribution right now i believe it's seven or eight uh entities get you to a third which is the the control threshold for a proof of stake system solana actually if you go to solanabeach.io which is the main kind of like block explorer for solana they report openly how many nodes does it take to get to 33 and i think it's like 18 last time i looked they're 17. so on that metric which is i would argue is kind of the most important one for the basic consensus safety of of the protocols today solana is more decentralized than these two now i realize that's not a perfect comparison that there's problems with that but the people who say it's a hundred x more if there's a 100 x more decentralized broadly i don't think that's a reasonable assertion and so i think that's important to realize the relative magnitude um and then i think the other important thing to understand is is the system as a whole becoming more decentralized or is it becoming more centralized if you look at the history of bitcoin and ethereum the answer is very obvious as they become much more decentralized over time and so the question is there's is there something fundamentally different about the nature of solana that would cause it to break that trend and i have not been able to identify anything and if i look at solana 12 months ago versus today it's obviously much more decentralized today because there's just so many more people building and doing stuff like the salon team doesn't know who people are building a lot of the stuff and that's exactly what you would want to see right is there's just tooling out there and people start hacking away and they never even call the core team and so i feel pretty good that the vector is the vectors are generally getting more decentralized and as long as that kind of generally continues to function then like i'm not really worried about it and i don't think most people in 12 months are gonna are gonna care yeah i mean it's interesting because you said at one point like oh these two will coexist for a few years so i am just curious how do you think things will play out over the next few years in terms of competition between the two yeah so i mean like there's some different examples in history where like so one is like facebook and myspace another one that i think is probably a better comp um it's probably blackberry and an iphone and like i i remember i was in college when it was kind of iphone versus um blackberry wars and uh blackberry i believe if you go look at rims financials it peaked in either 2010 or 2011. and then that was the peak and like it was still relevant for i don't know three more years probably like 2013 or 2014 is probably when blackberry started to kind of like really become irrelevant if i were to ballpark these so you know inertia lasts at a minimum for several years even my space too right like even as facebook surpassed myspace my face was still around and relevant for i don't know probably two or three years right so projecting up further than three years is pretty difficult like it's just it's too hard to reason about that state of the world but what i just see happening right now is they both coexist they have different growth rates um i think solana's growth rate will be sustainably higher than ethereums for the foreseeable future like liking the next 24 to 36 months and if that is in fact generally true then the relative divergence of you know user base developers and market cap will converge over that period ethereum is not going away people are gonna there's too much inertia there for it to go away quickly i think you're going to see two things co-exist we have ios we have android and today it's just everyone knows you have to build an iphone app and an android app like right and uh we may we may be in a world where you have to do something similar here i don't think that analogy necessarily will hold but it's like not it's not unreasonable to expect that there will be multiple competing ecosystems and we're on time but do you have time for one more question then yeah and so if we do end up with two two of these uh platforms that you know basically kind of do the same thing how would you expect to see them differentiate like what projects would you expect to see gravitate more toward ethereum versus solana and vice versa yeah i mean i have a very strong belief that software needs to be free um or as close to free as humanly possible humans are trained right over the last 15 years of the internet to expect everything to be instant free and fast right and so you know i think that that kind of core core demonstrated preference really favors solana and so i think you're just going to see an increasing percentage of developers you know build there and they're going to say okay i have it's just much more obvious how you can incredibly say this will be cheap and fast for a lot more users and like that's what people like that's what i think developers are going to are going to optimize for oh so then it sounds like you're saying that actually you don't think they'll coexist that one of them will win out and it's more likely that will be solana i mean again time time matters here like within 12 months it's just eath has too much inertia you know but in 48 months you know like who knows but uh yeah i mean it's ethereum's not going away it could definitely lose relevance myspace is still around there's like some music stuff on it or something i don't actually know dig is still around like there's plenty of these things but it could definitely lose relevance okay well last question then because i know um i did see you tweet oh and i don't have the exact quote but i remember seeing it that eos was you know one of multicoin's biggest mistakes and obviously that was a chain that was more centralized so what do you feel is different this time around yeah so there's a few things one is that eos was much more centralized and that literally there was just 21 fixed lock producers two the gas model and the system was really broken and so it caused all these kind of spam stuff to happen that was that was really problematic and then three that the team just didn't i mean they raised a bunch of money and they just didn't swing hard enough they should have been more aggressive with the balance sheet and that they just weren't and so i think some some combination of those factors kind of is what prevented it from getting there i i think it's pretty pretty short-sighted to say oh like being as scalable and fast as possible and being a little bit less decentralized is like has no chance of working like that that like just feels like a kind of an implausible claim and it's not obvious that like what degree of decentralization is the correct answer um like you can't reason about that in abstract and like and give a definitive answer right and um and and a lot of bitcoin and ethereum people kind of really have promoted this idea that like it has to be maximally decentralized and i just don't think that like that we don't actually know how to reason about that and so i think it's okay to try other experiments that do make some trade-offs uh but give you something very very important which is the user experience is just infinitely better and i think that's a trade-off that's really worth exploring all right well this has been super fascinating um i yeah uh kind of was like really shocked by all the salon activity and um yeah it's uh really interesting to get an insight like i mean we there's so much else we could have covered because obviously you guys have your uh new 100 million dollar fund and um i mean there's so much else so i'm sure we'll cover solana more uh in the coming months here on the show but in the meantime thank you so much
