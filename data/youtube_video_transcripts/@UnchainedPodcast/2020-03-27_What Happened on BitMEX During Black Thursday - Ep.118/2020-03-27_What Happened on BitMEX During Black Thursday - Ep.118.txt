wrote an analysis this week of the bit Mex liquidation spiral that occurred on Black Thursday March 12th I actually covered this in an interview with Kyle Somani on my other podcast unchained earlier this week but I thought that your post had some additional insights over what is the largest bitcoin price drop since the mount cox implosion give us an overview of what happened at bit max a couple of weeks ago yep so a bit max you know it's a steer eighties platform that allows people to trade with high leverage on Bitcoin and we also had Eunice pandemic going on in the world and some people decided to sell Bitcoin in quite a lot of it and it triggered a sort of vicious cycle as more people sold Bitcoin people that were training on bit max with leverage God would call liquidated which basically amplified this cycle and it all ended up somewhat dramatically as the bid next platform explaining some issue which turned out to be a sort of intentional attack which stopped this huge drop on Black Thursday so we spent a bit of time last week looking at exactly what happened and also looking at a deeper consequences of this event it's not only that the price dropped but it left an impact on the market structure or on Bitcoin on both beat makes blue so I'm sort of beat max yeah and for listeners who didn't listen to my episode with Kyle you should definitely check that out because he talks a lot about some of the triggers of the first price drop and then why there was a second one about 12 hours later one thing I do want to mention is that at the time we recorded I was not aware about the DDoS attack on bit Mex which is something that Antoine wrote about so we'll dive more into that but before we do that Antoine in your post you wrote that bit Mex is perpetual inverse swap is critical to bitcoins price discovery why don't you describe what that financial product is and why it's so crucial yep so prior to beat Max's product basically got two ways two main ways to trade Bitcoin one was the good old like Mon Cox you go on an exchange you dip but someone deposits bitcoins you deposit Fiat or the other way and then you exchanged the fiat for Bitcoin at the Bitcoin to Fiat the other way that appeared a bit later was called futures he's a way that enables trading of what of Bitcoin in the future but the invent the innovation of Big Macs is to make create a product that replicates the structure of the spot market of T you know like Mongkok so bitstamp or or coming pace but allows users to trade with leverage so instead of having to deposit one Bitcoin to trade one Bitcoin you can deposit and what been coined and trade 100 Bitcoin this has a lot of use in it for many use cases for people that want to make a quick buck on price movements it could also be people and have build kind and want to hedge their position the thing the price is going to drop the deposit five Bitcoin and then they transform that into stone synthetic dollar and wait for the price to drop so this product as we have been creating in 2014 and is so I think one novel product I don't think it exists in traditional finance because there's because it enables training Bitcoin with Bitcoin which is a bit weird which is not a problem that appears in normal finance and its relationship to price discovery with actually studied in different research papers is something that is also noticed in traditional markets that when as future markets as a class is quite often that we see that the price is ablated first on these futures markets and then on a spot one is different reasons behind that one of them is that it's easier to move to bigger trades or on these platforms and so in terms of the importance of this platform then it was quite significant when there was you know there were some issues of the trading on this hugely volatile day and as he wrote bit mix uh furred a DDoS attack at 2:16 a.m. UTC and interestingly the DDoS actually affected the troll box which you know kind of is more like a little messaging area so how did the DDoS attack work and why did that affect trading so Big Macs you know was started in 2014 and he created these troll parts basically a chat box for traders and even people that bid next to interact with one another as time I'd only lost a bit of its importance but it was still at the time of the DDoS attack quite deeply embedded like running on the same machine as the training engine and someone found a flow in basically I think it was requesting history of messages for like the Spanish troll box that nobody was using in a while and they found this a while ago that if only they requested this his Spanish troll box history it would basically slow down website a little bit and whoever is behind that decided that they could exploit that to basically put the platform to a crawl like nobody could trade on a day the disk and CPU usage we're off the charts and they decided to use that on the day Bitcoin was dropping by by rods and basically stop the price before then I went on more about how and why I stopped this pricing displacement in a newsletter yeah well can you go into that a little more because the timing of this really seems quite calculated what do you make of that well I don't know the timing whether you know it's a bit still unclear if whether what they expected was that by doing it it would make the price go up or down because you know you would expect that when an exchange is an evil and available the price would cut down but as that they had been quite volatile a lot of traders that were long Bitcoin so that one at the peak current tries to go up ended up being liquidated and bit max has these liquidation engine that ensures that or tries to ensure that nobody loses more than what they put in and ask more people while losing their pets on bit on on bit mix they were thinking of price was going to go up but it kept going down and down and down the engine had to take the reverse position on these traitors so the engine as well wanted to sell Bitcoin and so that made it so that price as more people as the price went down the price had to go down even more as pit Mac's had to liquidate these positions and whenever these who have a DD Sutekh trigger they made it impossible for anyone of most people to trade on bit max an effector that is as this liquidation engine was probably the largest seller on a market or one of the largest sellers since this attack basically removed bit mix from the Marcus basically when you remove a large seller naturally keeping things equal then the price would go up at least you know stop going down and he sees what happened it was a bit of a shock as well I guess to many traders because when you're on a very volatile day like that and a lot of people basically have trays on pit mix and trays on earth a exchanges that somewhat cancel out each other when you lose one of them it also creates a lot of trouble maybe they have for example triggers that when you lose picnics you close the position on your other exchange so there's many basically when losing it makes availability to do to this DDoS attack somewhat created a sort of shock in a system both by removing the large largest seller in the market and also by probably shutting down a lot of training training operations Wow so let's dive a little bit more into those liquidations at the point that you're discussing I think this is when 1.1 billion dollars worth of contracts were liquidated so can you dive a little bit more into how liquidations work on bit max yep so when someone makes a trade on bit max they have to put what is called margin so if I want to bet that when I want to bet one Bitcoin then the price is going to go up I have to put at least not point or one Bitcoin on it on this bet it's 100 X leverage and there's a sum of this margin that you put up so these this 1% is kept aside as a buffer so when the price goes the wrong way of your bed at some point you get your trade gets stopped so that you don't lose all the money there's a small buffer that is kept of margin by Jack change to close this position to basically you were wrong we're going to cancel your bed basically if you were wanting to buy Bitcoin cancel it if you were selling it we're not going to buy it so that you don't lose money it's not always possible to do that at the right price so the liquidation engine is basically the system that is in charge of closing the positions of traders that ran out of money basically and its inner workings are somewhere you know mystery and have to be because if people knew exactly how it worked there it's basically a game of a humans versus of rubber and often times of robot loses except maybe a chess so the inner workings are somewhat obscure but it's basically an automated buyer-seller in normal operations have the people that go that bet that Bitcoin is going to go wrong or town it's a rare that has happened on Black Thursday that everyone on one side so everyone had wanted bit going to go up ended up being wrong that day and quite dramatically so this engine basically takes these positions of traders that basically get liquidated and tries to close them the issue that happened on Black Thursday is that there were no there were few people willing to bet or to attack the other side or maybe too many people actually got liquidated there's also another mechanism that casing to place the Insurance Fund there's been a lot of talk about bid Maxie's Insurance Fund but it's basically a way to make sure that if even if the liquidation engine mat doesn't manage to close the traders position by making a small profit basically you bet that bitcoin is going to cut up you lose your pet there's still a bit of money left in your in what you put in to try to make to close the position of the profit but it can have still happen that is question a negative and the role of the insurance phone is to be basically a buffer of money that the liquidation engine can use as losses and when it makes money sanction makes a profit it goes towards these insurance fund and finally there's a last mechanism that actually you don't know if it's been used in this blank Thursday it's called auto delivery and basically when nothing works what it makes do does to avoid basically losing people's money or at least you know having people end up with negative balances and it has sometimes happen on other platforms is to basically make people with winning positions pay people with or cover the losses of people with losing positions so that in the end no one's and the owing bit makes money alright so we're gonna talk a little bit more about how Black Thursday has impacted the market since since that day but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible why should you get and a Visa card from Krypto calm first it's a beautiful medal card you can top up the card with crypto and spend

operating in the space back in 2013 in the accept crypto as payment one of the partners Sakura Killman is known for drafting a bill submitted to the US Congress in 2014 aimed at exempting on chained Bitcoin transactions from US regulations the other founding partner his brother Daniel Coleman became well known in the crypto law space for his work in the mal Cox civil rehabilitation so if you operate a FinTech business or have a dispute with some person or a business involving crypto or you just need legal advice related to crypto info at calment law that's ke l ma n dot law or just go to their web site at www.petland.com inst various times o TC dex market makers and day traders to to basically a hedge up on some of their first one if you're an OTC desk and someone wants to give you a lot of Bitcoin you might want to lock in that price on Pitt max by going short and there's many other use cases what happened on bit max that day is that probably a lot of these market participants lost money basically if you were long if you had a position on bit max before the price drop by like 40% it's quite unlikely that you were not liquidated all these didn't lose a lot of money and what we've noticed using our reference rates and also our so can be tricky store all the market data from many exchanges so that allows us to run analysis actus is that on a spot market so the non bit makes non derivatives we've seen an impact on a liquidity so instead of being easily yourself trainers being easily able to buy bitcoins by creating us a very small impact on the market now there's a large especially after this shock of 40% down in one day a lot of people that usually provide this liquidity stop doing it so it does several explanations one it is quite normal in if not is that for past events is that when the price goes up or down basically when the volatility goes up people whose job is to provide liquidity in a market and will make money based on that market makers usually widen despair so instead of no quitting very tight space that buy a 99 cents at this cell and 1 101 dollars they would widen a spend and buy me buy a 95 cents and buy at 1.5 and what so this is a normal reaction but usually these disappear so the liquidity shock happens and a few hours afterwards they go back to quitting what they were quitting before well this has not happened yet on the spot markets I run the analysis again this morning the spreads are still higher than the where before March 12 and on Betamax is even wider while on the spot markets work on various on cracking on this step it seems that little liquidity has been coming back slowly over time you've seen that on picnics it still hasn't gone to what it was before but there's also another reason may be behind the it was the than the price dropping by a lot it could be that a lot of these part market participants now also work with traditional finance day they are hedge funds they're looking planning to pay trended also trading those assets and it could just have stopped or limited their operations drastically in all markets including cryptocurrencies due to the crisis that the world is currently facing yeah that's a part was really fascinating in your post and I do one what will happen but then that last bit that you said there made me also wondered you know do you feel like what would you say the coronavirus is teaching us about how Bitcoin is correlated to traditional financial assets are there any conclusions we can draw yet it's you know it's very hard so we've noticed and we've wrote in our newsletter and past issues about some events where we could clearly see that the Bitcoin price was reacting to external events for his upon when there where workers fight by Iran in Saudi Arabia we could clearly see an impact even recently there was a clear impact at least on a very short from the Declaration of tamatar fed but basically you know unlimited quantitative easing we could see the price go up but when we zoom out these impacts are less visible so if Bitcoin still has a sort of a mind of its own but on a day to day basis you can still spot the impacts of of price of external shock events I think for the coronavirus the impact will still take quite a while to see you know there's a lot of activity going on by central banks in the u.s. in Europe and in Asia about you know dealing with this issue and with the impact on the economy but I think it would take a long time if it's clearly visible to see on the Bitcoin price because these things nothing time you if every American guess 1200 dollars from the Fed they will maybe some will buy Bitcoin with it but I don't know how clearly it would be visible to see it yeah well given what's going on here I for my part I don't think a lot of people will be buying Bitcoin with it but I could be proven wrong we will see but over this time period over the next few months as coronavirus continues to affect frankly just the entire globe what will you be looking forward to understand that question better like what are some of the metrics that you and your team will be looking at that's a good question a lot of so you know of course the price is one of the main metric that will probably anchor pass the bad information you know the new information with these prices but if we thank you from all different positions if we think that it's new users will come online then we can look at metrics like you know how many addresses on Bitcoin or how many addresses on more than X amount of Bitcoin we could look as well at you know transfers account and if people buy Bitcoin usually I mean this recommended that it only if all of it only exchange so they would move some of it or fly into hardware wallets or other things like that so we can see that on a chain by looking at you know how many people transact Bitcoin on a day to day basis but you know it's really still unclear exactly you know how things will change is also you know other Bitcoin specific events that will happen in the near future at the same time at these crises and first of all the main one will be the Bitcoin having for which of which the consequences are still a hotly debated topic but the thing is going to align with you know probably the tip part of the coming or still ongoing economical crisis as he's seen like two months and you know a lot of people find for unemployment and the impact of that will be feel felt in the coming weeks and the same as I having so even though you know there will probably be an impact I don't know how clear it will be to say you know as because all the events happen at the same time yeah and I did talk about this on last week's show but that I think this was the analysis you guys sent out last week on Black Thursday it appeared that a lot of the Bitcoin that was exchanging hands was from newer buyers who were trading so you know well I guess well it would be another metric that we could keep watching is you know how long-term hold lers react during this whole crisis well anyway thank you so much for coming on the show it's been great having you thanks for inviting me don't forget

I had in my life my friends my partner's my reputation my love my company and my country definitely check this story out for a great long read this week and for some news that's not related to the coronavirus next headline how crypto companies and projects rank across five spectrums of trust for the multi coin capital blog tony shang wrote a monster piece on trust in crypto and how it is multi-dimensional not binary he breaks it down into five properties custody immutability verifiable security legal and regulatory protections and insurance he then assesses a number of crypto companies and projects including backed coinbase tether compound maker and yuna swap among others along these spectrums some of the more interesting analyses are for instance the immune ability spectrum which shows almost all the companies and even some defy product projects huddled toward the mutable side which I think is probably a reflection of how nascent the industry still is in the years to come we may see more in the most immutable column where Eunice WAP currently sits alone in contrast the spectrum for custody is more spread out probably reflecting the variety in consumer choice the post also ends with an analysis of the recently zkx attacks and how the bzx protocol scores on these factors Shang writes quote this episode concluded with relatively minor losses about 1 million dollars total but it's not hard to imagine how greater damages could occur in larger systems with more malicious actors fun bits coin metrics raises six million dollars in Series A funding
