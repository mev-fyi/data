hi everyone today's special episode is of an interview I did with in forum at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco on the basics of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency my guess was Kathryn Hahn the former federal prosecutor who now teaches at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and is on the board of directors at coin based in hacker one I've done a few episodes on the basics of crypto there was an episode last fall and how to explain blockchain and cryptocurrency to the average person an encrypted 101 episode last December that explains all the basic terms those are two of my most popular episodes ever as I imagine many of you were sending them to friends and family and newbies were seeking out these explainers add this to your library of resources to send to friends and family who are new to the space and want to learn more Katie and I cover a lot of ground in a very digestible manner and we fielded some great questions from the audience take a listen yourself for more ideas and how to explain this new technology to newbies enjoy the show on may 11th and 12th some of the most interesting humans from around the globe will come together in Brooklyn for the ethereal

inform with a common well club I am Laura Shan I'm host of the podcast unconfirmed and Unchained and Katie is my friend and a blockchain in crypto leader she was a former federal prosecutor and she also teach at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and she's on the board of directors at coinbase and a hacker one welcome to all of you and welcome Katie thank you Laura thanks for having me and thanks for letting me be here with you so before we dive into our portion the discussion I actually wanted to sort of get the sense of what the base of knowledge is in the room so how many of you feel like you know what bitcoin is ok and how many of you feel like you could explain how a blockchain works to somebody else wait let's see I the lights are bright I want to see how many eyes might not be there fifteen percent or ten percent um we're calling on you I see the hands in the back okay and all of you watched the John Oliver segment on crypto currency and feel like you still don't know what's going on okay okay all right well why don't we just start with the most basic question what is Bitcoin well that's very basic right now I think here's how I think of Bitcoin I think of Bitcoin as digital money for the internet so let me just repeat it again digital money for the internet and when you think about money you can think about money in a couple different ways you could spend money you can transfer money to someone else I could give Laura some money so I could give Laura some Bitcoin you can also store money think about gold there so I think Bitcoin is digital money for the internet that you can spend or transfer like digital cash but you could also store it like digital gold and certainly with some of the prices we've seen the volatility in the past few months um although today it shot back up to a high I guess it gained about 20 percent at one point today that 20 percent of its high since December I think is what I saw so because of that volatility a lot of people are at least a lot of people in the United States are storing it using it as a store of value digital gold although as we can talk about in some other jurisdictions people are using it to make payments where they don't have access to banking systems that we all do in are we seeing someone that activity well in Venezuela is one example you know where the currency the national currency is not quite so stable some places like in sub-saharan Africa I think Laura you've done some interesting podcasts I'm thinking of the podcast you did with Roya where she couldn't have access to a bank account in Afghanistan so that's how she learned about Bitcoin yeah I will actually I'll tell this story briefly for people she this woman Roya maboob she was one of times 100 most influential people and is a serial tech entrepreneur and one of her businesses was like a little blogging platform and she needed to pay the contributor as many of which were women but I guess culturally in Afghanistan a lot of women don't have bank accounts or if they do then when they would get the money maybe their families would take the money away from them so they eventually decided to start paying them in Bitcoin and the women were set up with wallets and then taught how to use the wallets and this one woman I guess I think she had should I guess she had an abusive husband and she eventually saved up the Bitcoin she was earning from this service and then divorced him so you know that just shows he like this was very empowering but you know in a place like in the US where we have really good financial services you might not kind of understand what the impact of that coin could be but in this kind of place that was it was very I'm different then so forth we've just been talking about Bitcoin in which oh it's just a Naiad so annoying I'm sorry because I want it before we move on just about back to Bitcoin I did want to say I think of Bitcoin is like what I think of as 3ds when I think of do you like dog when I think of kind of some of its characteristics so can I just yeah so I we already said digital right it's the first scarce digital asset okay so digital it's also decentralized so it's not controlled you've probably heard this it's not controlled by a government it's not controlled by a central bank it's just decentralized and think about in the days of email before email came along if we wanted to send something to someone that piece of mail would go through the post office it would go through a central intermediary and with Bitcoin when I say it's DC realized I mean that you can send it to another person without going through an intermediary like a bank just like now you can send an email to someone without going to the post office or with your communication doesn't have to go through that intermediary post office the other the third D is it's deflationary it's a finite supply so only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist it can't be added to and this was the design that the person who invented or persons who invented Bitcoin the moniker is Satoshi Nakamoto and he wrote a white paper in 2008 setting forth his vision of Bitcoin and so this supply is limited now one question that I always get is and and from very educated smart people they say well I'm gonna wait until the price goes down a little to get some Bitcoin because I don't have enough to buy one whole Bitcoin and the thing about Bitcoin is it's also divisible so another D to the eighth decimal point you don't have to own a whole Bitcoin if I wanted to pail or something I don't need to pay her one or two Bitcoin I could pay her a small fraction of Bitcoin so those are just some properties I wanted to get out there before we before we moved on yes so I think bitcoin is the cryptocurrency that most people know about it was obviously the first it was the one that said hold this whole entire craze in motion but there's : to our class of actually what they call crypto assets but let's just actually talk about cryptocurrency how would you define that for people so again bitcoin was one of the first or was the first although I want to point out that even before Bitcoin came about with this white paper in 2008 we had things like eagled so there were some kind of digital systems that people were looking at but with cryptocurrency I think of them as I actually call them crypto assets because when you think about what currencies are there things that are being used readily to buy and sell things and I think most of one I think of crypto currencies I don't think they're there yet so bitcoin is one of the most popular other ones how many in this room have heard of etherium or ether okay so a decent amount of people ether is another what about litecoin okay so people think of litecoin as digital silver whereas Bitcoin would be digital gold they all share all of these cryptocurrencies have slightly unique attributes like coin is supposed to be cheaper for payments and faster than Bitcoin then you have some other crypto assets things like Zee cash and Manero and what those assets are focused on is providing privacy so we can get to that in a bit but you might already know this but people think that oh bitcoin is anonymous but actually that's not true at all it's sued anonymous so you can ultimately figure out for the government who owns what wallets oftentimes things like Zee cash and Manero are kind of privacy enhancing crypto currencies and there's one other thing that I wanted to just kind of lay out for people so we you know fully define what what this is but a lot of people say oh you know I actually think the money I deal with like PayPal and venmo is digital how is this different so PayPal and digital and online banking for that matter if you make a transfer you know you might think you're moving money but actually if I were to make a venmo transfer to you or a venmo payment to you it's not actually physically moving the money then and there rather it's a digital veneer on an age-old system called double entry bookkeeping and so it's really again just a digital veneer our banks have to go reconcile and settle up in the end and anyone who's ever made an international wire transfer knows that that first of all can take a some time be it's expensive it's also not very transparent and it's certainly not instantaneous because again you're not it's the banks have to do reconciliation at the end or these digital systems PayPal venmo have to do this reconciliation process whereas if I was to send you a Bitcoin we'd be able to go to the ledger the Bitcoin ledger which we'll talk about that's the blockchain we'd be able to go to that and see this transfer occur and and so that's really quite revolutionary if you again if you think about international wire transfers they can take well over a week I mean in this day and age it's still amazing to me that it's cheaper and faster to FedEx a box of cash to India for example than to make it on an international wire transfer now don't do that because that happens to be illegal and against a federal regulation but if you were to do it it would still be faster and cheaper than sending an international wire and that's because of this digital veneer so let's then discuss what is a blockchain so a blockchain as I let me try and illustrate a kind of picture in your mind's it I think of a blockchain as a massive shared ledger kind of a shared global database that includes all of the transactions that have ever happened in the Bitcoin network right now I'm just talking about the Bitcoin blockchain we'll get into some other block chains later but it's this massive database that anyone can go look at and see what transfers were made in Bitcoin and again it's public so it has you know there's some audibility to it which we can get into but it's decentralized and this is very important blockchain and Bitcoin architecture this decentralization this shared global ledger is spread out among thousands of computers all over the world ok now if you picture a vault holding this let's say that you had one ledger and you had a vault holding it if someone broke into that vault they could erase some of that ledger put in you know a different number they could alter it if that if it were just centralized but now think of again I told you thousands of computers think of all of those as individual vaults and they all hold copies of this digital ledger now if you want to go alter it you don't just have to break into one vault you have to break into all of these thousands of vaults all over the world all at the same time because all of these Ledger's have to match it might do I have people very following me because I think these are very very complicated topics but I do think of this one vault system versus thousands of false system and why I tell you this is that makes it very secure this ledger because these copies razaw of this you know global ledger reside all over the place in these individual vaults so that's a real piece of the architecture that makes it very secure it's also very trustworthy because not anyone can just go update that ledger we'll get into the process I think later by how this ledger gets updated but you know through some I always call it cryptographic wizardry through cryptographic wizardry this ledger gets updated in a way that you know is accurate and then it's maintained all over the world decentralized so it makes it very hard to tamper with so that's how I think of a blockchain that's the Bitcoin blockchain so obviously this you know is getting us into the weeds and kind of you know lifting the hood but the thing is that as technical as this might sound or as kind of difficult as it might be to follow like it's actually enabling some really really interesting things to be possible in the world that just were not possible before so we're gonna give you a few examples of what that looks like what what are some ways in which or things that are possible now with like blockchain technology that we're not possible before so first of all let's just take a minute and say what when I say when I was just describing to you the Bitcoin blockchain which also people refer to as the public blockchain that's different you'll now hear people talk about blockchain technology I think you're when you're asking about different use cases and what could be possible we're talking now about blockchain not necessarily with the Bitcoin blockchain and if you want to get fit we're gonna give you some terms before you leave here tonight so you'll be really down with some lingo I'm gonna give you the first right now it's called DLT how many of you have heard of DLT okay I heard someone whisper it but I didn't see a hand distributed ledger technology whoever said that that's exactly right and this is distributed ledger technology the difference or the interplay between blockchain and distributed ledger technology is that blockchain the public Bitcoin blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology but there are other kinds of block chains that aren't the public blockchain so for example think of it like the intranet and the Internet you could have permissioned block chains private networks where certain parties who already trust each other are sharing a ledger and that's different from the public blockchain so I just wanted to kind of throw that out before we talk about some of the use cases but the use cases are really far-reaching and I think this is one of the really exciting things about this technology one example is again this distributed ledger technology not necessarily the public Bitcoin because of course on a blockchain you can transfer any you can transfer assets on the public Bitcoin blockchain you're transferring Bitcoin but there's no reason you can't transfer other assets on a blockchain you can transfer anything of value so what has value in society one of the really promising use cases for blockchain technology is identity so could you put identity as an asset some governments think possibly you could so for example the state of Illinois right now has a pilot program to put birth certificates onto a block team again not the public Bitcoin blockchain but using blockchain technology putting that birth certificates and records of individuals birth on a shared ledger other things that people talk about very exciting use cases our supply chain management think about vaccines moving through the system we don't know where they came from maybe we don't know their provenance we might not know when they expire well there are a lot of programs right now where they're experimenting with tracking vaccines on using blockchain technology another thing I think is very promising I know you're aware of this project but charitable donations right now actually I think you were at that same meeting we we met with the former Prime Minister of Haiti he was the prime minister at the time of the earthquake and he reported that the Red Cross took in five hundred million dollars of aid that they couldn't account for and when he went for this accounting it wasn't able to be provided so if you think about some of the fraud and the corruption there's just a there's just a very much a lack of transparency which people are pretty excited that maybe distributed ledger technology or blockchain technology could help solve so these are just some of these cases I could actually go on and on yeah there are many more that are talked about and these are some of these are just ideas right and people say oh well that's not possible I don't know if you want to address that an hour well the one thing I wanted to add was that same person Laura Lawrence is his name the prime minister of AD or the former prime minister maybe he said in the earthquake there was a building with all the records of you know whatever it was birth certificates or something and a Land Registry - right and it collapsed or I don't know basically all the records were destroyed but imagine if all of those were held on a blockchain in the cloud in this tamper-proof fashion then that would be very powerful and that would have been unaffected by that natural disaster um but now that we've kind of given people given people an idea of how this can be applied let's talk about how a blockchain works okay now we're going to go back to our Bitcoin blockchain because that's our that's our best example to illustrate how it works so let's break down the term so two words comprise blockchain right block and so what is a block a block is just a group of transactions of Bitcoin transactions that are all grouped together and every 10 minutes a new block of transit so a new group of transactions is verified on the Bitcoin network and attached to the prior block and when I say attached I mean chained so there's the second word blockchain so a group event a transactions that's attached to another group of transactions in a chain like fashion and one of the interesting things about the Bitcoin blockchain architecture well there are a lot of interesting things but one of the really unique aspects is that that new block has some data from all over the pride from the prior block and and it's called a hash and I don't want to get too down in the weeds so I just like to think of it as data so on that new block it has some data from prior blocks and I think of it as almost DNA you know the new block almost inherits some DNA of the prior blocks and why that's significant is again for reasons concerning the ability to tamper and to trust this ledger and it's because if you it would be really hard if you wanted to go back and change this ledger because all of these blocks have you know relate to each other they have some hat they have data in them and Laura I think you're really good at explaining the hash function here but the concept is just each subsequent block has data from prior blocks you know so if you try to change you know some transaction ten blocks black back or something everybody would know because the chain would then be broken it wouldn't basically the math equations that kind of link them all together and prove that they are still linked they would show that they weren't no longer linked at you know some point so that's basically how the ledger is shown to be secure you can kind of prove it essentially mathematically the ethereal

is paving the way for safer and more reliable smart contracts that will power the decentralized world to learn more or request an audit visit ww1 stamp comm so let's talk about mining which I'm sure is something a lot of people have heard about and it's a really important part of how a blocking does work so what what is that I think one of the things about mining that throws people off is it's it's like mining we think of mining gold or something well it's not really mining how I another way to think of it is the process by which the blockchain is secured so if whenever you hear the word mining just in your mind think oh the process that secures the blockchain I think sometimes that helps at least it helps me so again it's the process by which the blockchain is secured and it rewards those who are doing the securing and when I say those it sounds like I'm talking about people in this day and age I'm really talking about computers and computing power but we can think of them as people also because people only computers and so how it works is basically you have again I talked about that decentralized network of computers spread out all over the world and how it works is that these computers engage in basically a gigantic race to solve a really complicated math puzzle and this is what I was talking about about cryptographic wizardry but it's a very complex math problem and these problems get by the way harder and harder and the first computer to solve this puzzle this math puzzle two things happen one they get the right to add the next block to that chain that we talked about they also get rewarded financially they're incentivized to perform this math computation and they get rewarded in the form of Bitcoin this is called a block reward okay and so they think they're doing this great thing they're getting money for solving a math problem but in the process they're secure they're adding another block to the chain verifying transactions and thus securing the network do you have anything to add about mining um well I I think the only thing that I would add here is that when other thing that's not saying about Bitcoin is the way that they incentivized people to join the network was that when the software was first released it was dispensing 50 new bitcoins every 10 minutes then after four years that went to 25 and now it's down to 12.5 and then we'll keep going until we reach the 21 million limit but the point is that you know it was sort of like trying to get people on in the network earlier rather than later right by just fencing more of them and so you would want to join before before the block reward got halved as they call it right the having events happen every four years and so you know as you mentioned it's got people on the network and of course 25 blockchain I'm sorry 25 Bitcoin back in the day wasn't worth all that much ironically at the time but now it's worth a whole lot and so the price obviously fluctuates so the actual fiat currency value of the block reward also changes yeah the economic system of their coin is so fascinating to me because I definitely think it's one of the first instances we've seen of just kind of this little mini economy that it's created where it's like incentivizing all these behaviors and as one of my other sources always says to me what's so interesting about it is that often when you get people who don't know each other and you're trying to incentivize different behaviors from them they don't always do the the thing that will like create an optimal good for the for the group the Bitcoin is one of those first instances where people don't have to trust each other and yet a social good comes out of the way that they've been incentivized but it's speaking of kind of social goods we've heard a lot about hacks in crypto how in have any block chains been hacked how can they be hacked well so my answer sometimes differs here than some other members of the crypto community and that's because I spent over a decade as a federal prosecutor and I prosecuted some pretty big hacks and cyber crimes so I'm never gonna tell you anything can't be hacked I think a lot of people in this community would tell you the blockchain is unhackable I won't make that claim but I will say it's pretty darn secure and trustworthy I would bet money that it wouldn't be hacked but I'm still not gonna sit here and tell you it's not possible when you hear about hacks and oftentimes not journalists like yourself Laura but some other journalists slow report that the blockchain was hacked and it's actually factually incorrect what they mean was that an exchange a crypto currency exchange was hacked again because see remember the the blockchain is decentralized so again getting back to that notion it would be really really hard if not impossible to hack it exchanges are centralized it's a centralized single point of failure and just like we see all kinds of central points of failure being subject to hack whether it's Equifax or whether it's OPM in the government cryptocurrency exchanges or whether it's by the way financial institutions traditional financial institutions cryptocurrency exchanges aren't any exception and one of the first really big ones was the hack of mountain how many of you have heard of Mount so mount docs was a crypto currency exchange came to be based in Japan although at some point it had some roots in San Francisco but it was based in Japan and it was suffered several hacks and at the time it was a lot of money it was about five hundred million dollars hacked however that number would be so much more today because at the time I think that was in 2014-2015 I guess Bitcoin was not worth nearly as much as it is today and about 850,000 bitcoins or hacked in that series of hacks so if you think about today value of Bitcoin is around around 8,000 dollars a coin I think it got up to today times that by 850,000 another Exchange was hacked was BitFenix a hundred and twenty thousand bitcoins which again translates to hundreds of millions of dollars I guess I don't want to do the math in my head but and this continues a coin check was an exchange in Japan where it wasn't Bitcoin that was hacked it was another crypto currency called nem nem was hacked to the tune of I forgot 500 million dollars I believe it's not unlike that and that exchange had actually made so much in profits that it was able to promise to repatriate the 500 million dollars in cryptocurrency back to its customers or at least it told the Japanese government that that's its plan so I think what you hear of is the Bitcoin is hacked or the blockchain was hacked you're hearing about exchanges that were hacked they would just be like as if I said if you know Bank of America were hacked and I said cache was hacked right right which doesn't make sense right but yeah in terms of like whether or not a blockchain can be hacked often people say oh maybe quantum computing can do it so I so that's just to give you an idea of when Katie says it it could be possible it's it's you know more in that realm of things but one other thing I wanted to ask you about is that a lot of people here in the audience and just generally in the wider world think of Bitcoin as criminal money and yet you were a federal prosecutor for more than a decade and yet you were so passionate about this technology and about Bitcoin why well let me take you back to when I first heard a Bitcoin which was in 2012 and I had just done a big I used to do national security for a while then I did organized crime and murder cases so I was out here doing prison gang cases I was by the way I was in San Francisco for nine years as a federal prosecutor I was in DC for nine years before that and out here I kind of had had my fill finally of the organized in violent crime world and thought I would move on to something else and my superiors asked me to prosecute this new technology criminal technology called Bitcoin and that was in 2012 and I said sure I opened up a case file this is still how the government works we open a case file a paper case file you know to prosecute Bitcoin and I went home and I talked to my husband about it who explained to me quickly he was kind of a sci-fi person into the gaming world so he already knew about Bitcoin I didn't and he said that's not possible that's like saying you're gonna prosecute cash or the Internet you better get smart about this he directed me to the wiki page on Bitcoin and that was my first exposure to it and I pretty quickly realized that what really the government's priorities here should be would be around prosecuting some of the worst criminal use cases involving crypto currencies like Bitcoin just like we focused on some of the worst uses of cash or wire transfers and so one of the things I realized early on is that like any new technology criminals are some of the earliest adopters of new technologies now although all of us in this room used the internet for everything every single day in the early days of the internet some of the earliest adopters were fraudsters and pornographers and they loved this new technology that helped them perfect their craft or facilitate their craft the same is true of cryptocurrency and in those early days a lot of criminals thought it was totally anonymous and not trackable again turns out that that's not at all the case and so what the government did was start prosecuting some of the criminal use cases but just like cash just like the Internet it turns out there's a whole lot of really great stuff about the technology and actually one of those great things about the technology is that I know it helped you solve some crimes can you tell people what those crimes were and how you solved them sure I can we'll see a couple of them some of them are still under seal so maybe you'll read about them someday but the some of the earlier ones I did was how many of you have heard of Silk Road Oh a lot of people in this room have heard of Silk Road so which was an online dark net marketplace where you could buy everything from fake identification to drugs and other things and you know whether you consider it a libertarian paradise or whether you consider it a criminal enterprise the government considered it a criminal enterprise and was hard at work trying to find out who was the mastermind behind the Silk Road who was running it so there were two teams on the East Coast of federal agents trying to find out who who was Dread Pirate Roberts or the mastermind behind the Silk Road well it turns out that some of the federal task force members on one of those task forces were themselves really corrupt and when I got a tip as I was here in San Francisco and I thought Oh typical San Franciscans they think the government it's always a conspiracy theory of course the government's corrupt of course there's a dirty agent on the payroll so I took it with a grain of salt but I looked with some agents well actually not many agents because you know one thing that most federal agents don't want to do is investigate other federal agents and that's where this thing called the blockchain came in because it's public you can go look on it on the internet and see some transfers that are going on and I'm simplifying things now but it was very important to have this public database turns out it was also important to have this immutable permanent ledger because these agents who were specialists in anonymizing technologies and tor one of them was joint duty assigned to the NSA actually knew how to really cover their tracks and get other centralized databases to change records and they could not change the transfers that happen on the blockchain and the long story short is they one of them was stealing which told about 21,000 Bitcoin from the Silk Road and made it look like the Silk Road administrator had done that causing a hit to be put out on his life in any event we were able to bring charges and that agent went to prison but what we didn't know was there was actually another agent who was also engaged in this kind of same behavior on that task force and the blockchain allowed us to see the patterns of these two people were very different so encouraged us I guess to keep looking because we knew we were dealing with more than one person so that's one case and I always say and it's very true without the fact that they use Bitcoin and blockchain technology we never would have caught them and that I do believe that another case was well the Mount  have I mentioned it turns out that another exchange that was based in Russia btc-e which was unsealed the indictment was unsealed last summer those mounting some of those coins that were hacked in that mount GOx hack that I mentioned they some of the 850,000 Bitcoin about five hundred thousand of Bitcoin we were able to trace again using the blockchain to this other exchange btc-e in Russia and laundered through there and using the EM lat you know treaty power and all kinds of other investigative techniques we were able to follow that to certain people's bank accounts so that case we solved using the Bitcoin blockchain trail so as we've seen governments find this technology very useful but I think there are some other ways where they might find blockchain technology useful what are those well I think anywhere well let's let's talk first about actually not in u.s. because I think there's some interesting stuff going on with governments using this technology not in the United States although certainly the United States government is also looking at this technology but Dubai Dubai has stated that it will be the first blockchain powered government by the year 2020 and so what Dubai will do is they're going to put all of the business licensing applications on using blockchain technology so on distributed Ledger's visa applications and what else there are a few other things so Visa Land Registry records and a few other kind of basic civil service kind of civic services I guess they're going to be putting on to this distributed ledger system and they've estimated that it will save at least twenty five million man-hours and countless billions of dollars per year and that's Dubai so that's kind of they've they haven't done this yet and in many ways I think it will be interesting to see what some of these countries are able to do when we can kind of borrow who the US government could borrow from that although the US government is engaged in its own kind of studies and pilot programs the Postal Service just announced that they're going to be piloting a blockchain program I mentioned that the state of Illinois is doing piloting a program to put birth certificates on the blockchain and I think anything that you where you think you could improve transmission see where there's a greater need for transparency and where there's a lot of fraud waste and abuse and it turns out there is a lot of fraud waste and abuse that goes on in government services unfortunately and so I think that there are a lot of different ways you could use the blockchain now that again I don't want to make it sound like this is just this miracle technology that can replace everything the fact of the matter is there's a lot of infrastructure and a lot of structure that needs to be built and in this way think of it like the early days of the internet like someone said we're on the dial-up days still and if you would have said you could stream Netflix videos and download photos to you in 1994 on the internet you would have thought they were crazy because you know remember do those of you in this room remember this dial-up noises that your modem is connecting couldn't even barely download an email and so this technology is also in its kind of infancy right now and all of those structures need to be bailed out and a lot of really talented developers and engineers and computer scientists are working on these projects now yeah and just to again underscore this point about it sort of where we are versus where we might someday be one stat that you always mention to me just that just blows my mind is that in the US I guess there's 14,000 different legitimate birth certificate forms or something yeah this is like this always makes people doubt me and then I tell them go look online and Google Health and Human Services Inspector General report years ago still nothing's been done about this but in this country 6,000 different entities just in the u.s. 6,000 entities can issue birth certificates using 14 was in different forms and we wonder why we have an identity theft problem and we wonder why we have a fraud problem and in law enforcement we call this breeder documents because they breed new identities once you're able to get a fake birth certificate which is really easy because no one can spot a forgery because there are 14,000 forms and with all of the advances in printing it's just an it's a paper document and it still is today and if you think about that it's kind of mind-blowing but that form of identity that again can breed new identities because once you have a birth certificate you can go get it you know credit card driver's license whatever and you Matt you get together a few forms of ID and then you're really in business if you're a criminal and so I think identity systems is one area where really our government should really actively I think be exploring use of blockchain technology people say well is that secure and I say well birth certificates are public records and certainly the current system isn't secure yeah so let's move into something a little bit more futuristic we did talk about aetherium before let's describe what that is for people who don't know okay so aetherium is a platform a computing platform again decentralized here's the big bugs buzzwords of cryptocurrency and blockchain is just centralization the decentralized computing platform for smart contracts now who knows what smart contracts are okay see just a couple hands do you want me to explain your contract either so think of a contract you know you have your paper contract right and it's a set of promises and if someone doesn't live up to those promises you what you hope they do and usually they do and if they don't your recourse is to go to court I guess just a much recourse these days because it takes a while to get there and it's very expensive think of a smart contract as a set of promises in a digital form you know like a digital format digital contract but that contract is programmed upon the completion of certain conditions to execute transactions so in its code it will execute certain transactions when certain conditions are met we can talk about one example is that people always use is escrow agents so in this way smart contracts some say will really remove middlemen even lawyers so from the equation but escrow agent is a great example because you know you have to have this trusted middlemen or third party for the title transfer and the funds transfer unless those things could happen simultaneously through a smart contract so basically how I think of and we'll get to aetherium because the currency of smart contracts I think of it as highly programmable money you can program your money to go somewhere else when something happens and and people think well how does the contract know if something happens I've had that question myself I think with the Internet of Things for example or with the Internet there are certain verifiable publicly verifiable facts that when they occur that contract will self execute and so that's a smart contract so when you ask about aetherium aetherium is just the platform the decentralized computing platform for smart contracts and in order to that to use that platform you need just like if you're a car you need gas to use the etherium computing platform for smart contracts you need gas to and that gas is called ether and ether is another kind of cryptocurrency so we're actually we're gonna um start questions in five minutes I just wanted to get people thinking if you have any questions you might want to get them ready and also go stand back near the mic which is near the door back there but we're gonna keep talking about aetherium okay why don't you give me some examples of what people can do with aetherium well there are examples that I can talk about which is what people say you'll be able to do with aetherium right now it's really still in early days so I told you that Bitcoin was conceived of by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 a cerium was conceived of by a young guy I'll call him a kid because he's in my opinion he's a kid named italic metallic butyrin and it was it launched in 2015 and he wrote a white paper he had studied Bitcoin and he thought he would improve upon Bitcoin to make it highly programmable so a cryptocurrency that was highly programmable and so in 2015 aetherium launched so aetherium is newer than Bitcoin and there are things that are said that we could do with smart contracts I'll give you a couple examples but I want to be clear they haven't yet executed yet come to fruition I don't doubt that they will but some some kind of things are like if you think about people talk about very futuristic a peer-to-peer air B&B appear to pure uber so we're removing the middlemen the middleman so it would be a peer-to-peer network of probably be self-driving cars by that day cars and riders and their it would all be run through smart contracts and so uber wouldn't be around to take a cut and then also the same thing if you think about peer-to-peer Airbnb there's another project underway right now called file coin and they call it it's basically a compete it's a platform where if you have extra space on your computer it's like an Airbnb for computer space and one of the really neat things about smart contracts here and that's underway now one of the cool things I know we're wrapping up for questions but about smart contracts is it makes certain assets that were illiquid previously possibly liquid so for example the unused file space on your computer on used computing power on may be on you couldn't previously get paid directly for watching Digital advertisements but why not so it will render they say assets that were previously a liquid liquid all right why don't we we have a good set of questions there why don't we take the first one hi thank you so much my question is about you said there are seven thousand computers updating the ledger so to speak what about the energy consumption will it reach a point where you can just be unsustainable and where are these computers it's a really great question do you want me to answer that do you want to I'm sure I mean the you're right that the energy consumption of Bitcoin is quite I know especially because there are so many computers on the network I have spoken with some Bitcoin miners and I do know that they are focused on placing their mining equipment near renewable energies so you'll see a lot of them like their hydropower in her geothermal but you're right I think the most recent statistic I found was that if Bitcoin were a country would be like I forget in the 40s in terms of like you know it's ranking of energy consumption amongst all nations on earths there yes Honduras I think I read it consumes more power and more energy than the country of Honduras and it might be even bigger now yeah it really depends on what time you check the stats basically but the thing is that there are actually other ways to secure the network that some people in in the crypto world are working on so like a cerium is moving to a form of securing the network that is less environmentally intensive yeah but that was a great question I'm glad thing about that and one other thing I wanted to say which I meant to say earlier when you guys were asking the question so that was a great question because it was briefed and asked a question but that's just reminding you of what Marissa said earlier to keep your remarks short and to be a question and I do think that's a great question and people are developing alternative crypto currencies for this reason environmentally friendly crypto currencies so that is in the works and laura has a great podcast yesterday actually I just listened to it today was it out yesterday it wasn't it was out Tuesday Tuesday about that you can go to and download on iTunes all about the consumption used for this and so that's actually a really timely question so thank you first question is so actually what happens when you buy a Bitcoin where does that physically go okay good question so you can get a Bitcoin in a couple different ways like let me just talk about well you could mine a Bitcoin if you had a supercomputer but let's say that you wanted to just buy a Bitcoin you get a Bitcoin somehow most people now will go to what we call on and off ramps which are the cryptocurrency exchanges and those exist all over the world the biggest one in the United States is coin base I happen to be on the board of directors of coin base so fair and full disclosure but it's the kind of most popular on and off ramp in the United States in other countries other exchanges are popular so you would go give in in this case you would open a coin based account or if you were in Europe you might open a bitstamp account for example that's another exchange and you would give give the exchange money cash money you know fiat currency you could use a credit card you could use your debit card or you could link it to your bank account and in exchange they will give you you you will have a Bitcoin wallet and you will get Bitcoin or you could also buy for example a cerium or maybe you decide you want litecoin the other ways that someone could give it to you and we do have systems in this country called like local bitcoins think of it it like a Craigslist you could meet someone at a Starbucks and give them cash and they'll transfer you you know through your digital devices you would both have a Bitcoin wallet which anyone can just get a Bitcoin wallet online and you can transfer Bitcoin and pay them cash so that's probably those are the easiest most common ways to get a hold of Bitcoin merchants also do take Bitcoin yeah and if you do at that second way then it's a little bit more like literally dealing in cash where you then there's no like bank or central authority that you can go to to say hey I made a mistake with this transaction like can you reverse it or whatever because like let let's say within coinbase Katie and I both have coin based accounts and I Center some money but then I didn't mean to or whatever like I could maybe say to coinbase hey I screwed up you know however send it back to me or whatever it is that they might do but if you're dealing with it in in more of that digital cash fashion where you know maybe it's literally on your or the way that you're accessing the Bitcoin network is through your phone it's like you are in control of that it's it's much more like literally dealing with cash so I know this is like maybe a slightly different concept because technically the Bitcoin will reside in the cloud but you are controlling that through your phone and they call that that control of it it's through what they call it private key like a password so essentially you can either ask a surface like coin base to manage your private keys or you can say I'm gonna hold my private keys and be careful if you hold your private keys as some have learned the hard way on set in some ways there's no centralized service holding them so if some people prefer it to hold their own private keys the only danger in that is that you could lose them and it's just like losing cash so there's the famous story of a guy who I don't know how many hundreds if not thousands of Bitcoin he had and I basically threw them out in a dumpster with his old computer well when the price of Bitcoin started going through the roof it was many millions of dollars and I last they heard he finally had permission to look through the landfill site but um the money is gone yeah this was in England because they were initially right when he lost it it wasn't worth as much and he was like I'll forget it and then last fall when the prices are going up he you ask for permission but they're working on a lot of custody solutions this is part of the ARCA structure the plumbing the structure that is being built by different companies and developers right now are secure ways to store this stuff a lot of institutional money on that storage point is yet to come into the space and a lot of people think that will help stability and volatility because a lot of institutional money we've heard is waiting on the sidelines to come in because there's no what we call in law a qualified custodian so hedge funds fund managers investment professional professionals under law are required to have crypto funds held by a qualified custodian and there just aren't those solutions being built yet but they're in the works now next question okay thanks my head is spinning right now but my question was sort of like how do you spend it I read a story one time this couple was traveling around the world and they only wanted to use bitcoins but you know companies or stores or hotel they have to sign up for this that so you could only go to places that are signed up to have Bitcoin exchanges that correct well so a lot of merchants are now taking it it's a bit in kind of in fashion now I know some of the merchants that are taking it because the fact is at least in this country with the price as high as it is people aren't actually wanting to make payments in Bitcoin there's this famous example of a guy who spent 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas and so those pizzas would now be worth what over a hundred million dollars no one wants to be that guy so no one's spending the Bitcoin in this country not no one but people are you know there's not as much demand right now I think for merchants to accept Bitcoin however we do see you know Bitcoin accepted here signs and so merchants just like they'll accept credit cards will do have mechanisms that they could accept Bitcoin payments and I think I forgot if it was kayak or Expedia one of those sites Expedia Expedia I'm like Dell computers overstock these are some of the big brands that famously do accept Bitcoin again though I don't suspect they have a lot of demand right now to be paying in Bitcoin because of the reason I just mentioned now maybe that stability and volatility works itself out I hope so because I think Bitcoin is a great payment system but right now in this country it's just not being used that way yeah I think in places like Argentina they use it quite a bit more where in Argentina there's sort of like an official government exchange rate to the US dollar that's definitely not the same as what it is on the black markets I think people like using Bitcoin because they feel like they're getting a fair exchange rate then obviously Venezuela is a very similar situation so basically we're in places where people don't trust their government money you see Bitcoin being used a lot more next question so thank you very much I have two quick questions so one is how how is the value of Bitcoin sort of determined and then the second one relates specifically to the regulatory framework in the United States I know like the SEC in the IRS everybody's looking at it differently and I'm curious what you see sort of happening there and how people who are holding the currency can deal with it for tax purposes or any kind of disclosure public disclosure purposes here in the United States so the first question is pretty easy it's just market right it's what the supply and demand is and so you can go to any of the major exchanges and look at what the price of Bitcoin is today so that's to your first question your second question about regulatory framework much more complicated I think one of the things we're hearing a lot about in the news now or and we didn't get to this question I think Laura is right but I do want to leave you at this term I echo or I see oh you're hearing a lot about icos now our initial coin offerings okay and these are for tokens which we can we could explain for a minute but a lot of the regulatory questions are kind of coming into play because of you know how how do regulators think of ICS are these tokens securities or are they not in terms of the broader regulatory framework look one of the hard things about doing business in the United States if you're a kind of an emerging technology company is you've got a lot of different regulators so for example using coinbase as an example one of the reasons that I joined coinbase is board is that they early on kind of embraced regulation and said we're going to get end up getting regulated we're gonna go get money transmission licenses as painful as it is in all of these 50 well 48 states because in two states they're not doing business presently but in the 48 states where they're going to do business they're gonna go get licensed even if the person at the financial supervisory board in Mississippi has never heard of Bitcoin they're gonna go try and get a Bitcoin license or a money transmission license to sell buy and sell Bitcoin but you also have anti money laundering laws that Treasury enforces and as I said sometimes it ends up being ironically easier for the federal government to kind of follow the money where crypto currencies are used instead of cash but you then have as you mentioned the SEC they think of some of these securities the CFTC has said No some of these look to us like commodities so we regulate them and then the tax questions are also difficult IRS kind of came out in 2014 and said this is just like property so account for it as you would property now that becomes really complicated if you start using Bitcoin as a payment mechanism because what if you made money but then you spent it on a cup of coffee and how do you account for that so a lot of really complicated tax questions I think in some ways you know the United States is not behind in regulations they have working groups at all of these agencies looking at this stuff and trying to work together in other ways like those working groups are also looking to see what other countries are doing too and how they're treating these assets like in the United Kingdom you have the financial conduct authority one of the nice things about doing business in the UK if you're one of these financial technology companies is they have this regulatory sandbox and they also have one primary financial regulator the FCA that's not what we have here that's said everyone seems to be making their way through and it is still there's some uncertainty but as I always I do always say this and Laura knows I've said this publicly the government's not looking to go after kind of gray areas in this space they really there there are enough bad actors that they want to go where they're kind of gonna pick the winners or the obvious cases so I do think when you see enforcement actions or when you see criminal cases brought you're gonna see well there was really no question that was wrong at least I hope that's the case next question hi so I'm also a coinbase user and there was a lot of commotion and Marcus disruption over the last bitcoin Fork so I was wondering can you explain Forks why does a currency fork and how do Forks affect the crypto market as a whole oh that's a good question about Forks so for if so Bitcoin basically this code is open source as I understand it I mean this is a very technical question you just asked this is open source and so if the community doesn't like a particular direction or the way the things are being run they can copy this open source code and create their own and so that's what happened in Bitcoin and Bitcoin forked and what split off was called Bitcoin cash do you how do you how do you think in what should about there's multiple ways to do Forks but the way the Bitcoin cash group did it was they did it in such a way where anybody who held bitcoins on the day that they forked which was August 1st 2017 would receive the equivalent number of Bitcoin cash so if you had 5 bitcoins now you suddenly had 5 Bitcoin cash if you had 25 you had 25 Bitcoin cash and what happens then is essentially because these are kind of ideological and very politically motivated things what happened right after that was that a lot of the probic when people got super angry and they were dumping or selling their Bitcoin cash so you saw the price kind of spike up the segment hit the exchanges just because that was the first time there was like this known price and then crashed down when all these people decided to sell because they were super mad that like this group had created this competing cryptocurrency and then there were a few more political developments and that happened the Bitcoin cow side that like I said again was my ideal ideologically motivated sort of gained a little bit of steam so the price has since gone up but your right side I think initially coinbase did not give its users access to the Bitcoin cash so if you weren't keeping your bitcoins on coinbase you actually didn't receive access to them originally and the reason for that as far as I understand is unit there's a lot of kind of engineering that goes into maintaining all these different accounts and these wallets for people and so I think maybe you know I did not interview them about this so I'm just speculating here but my guess is that you know they just sort of determine cost analysis Oh like we don't think that there's gonna be great to man for the Bitcoin cash they ended everything wrong about that there's this really funny chart you can see online where you literally can see that the number of users of coin base drop down before the fork because people knew that if they were not in control of their private key use that they would not be able to access therap declines in coinbase so literally they lost like half of the number of bitcoins that they were keeping which is crazy I'm sure that was it not a happy day there well I do just want to add it wasn't just engineering resources there are a number of I'm not here to talk about coin based business but I will say there were a number of other reasons that it was announced in advance well in advance that coin base wasn't going to initially support Bitcoin cash which it now does and that one of the reasons is as I just mentioned they have 48 different states money service business licenses and there are regulatory requirements to supporting new assets in some of those states and so that that's one of the other many reasons that went into that but now coinbase does support Bitcoin cash I should also mention bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that forked or crypto has said that forked etherium did too so you have aetherium and you have a theory in classic and when Laura says it's very political it is that people have religion in this industry not all of them I don't think I do but a lot of people especially some of the early people in this community really have very strongly held views and what we call here's a term for you crypto Twitter there's a very active Twitter kind of presence for the crypto currency or crypto assets community and they hotly debating issues yes okay next question on Stephen Colbert one night he was doing a charity and the website crashed because the crypto people gave all the money so could you talk a little bit about crypto and charities sure actually I'm pleased to talk about one example and that's called the pineapple fund and the pineapple fund is this kind of organization of individuals in the cryptocurrency community and again these funds grow quickly when the price of cryptocurrency goes up it has given away fifty three million dollars so far to charity I'm not sure yeah I think it raised fifty three million and I believe it's dispensed fifty three million dollars to various charities that's one example another example is ripple a company I'll call it distributed ledger technology company ripple labs you might have seen in the San Francisco Chronicle I think gave twenty eight million dollars to San Francisco schools a couple weeks ago the founder of coin base has called for a crypto giving fund and has asked people or anyone if he's asked people but in this medium post he talked about the importance of some of the early adopters of crypto who have made a lot of money to contribute to a fund for that purpose and so as I said before you know new technologies have good uses and they've bad uses and we're always going to have bad people using these new technologies and we're also going to have a lot of great uses for society with these new technologies and I think that's a prime example yeah and I will say just in general in this space there is this feeling that this technology can be very democratizing so a lot of people do are motivated to look into philanthropic uses of it and is there is without it or this is gonna be our last audience question okay thank you so much for your time I know this is somewhat insider baseball so if it doesn't make sense to answer feel free to and say no thanks but I wanted to know what if any overlap you thought the big fish ruling that came down this week from the Ninth Circuit had in regards to virtual currencies so I clerked on the Ninth Circuit and I clerked for the Supreme Court and I'm ashamed to say I don't have any idea what the big fish ruling was neither could you yeah sure so I'm not a lawyer long story short judge said that like the virtual currencies used in video games are real currency and so a lot of game companies are freaking out because they're little coins and their games are considered real gambling and so this this will really mess up the games industry and it's just the first time at least that I've seen it ruling that high up and the court come down on you know what could all sensibly can be considered not a blockchain based virtual currency but a virtual currency nonetheless well thanks for mentioning it because like I said I guess I should be a court watcher having clerked on that Court and also being in this industry but I hadn't heard about it so I'll look it up I think one of the things that's nothing new though because um a company called Linden Labs that made linden dollars they went through similar things you know years and years ago and it's actually been an open question before the Treasury Department they put out guidance in 2013 about virtual currencies and a lot of people in the gaming community said well why if this is this broad definition why then do frequent flyer miles not count why do videogame dollars not count so it's actually an open question I'll be curious to read that decision Thanks so we we are gonna wrap up with an in-form tradition which is to ask the guests what their 60 second idea is to change the world what's yours Katie I'm gonna split it into two in 30 seconds each the first is I want to see us owning our own data and maybe a blockchain is the way we can do it I don't know that it's possible but I have long been a privacy nut even though I worked for the government as a prosecutor for a decade I personally because of that valued my own privacy I felt it was a security risk and I hate that these companies have collected our data as they have one of the most interesting things I think from blockchain technology is let's own our own data let's own our own health data can we if we want to rent it if we want to sell it and if we want to donate it to charitable purse purpose for example to a pharmaceutical company doing research but the notion that these centralized entities owned our data and sell it and monetize number one without our consent and number two without us getting any benefit seems like we need to change that that was 45 seconds so 15 seconds great well let's give a round of applause to Katie thank you and and before you depart I just wanted to alkie let you know that we cleaned I was two more programs around blockchain and cryptocurrencies so you should stay tuned for news on those and then the last thing I wanted to say was thank you for joining us at inform of the Commonwealth Club thank you so much thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
