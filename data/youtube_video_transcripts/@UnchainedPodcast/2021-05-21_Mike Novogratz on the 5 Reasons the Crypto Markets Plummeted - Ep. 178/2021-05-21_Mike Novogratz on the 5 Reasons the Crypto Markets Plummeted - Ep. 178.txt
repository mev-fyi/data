neutral blockchain protocol learn more at n-e-a-r dot o-r-g today's guest is mike novogratz ceo of galaxy digital welcome mike how are you doing laura it's my third time on your show we'll have to have you back so we've seen a bloody week in crypto but as of today thursday which is recording day there's a noticeable bounce back up what do you think was the cause of the washout and what do you think the outlook is from here on out great question listen when you have these big liquidations there's always more than one cause and so the first thing is i think you have to recognize people were longer crypto than we all thought i got calls yesterday from you know people i've met years ago what should i do what should i do celebrities athletes you know rappers uh right crypto fever found its way into lots of pockets so that's one two we had tax day in the u.s you know two days ago and so a lot of people had a cell to take to pay their taxes but we also had it was about one year after like paul jones and that whole group of hedge funds bought crypto and so they hit their one year uh long term to short term or short term to long term capital gains mark and so i'm sure some of them decided hey now it's a short term you know i made so much money if you bought bitcoin at 8 000 and it was trading at 50. let's lock some in with the lower tax rate uh and then you can't deny elon musk you know his comment about esg kind of hit bitcoin in the remember that that book the hobbit where smog had that uh the dragon had that one vulnerability uh and the the archer hit the arrow right there like that's a vulnerability it's not ferrets of vulnerability in lots of ways we can get to the esg question uh in a little bit but you add that all together plus my last we had this kind of craziness going on with really crappy coins that were pumping 5x and i looked at eth classic i was shorty classic and thank god i was disciplined and covered uh and then it went up five times i was like thank god i covered you know for no reason you know these fudd coins were irish and fud coins kind of crummy coins were just being pumped that's always a sign of excessive speculation what we saw with doge and shiba emu and that it's it's fun if you're involved i guess but it's not healthy for the ecosystem and it's certainly a sign of excess speculation and so you put all those things together the charts crack and then you take out leverage and i think i read 700 per 700 000 people got stopped out nine billion dollars taken out of uh their wallets and that's mostly retail some hedge funds of course stopped out a lot a lot of friends that are displayed and sold most of the big institutions don't move that fast they're like what just happened uh most of the crypto ogs they're like ah this is just part of part of being in crypto that's like a painful part of being in crypto but we bounce back pretty quickly i think partly because you know the story doesn't really change there is a revolution going on uh i see it with the kind of human capital that we're hiring more and more unbelievably talented people want to work in our industry and i see it with our competitors doing the same thing i was talking to our own troops yesterday and i was like i remember when the nikkei fell 50 in one night when they had the fukushima earthquake the earthquake and then the fukushima reactor literally the second biggest stock market in the world fell 50 at night and then bounced it wasn't like oh the stock market's over right people dusted off went back to work and uh the industry continues to continue and it's the kind of the same thing when we have things like it for a moment you're like oh my gosh what's happening uh it was a liquidity too much leverage and so if there's a lesson in this it's for the individual investor bitcoin is an 80 vol instrument ethereum is 120 ball instrument the altcoins have higher vol than that you don't need leverage and everyone in especially the younger generation but everyone wants to get rich quick uh give me four to one levers freedom six to one and like where we're dealing with nitroglycerin uh that's the kind of volatility and so run with less leverage and you'll get stopped out less long answer sorry about that no no but you know you covered multiple questions at once i'm glad you actually raised the environmental concerns that was going to be a question of mine and i just wondered how much of a problem do you think that they are do you think that the industry should try to address them directly in some way and you know obviously galaxy you just launched um you know a new mining operation and you also said you'd be launching new financial services and tools for the bitcoin mining sector but will any of that address energy issues or is it just financial tools for minors so yeah let me answer that question really holistically first i think let's defend our industry a little bit we use a lot of electricity we provide an amazing service right bitcoin itself provides an amazing valuable service to the world right storing wealth and it should be expensive it uses a decent amount of green electricity and some less green electricity just like every other industry we're not talking about boycotting google and banning youtube because youtube uses two and a half percent of all global electricity think about that it crushes bitcoin and you know ah let's stop watching youtube provides an amazing service i will bow down at the altar of youtube it is one of the great innovations in the world you can learn anything on youtube literally anything and so you'd be crazy not to think youtube's a valuable service and it uses a lot of electricity just like google and microsoft and facebook and all the big tech companies and all the banks should be looking at reducing their carbon footprint going carbon neutral by 2040 or 2050 whatever they decide as the appropriate target crypto should too and i think you're going to see a rash of measures from the big crypto players to say hey this is how we're going to push our industry towards carbon neutral and those will be things like carbon sequestration right taking carbon and sinking it into the ground that can happen with carbon capture connect with these big machines that's carbon out of the air or planting trees it's complicated though like a tree is not a tree it's not a tree uh planting trees in some area actually create more carbon emissions and so you know we're working on finding the right experts i actually i know one or two of the the world's best people in this space um and i think you know give the industry time there will be a uh there'll be a response and i know that because i'm talking to lots of people that are in the space yeah i feel like the more that i see bitcoin people talking about this the more i keep thinking they may be working on some renewable energy you know combined initiatives i mean we're already seeing it like with caruso energy hey everyone just a quick note here the international energy agency says referring to this 2.5 statistic and others about youtube's energy use that quote it is clear these figures are too high although the iaea does not calculate its own number it does note how energy efficiency and demand are constantly changing um e3 has also been a big story this year and despite the bloodletting earlier this week it's tripled in price since the beginning of the year and this is even before we get to the london hard fork which will institute eip 1559 which will you know it's largely seen as a change in monetary policy that will make a deflationary asset how do you expect the rest of the year to go for ether yeah it's a great question i was people were like where do you think ether is going to go i was like dudes it went from 700 to 4 000. that's pretty good you know like how greedy can everybody get um listen ether has a lot going for it right now uh right it's got this monetary shift which i think is wonderful but it's got the three big tailwinds of stable coins being you know built on ether uh d5 being built on ether and nft is being built on ether and so i remember when i first met with joe lubin in 2015 he was explaining how all this was going to work and i was like and he's kind of got he's kind of gotten it right uh and we always said well ether's gotta it's gotta scale faster and it hasn't yet uh but their side chains and level twos and people are making all their their adjustments i do think because it's been slow to scale it's and because other people are creative it's led to the explosion really of these other ecosystems right the binance smart chain uh solana uh the tara luna system you know where you have these charismatic entrepreneurs uh all three maybe the three entrepreneurs of the year uh building similar ecosystems on far less decentralized far more efficient uh blockchains right i mean i don't know i don't even know if you can call the buy smart chain a decentralized block shape it's a cz chain and i don't i don't i don't bad mouth that i think they're unbelievable areas for innovation right and people are being brought into the system i wonder and you probably have a better insight on this than me if as these ecosystems grow and we transfer more value and we get and we get more regulated are regulators going to allow these less decentralized blockchains to be where we transfer all our wealth our consumer's going to care right like right now consumers don't care because most of the consumers of crypto are gamblers but they call them d-gens right crypto is still mostly a gambling ecosystem it will shift over time and you've seen it listen you know one of the cool things about luna is this chai payment system you know people i think it's seven percent eight percent now of payments and career being done over this blockchain based payment system and and so again i i'm watching this thing as a as an investor but also as a social the sociologist uh to see how this plays out i mean think of like you know the flow blockchain dapper it's pretty pretty tightly controlled like you know but we a blockchain is not a blockchain it's not a blockchain i was going to term afraid binos blockchain and name only uh and again i i know i sound like i'm casting dispersion i'm along a lot of this stuff because like charismatic leaders good communities momentum and the stuff uh in adoption i don't know in the long run how that plays out how you know we all started in this because it was a decentralized revolution right like literally and it was a peer-to-peer decentralized revolution where no one really controlled all your all the knowledge uh all the data and so we'll see how this plays out that was a long tangent sorry about that no no but i i mean you just again you covered some other questions that i had because some other thing that that raised for me was whether you know if um sec commissioner has her purse's safe harbor proposal were in place then it may not matter for some of these chains to start off centralized as long as they got decentralized within some certain time frame but you know right now obviously we're not operating in that environment but we're going to discuss a little bit more about the markets and also galaxy but first a quick

source platform nir is investing 80 million near tokens and community-led projects over the course of five years to power sustainable innovation through its ecosystem with fundraising opportunities and support for dows and dapps to engage fans and reach new audiences come learn why near is the infrastructure for innovation at nea.org back to my conversation with mike novogratz so galaxy has had a ton of news coming out in recent months and i wanted to ask you why did galaxy decide to make the industry's first billion dollar acquisition with bitco what do you see happening in the industry now that makes it bringing custody and how it seemed necessary yeah so i guess you know i was wrong originally in my instinct that institutional clients would want you to custody elsewhere right when you buy bonds at goldman sachs you custody of a bank of new york you don't keep them at goldman sachs and and in crypto i think because of the complexity of the instrument it people wanted a soup to nut solution so we heard that from a lot of customers not every customer but a lot and so it's to some degree we needed it to fulfill our growing though i wouldn't have paid a billion dollars for custodian if i didn't think there was more to it what i really get excited about with big go is they have 60 blockchain 60 and growing blockchain engineers and you know from the time i started in 2012 13 till now i have invested in blockchains i've had traded on top of blockchains i've been a cheerleader and an unofficial spokesman for blockchains but i've never built built on blockchains and i think building on chain uh and having that capacity is kind of the next chapter of where this whole industry goes right we can talk about our asset management business and should it be an unchain asset management business or part of it should be unchained and you know we hadn't had we didn't have the technical expertise to make that happen uh and so i think i see this merger as a marriage of west coast and east coast silicon valley and wall street uh puts mostly an acquisition of human capital our best assets in the whole industry go up and down the elevator every day right it's not like we have machines that create uh you know harvesters or automobiles or right we're we're a human capital business and that's what we're buying well so to expound a little bit on that you did in the same thing tell the block that you think where the industry is going is quote it is building on the blockchain it is d phi and you kind of hinted that galaxy would start doing that so what are you envisioning when you talk about wanting to build in d5 well listen so first of all we invested a ton of cool d5 projects that's been our our one of our best businesses because like seems everything you bought in the last 18 months is up a whole lot and we're going to continue to do that there have been structural impediments of actually using d5 regulatory mostly right think of something as simple as uniswap are you trading against a smart contract who's on the other side of the smart contract well if you're a retail customer there's a zero probability that the the feds are going to come busting through your door for having you know done it done a trade that might have happened with someone from a you know an evil empire right that's someone who wouldn't have been kyc but if you're a regulated institution you better be damn sure you have a process in place at least to say hey no i know i'm uh executing with someone legit and so we've been spending a lot of time on as a lot of people have on cracking that code right of having a to some degree a safe a safe garden inside of to be able to use default think about it like a blue check and i think we're close there as soon as that gets done we'll be a much bigger user we use some things now but like you know staking and and and trading on decentralized systems is still regulatory confusing space and then it's listen you know bitco has a a big wallet like you know i think i forgot the exact statistic but a significant portion of transactions and the whole space happened in bitco wallets right they support lots of other exchanges in and around the world and so i can see all kinds of staking services and and even you know like what i said what i thought about should we do part of our asset management on shane we've invested a lot of cool on chain asset managers you know it opens up a whole lot of possibility okay yeah i'm trying to read between the lines and i was thinking amms liquidity providers like using uh i forget what melon protocol changed its name to but anyway okay so i guess we'll have well but laura in some ways the simplest function of a bank right is you taking money and then you lend it at higher rates and so just even being able to to be a a broad lender in the space is could be a huge opportunity set right right now one of the hindrances and you see it on days like yesterday one of the reasons i think we also did this merger i think bigger is better as we go into the broader institutional world and i think having deep balance sheet is important days like yesterday are really important right markets already collapse you want to have excess capital but the traditional banks don't lend to crypto yet i can't go to jpmorgan and say hey give me a 300 million dollar credit line at libor plus 200 or 300 even we've got a 2 billion plus balance sheet like what are you scared of letting me money for that's crypto we don't understand and the days like yesterday they're like oh thank god we didn't lend that money right like those days set our industry back a few months not years a few months the conversation has to die down and that's a little it's endemic to the space still a young space uh but it allows people that were on the edge to back away from the edge and so getting capital into the space is critical uh we're working really hard and being really thoughtful at how do you because if you get cheap capital there's plenty of places to deploy it right the basis trading that happens letting on shane you know there's unbelievable yield to lending unshame the problem is there's not a lot of dollars so if you want to borrow dollars in crypto you're borrowing at almost 13 14 15 uh during times of duress which is crazy so if you could borrow it three or four percent well it's a uh it's a whole heck of a good business all right well i will keep my eyes peeled i'm very curious to see what you do last quick question galaxy also filed for a bitcoin etf last month and at the beginning of the year many people thought that having gary gensler as he's teacher was a positive signal for a bitcoin bitcoin etf but last week the sec released a cautionary statement basically for mutual funds that wanted to invest in bitcoin futures so did that statement change your view on the odds that a bitcoin etf would be approved this year you know i think it's going to be fourth quarter first quarter of next year i i don't know like it's it's hard to say gary i just keep saying if i'm the chairman of the scc an etf is far better than the great scale trust for the other products that institutions have uh that public equity markets are allowing people to invest in and so like we allow the greyscale trust but we're not gonna allow it an etf makes absolutely no sense like bizarre right and so and i know gary is very bright there are a lot of technical issues that i you know surveillance of the exchanges all these issues that common people like me don't like to get in the weeds of that when i talk to the guys that are working on it are like and so i think it's a it's as much of a technical solve listen days like yesterday aren't good for that accelerating let's assume they were going to approve the etf last week i mean they decided last week to approve it next month after yesterday's volatility any bureaucrats gonna say let's wait a couple more months and so i do think it happens uh i would i would make a market probably 30 70 30 4th quarter 70 first quarter all right and before we go do you want to give a bitcoin price prediction for end of year and same with ether yeah so it's funny my price prediction in december for end of year was 64 000 and we got to 64 000 in march and if i was smart i would have said hey i made my whole year let me take half of my bitcoin off of course then you're like oh let's go to 100 000. it's hard to to say uh i think we're going to go sideways for a while um we're going to consolidate between you know 30 35 000 and 45 50 000 for a while and i think a lot of the selling pressure is gone a lot of the stories that got people scared to sell are gone right the esg story came regulatory stories have not been great they've kind of come you know china regulatory story that helped kick off yesterday now we need new buying and you know institutions are coming they come slow you know i could tell you that every one of the major banks goldman sachs jp morgan ubs pnc bank they're all coming with product ear gear to the wealth clients right that's the 50 to 80 year olds who don't buy through their coinbase wallet but it takes a while for them to get set up then the money takes a while to get in so the positive news is i'll tell you something about our experience with morgan stanley in order to be a financial advisor morgan stanley and sell bitcoin you got to take a bitcoin course online i have done 10 probably teach-ins uh with various regional sales forces on how i think about bitcoin how i sell it and so think about 2013 there was like dan moorhead there was there were there were three or four institutional salesmen of bitcoin not even me dan moore i'm trying to think who else was out there burying of course now we just trained up 4 000 morgan stanley fas to sell bitcoin who have an economic incentive to sell it who understand it who help control people's investment decisions and you're gonna do the same thing at goldman sachs and the same thing at j.p morgan and so the institutional army is coming it's coming slowly and so i'm always balanced between that being the buffer on the downside what was interesting yesterday's price action is as the market collapsed people that traded on exchanges were getting stopped out because they were levered people that traded in the u.s stock market came in and microstrategy outperformed bitcoin by 14 yesterday uh the grayscale trust went from 14 15 deficit to trading at a premium right and so non-leveraged dip buyers showed up levered you know over their skis people got stopped out and so again if there's a message to send to crypto investors it stopped taking so much leverage but you did see demand from u.s retail buying a lot of crypto yesterday which i found really interesting and promising uh it really feels to me we put in a tradable low we've retested it last night which felt scary again uh because when you're testing lows it always feels scary it's the end of the world it wasn't the end of the world and and i think now listen it doesn't mean we're going to just rock it off to space but we got bitcoin miami coming up there'll be a lot of good positive energy uh i think the towel's going to go wild you know he's got coven plus miami end of covet plus miami plus crypto i don't know if you're not gonna you're gonna be there you might wanna have some i will not unfortunately i have a big book thing going on so i i cannot do fun things for a little while but i will be watching um from afar and you know fight living vicariously through you but i agree i think it'll be um pretty wild all right well mike this has been super fun i would love to have you back again um you know these shows are pretty short but we covered a lot of ground so thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed awesome laura thank you don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short

discover how people are reimagining the world around you on tazos [Music] hi everyone thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline the market crashed coinbase finance and other exchanges briefly shut down the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is down roughly 20 over the past seven days from about 2.2 trillion dollars to 1.7 trillion as a press time thursday afternoon bitcoin is sitting at around 40k after bouncing back from 30 000 while ethereum hit a weekly low of 860 before bumping back up to the high 2000s wednesday was the bottom for the market when bitcoin and ether lost 30 and 40 of their value respectively in a single day the correction led to coinbase reporting intermittent downtime for customers attempting to purchase cryptos on sale finance was also disrupted as the exchange stopped ethereum related token withdrawals from its platform the dip however did not affect decentralized exchanges such as sushi swap which reported its highest trading volume ever in a 24-hour period on the flip side average gas fees rose 239.4 percent on wednesday compared to tuesday meaning ethereum users paid steep prices to used apps next headline the crypto dip is not all elon's fault as for what caused this week's bruising several factors likely came together first tether last friday for the first time since 2014 to the tether revealed the breakdown of its reserves as part of its settlement with the new york attorney general's office three months ago which requires an ongoing publication of the assets backing usdt as of march 31st 2021 usdt is backed by 76 percent cash and cash equivalents with a final 24 filled by secured loans at 12.55 corporate bonds funds and precious metals at 9.96 percent and other investments including digital tokens at 1.96 the ft looked at what the 76 percent of cash and cash equivalents is comprised of and surprisingly only 3.87 percent of that or 2.9 of all tether is actually backed by cash about two-thirds of that 76 percent in cash and cash equivalents comes from commercial paper with fiduciary deposits making up twenty four point two percent reverse repo notes taking up three point six percent and treasury bills just two point nine four percent when tether initially launched usdt claimed to be backed one-to-one with u.s dollars in 2019 the company changed the wording to say usdt was backed 100 by ted reserves which it seems is still company policy today caitlyn long ceo of a bondi bank wrote a tweet thread about her thoughts on stable coins and the crypto sell-off which were probably connected in the thread she argued that risk managers at crypto hedge funds quote almost certainly will require haircuts on tether forcing traders to sell crypto to reduce risk because quote tethers probability of default and loss severity in default just went up based on the disclosure another cause of this week's sell-off may have been unease over china on tuesday three self-regulatory bodies in china all of which are under the supervision of the people's bank of china jointly published a note reiterating a 2017 ban on financial and payment institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions and initial coin offerings although it was nothing new it appears a misleading reuters article made their rounds tuesday morning spreading a rumor that china had completely banned crypto which was much more dramatic than the reality the third driver of the drawdown this week may have been elon musk and his twitter account last week tesla announced it will no longer accept btc as payment for vehicles citing environmental concerns regarding bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus algorithm then over the weekend tesla ceo elon musk hinted that tesla may sell or had already sold its bitcoin holdings by responding indeed to a tweet from crypto whale on twitter that said quote bitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out tesla dumped the rest of their bitcoin holdings musk later clarified the speculation tweeting tesla has not sold any bitcoin and that tesla has diamond hands however by that time btc had already slid well under 50k the final impetus behind the price plunge may have also been retail traders milton demir's chief strategy officer at coinshares said quote crypto is still largely a retail driven market driven by fear and panic it operates 24 7 365. this is a perfect recipe for panic selling exacerbated by media hype over non-events next headline ethereum had an impressive q1 james wang a former arc analyst wrote an insightful article earlier this week about ethereum's impressive q1 performance here are a few highlights on ethereum's growth between q1 2020 and q1 2021 total transaction fees are on ethereum are up 200x to 1.7 billion dollars daily active users increased 71 total value logged in d5 rose 64x to 52 billion dollars from 800 million dollars nft art sales rose from 700k to 396 million dollars on a related note on wednesday coin shares reported that digital asset investment products saw a net outflow of 50 million dollars over the previous seven days which is the first net outflow since october 2020 and the largest since may 2019. surprisingly the prime suspect of the outflows was bitcoin investment products which accounted for 98 million dollars flowing out of the system point shares noted that other digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling 48 million over that last week implying that investors might be diversifying their crypto portfolios interestingly ethereum accounted for 27 million of the inflows continuing the trend of eth outperforming btc this year as melton pointed out quote may is the first month ether products traded more volume than bitcoin next headline u.s regulators sprint to keep up with crypto during a virtual hearing of the house financial services committee michael sue the acting head of the controller of the currency expressed concern that quote the regulatory community is taking a fragmented agency-by-agency approach to the technology-driven changes taking place today sue is eyeing a collaboration between the occ federal reserve and fdic to create what he's calling an interagency sprint team that would establish a unified framework and set definitions for cryptocurrencies additionally sue requested a staff review of all the occ's crypto related guidance issued over the past year which will encompass the entirety of former controller brian brooks's reign at the occ when the regulator established crypto guidance largely seen as beneficial to the industry for example brooks wrote a series of interpretive letters during his tenure clarifying that federally chartered banks could custody stable coins and hold them in reserve caitlyn long ceo of avonte bank pointed out that earlier on tuesday the occ had reversed a final ruling which although unrelated to crypto is a very rare occurrence perhaps signaling that suit could zig where brooks zagged four other u.s regulatory headlines are also worth noting us congressman thomas emmer sent a letter to the financial accounting standards board or fasb urging clear accounting standards for digital currencies the fdic put out a request to depository institutions this week asking banks about the handling of digital assets on thursday senate banking chairman sherrod brown penned a letter to michael sue regarding his concern over the occ previously granting national trust charters to paxos anchorage and protego signaling that their trust charters may be at risk the u.s treasury is calling for businesses that receive ten thousand dollars in crypto to report such transactions to the irs stating that while they are a quote small portion of business income today cryptocurrency transactions are likely to rise in importance in the next decade the irs will also be given additional funding to address the crypto market next headline wells fargo and bank of america make crypto moves on wednesday wells fargo's wealth and investment management division announced that it will soon introduce an actively managed crypto strategy wells fargo is the latest u.s bank following morgan stanley goldman sachs and possibly jp morgan to grant wealthy clients exposure to crypto bank of america joined the paxo settlement service which has the capability to settle stocks at t plus zero through ethereum based blockchain technology you can listen to ceo charles cascarilla talk about paxos on a change in three different episodes which we will put in the show notes if you want to check them out kevin mccarthy b of a's head of finance and clearing believes that technology would be a positive for the bank as bfa could free up the collateral we'd have to post on an overnight basis which would improve the return on assets bfa will offer the service to clients when and if a clearing agency grants approval news heard around the block the

company is now valued at 3.2 billion dollars time for fun bits myspace tom with bitcoin at one point down 50 from its all-time high it was an easy week to bash the first cryptocurrency in the past a dip of this magnitude may have warranted a bitcoin obituary this week the obituary was replaced by an article titled first mover advantage is great but could bitcoin end up the myspace way by joe weisenthal executive editor at bloomberg with the gist being that btc could like myspace end up being replaced by better technology all of facebook though joe admits it will be harder to supplant btc due to the nature of blockchain tech versus social media here's where the humor comes in however tenuous the connection it seems the creator of myspace tom anderson is a bitcoiner which is perhaps worrisome for btc holders or hodlers in an odd yet humorous move tom has only posted on his twitter account five times in 2021. three of those posts came in response to nick carter partner at castle island ventures and an ardent bitcoin defender tom's latest tweet was posted on sunday showing off his new profile pic replete with laser eyes with a quote buying the dip alright thanks for tuning in
