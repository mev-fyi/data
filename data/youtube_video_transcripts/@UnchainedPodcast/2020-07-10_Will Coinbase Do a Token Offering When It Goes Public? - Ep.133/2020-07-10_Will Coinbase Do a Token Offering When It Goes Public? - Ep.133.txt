cryptocurrency out of Silicon Valley and on to Wall Street welcome Jeff thanks for having me big news coming out of Reuters this week coinbase is exploring going public tell us more about this news how firm it is and how and when they might go public yeah I don't know if this would count as big news because there's a kind of a genre in tech reporting where you say big startup is rumored to go public well of course there they all are that's the point we all know coinbase is going public it's just like writing a thing saying Robin Hood is expected to go public maybe this year you know I mean there's 10 companies you could write that headline about and I mean you know I don't want to be ungracious but I thought that story was kind of thin because I don't think there's anything to it I mean coinbase it's been rumored to go public this year for a long time and I see they're gonna happen late this year or next year so I'm not really sure what the news is here yeah I guess you did mention ID when we talked about your book the last thing you came on the show so I mean just in terms of what reuters reported how firm you know was what they were reporting in terms of like any sec registrations or anything more formal like that well I talked to a couple sources close to the company and initially Reuters was gonna try to run with that you know saying that like Morgan Stanley had was gonna be the underwriter and that's clearly not true and I'm saying there's a direct listing I mean I think that could be possible but I think the most interesting thing is gonna be what sort of IPO is it the you know because I know we're going to talk to Fredersen recently one of the cofounders of coinbase he hinted strongly this could be some sort of token issuance so I think it could be America's first combo ICO and IPO which would be super cool so that's what I'm waiting to hear about you know in terms of whether they're going public yeah of course they are but I think that part of the story is what's most interesting to me and so for that do you have any more details on what that might look like would it be kind of you know I for some reason I don't get the feeling it's gonna be the kind of icos that we saw in 2017 about there are these well-known ayios that have been happening the initial exchange offerings any details on what form they might take no they're playing their cards close to the vest on that and I know I think as coinbase has got more corporate you know I think there's a sort of a push to let's just have an IPO like everyone does but I think a lot of the people at the company including the like coders who work there are real believers in crypto and it would be sort of lame if they just did a you know garden-variety IPO so but in terms of the regulatory part that's hard I mean are they gonna do a sell tokens to accredited investors and then you know sell general shares to the public or can they get the SEC to bless some sort of token issuance which could happen because if you've been watching coinbase they've really been spending a lot of energy hiring Washington insiders you saw they just hired Judge Paul gruel who's a fairly prominent former federal judge and then they have the former child counsel Brian Brooks went to be the head of the what's called the Office of the Comptroller of the currency control yes sure but pronounced controller I learned this we should know this by now I should know by now but you know that's you know they oversee all the banks so you can obviously see them trying to put the political lobbying push on to kind of get a blessing for this and since you're the most mainstream crypto company you know who knows maybe they will get you know they will get a blessing to do a token offering but I'm pretty sure whatever's going on they're gonna hold it really tightly cuz leaking this stuff is just gonna piss off the regulators and could imperil a token listing so this is just me speculating I mean who knows maybe they'll chicken out and just raise the cash the ordinary way but I think a lot of us in the crypto community hope they do something more ambitious so just to go back to what you mentioned earlier about this former chip former Federal Judge Paul gruel and he also held a significant post at Facebook which is actually where they hired him from can you just give us a sense a little bit more about his history and why this is significant and perhaps relevant here in this discussion of whether or not coin base will go public well I mean that's an important position I mean I think they're calling him chief legal officer you know but he's their general counsel and I mean Columbus also presiding like every crypto company and kind of a lot of legal messes I mean they're getting class actions over the Bitcoin cash thing you know there's various SEC investigation to seize the IRS and he's gonna make all that sort of settle down or even better go away and I think just his clout as a former federal judge and he's well-known in a valley he ruled over like the Apple Samsung trials he ruled over Google and Oracle so I think that kind of credibility is got is one gonna be good for their legal strategy but also he's just someone people know in you know the legal world probably including the SEC and in Washington so I think his contacts will probably help grease whatever's gonna happen next and in terms of having their former chief legal officer Brian Brooks and the position of the office of the control of the currency what is the significance of that as well like what what does that department oversee and how could that be relevant here well they're the ones who issue federal bank charters and say who can be a bank and who can't and obviously you know with things like the you know the bitlicense in New York very unpopular and so fractured regulation and the hostility to crypto I think having someone like Brooks at the head of that he could maybe take measures to sweep away a lot of the kind of state impediments and put in a kind of clear federal licensing regime which I think could really eat a boost the American crypto scene you know I don't think it'll ever be at the level of Korea or Switzerland but get it a bit closer and make it more crypto friendly and so earlier when you discussed coinbase going public you phrased it as them raising capital but if Reuters is correct in the notion that perhaps they will just do a direct listing then we wouldn't actually raise capital right so what would the significance of doing it that way be and how would that affect their investors differently well I mean I think obviously at this point there's a lot of early investors who want to cash out and you know good way to cash out is selling shares to the public so nothing Spotify did a direct listing and there's also I think an increasing backlog backlash against Wall Street's you know IPO underwriting thing where all the bankers and the lawyers feed off it and then put aside certain shares for their best friends and then sell it to the public so I think just selling shares directly would let all the insiders kind of get rich and you know then you know they the shares would be public and I think that's important symbolic step for them but you know I'm still holding out for a token offering at some cost sort because you know if they don't do it who is going to do it and so you know even though as you mentioned there is always a lot of talk about different tech companies that will go public at any given point in time I do think that there is something significant about the idea of the first crypto exchange in the u.s. going public so in that sense like what do you think that would signify why would that be a big deal well I mean you know I've said before I think you know a lot of people hate coinbase and a lot of people think it's like you know not your keys not your coins crypto purists you know dislike it but the reality is for most Americans who own crypto that's their first point of call and for the industry it's almost Columbus too-big-to-fail I would say you know if coinbase fails it would be I think a decade-long setback to the rest of the crypto world and conversely if the IPO I mean that would really means in a lot of ways a lot of people could ride their coattails and I think it would really legitimize the crypto industry in mainstream finance so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the timing of the IPO and kind of the overall market for cryptocurrency but first

Jeff Roberts so coin bases recent valuation was at 8 billion dollars in an IPO where would you guess that their market cap might go believe it or not I would take the over because coin base stands out not just because their crypto company but unlike a lot of unicorns they are they've been making a profit like not every quarter but by and large I mean they've got a pretty solid business and if you look at like the likes of uber and not Airbnb but we work I mean these place is just bleeding money they raise more and more money and you know they're there the losses are staggering whereas coinbase is you know this is a profitable company which i think is would allow them to you know perhaps overshoot their valuation I mean I don't know if that's happened recently most IPOs last year too have been kind of flops but I have more hope for coinbase than some of the others and what do you think of that in terms of the overall market right now because the bloc recently ran a story talking about how metrics for Bitcoin searches for social-media followings of crypto exchanges for Wikipedia page views of Bitcoin and also how trading volumes for Bitcoin are all down from their peaks at the end of 2017 early 2018 so how much do you think the frothiness of the overall cryptocurrency market will matter to the coin base listing or do you think that you know coin based listing all on its own will create that frothiness that's a great question especially your last part maybe that could inaugurate a new kind of Bitcoin you know through--the bull market but I think you know Bryan Armstrong CEO of coinbase and their investors Andreessen Horowitz they're all playing kind of a long game and seeing it you know I think as many as your listeners do as a cyclical thing you know we've now you know since I've covered Bitcoin starting in 2013 I've seen maybe like three crypto winters and I think we're used to this you know there'll be surges of excitement then things settle down then it goes up again but I think you're very right I mean if they could time their IPO to coincide with the Bitcoin bull run like oh boy but you know maybe they you know this can't be bothered this is just another kind of house claiming tasks they want to do as they keep building stuff and do you have a sense how well coin base has been faring despite the overall interest being down you talked about their profitability is that something that's kept up in this sort of I guess bear market or slow market I can't speak to the last quarter but I think overall it's been quite profitable and strangely that pandemic crisis has benefited I know Robin Hood did really well they're not crypto company obviously but I think crypto the same thing they had a huge trading volume and whenever there's volatility which there was during the height of the Kovach crisis you know companies like coin based benefit my question for coin Daiso is where is another revenue stream going to come from I mean they've got trickles from custody and you know other tie ups here and there but I mean I still think they're very dependent on trading and I think that's a challenge for most of the industry is to try to figure out other lines of business that aren't just kind of hobbies or distractions but really can bring in the cash so that's what I'm waiting to see - and do you have a sense of how increased competition in the US has affected their trading volume because for instance I remember that when Finance u.s. launched here in the US they either cut their trading fees completely or at least slash them and meanwhile at the same time point-based rose right raised theirs so do you have a sense of whether people are seeking better prices elsewhere I haven't heard that I mean you probably know better than me but my read on it is we know by now and especially since it's not available in every state hasn't gotten that much traction in the US and does the defense have sticky they are how easily do people move from brokerage to brokerage you know I think a lot of people are like you know yeah if corn base charges me you know $2.99 but is that such a big deal so you know I'd be curious I'm sure places like the block and Masari have some good research on that but my limited understanding is I think a lot of crypto customers are quite sticky you know the hardcore traders of course are probably jumping around but I think a lot of your everyday retail investor is not going to you know jump ship to save like a buck on commission alright and so I guess to explore the token area a little bit more when you talked about how that's kind of what you're hoping for and looking to like do you have any particular preferred method for how they do that listing yeah it's a bit above my pay grade but yeah I'd be curious what blockchain will they use will they develop their own well they used aetherium and i mean just talking to people who really know this stuff including balaji and professor a professor at Cornell forgive me I can never seasons here yes he predicted down the road we're gonna see every company will be tokenized like you know Nike and General Motors and that eventually we could see like you know nicey and Nasdaq buying the likes of coinbase issuing all the stocks is token so which makes perfect sense because for record-keeping and tracking stocks and splitting stocks blockchain is so much superior to what's being done right now so I mean but that might be five or ten years off so that's you know that's I think where we're gonna go to but in terms of what happens in next year or two that's a great question what the mechanics will be I don't know okay and I guess yeah we'll see what happens with that but maybe coinbase itself will pioneer or assembly and perhaps create a new business out of that yeah I sure hope so I mean this pressure internally I think a lot of that like you know longtime coinbase investors and employees you know I think would be feel betrayed if they didn't do that but you know we all know what financial realities are so I'm very curious to see what happens and when you talked about some of these employees I know in your book that you know there was that period of a lot of tension at coinbase especially in 2018 what's your sense of how things are now and whether or not Brian Armstrong has been able to kind of write the ship and get everyone back going in the same direction well I think one recent scandal it's been a lot less drama out of coinbase both in terms of like kind of negative headlines and employee turnover infighting so I think they are in a stable place you know one thing I forgot to mention for the IPO I can't wait to see what the s-1 looks like because that's when you find out who owns how many shares I mean I've heard on good authority that Brian Armstrong has got a super majority you know I've heard of you know Fred the co-founder might have about 10% you know I'd like to see how much Andreessen has so that's gonna be really interesting but in terms of the management I think they've done a good job of stabilizing their operations and there's just a lot less drama out of coinbase than there used to be which is a good thing when you want to go public because you might recall what happened to we work you know you've got the spanner who's like smoking weed and you know on airplanes and running the cult and look what happened to themself right and do you have a sense of why it is now that things have been calmer there you know I think it's just the adult supervision you've got like their CEO oh Emily choy who's kind of you know you've got basically vet executives in a start-up a younger company you've got a bunch of people in their 20s who've never managed something really big before so I think having veteran executives makes a company more boring but it makes it more stable all right well anything else you want to add about the coinbase news no I just I'd like to hear more details I mean if reuters has them I'd like to you know see what what they've really heard but for now you know my take is let's let's wait and see okay yeah I agree that you know there's a lot still a lot more to be uncovered well anyway thank you sue so much for coming on and confirmed thanks Larry always a pleasure don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick
