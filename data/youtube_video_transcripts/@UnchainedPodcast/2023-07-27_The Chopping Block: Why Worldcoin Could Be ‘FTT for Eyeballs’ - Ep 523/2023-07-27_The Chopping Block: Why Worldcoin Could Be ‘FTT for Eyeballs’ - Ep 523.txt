not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day the quick intros first you got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and the tsar of superstate then we've got to ruin the Giga brain and grandfather gauntlet and finally I receive the head height man the dragonfly so we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investor advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping blocks at XYZ for more disclosures so we've been off for a week I think we were all busy rejoicing the xrp decision which is for now at least the SEC is not appealed although people are worried that yes he might appeal in the meantime we can kind of have our little moment as an industry to ruin you were just in Paris at ECC what was the vibe there did it feel different than how it's felt previously so I think a very important thing to note is that this year the ethereum community is not holding its main developer conference called Devcon which usually is the biggest conference like tens of thousands probably much more than that people go to it and also another really big conference from the ethereum world called devconnect got moved to later this year so there's a sense in which each CC had this whole position as the only Summer Conference for ethereum and one thing I often like to joke about ethereum development is that all the development gets done at hackathons so they have to keep having many hackathons because it's the only way decentralized like client development happens because people I guess have to keep synchronizing but that being said I I do I do think they're they're kind of super interesting I think the interesting thing of this one was it clearly was the biggest conference like I I think many of us went to eat Denver eat Denver it was horrible in comparison like I just can't even yeah Paris was so much better like what was the number one why major benefit of Paris over Denver uh Denver in February is like [ __ ] squared you know it's like it's not a very fun city and it's freezing no one wants to really be there Paris and summer is quite a bit the opposite you know what does the CC stand for Community Conference yeah beyond the weather I think a lot of people from virtually every ecosystem in crypto came this time which is very different I think than eat Denver I think a lot of people skip B um the European communities for a lot of protocols have been completely I wouldn't say like unscathed maybe that that's definitely too egregious but significantly less affected by the events of the last 12 months I think people in Europe it's very refreshing compared to being in the US where like all you want that may be because everything else in Europe has gone down so much like there's like they have horrible inflation and their economies aren't growing and so it's kind of like ah actually crypto not so bad I don't know if it's just that I think it's also like they seem to be taking a more metered view on like things like FTX they seem to have like you know protocols and teams seem to be working through that and have focused Less on legal stuff have had less legal things to talk about and I think their distance from the U.S regulatory apparatus is very palpable and that people are still extremely positive versus like in the US it's like feels like this roller coaster so I think that was really good there were a lot of side events almost too many from every possible ecosystem you could think of except Solano one one thing I actually think is quite interesting is Solana is like the only layer one that doesn't try to like ride the coattails of the East conferences like when there's an eighth conference they host a conference before or after or around they're just like no we're doing our own thing and it's going to be completely separate so which is interesting that Avalanche also I think is like that right there there are two ecosystems that completely just they don't try but like every other layer one like has a hacker house or has a little conference in the side and so there's tons of stuff going on how was the cardano presence I saw much more cardano in at consensus in Austin cardano and Tron than uh at HCC yeah yeah so what about Bitcoin any Bitcoin presence any Wi-Fi did you see anything I guess that's the that's the closest I got he he is kind of the mascot he's kind of the mascot yeah I don't think there was too much Bitcoin influence honestly I I feel like the most I ever hear see bitcoiners in Europe is like in Switzerland or Italy but I feel like France is definitely not or doesn't seem to be Bitcoin land in my experience that's because all of ethereum is building the future of France so there's like a very clear bias of course yeah I mean I think the interesting things were as highlights were there's a huge focus on infrastructure and I think this led to some debates over the last few days on Twitter about are you building bridges to Nowhere like or are you gonna have applications or is it like the applications fundamentally need this the current state of infrastructure it's very clear the roll-up world is definitely ethereum's future versus kind of some of the longer term East road map stuff I think people started you know ethereum 2 roadmap basically was not talked about that much but the roll-up Centric future was kind of talked about a lot there were a lot of stuff around restaking and eigenlayer as well as a lot of stuff around data availability in Celestia Celestia had a side conference that was probably the most attended thing that I had gone to I saw a lot about the modular the modular Summit seems like it was getting a lot of attention so I'm curious what you guys think about this I mean all of us are investors and we're seeing this play out in real time is almost everything that's getting funded these days is infrastructure and it sounds like that was really the theme of HCC is infrastructure whether it's shared sequencers or ZK Tech or you know modular something or other blah blah blah data availability these are all really kind of back-end infrastructure Technologies what's your take after having spent the time in Paris and curious to get everyone else's take on this idea of like are we over investing in infrastructure because we don't know what else to invest into disclaimer as investor in many of these companies over the last couple years before they kind of now are kind of these hot fuzzy things I think there was a while where people didn't care at all about infrastructure late 2021 early 2022 I feel like it was like what no no I just don't think you were seeing the big rounds for them right it was like so much about like big grounds for like sound.xyz or like nft things or what that stuff is completely gone in fact I barely saw any of that in Paris versus last year there was a ton of stuff around that and I think you know this is always what happens in the bear market like 2018 2019 definitely felt like there was tons of investment infrastructure I think it's sort of like we're sort of in this part of the market where everyone's waiting for the Hail Mary application to show up like where's the unisop where's the maker down and in some ways investors can't construct those things right like no matter how good or how egotistical an investor might think about themselves creating the market for a product that doesn't exist realistically it's very hard to make viral applications from funding right like if you think about some of the larger application ethereum It generally kind of came from some organic usage although there are some exceptions but I think in general applications are extremely hard to invest in comparatively whereas infrastructure at least like hopefully has these applications using them once they get big right so you could think of it as this like second order derivative on the applications Market that happens to be smoother in terms of how its payoff is which is what happens when the Market's down but I do feel like we're kind of in this like everyone is just like searching for the like the the thing that will will work and it's not super super clear that we found that I think like the current applications that seem to be having a lot of hype are more or less just some casinos so I'm not completely sure that that's uh that's the future of France it does seem like there may be a bit of overfitting in that you know if you look historically investors know that the biggest returns in crypto have all come from infrastructure there's basically nothing in the application that has ever performed as well as infrastructure in crypto and it does seem to be like it probably can't be true that every single layer of this infrastructure stack all makes a lot of money right it would be really weird if like Solana makes a lot of money and the data availability layer makes a lot of money and the API layer and you know the RPC node and the you know the folks who are hosting the RPC note like all of them are collecting a bunch of money and building gigantic businesses and the applications just kind of they're just paying the fees for everybody on top that seems like probably not plausible view of the world but I think investors just have this uh shared memory that like well invest structure is the only thing that makes money and applications kind of come and go but infrastructure is forever basically I mean which is not to say that we don't do it we you know obviously we also invest into a bunch of stuff that's infrastructure but it does seem like it's hard to know where things are going and like you know betting on products is infamously you know consumers are infamously difficult to predict and super fickle especially yeah is like it was very clear there were no applications like versus last year like last year I really felt like there were tons of people trying to sell you on music nfts or or God forbid the thing that makes me want to blow my brains out the most web3 fashion which is fashioned for your metaverse avatar which obviously uh we've found to be less exciting nowadays so many people made me feel so stupid for not understanding went through fashion I was like I I guess I'm just gonna be old and turns out that like I have survived I just don't think that there was so much of that last year or two because I feel like in Paris they were like somehow like the Paris hypebeast like people who line up at certain stores were just like they found their calling and of course I think this year there was like zero of that Tom what's your take on this whole infrastructure applications thing yeah I mean I think it is very cyclical people invest in infrastructure I mean there's a whole like a blog post about sort of infra application on cyclicality and like oftentimes it doesn't make sense why you're investing into that part of cycling you are like I remember in like 2018 2019 people were like you know investing like plasma plasma gonna be a thing I'm like why plasma like no like these blocks aren't even getting filled fees are like you know pennies gas prices are bottoming out like there isn't even demand to fill the blocks that we have let alone trying to create more Supply and then it's like oh will you do that sometimes there's an emergent effect where some applications just can't exist without that infrastructure and then sometimes building capacity to allow things that do blow up to you have the info that they need but I think on the investment front it's it's much easier to underwrite an infrastructure that and say hey we're going to get an index on all the stuff that's happening and hopefully that is getting some good you know exposure to whatever application blows up even if it's maybe not the most directly monetizable but I think just thinking about deal flow as well um I have not seen as many applications recently and I think part of it is just there's like a really difficult regulatory story around applications like you know okay you can't launch a token you can't charge fees you can't you have the kyc one who's using your front end like it's not really clear what great applications emerge in the current regulatory environment I think frankly like openc and like metamask but kind of like the only two that like make a bunch of money and or kosher but if you don't want to do either of those was like it's not really clear what that sort of next story maybe weird take on this is that one of the reasons I think developers like the app chain thesis like two years ago a year and a half ago was like hey I have a reason for my token people are validating my network and in the roll-up Centric world right what you're doing is you're pushing the application more towards infrastructure right because I have to run my own thing I have to actually like understand that and in that world you can justify these and maybe tokens a little more which is sort of feels like that's like kind of the reason people are jumping to row up eyes things when they don't necessarily need to but all the funding for Roll-Ups is not application specific right the stories are application oh you can build a roll-up that can do anything in op stack in this stack and that stack but none of the funding is going yeah that's true that's true I I'm saying like yeah not yet people are trying to make like like that would be what I would say is like people are trying to make apps look more like infrastructure so that they can like dress it up to investors and be like hey look app for structure right because if you squint right like what's the difference between depositing like in a smart contract first depositing in like a bridge contract to like URL too like it's kind of the same thing in like a very like you know squinty way and so I definitely think L2 sounds better for a single purpose application L2 I think it's because people think of an L2 as like oh it's like a platform there's going to be many applications and it's all going to be developing value like in a network effect and like it's super awesome versus like oh this is my one specific application that's highly scalable that you enter as an alto yeah I think there also just like a monetary premium or having an L1 or L2 token like just for kids looking this up guess what uh Ronan is trading at right now 1.2 500 700 mL I mean it's which is still incredibly high for what is basically like a shitty death Fork that you with a bridge that doesn't work for like an app that no one wants to use and so it's like it's like way Marsh don't they still have like 500 000 dailies or something they still have a lot of users I don't think it's that high but in any scenario I mean if you look at the trend it's not really yeah Trend Line's not positive but yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway I think it's just more hey saying you're your own chain you just get this huge premium over just having you know an application token if you even want to go the tokenization route yeah no that's fair I mean I I would push back on painting all onshine games with the same brush because like there is a big difference between like where decentraland landed and where axi landed actually still has a lot of users I mean it's not obviously it's not doing great and I don't think it's gonna ever step back into its previous valuation but uh it's probably one of the most used things on on chain period still yeah I'm just looking to this 300 000 monthlies so it's like not okay okay in any scenario I mean I think my point being more broadly you take these two things sort of split the universe one is actually at their own chain the other is actually just your application token and I think in this case clearly additive right because you have the application token in addition to the to the chain and you're sort of you know creating value from thin air I'm gonna sound super curmudgeonly saying this so I'm gonna say it anyway I'm just gonna feel how it lands which is that when I was first investing into infrastructure this was like 2018 2019 after the 2017 Bull Run and at that time it was really clear that ethereum was not going to scale ethereum was not uh performance enough to be able to handle all the demand for transactions and that created this generation of Founders who were like we need to scale block space when you scale smart contract platforms and that was the Genesis of the solanas and the nears and The Avalanches and and all the plasmas Roll-Ups all that stuff came out of that era because of that very strong need that everybody saw that this stuff needs to get better and improve so that we can do the stuff we want to do on chain right it feels that now in 2023 it feels like the best minds of my generation are once again all working on infrastructure but it's not really clear to me that there is the same crushing need for everybody to be focused on it right like we kind of have Roll-Ups right but people oh but you need perfect modular DA's then you need this shared sequencers then you need like some fancy Mev Contraption to you know more accurately democratize this and that and it's kind of like we finally got a bunch of people on chain we finally got lots and lots of people Unchained we've got lots of block space we have so many places where you can launch an application we have rollups I mean obviously yeah we need fraud groups and stuff to get up and running but we kind of have the First Cut Rate to go but it seems like people are kind of myopically focused on infrastructure at a time when it feels like we really need more people thinking about how to build great applications that bring people on chain so it feels like even though we're at the same place where almost everybody's focused on infrastructure it feels much more misdirected in this cohort not that nobody should be working on it but that should really 80 90 of entrepreneurs be building infrastructure instead of building things people to use on chain it feels wrong to me of the show this is not investment advice but if you're a Founder maybe this is founder advice here hasieve is the VC he telling you there's a wrong ratio of infrastructure to applications to use that infrastructure yeah now that said like I understand why people are doing it because they see where the incentives are right they see where the funding is going you know I don't think we've done any large infrastructure deals this year but most of the large deals this year have all been infrastructure so I can understand the fourth you know it's a tough time to be building applications right there's not a lot of people you know with pocketbooks open on chain willing to except for hamster racing and worldcoin except for right and welcome okay all right so with that as a beautiful transition let's go to the two big stories of the week the first up is World coin so World coin for those who don't know it is a project that was originally co-founded by Sam Altman who's now the CEO of openai so worldcoin it's a cryptocurrency and the idea is that they want a sort of proof of personhood and the way that you prove you are a person is that there is an orb a literal physical orb that you can pick up there there are a bunch of them around the world and this physical orb will scan your iris and it will create some basically more or less encrypted record of your iris that will identify you as being a singular person it gets tied to your address as like a proof of personhood and this creates a wallet for you not your scan of your iris so um they have scanned something like two million people supposedly mostly in the third world none of them in the US and in Europe because obviously this is less kosher in the US and Europe and so they just launched their token on Monday and their token launched currently it's about 250 million dollar market cap on a 22 billion dollar fdv and you're reading it right that is a one percent float so meaning one percent of total supply of the token is currently circulating there's been a lot of that's right that's right so I've heard a lot of people say that uh this is the new Sam coin which is a very reminiscent distribution of what I just hope he doesn't use it as collateral anywhere though I think Sam Altman is a little busier than SPF but it's right now very um suspect in terms of the actual real price discovery of this token because apparently the vast majority of this float is owned by market makers who have let's say complex incentives around how they're playing with this thing but then separately after this thing launched Vitali published a blog post basically critiquing the biometric proof of personhood system that wilcoin is using and then you've got just a lot of people taking shots at them on Twitter saying that oh you know this is like some kind of totalitarian scoop up everybody's eyeballs for the third world kind of uh I don't know whatever people people talking [ __ ] about world coin I haven't seen a lot of positivity basically almost everybody on Twitter is kind of mad it seems like a world coin I'd be curious just to hear from you guys give me the best positive take you can give there's my best positive take it is really hard to figure out a mapping of one person one set of Biometrics one address we've seen again and again and again every civil attack possible against every airdrop that's ever been imagined in crypto we've seen people try to farm you know everything they can we've seen like armies of people spitting up thousands of accounts you know to try to take advantage of things that don't even exist yet and it is a hard fundamental problem to identify who's a real person how many real people are there how many people are using this application we have a decade plus of people trying to game the metrics around L1 blockchains creating fake activity and fake usage because why not it's easy to make a million wallets right and to make it appear like your blockchain has a million more users it's a real problem it affects so much of what we do and whether or not you think the approach the solution is correct and personally I don't know if it is and it's pretty creepy and I don't love it it is an incredibly difficult and important problem to solve and it's worth solving and they're taking a creative Approach at solving it okay I have a very different believable positive story okay uh I actually think vitalik's post was not critical cool it was generally quite positive and part of the reason is I actually think the while Sam Altman's probably someone I would not necessarily trust in trying to not resell this type of data some of the people who work there on the ZK side of like encrypted basically what it does is there's this device it has a sensor the sensor has a particular attestation mechanism so it can sign and what they do is they take the picture they create this sort of like hash fingerprint and then they generate a zero knowledge proof a way of proving that hey if you took the picture again you know machine learning model tag your eyes and your face like a normal face detection thing and it's the same thing without revealing the input so without revealing like hey this is the picture so that's the only thing sort of stored publicly and the head of research there is one of the smartest but also like very privacy focused people I've ever met in this industry his name is Remco and I genuinely don't think he would work on such thing if they didn't have this kind of long-term goal of actually achieving the attested sensor privacy now that being said the eyeball stuff is personally I find a little bit very creepy I also just don't think that their auditing was particularly good and I can't really check a lot of the the details of exactly how the system works it feels like they rushed it like why do you have to launch the token now that to me just seemed like cash grab the float thing cash crab but they do have these like engineers and researchers who are amazing there so I think to me the fact that those people I think if they saw real malevolence would quit and then at that point it's like short up type of thing not trading but like like sorry yeah yeah but the uh obviously I think there's a lot of cool things they're doing but yeah the token just really felt cash grabby I mean my only argument against the token is I'm just just disappointed that it's like an L1 token like I would think if they're trying to make a currency for the whole world to use they would have waited to release the token not it's not it's no it's on an L1 it's on an album It's the yeah it's on ethereum but the wallet that they create for you when you sign up with worldcoin yeah it used to be on polygon now it's on optimism so it's like kind of going where the money is so they can buy the token yeah even though the token doesn't really do anything today I I agree I think the tech is actually very cool I think the goal is actually very admirable and like I don't know what people envisioned that like the current way we do kyc and like passporting is actually Superior to this and this is actually way better than the sort of the current system but I agree I mean the token armor you know we were looking at the round and like the type of business model it's like oh well you know maybe we'll like you know charge people to yeah look up your ID or like maybe we'll you know do some like metamask uniswap fees and it's just like kind of a big question mark so it doesn't feel like that's really figured out and it feels like totally unnecessary to like launch a token uh when you don't even really have clear pmf and it doesn't really serve a purpose and you know meaningfully decentralizing the system good you know a bunch of people have commented on like their docs are missing a lot of but like like they've been working on this in the open for a while but they kind of like rush to launch it in a way that just didn't seem like timed well it felt like forced whether by and I don't know who Force the investors whatever it didn't feel like you know like a natural kind of launch but again like there's a lot of people who work there who I have the utmost respect for and I really think if they were doing something duplicitous I do not think any of those people would stay and that the moment you see any of them leave that's one that's like all right the orb is just trying to [ __ ] you I wasn't true I find this argument of like I know people there it's cool no no no I act like that that after after having gone through 2022 the different the difference between like Remco and SPF is Remco is a like long standing you know in ethereum development a long-standing right look I Revco is awesome Remco is awesome I completely agree with you I completely agree with you but I'm sure they're paying him yeah a lot of that but I just kind of think like there are a lot of things like at this point that if they continued [ __ ] up I see a lot of people who work there leaving and they've said as such so it's like I also so a very funny fact is in 2017 2018 I met one of the co-founders who's currently now who's kicked out by Altman the current co-founder this guy Max and I thought he was a raving crazy lunatic when he told me this idea he was like yeah like you know I used to work at m-pesa which is this uh payment system in Africa that was on mobile phones and I think the number one problem is this identity problem and the reason it worked in Africa is because the cellular companies all made this like Federation and you could kind of like they agreed to tell each other whether someone was a real person or routed the right way and he was like What if you could do that with blockchain and I was like okay how do you plan on doing that it's like I don't know there's got to be a way to do it and so I remember when I first heard this I was like this is [ __ ] crazy this is like Silicon Valley hubris that we're going to give Ubi to everyone dot dot right like it started as a Ubi project it didn't start as like identity project the the identity thing was about give a Distributing Ubi but then it was sort of like a MacGuffin like the end goal wasn't the thing that it became like the the thing that you have to do to get to the end goal was the main plot in the story and that's like what you have now but yeah I find it a little bit distasteful in the way the token was launched and I think they're going to have a very hard time coming back from that I will say to to work one's credit obviously we've all kind of said the main things that there are to say in terms of critiquing them the one thing I will say about worldcoin is that it is a big vision and that is one thing that I think a lot of people I mean when you have the last year that many eyeballs that is a big amount of vision hahaha wow great 10 out of 10 dad joke thank you Robert I yeah it is ambitious and it's also I mean it is more or less exactly what we were talking about which is that almost everybody's trying to build infrastructure where are the people building applications and I mean they are an application yeah this is an application but also interesting application this is something that people will do it is kind you know yeah it's a Spectra it's crypto right you get you you take what you can get the better it's not about two World coin that I hope will happen but unfortunately investors will require a Sam Alton like figure to make this thing not sound like it was deranged suddenly going into actually existing is just like attested sensors in general like this idea that like the sensor generates some proof of identity that wasn't generated by a computer that's in general going to be one of the biggest applications like I just don't and I feel like World coin can completely [ __ ] up the AOL and the AOL Time Warner merger but like still we'll have at least given people this idea that like this you can actually do this at scale which no one cares about here's my startup idea for some crazy founder out there you make World coin without the orb where you could just use the webcam right in front of you and like everyone can just like go on their computer and get 10 coins there's no 25 for some team it's just like everyone who can scan their face onto the computer and rotate their face and do all that gets 10 coins and that's your fairly distributed crypto asset Robert I have bad news for you about what uh video generation works these days the answer thing though is it real like that's going to be the future the question is how do you get the hardware costs for a down enough that yeah anyone and their mom could write what Robert just described but like your webcam happens to have an attested sensor in it and it costs 10 bucks put the attested sensor in the webcam yeah yeah I mean I was gonna say I think the reason the Optics of the orbit obviously Optics or obviously weird but you know they talk about hey like you we looked at doing a cell phone Cam and like just two low res and like it's really difficult to scan around irises so we do infrared so it's like you know they've also had kind of similar thoughts um but I think to your point to read I think kind of you know the way they describe it is World coin is like one sort of source of Authority for a general sort of attestation Network so I think they have a similar view and this is just kind of like the way you do it versus you know one of and did protocols that are like oh yeah you should use you know my method for doing agitations now you should do my best for doing stations they're just building it yeah you know what I will say the one think about world coin that feels like a missed opportunity is that they've been trying really hard to try to like lean away from the like kind of colonialist orwellian vibe of a bunch of white guys going to Africa and do like taking a white note like taking the like snapshots of people's eyeballs and then taking and giving them small amounts of money in exchange for that and I feel like like if you look at the website you look at all the branding it's like very fuzzy and kind of like oh it's like just it's wonderful tech but like you know this crypto like people love the kind of like dark Cypher Punk like dystopian Vision what if they just like owned the orwellian-ness of the brand and we're like yeah World coin like the world is ending everyone is gonna yeah we're gonna have a database of everybody's eyeballs it's [ __ ] metal like it's so awesome and we have a token like go Arkham style you know like Arkham Arkham if you like managed to nail the landing of like yeah this is dystopian and we own it you know you may as well get eighty dollars for your eyeballs exactly exactly look if everyone balls are going to be tokenized we might as well get not even eighty dollars I think it's like eight dollars yeah I thought you got like 20 coins or something like that yeah it's like pretty good okay 50 bucks that's pretty good that's pretty good I would pay 50 bucks for it okay we heard haseeb say that he would take fifty dollars to get scanned so let's see buy an orb and take it to him he's ready how much do the orbs cost no yeah yeah because they have the people who are like in whatever country like scanning people there is a way to be like that so you can you can just buy them off the shelf this is where the centralized company part is like it's an MLA oh it's white listing okay so in addition to the world it is an MLM because like the coin is exists to kind of promulgate this like oh like you buy more World coins scam eyeballs and you'll get more World coin that part is the distasteful part and that's the part that I I find it very hard when I talk to these people working on like the real difficult sensor a tested sensor stuff that like they can never [ __ ] answer they're just like yeah well how else are we gonna get users I'm like Yeah by not scamming them out of their eyeballs like maybe there's other ways that are like more fair incentives than like trying to make this thing where it's like you have to buy the orb to get more people on and like I hope it works and then they can stop doing the MLM but like I kind of just don't see how that happens like it doesn't feel like there's like a natural like hey I went from Tupperware parties to to like you know Flatline right like I'm sold at stores and I don't need to I don't need to like do this kind of like keep paying for distribution type of stuff yeah this whole thing is just really weird I feel like easy to see coming that there was going to be more weirdness when the token launched because with something like this like it the I mean the whole premise of took in is that it's valuable because people have it right which I I feel like was a thesis that was invalidated a long time ago in crypto that like oh you give this to a bunch of people and that makes it valuable well no one's really done a good job of that I think the MLM is they want you to stake the token to be able to scan new eyeballs wait why do you have to stake it I don't think you have to stake it right because it's like the the scanning is like there's no need like having a DDOS thing idea of like hey there's these people who are who are getting orbs who are Distributing it one other way of basically incentivizing them without charging them for the orb which is expensive now is to have them basically like stake portions of the fees that they get yeah this this I've seen some crazy things like this and it's like that is just like so the only thing that was missing from the system is leverage so let's find a way to make people lock up lever up on their world coin if this didn't have Sam Altman people wouldn't suddenly be like it wouldn't have gotten this far where it's like now you're like okay so this is ftt for eyeballs okay [Laughter] wow this is like the most annoying part about like the technology is actually like amazing right like they're actually doing the right thing of like but then they like did the tokenomics in a way that like would make [ __ ] Justin Sun blush [Laughter] oh God okay all right well I don't know how we move on from that but it's going to be hard to move on to hamsters I know all right well the other ridiculous thing that happened this week was that unfortunately I I regret to announce that there is a new trend on crypto Twitter and that new trend is digital hamster racing Robert would you would you uh do the honors and explaining to the audience so again if I will go back to the preface before the show which is nothing is advice please in fact this is like anti-advice don't do anything related to hamster racing okay like please run yeah like run as far away as you can away from this because this is bad okay but basically some folks on the internet decided that they were going to race hamsters similar to horse racing or dog racing or like cockfights or like whatever and let people on the internet bet all these hamster races using crypto and in the midst of this they've released a token for their hamster race betting Marketplace and people on crypto Twitter got really excited about hamster racing and a token associated with hamster racing and things got out of hand for a couple hours people discovered that the hamster races might not even be live hamster Races they were just video Loops of hamster races great use case for attested sensors you put in a tested sensor on the hamster and now you're you're writing the hamster State onto the blockchain exactly there's better ways to do this if you're going to run a crazy illegal animal racing betting system right and so obviously this inspired a lot of conversation about what is the future of crypto based entertainment and wagering it's inspired a lot of discussion a lot of creativity you know there's a couple nuances to the whole system one is that the hamster organizational token has a five percent commission built into every buy and sale of the token this is an innovation in disaster and the developers basically pocketing an extremely large fee on every single trade which is unique I don't know why they had to add such a wasteful facet onto an otherwise horrible operation and you know we'll see where hamster racing evolves to I hope it ends I hope like people don't start just like spinning up crazy things in their backyard but like if they do marble racing pretty fun you could have like an online marble racing betting ring you know we'll see what the world takes what if the hamster racing is only deep fake hamster racing like it's only AI that could also happen this is why we need those sensors I'm impressed by all the the copycats that spun up because this isn't like a you know Sushi swap copy paste thing that you can do in an hour you know if you if there's one that's like grab roulette and it's like a rat that runs around the roulette wheel and like you have to go acquire a rat and a roulette we and I'm like that yeah just take some some leg work to to accomplish it so um and the very least people are are actually the Cockroach one was even more impressive I don't know where you get live cockroaches within 24 hours but you can apparently so I think some people just have them around the house yeah I mean Quinn gecko had to add a whole section on like animal racing tokens yeah we've been complaining about Innovation on the application layer and I feel like this is the answer that we were basically waiting for as we just said this is why the Normie stories okay please no more of this for the sake all I want to invest in a tested sensor applications because we've clearly proven that like World coin is the the right technology idea but like Ico token behind the two we need to combine World coin and rat racing and it's perfect what else what else could one want all right well that's incredibly depressing um also I will note the uh the the thing that you were talking about Robert the the take rate on the uh transfers that is actually one is both a function of Terra that's what one of the things that Tara implemented wait Tara two territory to call back to Tara 2 implemented a Tarot one it was always a function that could be called to re-collateralize the system if if the collateral was too low so that was a an original OGE Terra functionality that I love that they now integrated into one of the worst like from one of the worst things ever into one of the new worst things ever also kind of a call back to nft royalties is I feel like there's some analogy there I think this has been around for there's like like bombs and they're a bunch of these kind of like yeah people love doing this kind of stuff I don't even know how to describe it yeah what is it yeah what do you even call this this sort of uh High transaction cost tokens there's no point to it you know if they wanted to have a token for their gambling operation betting on hamsters there's no reason to over complicate it with this like crazy ass tax function yeah they already get a share from the marketplace right from from the bets so it seems like that you know that alone yeah I mean the other crazy token that my friends were talking about at the same time was these telegram Bots you've read about these the uni bot and all these other Bots where you basically like let them have a private key where you send all your crypto and then they can trade for you after you send them all your crypto nothing sketchy there yeah nothing sketchy there yeah that sounds totally normal why would you not send all your crypto to a telegram box big step backwards yeah yeah I do feel like uh things are in a weird place when retail is getting really fixated on like telegram Bots for trading and fake hamster races I think consumers in a bad spot right now apparently the jury is still out on the fake races the devs claim it was a bug and that was why this you saw the duplicated streams so you know a bug that played prior footage yeah yeah they were yeah obviously you should give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to Illegal hamster racing Rings like come on all right let's maybe talk about some uh more kind of compelling applications in crypto so there was a big story uh last week about uniswap X the uniswap lordison chain amm exchange uh they announced they're launching a new product which is basically going to be an off-chain aggregator so they're going to do in the style of one inch cow swap zero x what they're going to do is they're going to have these off-chain actors called solvers that are basically going to basically look at all the possible ways in which they could take your order and execute it and they're going to these off-shane players will compete to give you the best execution possible either one through failing it themselves with some you know with their own inventory or by you know routing through some fanciness on chain so that's more or less the idea I mean there's a bunch of other details but basically uniswap is expanding the product Suite to go beyond just directly being the decks to now also being the aggregator of other dexes effectively kind of pushing them into you know the rest of the market the only part of the market that uniswap did not have for on-chain Dex trading for for spot markets obviously for derivatives there are other platforms that have market share there but for spot trading basically the only thing they didn't have was was aggregation so any thoughts on new swap X and kind of how you know swap I mean at this point they if they if they succeed in taking away market share they're just gonna end up kind of the entire stack at the end I mean I think the part that's interesting is the capability of doing cross chain swaps I don't think you know there's been enough Innovation there I think you know there's been aggregators and really efficient systems for on-chain aggregation and like best execution for quite some time but I think the actually interesting thing is that because it's using essentially an off-chain system and you can have two different Assets in two different places as part of this solving that you start to get into like meta chain aggregation and best execution without locking without explicitly locking up capital on both sides yeah without locking up Capital which I think is like an extremely underexplored area of trading now I think there's some room to explore there but like I I that's what excited me the most um personally is that like hey this could totally change how people think about bridging in general like this is like you could just rely on trade execution as the bridge and we could potentially get rid of a lot of like existing approaches like if this were to work at scale on the other hand you do rely on there being active market makers at all times so you might lose your your sort of liveness of like you know in a bridge you get some guarantee that your transaction if it makes it into the bridge contract eventually gets the other side given sufficient numbers of validators monitoring the bridge but here you rely on market makers providing a capital just in time and like if they all disappear on that chain say Phantom multi-chain exploit you might be out of block so there is a there is sort of it's on a free launch you're also relying on uniswap as the one hosting I believe like the order book and the quotes in the system and in some ways it's a much more centralized system then uniswap V1 V2 V3 in that like you're relying on oh yeah you know an entity to make to run the book so to speak Tom you yeah to an ad yeah I mean I I agree I think uh it feels a little bit like uh you know you just swap is in it's it's Google era where it has so much dominance that you can sort of just use your distribution to you know push new products that are maybe or don't depend so much on Innovation like you know I'm sure it's a great product but we've had stuff like this for a very long time and it's more hey if we have so much traffic so much intent coming through our own you know site we may as well you know modernize that or do something else with it versus and sort of borrow from what the market has created versus uh needing to sort of create brand new products from scratch that bring in new people so I agree I mean I think it's probably going to be great to trade on and has a lot of those properties that that people are talking about include execution minimize Etc but it does feel kind of you know very very similar to like a lot of other products that you mentioned they're already out there cash swap zerox one inch Etc and yeah it does create this weird centralization um Vector in the sense that if someone has to host these these quotes someone needs to be on the other end of it it was also interesting that they were talking about fees for this and they're being sort of another v-switch for unit swap X which you know I don't know how to spread that those two of yeah we're hosting this website but it also potentially fees going you know through this application that we're hosting are the fees are meant to go to UNI token are they meant to be monetized totally separately by unit swap Labs I'm assuming uni token um but it's not live yet so who knows okay interesting what's interesting to me about swap X is that it feels a little bit of an admission so uniswap has been trying to expand Beyond just trading right so they acquire Genie which was the nft aggregator while that you know used to compete with Jim and now with blur that kind of hasn't gone well as far as I understand they haven't they're not doing a lot of volume on the unit swap nft exchange um and this kind of feels like okay they're kind of keep trying to push the product Suite of all the uniswap offerings in D5 to become larger and larger and kind of become this like D5 super app effectively that kind of seems like the direction they want to go I remember back in 2020 like late 2020 we were arguing about whether or not to invest into yearn internally at dragonfly and um you know urine was very explicitly doing the super app game where they were like okay we're gonna have you know originally it was just basically a yield aggregator and they're gonna launch all these different verticalized products oh we have insurance we have this we have that and they're even like white labeling things to kind of bring into this yearn super app and we were arguing like okay well uniswap is going to do this too obviously because uniswap has so many users they're basically the front end of D5 like it makes so much sense for them to just verticalize and like have their own lending market and their own this and their own that and just bring it all under the same brand and just you know combine them under one common Token build the super app thing and they didn't do it they didn't even think about doing it they did almost nothing for years until basically they launched an nft exchange which they dropped usdc to people who used it um and so and and then that's it and then this is the next thing that we've seen that's like kind of a real outgrowth Beyond just we are a DEX to me one it feel it feels quite late to be doing this right it felt like they could have really done this two years ago but whatever reason they didn't but it also feels in a way like a concession that the the style of trading is going to change over time toward this model which is just more efficient right which you know a lot like we've been kind of arguing this and making Investments along these lines that we thought that you know the amm model was going to eventually get overtaken by this sort of RFQ off chain you know like find the best find the best way to fulfill this order use market makers or use whatever that this model was eventually going to win and it's a little bit sad to see that maybe the way it wins is that by unit swap just puts it on the front end and then now it wins but the it's pretty clear that like they're the reason why they're doing this is that presumably they're worried that if they don't that the one inches of the world the cow swaps of the world the hash flows of the world the the Xerox of the world that take on this model are just going to out-compete them on price by having market makers essentially standing in and just giving you a better price or or just routing it on chain so my sense is that this might be in a way like kind of the beginning of the end of like the really cool on-chain stuff and also I mean one thing a lot of people have been talking about is that it is in a way a reflection that uh we're moving away from the transaction based model of on-chain trading and more toward the intense space model of on-chain trading and maybe this is a good place uh to just kind of wrap up the show and talk a little bit about this concept of intents I know a lot of people have been talking about it it's one that you know I know we were just lamenting how much people are talking about infrastructure but it is one of those big topics and infrastructure that keeps coming up again and again so it's probably worth at least giving uh kind of two cents on it Tom you want to explain really briefly what is meant by this concept of intents versus transactions sure uh it's basically the zero X order so I think we're done um but uh no I mean I think um you know the the basic sort of you know like primitive of ethereum right is you specify hey here's like the transition that I like to make and here's like or here's the function I'm going to call it with a specific data and here's how much I'm going to pay to you know perform this transaction and then sure that it's it's valid and it gets included it's almost like too rigid it's like um if you were like ordering something from Amazon you're like well I want this specific thing at this time delivered through this you know delivery driver and it's just like it's actually not really what you care about it's kind of like you want to be very loose on on inputs and rigid on on the outputs where the outputs might be I'd like to purchase this nft or I would like to swap you know one eth for roughly this amount of usdc and you let the market sort of figure out the best path to get to that output that you want and sort of what the inputs are to get to that output and so for an intent it's switching away from very specifically this is the type of transaction you'd like to make um and and all the different bits that go into that versus here's roughly the the output that I would I would like and I would let the market figure out how best to accomplish that that output right and so yeah to ruin maybe you can speak to like why is this such a big deal why is everyone talking about this I mean especially if you were in Paris I know there's a lot of discussion about intense and intense based like I'm moving away from transaction stored intents what's the big deal um yeah can you guys see my uh shared screen not yet but I'm super pumped to know uh oh you know this is a talk I gave uh at Andreessen research about different types of things that people are uncertain about in the transaction supply chain of like I send a transaction has like executed where's it executed what parties are in the middle and these are all the different um mechanisms that people have studied and you know you know obviously the most used one in the world as an auction and you know I I gave this color coding making fun of the fact that like intents are this kind of like in GitHub comment kind of description they're not really formally defined I think the way people are actually using them is actually quite broader nowadays than sort of a Xerox order for instance but you know I think it's mainly a catch-all for things that have any form of uncertainty so the user has some type of uncertainty in how their transaction gets executed but they get some guarantees that regardless of how it gets executed some covenants hold like they get at least a certain amount of tokens or they use a certain amount of Leverage at most or they dot dot like choose a metric usually a financial metric but it could be a non-financial metric that you can compute and you have some way of giving some proof that even though there's all these uncertainties in the transaction supply chain in the blockchain um that you can uh you're you're guaranteed some elements and so a lot of people on the internet will just be like it's just a limited order right because the limit order says guarantee if your order was filled it was filled at this price because the limit order was at a certain price for a certain quantity but a lot of the type of stuff people are doing is actually more complicated than that and it it's more like hey in this circumstance I want to trade Pepe for hamster but actually if like the hamster people are posting attestations that's and they're failing it's not a real hamster I actually want to sell all my hamster and I want to make sure I only get eat out no other asset and so these like more complicated trading things are are kind of important I had some slides showing the uncertainties but there's probably too complicated for this podcast I mean I'll save that for the next step all right show us this live I want to see the slide now no no you if you're you're gonna clean this is too fancy for our audience I want to see it I want to see it there's there's a spot this is there's just an arrow our audience can get this Arrow the uncertainties ordered what is that some type of like Minimax payoff all right I like the increasing payoff uncertainty that means supremum in in math which is like a generalization um obviously obviously obviously I know that I mean come on who doesn't know that super super yeah yeah EG super okay exactly cool well I I immediately understood this the moment you pulled it up so I think we can we can meet down um okay awesome all right well I think that's it for this week all right next week will be a totally normal week but we will be back and we will be talking about whatever happens between now and then so until then signing off [Music]
