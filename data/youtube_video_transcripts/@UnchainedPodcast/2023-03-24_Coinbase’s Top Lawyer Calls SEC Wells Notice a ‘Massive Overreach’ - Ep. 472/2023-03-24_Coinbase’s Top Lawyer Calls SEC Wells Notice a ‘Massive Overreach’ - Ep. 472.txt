thank you Laura thanks for having me on the SEC just served coinbase with a Wells notice which is an intention to Sue or issue an enforcement action for a while it's been apparent that the SEC and coinbase have been engaged in some sort of dialogue even if at times it's been a little testy from your perspective what happened here how did things get to this point well Laura as you point out uh coinbase has been talking to the SEC not just for many months but in fact for many years our conversations predate when when we became a publicly listed company in April 2021 and since that time we continue to have productive even if sometimes challenging conversations on a range of issues what happened yesterday is that we were informed that the SEC was issuing a Wells notice which is a formal notification that the commission was intending to pursue claims against coinbase or violating Federal Securities laws and while we were disappointed by that notice we weren't surprised at all given that for many many years now we've been trying to get reasonable rules operate rating in plain sight and the commission is simply chosen or refused to engage with us and so essentially were you about to come to some agreement on something and then they they issue the wealth notice or what was kind of the trigger for that well just to give you some sense of the conversations that predated the notice we have met with the SEC on at least 30 occasions over the last nine months to try to get to some common understanding of what registration could look like for a cryptocurrency exchange like coinbase we had 30 or more other engagements with them over that same period of time all focused on what reasonable rules could and should apply so that a cryptocurrency exchange could be registered operate inside of the regulatory perimeter how could we accommodate the unique elements of blockchain Technologies so that investors and consumers get the information they need and at the same time the fundamental structures of blockchain networks are understood and respected and yet every time we have attempted to engage address particular concerns that might come up we've essentially hit a brick wall it's also important I think to understand Laura that we have not limited our engagement with the SEC to Simply these private conversations now going back to last July for example we filed a petition for formal rulemaking which is a public request that the SEC issue rules and in that petition we laid out something like 50 or more questions that we think need to be answered in order for any crypto framework to make sense again we were given essentially no response even after we filed not one but two separate comments to our own petition in which we spoke specifically to what do issuer disclosures need to look like what does staking look like under a registration regime all of this you know unfortunately has led us to this point where the commission appears to be choosing litigation and Court fights over some public type of public conversation that allows everyone to have a say and then for everyone to understand what rules need to apply we think that's a mistake and so what did the wells notice say like what do you think it is that the SEC will allege as to the nature of your violations well the wells notice itself was very generic if you look at it and in fact all of your listeners can look at it if they go to my Twitter feed because I posted it it's essentially a boilerplate recitation of a variety of statutes that fall within the SEC jurisdiction and a claim that coinbase is somehow violating them we asked the commission once we received word that this notice was coming can you tell us what particular tokens give you concern can you explain to us why baking and our arguments that staking is not a security are somehow flawed and over and over again we were told that we would have to Simply rely upon the guidance that the SEC has issued and the statements that the chair has made from time to time that all assets effectively other than Bitcoin are security so it has not been a productive conversation and it has been much more of a monologue than a dialogue um but you know we've kept at it because we think that reasonable rules are important we think it's a much better way to regulate an industry that there be rules issued pursuant to notice in common rulemaking and unfortunately this commission has decided that that process set by Congress doesn't apply to them and that court is the place for these issues to be resolved and so just to understand the origin of the investigation is it from the conversations you were having or does it concern any particular offering such as their earn program which is around staking Laura I'd love to be able to tell you exactly what products are at issue and what particular claims the SEC will be making in court but unfortunately the commission is chosen to withhold that information from us and simply proceed to a Wells notice now we have some understanding of what concerns the chair and others have about crypto in general because of course we pay very careful attention to what the chair has said and so we have attempted to anticipate concerns and present our views on for example why staking at least as offered by coinbase is not a security or alternatively why our rigorous process reviewing assets does keep those assets that may qualify as Securities off our exchange we've laid out for example that of the thousand plus assets that we've considered for listing we've rejected over 90 of them for the very concerns and reasons that the SEC professes to have when it comes to a digital asset Securities and of course all of this was laid out in painful detail when we attempted to become a public company back in April 2021. just to give you one interesting fact from that process Laura staking was listed over 50 or 60 times literally in our S1 so we've been operating in plain sight we've attempted to engage productively on this and over and over again what we've seen from the commission is a refusal and and simply a Reliance upon litigation or threats of litigation in order to get answers and so at that time that coinbase went public and the SEC reviewed your S1 what was the nature of the questions or the discussions that happened around those various activities such as you know the listing of assets and staking Etc well we had a very exhaustive discussion about all of the different elements of the op of our business and how we operate as a business and intend to operate as a public company if if our S1 registration were to be approved the fact of the matter is that we had nothing to hide we have relied upon a rigorous asset listing process going back to well before we had any interest or intention in becoming a public company and we laid all that history out for the commission we specifically referenced our staking programs over and over and over again in our S1 and since we have been a public company we have filed a petition for rule making laying out the issues we think need to be resolved we've had these many dozens of private conversations with the SEC to try to work through what Market structures could make sense or would make sense under our registration regime in an over and over again and we've just been met with silence we don't think that's the right way to regulate this industry obviously and out of curiosity was there any sense that things changed based on some of the bigger news of last year that you know cast perhaps a negative light on the crypto industry and on exchanges in particular specifically I'm speaking of FTX like I wondered if you noticed any kind of change in tone based on those events from last year well there's no question that FTX was a watershed moment for the industry and for the commission itself and for good reason what happened at FTX was clearly a fraud and we have been very public and clear that we believe the fraud that took place needs to be addressed now perhaps it should have been addressed before it was allowed to take place I would be curious to see for example what wells notice may have issued to Mr bankman freed or to FDX I suspect none was and yet here we are years after uh becoming a public company under the auspices of the SEC requesting publicly and privately reasonable rules that we can all live with and yet we find ourselves receiving the wells notice and having to prepare for court it's not a place I wanted to be at but it's a place I'm prepared to be at on behalf of coinbase because this is not the right way for America to continue its preeminent role in crypto and as a and in technology more generally and just to understand like when you were undergoing that process with the SEC what would generally happen in that kind of process and because basically from your blog post it sort of seen you were saying that the turn of events here was really out of the ordinary so if you could just kind of yeah paint that picture of what was a more typical process I'd be interested to hear yeah well the the process we followed at least initially was a very typical process again I would point to the fact that as a company seeking to go public we had no choice and we're eager to share all the details of how our business operated and yet again uh there didn't seem to be any problem uh back in April 2021 and for the years that followed since that time we also followed a fairly standard process as we sought to introduce new products and services we reached out to the SEC we offered and delivered presentations and detailed discussions of how our products and services work why we believed the law permitted it um how we thought new rules could help clarify you know certain ambiguities in the laws so that was all a fairly normal typical process what has been less than normal is that over the course of those many many discussions on a variety of topics we have received literally zero feedback on why we were wrong where we were where we were mistaken in our understanding of how the 33 and 34 Act and the Howie test and all of that applied that's highly unusual particularly for a commission that is charged with protecting the public interest all right in a moment we're going to talk about conflicting

aware that there seems to be somewhat of a turf war between this SEC and the cftc and conflicting statements even from the chairs Gary Gensler as you mentioned the chair of the SEC seems to believe that all cryptos aside from Bitcoin are securities whereas uh the chair of the cftc is at least indicated that ether would also be a commodity so I was curious for your thoughts on how you manage those types of contradictory statements and also to know in your Ideal World how would the SEC regulate you and how would the cftc regulate you or what areas would they regulate you for Laura is someone who has been involved in these issues for years yourself you certainly can appreciate that this jurisdictional fight between the SEC and the cftc is not anything new this has been going on uh really for as long as as crypto has has been in existence but the statements by the respect of chairs of the commissions are really quite striking if you think about it you have the chair of the cftc saying something diametrically opposed and at direct odds with the chair of the SEC has said when it comes to one of the most important tokens in crypto which is of course eth at the same time you have courts that are weighing in on these questions raising serious doubts about the State of Affairs as a result of this clash between The Regulators in the boys in the Voyager bankruptcy case for example the federal bankruptcy judge in that case in a written opinion issued a scathing assessment of the clash between The Regulators on what assets are securities and what assets are Commodities and the fact that exchanges and other members of the crypto ecosystem have been operating in plain sight for years and yet they still have no clear resolution or guidance from those charged with establishing rules and standards we don't have a particular dog in the fight as to which regulator oversees what part of crypto although you know we have some we have some opinions about that the main thing is to get clarity around this and so you know in the meantime as American Regulators seem to be squabbling over you know you know key elements of their respective jurisdictions we're seeing a very different conversation taking place outside the United States in the UK in Australia and Germany and Singapore all over the world Regulators are saying yes we need to protect consumers we need to protect investors but let's do so in a sensible way that promotes Innovation and make sure that this industry which is not going anywhere which is here to stay is properly overseen and and properly regulated that that's really I think as striking as anything to me the difference between what we're seeing in Washington and capitals all over the world and so what are the next steps here are you going to be submitting a Wells response and if so what would that say well um the wells process does permit a company like coinbase to submit its arguments the SEC and I expect that we will take advantage of the opportunity before the commission makes a final decision on whether to proceed with litigation I will say Laura that because this is not our first encounter with the SEC on these same issues because we've been trying to talk to them for many months and indeed many years about these issues I'm not terribly optimistic that anything that we will say or present will change anyone's mind but it's important that we run that process I think it's also important to understand that this is not just a fight for coinbase this is a fight for all of crypto if responsible actors with serious AML and kyc programs publicly listed that are filing petitions for rule making and attempting to engage with the government can be treated in this fashion nobody else is safe either and and I think it's important to understand that this is not just a shot at coinbase this is a shot at crypto as a whole and so we will certainly do our part to defend against what we think is massive overreach on the part of the commission but it's not just a fight that coinbase has to fight alone this is really something that all of crypto I think needs to be very careful attention to and um we're going to make sure that all of these issues that we're dealing with with the SEC are explained and disclosed and described to the public as a whole to the best of our ability so that everybody can have a clear understanding of where things stand and when you said that you felt that this was a shot at crypto as a whole do you also believe that it's a shot at Bitcoin because sometimes when I listen to Gary Gensler he just seems like a almost like a Bitcoin maximalist and so in that regard it may be you know that would be untouched what's your opinion on that well we love Bitcoin at coinbase and obviously Our Roots uh Run Deep with Bitcoin if you look back to when Brian first started the company over a decade ago I don't know if the chair has any particular affinity for Bitcoin or anything else he may be dealing with the political and practical realities that the very first blockchain based Network and token would be even more difficult I think to attack directly than some of the other tokens and projects that he's that he's taken aim at I think the main thing though that stands out in my mind about this approach is that you and I sitting here today can't really explain nor could anybody else what's special about Bitcoin that distinguishes it from a whole host of other projects out there we have I have my own theories I could surmise you know what those differences are but that's the job of the regulator their job is to tell us what differences matter why one particular project is on one side of the rules or the law and others may be on the other side and then we all have a responsibility to follow those rules I'm happy to follow the rules Laura coinbase is happy to follow the rules but we need rules to follow if they want to throw the rule book at us fine write the rule book that's what we're asking for and yet over and over again we just see this Reliance on the part of regulators in a particular condition on ambiguity innuendo and supposition as opposed to standards that we can all apply over and over again I've seen that coinbase in its blog post will say things like coinbase does not list Securities but it sort of seems you're implying that it is the regulator who decides that so so you know do you just feel very confidently that what coinbase's listing processes would align with what The Regulators would be or you know how do you reconcile the difference between the blog post and what you just said to be very clear Laura Congress tells us what the laws are The Regulators are charged with interpreting those laws and developing clear rules but at the end of the day the courts are responsible for deciding who is right and who is wrong um that is not the charge of any regulator on its own we should be able to get to Clarity and certainty without having to go to court but if this fight has to go to court not just again on behalf of coinbase but on behalf of all of crypto the courts are going to have the final say here there should be no mistake about that and so under what circumstances would you settle well to be clear I'd rather be I'd rather be talking to you on this podcast about new products and services that coinbase is offering we don't relish a court fight um and yeah in most cases there is usually a reasonable resolution in which one side gives a little bit on its for its part and the other side gives a little bit on for its part and and and the case is resolved we're always open to conversation I don't know how much more clear we could be about that other than the point to our long history of you know screaming from every rooftop give us rules and tell us what the standards are so I'm always going to keep an open door on behalf of the company and O'Brien and our other leadership feel very strongly that um we should try to work to reasonable accommodations where we can but the rule of law has to matter this can't be arbitrary this can't just be a reflection of personal preference or policy when the law makes clear that products and service is the coinbase offers today are fully compliant and we're going to stand up and vindicate that principle if required and so if the SEC prevails and it ends up being something where Bitcoin is not seen as a security but all the other cryptos are then how would coinbase comply with that what would that look like and is that something that you would be amenable to well to be clear the SEC deciding that is is the first step in a long process as we've seen in the Ripple case and others litigation can often take not just months but years and there are hearings and trials and appeals that can extend far off into the future we've built our entire business law as you know because you've been studying in this industry and covering coinbase for for a long time on two core principles Security on the one hand and Trust on the other and Trust first and foremost is about following the law that's what we're doing here we we are standing up for the rule of law by challenging this overreach on the part of the government we'll let the courts decide in due course um you know where these lines ultimately will need to be drawn but in the meantime we're very excited about our business we continue to ship new technologies and announce new products for example our base layer two is recently announced and we're very excited about that so um yeah we've got a lot of lawyers at the company I've got even more lawyers outside the company working on behalf of us we'll take care of the court issues and due course in the meantime our product leaders our engineers and others they're going to keep designing great things and uh I'm very confident that this will not distract us from our long-term mission last question for you if Congress were to pass crypto legislation this year what kind of elements would you like to see in the bill we would love to see legislation passed by Congress it's one of the reasons why a week or two ago I testified before the digital asset subcommittee of the house Financial Services committee um we think there are unique opportunities to get legislation done even in a very politically charged environment in Washington right now for example stable coins we think that there could be sensible standards enacted in legislation as to as to how stable coins should operate what the reserves are what audit requirements apply what transparency is made available so that's one area where I think there's a real opportunity for Congress to step in and and provide greater Clarity but there are others our Congress has now pending before it you know any number of draft bills that get at what the what the jurisdiction of the cftc is what the jurisdiction of the SEC is how could Securities be defined much more clearly um through legislation so that we're not playing this guessing game here in the United States that doesn't seem to ever come up outside of the United States so any number of these areas could be quite productive for Congress to engage in I think the main thing is for the Congress to understand it unless and until it steps in either through legislation or through oversight agencies perhaps even Rogue agencies are going to are going are going to fill that vacuum and we think that's a real mistake for American innovation and competitiveness all right Paul thank you so

stolen amounting to 3 000 eth or 5.4 million dollars this development led to defy lending platform Euler Finance entering negotiations with its Anonymous exploiters to recover the remaining stolen funds the ongoing discussions took place through on-chain messages between both parties on Wednesday another twist occurred when the infamous Ronin hacker sent a suspicious encrypted message to the Euler hacker which on-chain analysts believe could be a phishing attempt the Euler team advised the hacker to be cautious while using the encryption tool mentioned in the message in response to Euler hacker confirmed their intention to return the stolen funds to the Euler team these developments have left Market participants undecided on whether the blockchain messages between the two hackers were part of an actual attempt to steal funds or just a show put on by both parties last week the Euler hacker sent 100 East to the Ronin hackers wallet address causing confusion over potential links between them time for fun vids Ginny from Unchained has something to say about FTX clawing back funds from medulla Capital listen to her give her take bear claws are only my second favorite claw today FTX has entered into an agreement to claw back 99 of the value of the assets held at modulo Capital a so-called obscure crypto fund AKA crypto fought SPF funded last year Angelo Capital was founded in March 2022 by two people one of whom was romantically involved with SPF number two of SBS X's were getting rich off FTX money it was like that's what they liked about him SBF claims to have given modulo Capital 75 million dollars less than he actually gave him his defense 75 million dollars to SPF is nothing that's what like two extra weeks in jail unfortunately it does represent 99 of modulo's total assets which unlike the time Mark Zuckerberg pledged 99 of his wealth to charity except in this case I think modulo actually is going to have to pay up now FTX and Alameda have to give up their claims to modulus which seems fine that's like sending her food back to the chef after you've licked the plate clean as being is not immediately responded to requests for comments but if we
