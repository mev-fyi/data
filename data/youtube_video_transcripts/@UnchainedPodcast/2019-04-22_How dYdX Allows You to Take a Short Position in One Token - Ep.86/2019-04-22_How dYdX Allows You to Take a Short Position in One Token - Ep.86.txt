is Antonio Giuliano founder of dy/dx welcome Antonio thanks for having me Laura before we start I just have a funny story to tell which is that dy/dx is definitely one of the more challenging projects i've had to wrap my head around and preparing for this interview was giving me flashbacks to when i was a senior in high school and I took calculus BC and there's like two kinds of calculus you can take as a senior and that's the more difficult one and math was always like more challenging for me than that their subjects but I I just thought like oh I can do it but it kind of had like too much fun that summer and it took me a little while to get into the school spirit when when you know the fall semester of element round so I literally got a D in the first quarter and at the end of it I went to the teacher and I was like how you know can I change this like is there something I could do for extra credit and he said yeah oh well if you do extra credit I can give you a d+ and I literally started like tearing up and I was like oh my god like because I really wanted to go to Stanford like I'm never gonna get a Stanford oh and what ended up happening is he agreed to give me a p4 pass and then I got an a-minus the second quarter and we averaged the grades with my final exam and eventually I ended up with a b-minus for the semester so it was all okay well I'm glad hopefully the name doesn't give too many bad memories for too many people oh my god yeah like going through all this stuff yesterday I was just like okay it's not like I can't get it but it's taking me so long and I had done that pre-interview with you before and you know I wanted to relist into it to make sure I understood and I had to listen to it again on 0.6 or 0.7 speed so quickly and I could so apparently understand what you were saying so all of this preamble is just to say go slowly assume you're talking to 5th grader because you know I'm only barely grab something I will do so okay so let's just start with the simplest thing what is dy/dx so dy/dx is a protocol for decentralized derivatives and margin trading basically the first thing that we're doing is making a protocol for margin trading that lets users go short or get leverage on any for now aetherium based cryptocurrency our first product that we're launching soon is called margin tokens and with margin tokens you can basically represent a short or leveraged position as a regular fungible ERC 20 token this is cool because we can basically create the short etherium token say and now if you want to say go short on aetherium all you have to do is buy the short etherium token which you can do on our product expo or on any other exchange that lists the short or leveraged tokens we what we think of dy/dx and not just as a margin trading protocol but as a protocol for all types of financial derivatives we just decided to start with the margin trading because we think that that's the most applicable thing to build in the market right now and why did you decide to tackle derivatives and and just for listeners who aren't super familiar with the financial services system which in a way I'm also not you know I think also the vast majority of my listeners are or at least the plurality come from tech so what are derivatives and why did you decide to tackle this area of finance so financial derivatives are financial products that are built on top of on other underlying assets so they vary a lot in complexity things like options or swaps and they're primarily used by bigger institutions or more sophisticated traders to get met better risk management or increased speculation on their while on their portfolios so that's kind of what financial derivatives are we're excited about building them because they oftentimes bring a lot of maturity to the underlying markets the way that most people are trading cryptocurrencies right now is basically just to buy and hold them but that's not at all the way that people trade traditional assets they often use financial derivatives to kind of hedge their bets or get different types of speculation or risk management that they couldn't otherwise get so that's kind of what financial derivatives are any response to your question about why I decided to tackle the challenge of building financial derivatives on the blockchain so I really wanted to build something that was actually useful in the market right now and the way that most people are using cryptocurrencies is for speculation but like I was saying a lot of these more advanced trading tools that traders are accustomed to don't exist in the market yet so we thought that that this would be an interesting thing to build in something that would actually be useful in the market right now well actually so one thing that was interesting is in the white paper you said that derivatives will open up new avenues for speculation and yet you're you're kind of saying like oh we want to do something that's different so how do you square those two statements yeah so derivatives can be used for a lot of different things kind of the two main use cases I mentioned are either hedging something that's really good to do in kind of bear markets so a lot of these crypto hedge funds could use financial derivatives to basically hedge their long bets and protect their downside which is something that probably a lot of people should have done more of in the past six months or so the other application that they're widely used for is increased speculation or getting leveraged you can also kind of bet on more interesting things like volatility that you couldn't really bet on with basically just buying and holding the underlying assets oh interesting so if this protocol had been available as of like January 1st or something that I know we might see a lot of people making profits off of this bear market is that correct yeah absolutely and actually our first product short aetherium which is the short aetherium token would basically be a really simple way for users to bet on kind of aetherium going down so a lot of people could have used that to basically actually profit in the bear market of the past six months interesting I recently had like a maximalist on the show and it was toured to me to do Meester so maybe I'll let him know and see it but his money where his mouth is well actually that that brings me to this other question because I am curious so right now if I wanted a short ether how could I do that so there are a couple different ways you could short ether right now and they're pretty much all on centralized exchanges so probably the easiest way to do it if you're a big traditional institution is to buy futures on some of these centralized exchanges that offer Futurist products like I think CBOE and a few of the other ones do so a lot of the bigger institutions are kind of using those mechanisms to get short exposure there are also a number of centralized exchanges that do offer margin trading such as Polonia X or bit Mac so those types of things where you could basically go to take a short position on any cryptocurrency that they offer and kind of the final way that we've seen people doing it in a bigger way are through over-the-counter desks so there are certain OTC desks that do provide lending liquidity that you can use to short assets like Genesis trading for example I believe offers you see lending so those are kind of the three predominant ways we see institutions getting short exposure right now but there aren't really any products that are super available for more individual traders to kind of get short exposure on a number of these assets in a really simple way and if they're doing it with dy/dx then they can maintain control their private keys it sounds like yeah absolutely that's a big selling point so if kind of our protocol and is similar to a lot of other protocols such as Dharma or a0x or similar yeah I've had both of them on the show recently in case people haven't noticed I'm trying to do a little series on this sort of world of decentralized finance that I am watching being built which is basically incredibly fascinating to me but before we get into how do you ID X works I actually also want to bring up your background how did you get into crypto so I got into crypto in 2015 when I started working as a software engineer at coinbase I was much different than most other people that worked at coinbase in that I didn't know anything about Bitcoin before that oh yeah so I was at a Princeton CS at the time and I was just graduating and point base was one of the like 20 places I applied to as a senior I kind of only applied because Fred Wilson actually came and gave a talk and mentioned coinbase in one of the classes I was taking at Princeton but one of the unique things about coin dayses hiring process is that they did a work trial so basically during my senior year they flew me out to San Francisco and I worked with them for a week and at the time I still didn't really know anything about Bitcoin but everybody was just so excited about it and all there are so many amazing people a coin base at the time so I could just see that I wanted to work with these amazing people and they were all super excited about this Bitcoin thing so I just decided to give it a try and jumped on board full-time at coin base after graduating and then once you're at coin base it's pretty much impossible not to get excited about Bitcoin because everybody just talks about it all the time you get to sit down and have lunch with amazing people like Fred or Brian or Olaf who just are far and away like the the best thinkers in the space so just kind of having that exposure to the really best people in this space really got me excited about it and then after I worked at coinbase for a while I knew that I wanted to build things in this space in the future which is kind of what led me to dy/dx yeah and so fill in that part of the story so I actually left coinbase to work at uber briefly so I was at uber for like six months after working at coinbase and I knew even when I went to Eber I knew that I wanted to still work in the cryptocurrency face and that I wanted to start a startup but I kind of my plan was to work at uber for like a year make some more money kind of give me some time to work on my personal projects but I only lasted for six months at uber before leaving to start my own thing and the first thing that I started was not dydx it was a search engine for decentralized apps that I called Waypoint so I built this whole thing out and basically was trying to be like a Google for decentralized apps and I was working on it full-time for like three or four months and literally nobody was using it and that kind of led me to my realization that I really wanted to build something that's actually applicable in the market right now and the main problem with the search engine thing was that just nobody is building any decentralized apps or especially at the time like a little over a year ago so there was just nothing to search for and it was too early in the market so I kind of spent a weekend sitting down and thinking about the types of problems that I could solve with a decentralized protocol that would actually be useful in the market and that kind of led me to financial derivatives I didn't really know anything about derivatives at the time but I spent a lot of time talking to a lot of good friends who had gone on from Princeton to work in the finance world and quickly came up to speed on kind of what derivatives are kind of the hard part about derivatives is not understanding how they work but more understanding how people trade them like how an option works is kind of fundamentally fairly simple but how people trade options is very very complicated so I definitely did not understand all of that at the time and that's still something I'm working on but I did kind of come up with basically a protocol that supports fully collateralized options which is the the first thing that I came up with and then soon after that came up with the beginnings of the margin trading protocol which is what we decided to start with and are launching now so that's kind of what led me to building dy/dx and in the derivative protocol I want it yeah I want to get into that a little bit more later about how what's more complicated as the way people trade them because I would imagine maybe part of the complication comes from the complexity of the existing financial services system itself but so before we get there why don't we just go into how dy/dx works you started by talking about the margin tokens but I actually want you to walk me through how a short-sell works in dy/dx on the back end you know not through the token but just like step by step and for listeners who don't have you know the background on how a short-sell works traditionally it would be you borrow the asset that you want to short you immediately sell it so you kind of know how much you know your your sale prices and then after the price of that asset falls at that point you buy the shares at obviously at this lower price and return them back to the lender so ending where Jax it's like a little bit different so why don't you walk me through how that goes yeah that's a good walk through of how normal short sales work and it's actually quite similar in dydx so at the beginning of the show I did mention our short and leveraged tokens which are the simplest way to get short or leveraged exposure on dy/dx but actually backing every short or leveraged token is a short or leveraged position so for taking a short position on UID X it basically works the same way as a normal short sell in that you have to borrow the asset that you want to short and then sell it to the trader on the spot market and then lock up some collateral in the position and then that kind of collateral basically just sits there for the duration of the trade and then you use whenever you want to close your position you use some of that collateral to buy back the tokens that you borrowed from the lender and then you get kind of whatever is left so let's just kind of walk through an example of how shorting theorem on dy/dx works so if you want to short aetherium you need to borrow aetherium from somebody dy/dx has its own kind of lending protocol built in and basically it kind of works in a couple ways lenders can basically offer to make loans for etherium by signing an auth message and this message contains details such as how much they want to lend the interest fee like the maximum duration etc and then these loans are held on a relay err which is very similar to the concept of a relay er used by many other protocols again such as zero X or Dharma and then so now if you want to short a theory 'm you can go to the relay er and find an offer to lend you a cerium similarly you need somebody to buy aetherium from you on the other side you also need something to short aetherium against so say we're shorting aetherium against the dice table coin which is maker Dallas stable coin then you basically need an offer to buy aetherium and sell die which you can use that by order to basically sell the etherium that you just borrowed from the lender dy/dx plugs into a number of different decentralized exchanges the primary one being 0 X so normally people will use a 0 X order - that's basically offering to buy aetherium and sell die in this case so you the trader just want to short aetherium so you go to the relay er and the relay er finds you this loan offering offering to lend you aetherium and similarly this buy order offering to buy aetherium and sell die then you take those two things and send them in a transaction to our smart contract and our smart contract does a few things it verifies the signature on the loan offering to make sure it's legitimate and if it is legitimate then it basically cools aetherium from the lender so now our smart contract has some aetherium then it sells it to the external buyer and get some dye from that trade an interesting thing about 0x and other decentralized exchanges is normally they're used for just peer-to-peer trading like I'm a human and I Trey with some other human but a really interesting property of them is that smart contracts can also trade with them and that's kind of what we utilize to enable us to enable our smart contracts to basically trade within external 0ex maker so at this point our smart contract only has died it basically sold all the etherium that it got from the borrower and then it takes some margin deposit from the short seller proportional to in the amount of margin deposit is basically specified on the loan offering that was offered by the lender so now it has died equal to whatever it got from the cell plus your margin deposit let's just say kind of putting concrete numbers to this you borrowed like one etherium and then you sold that etherium for a hundred died and then you put up 550 die as margin deposit so after all of this stuff has happened then the smart contract ends up with 150 die locked in the position it's also important to note that all of this stuff that I just talked about happens atomically in one transaction on aetherium a really interesting property of aetherium that we heavily make use of is that smart contracts can call other smart contracts within one transaction so basically we use that to kind of do the borrowing and the selling and the locking up of collateral all in one aetherium transaction so it makes the process really simple well just just to clarify so this part that you where you described it all happens atomically is that on with the margin token so this doesn't have anything to do with the margin token quite yet but basically has to do with just how aetherium transactions work and it's really nice property because say for example we do the borrow and then for some reason the selling fails it'll kind of roll back the whole thing that's that's basically what Adam is today means so kind of all of it will happen or none of it will happen you can't get into like a weird state where you kind of have borrowed some of the funds but haven't actually sold them or things like that okay so keep going okay so now the state of the world that you there's a position and you are the short seller and you've shorted aetherium on the other side there's a lender that you owe aetherium back to and there is 150 died locked up in the position so we use continuously compounding interest to basically determine the amount of interest that's owed to the lender at any given time so you the short seller can decide to come back and close your position whenever you want to so say you wait like a week and now the price of aetherium has dropped to 50 died and you owe a little bit of interest so say you owe like 55 died back to the lender now what you can do is basically you need to find somebody that's willing to sell this time aetherium for some died and you'll go to a relayer to to find somebody to do this and normally this will be through 0x order but I do want emphasize that our protocol will work with a bunch of different decentralized exchanges not just 0x so you go to a relay ER and find say a 0x order that's offering to sell back the etherium that you owe to the lender for say 55 died so you send that to the smart contract and the smart contract trades some of its own die that it has locked up in collateral for that aetherium so it trades like 55 out of the 150 die that it has locked up in collateral and buys back the etherium that it owes to the lender gives the etherium back to the lender so the lender is happy they they basically earned interest on their ether and we're paid back and then you the short seller get whatever is left and in this example you actually made money because the price of aetherium goes down and you made basically the amount of collateral which is 150 - what it cost you to buy back the tokens that are owed to the lender which is 55 so in this example you made 95 or sorry you get a 95 die and you initially put up a to deposit of 50 died so in this example you make a profit of 45 died on the trade interesting so a couple of things so first of all I spoke with shoot I'm pretty sure it was um I think it was Robert Lester of compound and they used something called collateral ratio to determine how much collateral you put up is that just determined on an individual 101 basis in dy/dx yes it is determined on an individual one-on-one basis so kind of a lot of the parameters for loans are determined by lenders and dy DX dy DX is a very kind of open in general protocol so we let lenders specify pretty much any detail about the trade from kind of the maximum duration of the trade to even the interest rate that they're offering and in other things like that so it's more just specified by the lender and our protocol whereas for some other protocols like the compound for example is what you're mentioning a lot of the parameters are kind of specified globally on their smart contracts and the other thing I was wondering is in your example you used ether and die and die obviously is a stable coin that's currently pegged to the price of one dollar but what if let's say I want a short rep with ether and both of those prices are fluctuating in relationship to the dollar then how does the collateral work and and in all the other aspects yeah absolutely so you can use any pair basically for kind of what you borrow and what you put up as collateral so you could absolutely use UID x to basically short rep for aetherium and we kind of anticipate that that will be a really big use case basically that's basically just taking a bet that you think that say rep or or whatever other token it doesn't have to be rep is overvalued as compared to ether and basically using dy/dx to short that as compared to ether would be a really good way to to kind of take that bet without actually even exposing yourself to the overall risk of cryptocurrency so even if say aetherium went down by a ton but rep bot went down even more so you're actually right on your bet in that kind of went up as compared to rep you'd still make money on that trade so there are a lot of use cases for margin trading where it does make sense to actually use as collateral something that's not just back to the dollar or some other fiat currency like that and it would make a lot of sense to kind of use underlying cryptocurrencies such as aetherium really whatever you want as collateral as well hmm that's interesting I usually would think it would be the opposite because you know ether is down so much this year so you know you would have to be well I guess I mean there are a lot of not so good tokens that have plummeted even more so so maybe actually it does make sense but I just think it would be trickier it's like you have to sort of make more than one calculation in a way yeah absolutely and you really do like financial derivatives are in margin trading are definitely financial products that do require a higher level of sophistication to trade so you really have to understand exactly kind of what you're buying or what trade you're making before you make it but these these types of trades are commonly employed by more sophisticated traders and that's more of the target use case that that we're going after all right so let's then describe this short token how and how it works yeah absolutely so in my example basically it described basically just an individual getting taking out a short position on ether the way that the short token works is very interesting and it's actually fairly simple all you have to do is basically there's this concept where positions and loans can not just be owned by individuals like humans they can also be owned by smart contracts and this is really important because it allows you to unlock a lot of other functionality on top of the protocol so the way the short token works is it works exactly the same as in my first example except now the owner of the position is not a human but a smart contract and this smart contract basically is an e or C 20 token and the ERC 20 tokens basically just referees fractional ownership of the backing position so say I take out a position in exactly the way I described in the first example and I take out like I'm now short say a hundred aetherium so the the protocol will basically meant me a hundred short aetherium tokens now if say say you want to short fifty aetherium you don't actually have to do all the complicated stuff that I described in my initial example all you have to do is buy 50 short tokens from me and then you'll basically own half of the the short position because there are a hundred short tokens and you own 50 and I own 50 and basically just the fact that the position is owned by an e or C 20 token allows you to do really interesting things like like splitting up ownership of it and also due to the economics of it the price to buy a short token will always be equal to the price to mint a new short token in minting a new short token is just done by kind of the process of opening a position that I described before so it's really interesting because now only a really small number of actors need to actually do the complexity of opening and closing positions in the vast majority of users and just live in this simple world or if they want to get short exposure they can just buy the short token or if they want to say close their position or like exit then they can just sell the short token to somebody else and somebody else can kind of deal with the complexities of opening the poor closing the position for them and so with the short token then there's not like a duration baked in right it's just like when I want to sell that that's when I sell it and it's at that moment that it determines whether or not I profit or loss it's not like I'm betting oh I think the price will fall you know to this price by this time and if it does then I then it caches that for me or you know and if it doesn't then it goes out to the full duration and I lose money how does that part work so there is a max duration both two positions and the short and leverage tokens but you can also close your position before that maximum duration so say the maximum duration is like a month and you buy a short token there are two ways you could profit on it first is say fifteen days through the month you decide you've either made or lost enough money and you sell your short token and you basically just make whatever profit that the short token made during that first fifteen days or you could basically wait the entire duration of the short token and we have automated mechanisms in our protocol that will basically close the the short token at the correct price without you having to take any action so you could simply like the simplest way to get short exposure on the dy/dx protocol will be to just buy a short token and then wait say the maximum duration of the short token and then let the automated mechanisms close the token for you and then you can just come back and withdraw kind of the payout that you would have gotten and the payout that you would have gotten is is basically just the profit that the short token made during the entire duration okay we're gonna keep discussing your other products but first I'd like to take a quick break for our fabulous sponsors interested in becoming a blockchain citizen but unsure of how to get started come be a part of the decentralized revolution and head over to block daemon comm slash Unchained to launch your own node on a public blockchain network or join a private

add spot could be yours got a great product or service for Unchained or unconfirmed listeners reach out to raylene at Laura Shin podcast at gmail.com to find out about sponsorship opportunities on Unchained and unconfirmed again that's Laura Shin podcast at gmail.com la you are a Shi n podcast at gmail.com I'm speaking with Antonio Giuliano of dy/dx so your other product right now I think is a leverage long token what is that and how does it work so it works very similarly to how the short tokens work the only difference is that you kind of flip the token that you borrow and the token that you put up as collateral so actually the protocol doesn't really even know what is a short versus what is a leverage long all it knows are kind of what the token is that you borrowed R and then what the token that you put up as collateral is so let's kind of go through an example of how getting leverage on dy/dx would work so in our first example we kind of borrowed etherium from the lender and then we put up die as collateral if you want to use dy/dx to instead get leverage on aetherium you'd in this case borrow die from the lender and you put up aetherium as collateral so you could basically so if you borrow die from the lender you're basically increasing your buying power so say you put up you have like 100 die with which you want to buy aetherium you could just buy $100 say worth of a cerium with your hundred die or you could borrow say another hundred dollars from a lender and then use your 100 die plus the hundred die that you borrowed from the lender to buy 200 die worth of aetherium with your 100 die in the way that this works is say you in our example you put up 100 die and then you borrow another 100 die so now the protocol has 200 die locked up in the position then it sells that 200 die for aetherium let's say in this case the price of one ether is 100 die so it sells the that 200 die for two cerium and then locks that to ether up in the position now that too they're basically just sits there for the duration of the position but you still owe the lender back in a mountain denominated in dye not an ether so in this example let's say the price of aetherium goes up to 200 died whereas it started out at 100 died so now the two ether that are locked in the position are actually worth 400 died and you still say ignoring interest a hundred died to the lender so you could close your position by basically buying back a hundred died and giving that to the lender and then basically there's 300 die left and you could basically take that as your profit so in this example you'd end up with 300 died whereas you only put up a margin deposit of $100 leveraged to Exxon etherium whereas if you had only say bought a hundred die worth of etherium with your 100 die you say would have initially bought one ether with that and then ether went up by a hundred died so you would have made 100 died on the trade whereas being leveraged to X with UID X you would have made 200 died on the trade so so kind of an example works very similarly to how shorting on dy/dx works except you basically just flip the token that you're borrowing with the token that's held as collateral super interesting one other thing I was wondering about is how do you guys determine the price of the assets because obviously all these exchanges have different prices so the way that prices are determined on dy/dx is that each trader can kind of select their own spot order that they want to use to open or close a position so so say in going back to our initial example of shorting ether and that the price for ether in that example was a hundred died for one ether so in basically the reason that that price is what it is is because that's the best price that is offered by 0x order to basically trade if your a.m. for die on 0x so basically there the trader has an economic incentive to pick the best order for themselves because they wouldn't there would also be orders on the book for say like trading ether at like 90 die but you want to open your short position at the highest price possible so traders will always pick the order with the highest price for themselves so it's very similar to how just kind of limit orders work on exchanges and traders always have economic incentives to basically pick the best order for themselves or similarly say like 0x was offering a price of like a hundred die what's the best price you could find on 0x but like Khyber or ASIS or something else like some other decentralized exchange like that we're offering a better price then you could kind of open your position with Oasis instead and basically get a better price for your trade hmm that's interesting so as far as I understand for margin tokens when you close your position those tokens get burned why is that so the margin tokens basically represent your ownership in the position and when you use basically the reason that margin tokens have value is because they allow you to close a fraction of the backing position and receive the appropriate payout but when you basically use your margin tokens to to close part of the position and get the appropriate payout you no longer own a fraction of that position so we basically just have to burn the tokens because the tokens all we represent ownership in the backing position and if you close your ownership and that backing position then you should no longer have the Martian token to represent that okay something that I was curious about is you know you were talking about how these orders will be filled on these different decentralized exchanges and how you can you know set the parameters with your lender and stuff like that but how well do you think margin tokens will work with low liquidity tokens yeah that's a great point and we do think that they will work a lot better we tokens that have more liquidity and that's one of the main reasons why we're starting with short and leveraged aetherium because the the etherium dye market is by far the most liquid on decentralized exchanges so that's actually one of the main criteria we're considering when deciding when to offer different assets for foreshortened leverage tokens is how much liquidity there is an underlying spot market so it's kind of that combined with how much lending liquidity that we think there is for each asset so if you want to short something like like we've been saying you need to borrow it so we actually need to go out and find lenders that are willing to lend all these different assets that people want to short so kind of the the two things that you need are the underlying spot liquidity and underlying lending liquidity in order to to trade a margin token on dy/dx yeah I I imagine that's the case now but I could sort of picture this going into some kind of longtail thing we're really really far in the future you'll be able to do all kinds of different combinations including of somewhat obscure tokens if if this all you know works but yeah so one other thing that was curious about is so is the person creating each mark and token the trader him or herself or do you imagine there are gonna be companies that crop up to kind of like feature different kinds of smart contract based derivatives that you can buy or how will that part work yeah so dy/dx is a very general and unup enya nated protocol so anybody can use it to take out any position or margin token that they want to so you can use dy/dx just to trade peer-to-peer if you want to the first use case that we're really focusing on is the margin tokens and the kind of standard margin tokens which are the ones that we're offering on Expo are kind of the ones that are created by dy/dx but anybody else could come along and create their own margin token on dy/dx and in all that creating the margin tokens means is that you kind of specify the parameters for the position so you specify the things like what are the tokens being traded the interest fee being paid to the lenders what's the maximum duration other things like that but dy/dx is a very general protocol so we do anticipate that other people will use the UI DX to build all kinds of different applications on top of our margin trading protocol and other protocols that we offer in the future but we did think that it's important to offer the first and easiest way to trade UI DX margin tokens which is what we're launching with expo and actually just before we continue when you mentioned Expo before but I don't know what Expo is yeah so Expo is our an end user facing application that we're building on top of the dy/dx protocol and expo will be the simplest way to buy and sell dy/dx margin tokens this is actually like an interesting point and something that we're kind of doing differently than a lot of the other protocols that I've seen is that we are building a lot of these and user facing applications and supporting services on top of our protocol so what we're doing is a lot more than just building smart contracts on aetherium but expo is basically just a regular website similar to any other d app that you might use and basically it allows you to to go and see what's the different short or leveraged tokens that are available to trade are and gives you a really easy interface to buy and sell them and kind of how it works is it plugs into other decentralized exchanges on the back end to get to the buy/sell liquidity that you need to create to buy or sell the the short tokens well this is really really interesting I know I keep saying that it'll try to stop uhm so earlier you mentioned that as you've been going along you've realized that what's easier in a way to comprehend is the actual derivatives themselves but what's more complicated is to understand how traders are treating them so what what are the differences and what are you having to learn in that regard yeah so just the way that margin trades or options work aren't really that complicated from a technical perspective like for margin trade it's basically what we just went through like you borrow something and then you sell it to somebody else and they you lock up collateral and four options which we haven't really talked about but they're fairly simple basically you kind of lock up collateral and give somebody else an option to basically buy that collateral at a certain price so it's not too difficult to make them from a technical perspective really the complicated thing is to understand how traders actually use them in trading and kind of what trading strategies they use with options or with margin trading this is something we've been doing a lot of is kind of reaching out to customers to understand how they want to use to start with margin trading and then in the future options or other types of derivatives on cryptocurrencies and kind of what strategies they want to employ with them like interesting things like margin trades are probably the simplest type of more advanced financial product in my mind but once you get to more sophisticated types of derivatives like options or swaps or similar then you can kind of do a lot of really interesting but more sophisticated things like for example with an option you can kind of lock in your price for aetherium or really limit your downside so say like aetherium was at like $1300 before and you were like wow this is great I still think aetherium will go up but I want to protect myself if the price of aetherium goes down you could basically use a put option or which is basically an option to sell a theory amad a certain price to kind of lock in your price so you could buy a put option with basically a strike price of say like a thousand dollars when aetherium is at $1300 and then if the theory M goes up you don't have to exercise that option because the price of aetherium would have been higher but if the price of aetherium say as it did went down to like $200 or whatever it is now then you could have used that put option to instead sell your aetherium at $1000 so that's kind of one example of a really simple use case where kind of these more advanced financial products can be used to really protect downside and hedge against like extreme volatility so we think that they're really important part of the overall trading market and something that we haven't really seen used very widely in cryptocurrency but traditionally we see the derivatives markets being on the order of 10x having more tell like 10x more volume than the underlying spot markets and in cryptocurrency that isn't the case at all yet so we really think that derivatives are going to be really widely used in the future especially given the underlying volatility of cryptocurrencies so that that's kind of Y dy DX is something we're excited to build in the short term before we move on do you want it just walk me through you know your version of an option briefly yeah absolutely so our current options protocol and to be clear this isn't something that we're launching right now but something that we're planning to launch in the future but our current options protocol is for what's called a covered option and covered basically just means a fully collateralized option so there are two different types of options and I mentioned one of them before there's a call option which is an option to buy an asset at a certain price so you could like buy a call option on aetherium and it would have some strike price or a put option which is an option to sell an asset at a certain price so the way our options protocol works is is that there are these people called writers which basically are the people that create an offer to sell options so if you want to say buy a call option which is an option to buy aetherium on aetherium then you'd go to a writer and when you buy an option basically you have to pay the writer a premium which is kind of money that you pay the writer upfront in order to basically own the option so let's kind of go through a concrete example so say the price of aetherium is at $200 right now you could basically buy a call option on aetherium at say a strike price of $300 so if the price of aetherium go those goes down or kind of stays the same then that option will expire worthless because why would you ever buy if you're iam for $300 when you could just buy it on the market price of $200 but say the price of etherium goes up by a lot say it goes up to like a thousand dollars or something like that and now you still have this call option to buy aetherium at $300 then you would have made $700 on that trade so that's an example of kind of how options can be used to increase speculation going into the specifics of how our options protocol works it's actually a good bit simpler than the margin trading protocol especially for the covered options and the way it works is that a writer will basically locked-up aetherium in a smart contract and will immediately get paid a premium and kind of what the owner of the option gets is a brand-new ERC 20 token very similar to kind of how the margin token works that basically represents the option and what this ERC 20 token gives you is the right to exercise the option at a specified date or strike price in the future so if you say own a call option token on aetherium and the strike price is $300 whoever owns this new option year c 20 token will get the right to buy the etherium which remember was locked up at as collateral in the smart contract by the writer at say 300 died in the future so that's pretty much all there is to it and so it's basically just the writers lock up collateral and a smart contract the smart contract mints a new year C 20 token which represents the option and whoever owns that option token can buy the collateral that's locked up in the smart contract for a specified price it's really so fascinating because I imagine that in existing financial services every you know everything that you just described takes a lot more kind of like paper and a lot more intermediary so I just find it really mind-blowing frankly when I learn about how this can be done with technology um so one thing I wanted to ask about was that in a previous interview with me you said quote that you're working on things where you can take margin positions for other types of derivatives with not full collateralization and then you said that you'll be putting all of that in a pool of collateral that will back you know many different positions so I just was curious to know how would that work if there's a market crash yeah absolutely so kind of just taking a step back and I can describe a little bit what I was talking about there so our options and margin trading protocols are fully collateralized and but this isn't the way that most people trade derivatives and more advanced financial products in the future they usually trade them with fractional backing and you can kind of see this by like the some of like the total notional values of all the derivatives in the world is somewhere in the range of like a quadrillion dollars which is clearly way more than all the money that exists in the world and the reason for that is because all these people are trading derivatives and advanced financial products with fractional backing so that's kind of what we are trying to solve with kind of this future protocol that will enable us to kind of back options or margin trades with not full collateralization I want to caveat all of this with kind of saying that this is very very much in the research phase and we think strongly believe that kind of launching the fully collateralized margin trades and options are the the most impactful thing we could do in the short term but we are thinking about ways that we can kind of solve this problem of not full collateralization in the future and kind of what you were alluding to is one of the ways that we're thinking about solving that is kind of with a pool of capital and basically the pool of capital but kind of back a number of different derivatives and financial products together and we'll kind of diversify the risk across a number of positions so kind of thinking about like some easy things that you could do with this like on dy/dx with like options say you have like a put option in a call option for aetherium so that's kind one's betting that the price will go up and one's betting that the price will go down with the version one options protocol you'd have to put up full collateralization on both sides but you don't really need it because it's kind of either the price will go up or the price will go down so in that example you could kind of back the position with half the amount of collateral and that's kind of the general trends of how you can back like a number of different positions with less capital by kind of diversifying the risk across the number of positions so that's kind of the general theme of the protocol that we're in the process of designing for the future and something that we're really excited about and we think solves a really massive need for these not fully collateralized derivatives but before you have not fully collateralized derivatives we're kind of a pool of collateral backing them you need to literally make like a margin trade or an option so that's what we're focused on in the short term is basically just making the easiest possible experience to do a margin trade or an option without trusting your tokens to anybody else yeah I imagine also for that to work that you would need to mix in other asset classes besides crypto like security tokens because at least for the moment crypto markets the crypto market tends to move in sync you know like those days when you open coin right wake up and everything is read or everything is green so that actually leads me to my next question it like I know that harbor which does security tokens that there are tokens standard is er C 20 compatible so does that mean that you could use a security token built with harbor on dy/dx yeah absolutely so you can use any year c 20 token on UID X so that opens up a lot of really interesting possibilities because once you start tokenizing real world assets with harbor or similar you kind of can immediately tap into this whole ecosystem of decentralized financial applications such as like you could trade it with 0x you could like take loans out in on it with Dharma you could kind of take margin trades or options out on it with dy/dx so it's really interesting once you kind of get all these open standards working together and that's something that we're just starting to see the power of that I think and I think dy/dx is a really good example of different protocols working together because we are kind of built on top of different decentralized exchanges such as 0x it's a pretty interesting example of how you can combine like lending with 0x to basically make margin trading so I think we'll see a lot of really interesting use cases pop up really quickly once a lot of these protocols are actually live and start working together like that and just out of curiosity obviously this is a different token standard but do you think eventually ERC 721 tokens which are crypto goods like crypto kitties will work on dy/dx it's possible it makes a little bit less sense with kind of the way that we're doing margin trading or options to start with because you kind of need an underlying spot price for the asset but some some things that people are thinking of doing are basically kind of fractional izing ownership of like an ear c71 like if it's like a really expensive crypto kitty or something like that then you can kind of have an e or C 20 token which represents ownership of that backing years.you 71 token and then you could kind of use that to kind of like stay short a crypto kitty or something like that but kind of the concept of just like shorting the one crypto kitty like doesn't make as much sense because there's not a spot price for it but those are the types of things that I think we'll be exploring more in the future you have two million dollars in seed investment from andreessen horowitz poly chain Capital Brian Armstrong and others but you don't have a token so how does dy/dx plan to make money so there are a couple different ways we could capture value and kind of the the biggest ways I think about it or the biggest question for us as a company is how we capture value and we could either do it at the protocol level or more at the application level and what I mean by that so at the protocol level we could actually do like an actually useful token and I do think that there are a number of tokens that actually do have value so that's something that we might consider in the future we don't think there's a strong need for a token in the margin trading or the options protocol in my thesis on tokens is that they're not something that you need to rush into and it's worth thinking pretty deeply about first of all whether you even need a token and then if you do what the best way is to implement that token in your protocol so that's something where we really would just wanted to come out with a protocol that works without injecting a useless token into it first of all and then kind of thinking about how we can add a token later in kind of the way we're thinking about tokens right now is we may introduce one with kind of some of the future protocols that we're building and we kind of briefly touched on the like collateral pool protocol which kind of supports not full collateralization so that's kind of something that might have a strong need for a token based on kind of how we design the protocol the other way that people are thinking about capturing value at the protocol level is through just kind of straight-up charging a fee through their smart contracts I'm not as much a fan of this but I could see like a world in which this kind of emerges as the standard for how protocols capture value I think it kind of works in applications like crypto kitties for example charges like a three point something percent fee whenever you trade a crypto Kitty so I think it kind of works for games and things like that but I don't really think it works as well for serious financial applications like derivatives or lending because people really care about like kind of fees and like middlemen sitting in the middle but that could potentially be an option if that emerges us kind of the de-facto way that protocols are capturing value so those are the ways we could potentially capture value at the protocol level on the application level we could capture value through actually just making money and as I was mentioning this is something that we're doing differently than a lot of other protocols in that we're kind of building and user facing applications on top of our own protocol and a good example of that is Expo so Expo won't be charging fees to start because what we're looking to do is just getting to get as many users of our protocol as possible but if it does like come out that most people are kind of using Expo to interact with the dy/dx protocol that could be a really good opportunity for us to kind of charge fees like you would see on a centralized exchange at that level so those are kind of the the three different ways we're thinking about capturing value we have a lot of really excellent backers who are really really long-term aligned in the space I mean also raising equity has given us a lot of flexibility and to basically just build out something that's actually useful in the short term and think about capturing value later but we are thinking about it a lot when we're very much like a for-profit business not just kind of like a just an open protocol or anything like that that doesn't make money um so so that's kind of how we're thinking about it for the long term and who do you imagine your target users will be like do you Matt do you see Wall Street using this technology eventually definitely not to start so to start with we're thinking our target customers are smaller crypto hedge funds there are a ton of these crypto hedge funds these days or more sophisticated individual traders so that's kind of who we're targeting with the launch of the marketing trading card a call and Expo once we start getting into more sophisticated types of derivatives like options or anything else that we might add that's kind of when you need more institutional type traders or really sophisticated individuals to be able to trade those so I think we'll kind of move up the spectrum from like I think about like customers as a spectrum from like full retail customers to like full institutions I think we're starting somewhere in the middle but we'll kind of shade more towards the institutional customers over time a really interesting thing that having these tokenized positions offers you is that the the positions like the short tokens for example are just regular cryptocurrencies so they can be traded anywhere even on a centralized exchanges very much in the same way that bitcoin is decentralized but you can trade Bitcoin on a centralized exchange if you want to so I imagine that this will be one of the main ways that users interact with our protocol basically just buying the dy/dx short or leveraged or in the future may be options tokens on an exchange without ever even having to interact with a decentralized application at all so that kind of allows us to cater to a much more kind of traditional audience there are like a number of centralized exchanges as I mentioned at the start that are offering margin trading in in certain derivatives products which those are kind of the like CBOE or example for example will be kind of where likely most of the traditional financial people who are trading Bitcoin will trade derivatives for the short term but I think in the long term there are like a ton of advantages to using an open protocol like dy/dx to do margin trading or derivatives in kind of a number of those are that they're fully global like you can trade with anybody anywhere in the world which is kind of like something you see come up a lot for for why you would use a decentralized application it's more secure there are kind of less middlemen sitting in the way you can kind of share liquidity across a number of exchanges which is actually a really important point because for all these exchanges that offer margin trading you can only borrow from people that are on the same platform like for example if your margin trading on Colonia acts you can only borrow from people who are on Bologna acts but with dy/dx like the protocol doesn't care where you get the lending liquidity from so you can kind of share lending liquidity and spot liquidity across a number of different exchanges and I think that will really see that pay off in the long term but that's kind of how we see the evolution of our customers starting with people who are already trading and using decentralized apps right now and eventually getting to the more mainstream over time when you mentioned that you can trade with anyone anywhere in the world it just made me think so obviously you know there's an advantage of that in terms of liquidity but it just sounds like a regulatory nightmare and I just wonder what are the regulatory issues and is it simply incumbent on the trader themselves to make sure that they're complying with the laws of their jurisdiction or does that burden lie with zio dy/dx or how does that work out yeah so a lot of the time it will fall onto the centralized exchanges or relays on which traders are trading like I think we see this a lot with different protocols if they have any like centralized components those are oftentimes the most highly regulated so I think if there's any taury burden it will fall with those players we have been thinking about this a lot for working with one of the the very best cryptocurrency law firms Perkins cuy we're actively engaging with the CFTC which is the regulatory body that regulates derivatives and also other regulatory bodies to try to understand and educate them on how to IDX works I mean kind of what the regulation surrounding it are you're absolutely right that there's a lot of regulatory uncertainty and this has been said over and over but especially once you get into some of these more heavily regulated spaces such as financial derivatives like a lot of the laws were literally written for like physical commodities like kind like you could sell like an option on corn or something like that and now the CFTC is classified like Bitcoin or etherium also as commodities and they're trying to kind of apply the same regulations to it so we're definitely taking a very compliant approach to this this is something I think I really get from coinbase and and we really saw work well there in terms of we're being built like in the u.s. like we're not like incorporated overseas or anything like that we're actively engaging with regulators we're really trying to provide supports as much as we can to other real ayers and exchanges building on top of the protocol but it's definitely something that I think the regulation will have to evolve with the technology over time and that's kind of how we think about it this has been an incredibly fascinating discussion and I don't think I nearly failed as I was having flashbacks to last night so thank you so much where can people learn more about you and dy/dx yeah so you can go to our website dy DX dot exchange or if you'd like to try our
