hey everyone a couple quick notes before we start today my guest is Sondra roe one of my first sources to appear in the show back in the day this episode starts a bit slowly but really picks up when Sandra gives us not just one but two contrary intakes on regulation and reveals the inside story on how she got Bitcoin future started at sea Emmy it was great fun having her back and we'll see if her predictions bear out I also wanted to repeat some news in case you didn't hear I decided to cancel the crypto weekend retreat at Omega because I really could use that time to work on my book but I do hope to offer something similar at some point in the future now here's my conversation with Sandra hi everyone welcome to Unchained your know high prices for all things crypto I'm your host

regulators themselves use cipher trace to comply with regulation to monitor compliance my guest today is center burrows CEO of the global blockchain business council welcome Sandra hi Laura thank you for having me on what does the GV VC do the GB BC was conceived about three years ago it's a Swiss based nonprofit focusing on three pillars education advocacy and partnership to drive the business of blockchain and so what does that mean exactly like who do you work with and on what types of projects like how do you decide what the organization will work on sure I'll give you the short version of how it all started so as you've been on the island Sir Richard Branson's blockchain summit occurs every year and back in 2016 a group of entrepreneurs got together and decided that it would be important to create a nonprofit that would help focus education primarily two spheres of influence and what do I mean by that government legislators leaders central banks regulators and also executives some of the biggest companies around the world and then bridging that gap with the entrepreneurs who are doing the most cutting-edge leading-edge work in the blockchain space and so with the launch at Davos in 2017 the group has evolved quite considerably we started with 35 country ambassadors with a handful of members now we have over a hundred across more than 50 countries and we rely very heavily and on distributed network of influencers and supporters and ambassadors to help us get the word out we've been most recently to countries like Kazakhstan where we were with the a IFC and the government they're focusing on how to grow blockchain initiatives entrepreneurship and also foreign direct investment into that region especially considering how important it's going to be in the one belt one road China initiative and so and then obviously in the u.s. we've been stepping up our engagement not only on the hill but also at the state and city levels so we've evolved quite a bit in the last couple years I came in as a founding board member when I was still at zme group and now in the last year and a half have taken the role of the CEO and we have definitely brought in our mandate but we still focus on being the bridge and the convener of lots of different stakeholders to make the business of blockchain happen give some examples of some of the types of projects you're working on I mean you mentioned the Kazakhstan thing I it just isn't clear to me after that how blockchain technology would be used in this like one belt one Road initiative yep so at a very high level we spend our time behind closed doors educating governments and different agencies around everything from Evo ting to crypto currencies to practical use cases at a more fundamental practical level you know in the case of I just gave an example of the IFC they have basically set the Astana international finance center is focused on effectively it's like an economic zone it's English law it's English speaking inside of the main capital so where you have basically entrepreneurs and companies that are foreign they can come to a IFC and basically get space get support and also effectively in English speaking English law governed zone inside of Kazakhstan which is pretty unique and it only launched last year and one of the big focus points is on technology and it involves everything from blockchain to other types of emerging tech and so we spent our time in the last couple months focusing on helping them build out a conference and then beyond that we've had meetings with them around how they attract more blockchain entrepreneurs not only locally but also externally so just to give you a couple examples bitfury orbs soar omitsu and a number of others is from Switzerland have actually set up shop in what was called Astana is now called no nurse or time the city name has actually changed in the last couple months and so the a IFC houses all of these companies and they're looking to grow that and then from a separate city perspective or a country perspective they're really looking to figure out what use cases can be used to implement blockchain and they are looking at everything from Land Registry to record-keeping and improving systems around that so in a way it sounds like more like gee BBC right now is more of an educational resource for different governments and businesses that are interested in learning about the technology yeah we spend a lot of our time around the education piece because there's still major gaps you've got countries where let's say for example the home country for gbb C which is Switzerland quite sophisticated lots of use cases going on you don't need to do blockchain 101 to most of the officials there but you go to other countries and you do have to start from Ground Zero and unfortunately there's still a lot of confusion around a conversation around Bitcoin and cryptocurrency versus a conversation around how identity plays into this or how a healthcare use case would be utilized or supply chain and so what we tried to do is unpack it in a way that people who do not do this day in day out understand and then can walk away and at least have a high-level understanding of what is possible and on the gbb site there are a number of different use cases that are listed on a page under different categories such as energy government financial services healthcare business processes supply chain IRA culture real estate and media and I was kind of poking around at the examples and they really run the gamut there's digital identities for displaced Rohingya Muslims to a system that fidelity developed to enable charities to receive donations of Bitcoin there's I think that orbs thing you mentioned which is the public blockchain there's a project on that to help prevent the spread of fake news and make sure that credit creators are credited for their work so like what is the level of involvement that GBC has with these different initiatives so again we are a convener of those who are building on the blockchain and building block chains as a matter of fact so when you look at all these examples we have either they are members or their partners or they're people who are supporters of GBC who have offered up their use cases to us we've obviously vetted them we curate it and then we make sure that we highlight them again GBC is a neutral entity in the sense that we are yes absolutely Pro digital and pro tech but we will not be pro a particular blockchain it's way too early there are too many different applications and problem sets that can utilize different types of block genes and so we don't sit there and dictate to any one group oh this is the one that should be used what we do however provide our balanced pros and cons around a set of block teams or a type of use case and say these are the things that are available and this is what's out there so you can think of us as the group that knows what's going on in the space at a macro level we look at lots of different countries and entities and verticals and then we bring that together in one place so that people can take that information and understanding and networks and collaborate with each other so we're a convener or a curator and we build bridges and so then when one of these groups does commit to doing a pilot are you very involved in getting that off the ground that's an excellent question Laura I have to say we have stayed away from that for the most part in the last you know at least since the beginning of the creation of GB BC but in the last year we've been increasingly asked to participate especially by governments on different initiatives and one area where we have pivoted and actually grown is public/private partnerships around blockchain Center and for example New York City EDC where an operator of the New York City blockchain Center partnered with the Economic Development Corporation of New York City to launch a physical Center and that Center has its own specific mandate around blockchain we're also talking to other cities in the US as well as around the world it's not wasn't in our original mission but it actually does tie very much into community building and a physical space as much as all this tech we talk about is virtual at the end of the day people still like to come together and we've actually seen some pretty cool things happen already with entrepreneurs who've met at the center and are now working together and collaborating with two very different companies in some cases but they found common ground and are looking to actually work on projects together so again you know it's different the sort of physical space around a blockchain center or a blockchain lab but we have delved into that space right now and then you will hear in the near future that we've got several projects going on that involve more are more direct involvement in certain projects but again are we a consultancy firm no are we trying to you know run projects ourselves not really we're here to support and if anything what we're doing is trying to get our membership to who are actually the builders who are looking for business development opportunities and connecting the dots for them so what we would like to do is create the opportunity set for our entrepreneurs and also big enterprises who are looking for startups and earlier when you mention that you vet the different projects that you feature how do you decide which types of projects to work with yeah we spend a lot of time just making sure that the projects are real you know in the last few years that have been in the space I will have to say I've been really and maybe I shouldn't be so alarmed with the shocking number of vaporware that's out there just things that don't exist people have raised money for projects where there is no product and so we've tried very hard to do is to make sure we've seen the demo we understand who the people are and that they're credible and the projects are actually have a chance of succeeding well failure rates for startups are very high but what we want to do is to say at least we've taken a look at something that's very interesting we believe that it's got enough legs for it to be viable and frankly to be broadcast to the world that hey take a look at what's going on here we have a few more that are really exciting in the healthcare space for example I think that are really coming to fruition that are not in the headlines but these are startups one out of Australia that we know about another one hopefully percolating quite well in the US and we'll be able to highlight those and I think healthcare is going to be one huge vertical that is really going to start setting the tone for a lot of amazing use cases that will impact the lives of everyday people like you and me and to me that's exciting so healthcare is such a broad area is that like around health data privacy or around you know pharmaceutical counterfeits or like what are yeah I mean there's just so many absolutely I agree with you there's so many different areas right so I think you know we are really excited about the ones that are already public like around you know Medi led your Chronicle Medi ledger that's doing the pharmaceutical tracking and they've got you know half a dozen really big pharmaceutical companies involved and let's see how that goes right from a supply chain perspective but we're also hearing about now just give you an example of how to deal with opioid responsiveness so here's an example of something that's a very you know us problem folks problem across many different states you've got many stakeholders you've got law enforcement you've got hospitals doctors and nurses you've got people you know in the communities that are suffering and how do you get better at the responsiveness so one example I've been given and again this is something that's in progress that's not been fully you know baked in and vetted yet but the point being is it's coming and so I'll give you a window into that which is how do you if you're a nurse and you see four patients who come in and their profiles are very different than the four patients who came before with drug overdose problem well what if you notified the law enforcement agency or law enforcement in your community immediately that this was the case and you logged that in and then the law enforcement could then take a look and see that actually what's happened is the reason why you've got the different symptoms is because there's a new product on the market and it's recently hit the market and it's you know quite let's say a bad strain of whatever the drug is that's in question or as a derivative of that the this kind of ability to share information in a secure way more quickly actually helps with decision making and also just understanding amongst different stakeholders and to facilitate that it's really actually I think exciting and how will blockchain play a role in that and there will be different pieces it won't be just blockchain it will be many other components of tech that are lip this together but can it be done on a blockchain backbone infrastructure to share that information securely in a way that works that's what's being explored right now and believe it or not there are cities and politicians I've spoken to who would be very interested in supporting initiative like this that's interesting yeah it's sort of like a Google Trends there are those people who say well that could just be done with the database so why why would you use a blockchain for that well I I have a couple different layers of let's unpack that a couple different layers when people give that argument so what can a database do database can hold information really well and if you have you know let's say good API is and good and user interface you can probably have that those access points to that database fairly fairly easily and from a user standpoint could be pretty good so I'll give you that okay what can you do beyond that well it's actually kind of limiting it stores data and you can access data at a central point the whole point of a blockchain solution is that you distribute this information in a way that is a secure architecture so that you could have across city state and multiple stakeholder lines the ability to access this data and from a security standpoint from a ease of information sharing standpoint and also and this is I think the most important piece which is around the verification and then securing of that information so that it is very difficult and it is what people use the term immutable I use that very carefully that information once secured is there you know and in hard to be tampered with I think that's not to be underestimated people monkey around records all the time people manipulate records all the time and so let's take one level up from the data you know manipulation and the the record-keeping manipulation at the next level up is around what else can you do with that data well data analytics overlaying whether it's you know and I'm just thinking out loud here whether it's overlaying smart contract ability to automate certain functions I don't know where we would go with that but you have the option to do that in a blockchain world you do not have really that kind of option in a just database world and if there is some reason we wanted to embed a payments layer a crypto payments layer or digital payments layer that's possible to and so my argument to all the people who always say well you could just use a database absolutely if it's a very simple use case and it really is just around you know a centralized database having information and everyone accessing it and that's fine fine so be it and that's all you need but in a world where you have the ability to build on blockchain infrastructure and you can add all these different other layers of functionality and automation and application why would you build on just a plain database well another thing that I was noticing from digging around the site is that there are some initiatives that are under the G BBC umbrella that work with private blockchains and others that work with public long chains so when you're kind of like educating these different organizations that come to you like how do you guide them on either which blockchain or or maybe you don't go that for you know or at least which type of blockchain they should use for their project right so again what we try to do is level set make sure the hype or misunderstandings are you know cleared away and then we start with okay this is the world of public blockchains there's a whole scale and spectrum that go all the way over to then private permission block chains right because we've got hybrids now we've got also block chains that are trying to build into other block chains and create interoperability mechanisms and I think there's a lot of cool stuff happening there but what we try to do is say look what is your problem first what are you solving for what are the really important mechanisms that you need or business requirements that you need are regulatory requirements that you have that you need to satisfy and then we then try to present you know these are the types of block chains and these are the types of similar use cases where this could apply but ultimately it's up to a government or people to choose what they want to do or which blockchain they choose and when you say you know one of the first questions is what is the problem you're trying to solve are there any particular guidelines that you follow for which types of problems are better suited to private blockchains versus public ones or any of the other company combination right right look I think inherently when we start talking about use cases that involve regulatory hurdles and data privacy or financial privacy issues you then immediately move to a different set of guardrails in my mind or a different set of criteria because if you know off the bat for example that you have to safeguard because of regulatory reasons your customers data and their identity and their financial transactions then you cannot apply it at least carte blanche on the etherium network right just there are things that you cannot cannot do on a fully fully public blockchain so again does that mean you go completely private permission no not necessarily and this may not be a very satisfying answer for most people but I would I would actually argue that we do need to have those kind of levels of detail to understand what makes sense yeah talking about this of course reminds me of the Facebook Libre issue which we'll talk about later but yeah there was a lot of there was a lot of commentary about what type of blockchain it was and how it was different from these other ones and well see there was another initiative on your site that I wanted to ask about which is one that was probably more controversial and really hit the mainstream news like I even saw acquaintances I have from just being a journalist you know other journalists that I know were writing about this and that was the pilot in West Virginia with the votes platform to enable blockchain based voting what were the objections or concerns there and when you guys you know we're vetting that were you aware that it would be so controversial yes I think so there are certain hot topics right I think eroding is definitely a hot topic and I think it's actually going to crescendo into 2020 and believe it or not we are working on a global eva state of global avoding report and so we'll have that out and we're also going to supply that not only free for everyone but also to Congress because we think this is a really important topic and it's not one view catches all things so what I mean by that is what did that particular use case tackle it tackles actually a very narrow subset problem for military overseas who are registered in West Virginia so I don't know the exact stat on how many military there are overseas or how many expats there are but I used to be one of those expats sitting in London and you would mail in your vote whenever there was an election you'd get the mail-in ballot and you would have 15 different things that you have to do to make sure that you know you got it right and then you'd literally mail it in and hope that it got there couldn't we have a better system than that and what the West Virginia use case did by the way they did a pilot before they ended up actually running it in during the midterm elections last year was to work with the military and get that small subset of people who happened to be registered in West Virginia and apply a blockchain pilot that would help them to vote using a blockchain solution again it was done small scale just to see if it would work in the precursor to the actual launch and then once you know any of the kinks were you know smooth out they did implement that during the midterm elections and that was beneficial and easier for the folks who are out there you know serving the country abroad and could then vote with some relative ease now the immediate question to anyone who's been looking at this space at all would be or who cools the data who controls the data what happens to that data did they record the votes and again I think these are very valid and important things to that my understanding is no your vote was not recorded and I don't actually think anyone's vote should ever be recorded as in you voted for the Democrat or the Republican or whoever else was out there I think that would be pretty dangerous for the government to know how you voted in every election personally I think being able to vet that someone is a legitimate voter in that state and verifying that data without giving up all your private information again and over and over again would be a way to actually help simplify the process and secure your ability to vote I think there's a number of different places where blockchain does make sense in the voting process but let's face it there's a number of different things in the voting process that you need to unpack there's an identity piece there's a verification piece then there's the actual voting piece and the there's the post aftermath of the voting record keeping and then the question is at what point does blockchain actually participate is in the entire end-to-end and who controls that who runs that what's the governance around that and again I think we've only scratched the surface an identity plays a role on this huge role yeah I imagine that's actually the number one most important thing so one other thing I mean you've kind of been alluding to this throughout the conversation but I know that you talk frequently with regulators and legislators how would you characterize their views on crypto and and let's let's limit this question first to the US and we'll talk about the rest of the world sure I'm a convert I'll put it that way I used to be pretty negative u.s. relating to anything crypto and that it would change I will have to say in my dealings most recently with Congress certain members of Congress a New York State in particular and New York City and even DFS I will tell you I actually think that we need to step up engagement and we can actually over the next you know year year plus have real movement and the u.s. can lead I'm more bullish now about the USS ability to get its act together as house in order to lead then before and I know for me that's even surprising for me to say that and it was who was changed a couple things I actually think all of us and and I do you know emphasize any of us who've been in the crypto space having gone through crypto winter having a lot of the bad actors just flushed out of the market plus with the crushing amount of you know I have to say lots of people have been advocating and and letting legislators know in pockets that the u.s. is falling behind is finally actually falling upon years that are listening their proteges ttle they may not understand all the nuances around blockchain and the technicalities of it but guess what they get it the u.s. is behind the US has the deepest most pervasive capital markets if it wants to maintain its role in financial markets in the future it needs to get with the program and job creation who doesn't want job creation and leadership in that space so I actually think and also I will think for good or for bad the Libre conversation has accelerated the urgency in the u.s. all right and do you want to make any predictions on how this will affect regulation going forward or any new laws going forward I'm probably going to upset some people by saying this but I will tell you if the u.s. sets the tone especially at the federal level and then there are a couple key states that we need to get an allotment to get in line which is obviously New York California I would even argue Illinois because of Chicago and hft trading and and Washington DC and a few other states you know what Wyoming's already led but if we get this done including IRS the US will set the tone for the rest of the world and I understand Singapore Switzerland UK have done a tremendous job of providing clarity and definition but I'm also pragmatist the US has the deepest global capital markets it has the largest financial wallet share still and when I talk to Asian sorry Asia based entrepreneurs in the crypto space they all want beachheads in the US they're just waiting or they're now starting to tiptoe in so from what my you know my view is is the US will eat and that's going to be very controversial I know people will disagree with me it's all occasionally different yeah what I get it I get it Laura I want it to go on and say something different so here you go I would expect nothing less from you Sondra actually and so so for more on santa's contrarian takes and how she really led the initiative to get bitcoin futures that see me long before anybody else was thinking about this area that we're gonna have to talk about that but first we're gonna have a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan

completely different from what like Fred Wilson of US v is saying and Jeremy lair of circle and there are a lot of people I mean obviously you can look at the kick lawsuit with the SEC I mean there's it's so so it seems like you feel like there's enough of a recognition that the u.s. is falling behind that things are gonna like radically change that they're gonna be leading because right now they're they are quite yeah I would say like laggards maybe and yeah so I'm not telling you it's gonna happen tomorrow it's not I'm not gonna tell you it's going to happen even in a month but I see a momentum change that is different than the last five years and I do actually feel really badly for all of those people who have been knocking on the doors of Congress of you know regulators and basically hitting their heads up against a wall for quite a while yeah and sometimes life is about timing and I'm being very plain speaking here and I know there will be people who family disagree with me and I think that's wonderful disagree with me let's have this discourse because frankly I think that the u.s. is waking up we've got noise around the presidential 2020 elections but I will tell you based on the conversations that I am having with people on the ground who make the laws they are looking for the tweaks in the laws that they can make to create an environment where there is innovation and there are guidelines for crypto and this is where I want to also emphasize to people I say this again and again I feel like the community forgets this legislators write the laws regulators do not regulators oversee and enforce the laws so if you a law change you need to go and speak to the legislators otherwise yes you are then talking to the regulators about oversight and enforcement and I just sometimes feel the people forget this fundamental fact and they rail on regulators on things that they cannot do which is change laws right and so I think we need to have a very sort of frank conversation about what the community needs from the legislators versus what the regulator's are doing and here's the other thing and again I'm going to give you another controversial one which I know people will not be happy about to hear but I actually think their strength in the fragmentation that is the us think about the u.s. regulatory environment I know support is there strengthen this okay wait I'm sorry what do you think yes there strengthen this believe it or not really okay yes okay but we do need to guide this in a way that works for the crypto and blockchain community all right but how is that how can we strengthen that I mean like okay you can even look at a coin base which has I can't even remember the amount it's like some astronomical amount of VC money they've raised and they still don't have licenses in all 50 states yes that is true okay so there are strengths in having different bodies be responsible for different aspects of the financial system and not have it be concentrated in one centralized body in my mind that's no different than a distributed network of bodies who are responsible for different things so for example the SCC being responsible for X FINRA of being responsible for Y and you know IRS you know CFTC etc etc are being responsible for different things that actually in my mind is not a bad thing hold on before you know people start getting really that here's the issue here's the issue what is and where does crypto and digital assets it the problem is it doesn't have a home with one it actually looks like it's got homes with all of them right and there's almost a power play and maybe turf war going on about who controls or who's going to regulate crypto that to me is the problem and frankly I think there probably needs to be an overarching convening body that coordinates with all of these different and I'm being very practical here you're not gonna get the SEC to step off or the CFTC to step off or any of the other agencies to just step off they're not they're not going to they've already staked their ground right in many ways so how do you get this to work on my mind you get this to work by having an overarching convening body who will then coordinate across all of these you know major institutions I'm talking at the federal level here and coordinate this across and have that being the convening body that ultimately works with those agencies allows them the power that they already have in their forgiving jurisdictions but then also the this convenient body is the coordinator to make sure that there are sensible rules around digital assets because let's face it one digital asset versus another how can have different profiles and this is the constant challenge that we have and I know there are people working on token taxonomy and standardization or sorry standards and and definition setting and I think those things are very good and we need that but ultimately digital assets shape shift and that's very uncomfortable for people like all of a sudden it can be a utility and a security and it could actually be payments on money what do you do with that maybe use you embrace it we just have to figure out how to make that work hmm I like what you're saying I I recently had Jake sure Vince key a lawyer who specializes in the crypto space and I did ask him if there should just be one regulator and his answer which I agree with is that it doesn't make sense because it is true that some tokens are securities and others are commodities and so the idea that like you know you just kind of create this other definition because I think this is what Jeremy Allaire has proposed that there just be this other definition for a digital asset and that they're sort of like exempt they have their own laws but you know what Jake was saying well they actually do many of these do fit within one of these categories or another but just having maybe one like as you called it a convening body where the entrepreneurs can talk to you know the same set of people all the time instead of having to kind of explain themselves redundantly maybe with our regulators yeah but we I actually want to go back to just earlier when you were expressing hope about how the laws might change so are you saying that you're seeing this in a bipartisan way because one of the dangers is of course especially with this big presidential election coming up that you could see one party embracing the technology and then the other party just reflexively opposing it but you're not seeing that well we're what we're trying to well first of all in most cases we find that when we present an overall balanced view of blockchain digital assets and cryptocurrencies it's it becomes embraced by in a bipartisan way I know that was not the case when you looked at what was going on with the Libre hearings but but I think also people miss out if they just get very narrow about all the focal points and I know crypto currencies is super important and you know you know I'm a big advocate from early days it's just I feel like if you start with that dialogue you're then shut people down because they already have preconceived notions and it doesn't help you to make the case for other things and in many ways we do the opposite we actually start with use cases that are very human that have a blockchain element and that may or may not have a token element and then we bring in the component pieces which include potentially digital payments and uses of tokens because they represent something physical or something you know that gets used in on the platform and in our in our world it's been more effective and actually absolutely bipartisan building to do it that way and when I mentioned before about health care being a dominant vertical in 2020 I absolutely agree with that and it's what gets politicians interested that education and identity really and to me that's the gateway to have these frank conversations not just railing on them because they're not changing laws to make crypto easier I think we need to articulate and a little bit more of a sophisticated way why this is important to the world to their constituents and ultimately used to be important for them to be focusing on let's face it they're focusing on many other things in the world right and how do we get them to actually focus on this yeah yeah I mean I think you know just thinking about it in a non-emotional non-political way it is it would be strange I feel like if one party said therefore this technology and then another talk parties that they were against the technology just because you know that's like one part one political party saying they're against the Internet and the other ones saying therefore yeah yeah so in that regard like I feel like it's probably not going to happen um but actually just from hearing you talk about this and I I did want to bring out more of your history of creating or being you know one of the people to spearhead the CME Bitcoin futures I just wanted to hear stories from you about like what it was like to try to advocate for Bitcoin among you know I mean I just imagined seeing me you know it's been around forever it must have been a stodgy is probably too strong of a word but just you know it's this very established financial institution it's huge and back then when you were advocating for it I think that's really when Bitcoin had this huge association with Silk Road so what lessons like what was that like and then what lessons did you learn from not that you're using now so I know this is gonna be very frustrating for people who are really you know quick moving and our sprinters but you've got to play the long game always my view is always play the long game so we started really small and we were just researching and I happen to run FX and metals research and product development at the time so I could put cryptocurrency research under my purview as just you know work that we were doing like we were supposed to do which is to look at anything interesting and new even if it didn't fit in a particular bucket we were looking at cryptocurrencies fairly early on we managed to collate or sorry collect lots of different groups around the firm and that's everyone from technology to clearing to operations to legal who are interested in the space and we effectively taught each other and create our own little internal network and once we did that you know I had a couple really good peers who ran different groups in different parts of the firm who could be advocates and we not only educated ourselves but we started educating our board in our leadership and and I'm talking the c-suite and you know fell on deaf ears for a year or two but that's where persistence comes in right if you really believe in something and you think it's interesting you have to keep at it even if no one's paying attention to you and you're not getting any limelight because then for you know unfortunately like you may never get that limelight but if you really believe in something you you have it on record that you've done that work and that you have advocated for it and so we would send research reports or you know occasional assessments around the crypto space and we're like hey we need to look at this a we think this is going to be interesting and disruptive to financial services we need to think about this and finally and I will thank media for this when Wall Street finally started reporting on it asking about it and because we had customers and board members asking that's when we got inquiries about what are we doing in the space and luckily for the firm we had already created a body of knowledge there are very few big firms out there that had already met with like several hundred startups around the world like we'd go to meetups in some of the dodges places you wouldn't believe you know I go to Bern and being like these crypto what do you call it you know underground bars where you own can only pay in crypto and this was like back in I want to say like 2015-16 and you know what corporate was doing that I'd literally be the only corporate person who'd be like in these meetups but I did a lot and it's the way to go and frankly like when etherium was just starting I mean we won't be sitting there in Berlin just be like well this is just like you knew something amazing was happening and you just maybe couldn't put your finger on it but you knew something was really going to like grow and and this is this was borderless and this is going to be huge and look this many years on I can't tell you that I predicted any of this because I didn't but when you have that feeling and you just kind of sit there and you're patient and you just you know do what you can do in your corner you kind of change and you know we started with the Bitcoin pricing products we knew that was the first thing we needed to get out the gate in order for it to even think about the futures that took well over a year for us to really focus on but we had advocates inside the firm you know I have to tell you when you sit in sort of middle to middle senior management you need the person above you and the person above you and the person above you actually advocating as well it otherwise you'd come up with all kinds of roadblocks at a big corporate it's really hard and even then you still come up against roadblocks yeah I was gonna ask you about the pricing products because you guys launched the Vic Wayne real-time index and then the Bitcoin reference rate earlier yeah and so when you did that did you have in mind that you wanted to build Bitcoin futures like off of that that that was kind of yeah yeah I mean look we didn't know that it would happen but we knew that we needed that and here's the other thing and again play the long game we knew that you need at least 12 months of data around any pricing index in order for any of the hedge funds or anyone who's going to look to trade this to have data to do back testing and so you need that lead time and because most firms will need at least some will go with six months but most really need 12 months so again you kind of to map that stuff out and then you know we've been talking to the CFTC on a very sort of I don't want to use the word casual but on a non pushy basis like it was more informational we were like hey let's talk about Bitcoin you guys are looking at this let's talk about that let's do a teaching session so we did a lot of this collaborative work on the ground in DC as well as on the phone and the nature of the relationship obviously it's different because seeing me it's the known item and you know the conversations with regulators are don't get me wrong they're still very tough and at times you know you do want to hit your head up against the wall but the conversations are different because these relationships have been built over years and people know each other and have at least gotten into into a working relationship cadence and therefore if someone brings up hey let's look at this how should we approach this let's take a look at the metrics and the core principles that we need to satisfy what are the problems here you end up having a very sober real conversation around how do you mitigate prices susceptibility to manipulation how do you make sure that you can risk mitigate that because that's one of the key core principles that you have to satisfy for any CFTC derivative product and I think you know it takes time you just can't push it so how long did it take you for you know to get the Bitcoin futures launched like from the time that you proposed it within CM e to the time of launch I think we had the kernel of idea back in what 2000 I want to say late 14 or 15 early 15 and the pricing products came out we announced it at consensus at 2000 may 2016 and then we launched it in December November December 2016 and then with the futures o knowing that the priority index and then by the way I'll let you guys in on something which I'm enough years out where we can talk about this but um I remember I think it was coined as 2017 I was right before I left the firm because I left seeing me in July of 2017 and we'd already you know written the specs and we were going through with a whole bunch of people around what that would look like and potential traders and we're working on with a design of it and then what it would you know how the mechanics would work and how people would get connected because there's a whole host of things that need to happen for this thing to trade and I do remember at one point we we organized a meeting with through to the top I think 10 to 12 trading houses who would do this crypto and you know it's all the lot of the famous names you can think of now in early in the early days who would have traded this potentially and I remember we like convened this meeting and we were like do not tell people because it was during consensus and we're like do not tell people we don't want people gate-crashing this keep this under wraps and I will tell you I was so proud of all of the traders nobody said a word the meeting happened and it was great we went over the specs we talked about the problems of physical versus none you know to cash shuttled US dollar basis risk like it was a very it was a really great conversation it was a very constructive conversation and we got good feedback and I will say I was singularly shocked I was I swore somebody would leak it and no one did mm-hmm I wonder if I know any of those people in any way but I did one at I'm sorry I did appreciate it I mean that anyone can about shut no because we couldn't have got we it could have actually blown up our ability to do this properly you know with the confidence of the CFTC and that's the other thing is that trust is every we need trust right and ultimately this is all built on trust and human trust of each other right as maestra talking about trustless systems yeah but that's the thing they're not trustless its software replacing I know that's my take I'm like why is it's like I agree with a system that enables trust but anyway I completely agree with you on that point so anyway yes but I did want to ask you about this physically settled versus cash settled so as you know we so obviously you see Emmy Bitcoin future our cash-settled meaning that the payout happens in US dollars yeah and so obviously if the Bitcoin price is fluctuating you know depending on when you settle you can end up with a different amount but back and Aris ex are launching physically settled ones where you know if it's a contract for one Bitcoin you get one Bitcoin which is just one Bitcoin so I just wanted to get your opinion on on physically settled for just versus cash settled and maybe yeah saline a little bit about why the seamy ones were cash settled yeah I will tell you it's a very practical problem which is you have in simi for example how is it made of you've got the market infrastructure firms eme it's got the platform you've got clearing members which are attached or connected to CMI's platform you've got brokers right attached and linked to see me play see me platform you also have customers it's very rare that a customer is a customer and then a clearing member and also directly connected so you go through several layers right and imagine you get a new product out there how are you gonna get all of those clearing members to set up custody solutions for digital assets when they don't even know what digital assets are we're talking about in 2015-16 you tell me how you're gonna move all these people to change systems or buy new systems by the way don't even exist and risk manage this stuff and oh by the way they're regulated to to some degree and they're gonna go to their respective like risk management board or committee and get sign-off for something called Bitcoin that nobody really understands or knows about I mean think about the awesome amount of friction you are causing to launch a physically deliverable solution no it was a non-starter in 2015 so the very pragmatic decision you can make then is you get a product out the door that may be imperfect because it does introduce basis risk and I completely agree it does a physically deliverable product is always the best solution if you can get it but in a world where you don't have the infrastructure what's your next best bet well the next best product is $1 settled one because people know how to deal in dollars and they don't have to hold the crypto and they can margin in dollars this is a very practical pragmatic path and that's why we took that path we were hoping that ones that become successful that it would then be the Gateway for physically deliverable to come in mmm yeah at CMU you mean or just in general in the space in general for the market yeah yeah I just hadn't I just had you thick a Chow of letter X on my show and they're in the process of launching physically settled Bitcoin futures but they already have launched options and she was saying that they started this process I actually I since I I don't have the facts right in front of me I don't want to miss the event it was a very long time and she either said that like in a way they probably started too early because they they basically just spent so long educating all the regulators yes so I remember speaking to them way back when when I was at seeing me and we were starting our journey I mean there were one of the companies that we met with and we were like um interesting they want to do Bitcoin options why would you do options before the forwards or futures we thought that was interesting we I'd have to say I respect their tenacity and perseverance and all the work that they've done educating but I will have to say they were extremely early and frankly I'm not sure that I agree with the approach to go with options before forwards or futures but I get it all right so one thing that I wanted to ask you was there are a lot of people who say that block chains without assets you know don't make sense and this we kind of touched on this a little bit earlier but you know obviously when you were at CM e you were very Bitcoin focused so why did you kind of make that shift to kind of embrace more different types of chains instead of just focusing on ones with crypto assets at the centre so two things what's very public to the world about what seme was doing is obviously the Bitcoin futures and as you recall also the Royal Bank gold with the UK government was announced and unfortunately that's been shelved since I left but behind the scenes there were many projects either inflate or under consideration that involved DLT efficiencies and working with our customers clients around efficiencies in the post trade space which obviously still may be happening may or may not be happening can't speak to that but that was not known and we spent a lot of time on the permission blockchain space for quite a while just by the nature of the fact that we were dealing with banks and custodians and other market infrastructure firms now my pivot it was very conscious one where I wanted to focus on blockchain for social impact I still believe in a world where tokens and digital assets are absolutely necessary in a blockchain space can you exist in a world where you just have DLT where there's no token no digital asset I'm probably a little bit more forgiving than others about that yeah I think there probably are a few are they the majority use cases no and I hope not but again my view is it's so yet to be seen we have use cases and different types of block chains evolving every year we're into year ten plus of Bitcoin but yes what bitcoin is done and I really have to think you know all the early pioneers and look at what it's Unleashed already I mean you wouldn't have imagined this 12 years ago unless you were one the ones building it perhaps but all the derivative block chains or DLT or DAGs or non blocked whatever you want whatever you want to say about that it's because of the inspiration of what started first right so in my mind let the best ones win I believe in absolutely a Darwinian markets you know efficiency overtime play meaning it may not be the best technically it will be the best for a given situation or a given group of people and for me what works best for that and solves for x y&z is what should prevail I don't believe that there's one pervasive only we're gonna have a lot of them we have too many right now more being formed every day but eventually a lot will fall away and that doesn't concern me at all so I I want to circle back to regulation because you did bring this up briefly you were recently named to the New York State Legislators digital currency task force and what are what do you intend to do on the task forward what does that house force intend to do and will you be revisiting the bitlicense yep so number one I have I'm one of six on the legislative side that have been appointed there are seven to be appointed by the governor side which will then comprise a 13 total I do not know who the seven are on the other side so we're waiting for that and then we're also waiting for instructions on the exact requirements from of us other than obviously we know we need to have a report done answering the questions that have been delineated but frankly given the choice I would like to have and I've already proposed internally and not been given sign-off but we hope to do this I've asked for us to do a much more public and open communication line with the crypto community around in the form of let's say like town halls or virtual feedback around what we're doing and what people and entrepreneurs need to flourish in New York State in New York City frankly with regards to the bitlicense again I'm a pragmatist and I'm saying this as a person in the crypto space not with any particular agenda or hat I'm just saying that I don't see a world or trying to repeal it is the path forward I think the path forward is actually how do we make this now that exists and it's been around for god knows how many years how do we make it as friction less as possible and also bring down the cost to be properly licensed how can we make it more entrepreneur and user friendly and to me that is a more pragmatic path in terms of helping businesses than saying we're just gonna try to repeal it I don't know actually any politician maybe there was one before if someone can convince them go for it that's great I'm just not gonna fight that battle I'm gonna be more pragmatic about can we make change that helps people who already have the existing bitlicense but also more importantly can there be a more efficient path to those who would like to get one so we're running out of time a little bit but we didn't even get into your history pre CME and I know you worked in financial services for a long time doing structured products for Morgan Stanley and you did also talk about how you know financial inclusion and social impact are kind of some of the big goals that you have right now so I just wanted to ask you you know given your background in financial services when you look at the crypto space and all the different trends like maybe and defy or around you know things like what Facebook's trying to do with Libra or any other initiative frankly like what do you feel like is quite promising particularly from the pure crypto space you know not talking about like voting or whatever that yeah you feel like yet draws on that experience but also a comp accomplishes that goal first of all crypto is like no other group industry have ever encountered in my career in the sense that think about how global borderless we all are as a community I know that people think that crypto is very you know dogmatic and alienating but actually anywhere I go in the world if I meet a group of people who are in the crypto ball space there are some of the most welcoming and wonderful people so I think the culture of what's been developed is amazing but from a very practical nuts and bolts financial point of view I think we have the rise of grassroots focus on reducing social and financial inequalities and I think that's one of the most important things I'm sorry but big finance if they could find a way to make money you know to service the people who are not serviced today and I and I'm not just talking about people who are unbanked I'm talking about people who have very limited access to financial services and I'll throw a couple things out at you because I was just with the World Federation of exchanges and you and I was a bit shocked by this you know in the u.s. you've got double-digit ownership of equities and people own stocks a lot a lot of them mostly in their pension funds or whatnot and it gets kind of managed for them but in the rest of the world its single-digit at best and I think it's actually low single digits I'm in high single digits you'd have to double fact check that I don't know what the exact figure is but you know one of the stock exchanges said how do we help democratize people ownership of stocks and equity because let's face it if you're going to have wealth creation for people who are really needed the most and not just the rich getting richer we've got to figure out how people get access to investments and this is where the system right now just does not work alright well um and do you want to name any kind of particular project that you feel like is is going to help achieve well for inclusion or trend yeah I mean look I said for evil and bad and all the stuff that people rightfully should slam Facebook on if Libre Association itself or some other group like it could have the scale that it does it's bigger than any country in the world you know 2.3 2.7 whatever number billion that you want to use nobody else could have that kind of lasting impact on people who need who have no voice right in terms of financial access if some group can do that and maybe Libre is the answer maybe it's not we'll see we're definitely just for full disclosure you know we are keeping an open mind about Libra association working with them I know Dante personally who's the head of policy in comes he is a genuinely decent good person and so we'll support him because we know who he is and what he's trying to achieve but whether they manage to do the right thing I think we'll have to see but my view also to the community always is just let's keep an open mind because it's trying to solve for a major problem that none of the banks and governments can't seem to solve then it's a incumbent upon us to do it who else is gonna do it all right I will also vouch for Dante he was on the show uh none confirmed and I agree he is he is a wonderful person I will link to that interview in the show notes all right Sandra well where can people learn more about you and GBPC well go to our website GB would seek way sorry GB be council dot org and then also you can follow me on my twitter handle sr london or find me on linkedin great well thanks for coming on Unchained thank you so much Laura and again even watching from the early days of how you grew your podcast I mean you're amazing your tour de force thank you thanks I'm actually and I don't want to forget to tell people that you were on the show I think it was it feels like years ago deals like a decade though it's a probably only up there three years ago when I was at CMA so the opportunity I never got to reveal to people at that time but do you remember that I had to do that show from a closet because gosh that's right you're at your sister's place you went into a broader company yeah yeah long story I meant to reveal it at the time because it was funny and I think I might have a photo of myself in the closet performing the conducting that interview but anyway no now things are respect I'm like much embedded laura is a true pioneer most of the world knows this in the crypto space but honestly alright you are a tremendous voice for the community and just thank you so much for being you know the balanced sensible and also really just what's the word I'm looking for like the light that we need sometimes I mean seriously sunshine your excuse me Sondra here your since your gym that's why I
