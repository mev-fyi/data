intelligence powers anti-money laundering blockchain analytics and threat Intel leading exchanges virtual currency businesses bigs and regulator's themselves you a cipher trace to comply with regulation and to monitor compliance today's guest is lawson baker head of operations and general counsel at token soft disclosure before we get into the show token soft was a previous sponsor of my show welcome lawson hey Laura how are you good glad to have you so there was a lot of regulatory news this week but I wanted to start with one that I know you were particularly following which is the SE C's statement on broker dealers in the crypto space and it was titled joint staff statement on broker dealer custody of digital asset securities so before we get to the statement itself I want to have you explain the backstory behind why this statement that they released matters like what is a broker dealer what do they do in crypto and what specifically were people waiting for it to be resolved regarding this issue sure so just kind of quick disclaimer all of these opinions are mine and not token soft and I'm not giving legal or financial advice but by way of background the security token space is essentially this idea of selling investments to people that are associated with either traditional financial assets or more crypto native assets you know post 2017 when token soft-launched there are a number of people who kind of trended towards we needed to do these sales a token sales to follow securities laws and so that's really what we focused on at token soft and the the market as it trended towards following the securities laws essentially started following rules related to private security sales and selling to credit investors or registering their security and one of the key issues with that is when you're doing a token sale at a security token sale after the tokens are sold who can hold them and in the context of security tokens broker-dealers can hold them if they're approved to hold custody of security token so it's people call that a carry and broker dealer in the space and currently there are a number of broken dealers that are approved to quote hold security securities the sec however has essentially told the vast majority of broker dealers nospace a kind of a side hey you shouldn't be dealing with security tokens until we tell you how to deal with them and so while they may be approved for custody of securities they're kind of like nudging them and saying you probably shouldn't hold security tokens until we approve that and so that's like there's this current class of broker dealers and then there's like this new age class of exchanges or exchanges like coinbase or just trust companies and a whole other group of people who are trying to get approval for brand-new broker dealers and new exchanges that can hold securities on behalf of its users and investors for the past probably two years all of their applications have been in limbo and at the end of 2018 the kind of the word on the street with if you were talking with sec was hey we're gonna release new guidance in the first quarter of 2019 over how to custody security tokens I mean that kind of like helped the market be like okay we're this good let's get some guidance and then we can go forward and then the government was shut down for all of January and it essentially took till June July 8 well over six months of the year to get the first part of this guidance and so what what they did in their in their guidance is more like stating the issues and maybe drawing the lines of where the issues are present so drawn from the drawing the lines perspective they kind of clarified if you're operating an ATS but not actually taking custody of the tokens on the exchange when there's a sale meaning me Lawson halter of pre-ipo stock selling my securities directly to Laura I can use the ATS to help facilitate that sell but I have to send those securities security tokens directly to Laura and so part of the part of that release was kind of clarifying where who is not technically a subject to these type of rules which is not really news so much is just kind of like highlighting what that looks like in the context of security tokens and then and then they really focused on like why do we care about the issues related to custody of security tokens and it really kind of comes down to two things one is how can in the context of a security token the things on the blockchain can how can you prove you actually are the only entity that custody security tokens is the first thing and the second thing is like how do we make sure investors are protected and and those concerns directly relate to how crypto currencies and how tokens on black chains work today with regards to how do broker dealers prove they control security tokens for the same way that like Howard Howard lost and prove he owns his Bitcoin that's a really really kind of an unsolved problem because we what you essentially have is a private keys that can unlock your access to the cryptocurrencies or security tokens you can't prove you're the only person with those private keys you can only prove that you have a like reasonable good process to securely generate this keys or break up those keys where you're the only one with control of it but you can't actually prove that no one else somehow it got access to your private keys so that's kind of this one issue that's frankly unsolved and will only be solved by well well drafted policy procedures and then all of them of it after the fact kind of like anything else you would audit financials or standard operating controls with regards to the second issue is how do you protect investors this really kind of comes down to this concept of like where's the undo button in all of traditional finance both banks and broker dealers there's an undo button if there is a mistake the regulator knows who to tell to fix it and the consumer or investor knows who to say hey you need to fix that and so like what why would you need an undo button with regards to security tokens it's pretty plain and simple security tokens are traditionally for traditional finance assets are associated with off chain assets off chain businesses and as a result is a little bit of a different experiment than the crypto currencies you know censorship resistance is not really a narrative of security tokens security tokens need what I call god mode they need the ability to have undo buttons and so and this idea of the undo button it would address things like if I accidentally said my security took in to the wrong address or they asked the broker dealer accidentally cynthy as security tokens to the wrong address they need to be able to fix that problem for the investor or if I passed away my will says these securities need to go to my girlfriend or my you know my heirs or whoever they need a functional way to transfer those security tokens to somebody else from our perspective it took us off this is a solved problem you know we co-authored I co-authored with this tokus off team ERC 1404 which is essentially a security token standard that that both implements the transfer restrictions associated with security tokens which aren't present on normal cryptocurrencies in addition to giving the security token issuer for unregistered securities or transfer agents for registered securities God Mode if there's a mistake there's a button to fix it essentially and so for the companies that we're kind of waiting in the wings for this guidance do you feel like what was released this week is enough for them to proceed it's kind of know news news the fact that they put it out was nice I think there was some internal conflict for them to be able to put something like this out now that it's out in addition to I think we're gonna talk about later the the reggae first reggae proved with box deck I think we're unfreezing the SEC is unfreezing now I think well I think they must I think probably if you're thinking in the in their mindset first they need to release what we think the issues are and then they're probably going to either follow that up with more direct solutions over like what they expect custodians to do or we'll just start seeing approvals so all of these applications for carry and broker-dealers are going to probably start getting approved so a NOAA number exchange is applied for it the Anchorage that start up in the space applied for it there are a number of startups and exchanges in and even established for the institutions that are asking for permission even if technically they can hold securities I think we'll start to see potentially approval now that we had this this kind of first guidance out alright well we'll see what happens we're gonna discuss locks tacks reggae plus ICO and also the Libra congressional hearings next week but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate

back to my conversation with Lawson Baker of token soft so before we move on to blocks I just have one last question which is when I was reading the SEC statement on broker-dealers there was something about some of the wording where it made me think that this regulation and this is not a thought this is a thought that I've had before as well from reading some of the other guidance we're reading this statement I also you know thought Oh regulation broadly might push the industry further into a sort of peer-to-peer slash non-custodial direction do you agree with that yeah I think that's exactly what the technology allows for you know when you read the release they were talk and in the context of when there are a peer-to-peer type transfers its ie the the broker-dealer is not actually custody in the tokens in between then they're basically saying that's not what this is talking about so if you're at shares post ATS or open finance ATS or any of the other 80 S's which is alternative trading system exchange in the space the unless they're approved for custody that the they can't escrow the transaction so I can't send it first to them before you send the money to them and then they release both sides it just has to go between either a trust company which is not under Sec jurisdiction could do it or it would have to go peer-to-peer I would have to send it directly to you yeah I think I think that's kind of how the markets been operating today without approval Peter appears what's frankly been necessary in most contexts it's pretty safer Punk of the government yeah yeah all right so let's now talk about the big news this week regarding blog stack with this first regulated ICO and at the moment of recording they haven't announced whether or not they sold all the twenty million dollars worth of tokens on sale but they have been tweeting that they kept happening like spin up extra servers and stuff due to demand so what effect do you think that this reggae plus offering by blog stack and now there's another one that's also been approved what do you think that those will what effect do you think those will have on the ICO phenomenon and will we see more crypto projects go this route definitely you know block stacks are a really cool project that I've been following for a few years now and yes they were previously on the show by the way but it was a long time ago I should think two years yeah yeah very cool technology is basically something around this idea of like moving back towards a peer-to-peer version of the internet with like local data and local identity interacting with distributed distributed systems it's very cool project it's unfortunate they're having issues with their sale and their service provider but and I think it really highlights what I would I agree with is this idea that to normal investors want access to some of this technology and these investment opportunities and so you know the current securities laws today don't really allow for that for a knight accredited investor you know Joe plumber to invest in many early-stage projects whether it be early-stage companies or early-stage tokens those normally fall under you know you have to fall under an exemption where you can only sell to credit investors people with a certain amount of income or wealth and what reggae Plus does is essentially say hey hey startup or early-stage crypto project you can sell to a up to a certain dollar amount if it's either 50 million dollars or there's there's also a twenty five million dollar number in one year there's also a cap number over a multi-year period based off your assets and you can sell up to let's call it 50 million dollars to normal consumers that are not accredited investors in in this kind of a mini IPO model it's not a full-blown registration like when when Google or Airbnb or whoever goes public it's it's it's like a it's an in-between exempt security in a full-blown registration in that it has little bit less requirements over how many years of financial statements and audits and in those type of things but allows for you to sell up to in in blocks tax case up to 50 million dollars to consumers directly to consumers in the Reg a requirements you have to you can only invest a certain amount of your income or net wealth I think it's like 10% and so the the the block sac approval is part of this narrative I was going back to earlier with the SEC first gave this guidance and now we just saw our first approval that's kind of related I think that's that goes along with the narrative that we could start seeing a lot more approvals the the rumor last fall was there something around 100 to 150 crypto native reggae projects in some sort of back and forth filing stage trying to get approval for reggae's in the crypto space I don't know how many of those are still around because there's high quality projects and there's not always high quality projects but I know it took us off we've been talking to a lot of people and are ready and can already support reggae offerings and we expect there to be a whole bunch more that are going to go live now that we start seeing the first few kind of come out and then just briefly before we move on to Facebook do you think that the requirements for crypto companies to file a reggae Plus or too onerous because I notice that many believe the CEO of log stack said that blog stacks spent two million dollars on their filing which that's a pretty heavy lift for a project that's just starting out do you think that could stifle innovation yeah I mean the idea of reggae was to frankly cost less than be less of a burden than a full registration and those type of dollar amounts and with a full registration type of costs however the fact of the matter is I think for the good in the bad the Box acts of the world and money had to do a lot of educating of the regulators just like a lot of the broker dealers were trying to get approved I mean he did tell ya he did tell the Wall Street Journal died he has been calling it his block stacks 2 million dollar donation to the crypto industry yeah assessment I think they did a lot of education and I'm ok with that it's it's unfortunate for them I'm glad they are willing to do it not everyone is good at educating and giving analogies and trying to help the regulator understand hey this is how it's similar and this is how it's different and here's how we continents say for that you know we had we spent a lot of time thinking about that it's oaken soft and trying to make sure we account for that and how we design our systems I mean I think believe did a good job you know they got approved and so you know congrats to them yeah and and also just to give people more context I mean they have really big name backers like Union Square Ventures which is you know hugely influential in the space and and yeah it's not like they're 17 I think they raised around 50 million if I remember correctly back then and have and frankly have been on an incredibly lean team I think the last numbers I heard were like 15 or 17 people and so they're not burning money I'll say that they're pointing it towards the right resources presumably until they're ready to deploy it faster all right so let's now turn to what's on the horizon for next week which is the Congressional hearings on Facebook's Libre both the Senate and the house are interested in this what will you be looking for during those hearings yeah so so libros is this everybody who's not aware is Facebook's attempt at putting together a quote distributed or decentralized cryptocurrency it's a little bit of different structure they are looking for a hundred partners to be part of the validation system and and consensus system of the the Libre blockchain and those those partners are essentially they've said we want them to be well known capitalized and should be brands consumers trusts and these these these brands and these companies will help secure the network and secure the funds in addition to they have a I believe it's a Swiss foundation that will hold in it a basket of government fiat currencies and so the Libre token is is quote backed by a basket of US dollars in euros and pounds and maybe the Chinese gee and I forget whose own the entire basket no it's the Japanese yen it is Japanese yen okay yeah so that's the idea it's basically this idea of the crypto currency backed by a basket of assets supported and quote secured by a hundred different entities and so as you're well aware the House Financial Services Committee when they heard the Libra announcement basically said hey hey Facebook you need to get our approval or talk to us first before you do that and their concerns are a number of concerns if I'm against a male most of them are probably a little bit of like overflow from just Facebook concerns so things like privacy in too much control and how big and how much can Facebook influence and I think as we saw in the prior elections people believe there was influence that occurred on Facebook with the elections and so the question is do they want potential new type of money to be influenced by Facebook or things that happen on Facebook in addition to Facebook's got a lot of consumer data and so they're very concerned with like peoples should people's financial lives be is associated or attached to their financial lives is that something go ahead given this context like what do you think the likelihood is that the regulators will keep Libre from happening you know can they keep it from happening I think the social pressure is probably more it will have more of effect than what from a regulatory standard structure of how they can do it the question is do they think they have enough social pressure to allow them to do that so you know I'm I'm I'm Pro the Libre project because I'm Pro attention on cryptocurrencies I believe the Libre project is like similar to stable coins and there's probably a little bit different of experiment than things like Bitcoin and truly crypto native assets that aren't associated with off chain assets or opportunities so I think attention on the space is okay and is good yeah I mean one thing is yeah I just feel like the timing for Facebook to do this it's like the you know their kind of popularity at least in the halls of government is probably at somewhat of an all-time low and so in that regard it just feels like oh yeah okay so maybe Libre might be a good project but you know is this the right time but what everything that I noticed this week was the former governor of the People's Bank of China suggested that China should do its own version of Libre do you think that specter of like a digital yuan will pressure the US or I guess other non Chinese regulators to allow Libre to go through yeah that's a good point Mason the CEO and one of the cofounders of toga cough wrote an open letter to the head of the Financial Services Committee in the house that basically said hey we understand your concerns and we also understand your concerns that like should these type of projects be banked in swish foundations and part of Mason's call was like hey you should open the doors to the u.s. to cryptocurrency projects like Libre like block stack you know giving clarity around things like aetherium and Bitcoin because if you don't other countries will compete and so you know part of the you know there's a number of narratives of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and these type of things and one of them is competition when you make money when you make money software you're gonna have a whole lot of competition with the best software and you know beyond software you then have like social influence and so a hundred percent and governments can and will make cryptocurrencies if the u.s. is not awake and paying attention to that then they will they're gonna they're gonna lose it's as simple as that that being said you know that being said I think there's this this this whole other narrative of cryptocurrencies in this idea of separation of money from state and that's what bitcoin is doing in a very similar way to separation religion of state Bitcoin is trying to separate money from state the question is should corporations also be separated from money you know that's that's for the the community in the world to decide but these are the narratives that are fighting right now alright well we will see how it plays out it's been great having you on the show thanks for coming on on
