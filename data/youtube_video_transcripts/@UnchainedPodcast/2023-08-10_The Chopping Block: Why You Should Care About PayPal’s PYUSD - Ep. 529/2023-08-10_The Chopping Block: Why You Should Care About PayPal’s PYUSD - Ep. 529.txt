not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry Insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first you got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and the Czar of superstate then we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and finally I received the head height man at dragonfly the we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block.xyz for more disclosures so you might notice uh something a little bit different about us today uh turns out that we are now officially sponsored by Red Bull in fact we are still sponsored by Red Bull that they sent us uh when you tell us what what we got in exchange for this incredible absolutely very official sponsorship so I believe what happened is uh me as the always drinking Red Bull on the show uh speaker had lamented the fact that you know I drink so much red bull but then talk about all the time and I'm not sponsored and someone listening to this here show happen to be working at Red Bull or actually very close to someone who's working at Red Bull and marketing and sent over a little care package of uh you know four cases of 32 cans of Red Bull which you know had had there not been conferences I was traveling would have been kind of finished by now but close but the uh you know in in exchange for that of course we wanted to show our school spirit and school colors that's right I believe that that retails at Costco for about 40 bucks but we're we it's a bull Mar it's sorry it's not a bull market it's a bear Market in crypto we have no under here that's right we got it's a red bull market at this point so we're doing everything we can Red Bull if there's more where that came from we're ready for it RB is a set of two letters that is blowing up both in crypto and in extreme sports between roll bit and Red Bull crypto is just filled with with lots of these these Arby's that's not Financial advice as a show we sell out immediately so if there's any more if there's any more Red Bull swag you can send us we will go even harder than this and in fact the number one thing I think that means that you've made it as a a podcast or streaming site that loves Red Bull is the Red Bull fridge so yes so we've seen that there are certain streamers who are like twitch streamers who get this like branded Red Bull fridge this is our bid to try to get a branded Red Bull fridge so Red Bull if you're if you're watching if anybody at the Red Bull corporate something or other if you know somebody in Red Bull send them this and let them know that we are we are ready to sell out even more if we can get a Red Bull fridge you just ship it to tarun Brooklyn New York it'll arrive at tarun just write that just write that tarun Brooklyn New York and it'll show up everyone everyone knows her own So Perfect all right well that's enough for me my head is gonna get sweaty wearing this yeah yeah until we get the fridge we're we're not gonna go the full show with The Branding but if we get the fridge we're going entire show with Red Bull branding I I also loved on Twitter somebody said that uh tarun was the first um what was it the first intellectual athlete sponsored by Red Bull which I thought was very that was very fitting I thought that was very fitting I think it might be it might be the first math that's surprising I would I would I would bet they already did that I somehow somewhere they'd sponsor anything like have you guys ever seen the fluke talk which is a sport that I feel like they made up it's where you make a like what is a wooden plane that can't fly and you push it off a ramp over some water and it's like how far can you make this like thing that like can't Glide um I mean some of them are hilarious like people get pushed off in the entire thing disintegrates as they're in it and then they fall into the water [Music] yes oh I thought it was just like one of these oh my God all right that's intense oh I see okay got it got it all right well uh I don't know if we're ready for that I think about extreme as we get is like sitting with wearing merchandise but if that's attractive to your Red Bull we are we're ready for it okay so let's do a quick recap uh last week we talked about all the craziness that was going on with the CRV attack uh I think we were lamenting the state of smart contract security and talking about what this means and and how D5 is potentially going to recover from it well it's been about a week since the CRV hack took place and there's some there's some updates so one is mysteriously uh the exploiter of the CRV bug is we now know a little bit more about them because they turned out to return a little bit of the money so the story here is that one of the pools that was hacked was from a protocol called alchemics and alchemics they are uh what is it uh self-repaying loans self repaying loans that's what it was I remember it was very very popular kind of D5 2.0 project back in the in the last cycle um so they had some kind of uh you know stable to stable pair and that got hacked because of this old Viper vulnerability so the attacker ended up sending back all of the ale that was hacked and they sent a message to at the same time that they sent this uh this money back and this message was about 12.7 million including the eth and the ale that was returned and uh the message they send was the following I saw some ridiculous views so I want to clarify that I'm refunding you not because you can find me it's because I don't want to ruin your project maybe it's a lot of money for people like you but not for me I'm smarter than all of you [ __ ] that's what I said I I don't know what you guys thought of this uh it sounded just the way that he was talking like very Russian or something I feel like it's a very Russian way to talk of like you guys are idiots and then an expletive you're projecting am I protecting am I projecting I can't read any nationality from that statement the only thing I can read is like a personality disorder and I've met people like this in crypto where they just you know think that they are the smartest person on the internet because they can exploit a contract guest is actually not yeah not ethnicity or ego but under 22. I would I would be willing to bet like three to one three to one odds like 17. it's definitely solo it's not it's not organized if you're sending messages like this after a hack but it did feel to me just like the way it was written that this is clearly not a native English speaker maybe I'm being racist the other weird part was um if the funds were not returned to curve they returned them to the alchemics like wallet Alchemy style so it's not like the curve LPS everyone's getting refunded it's like alchemics you go figure it out I like you you're cool everyone else gets gets [ __ ] oh that's an interesting angle I didn't think about that okay but I assume alchemics will return it to the curve users that it was taken from yes yes so they're like you go figure it out but it's like almost like I don't like curve is you don't have the responsibility anymore like you know I'll go because the only one I love and everyone else you know sucks and like you know they just pieced out it was very uh strange yes because he didn't return funds to any other of the hack protocols so there and there were a few others so yeah maybe this is like alchemics is cool I like D5 2.0 I don't like curve I don't know strange uh so so the another side of that was that so curve actually put a bounty on the recovery of these funds so the curve basically announced that if you return these funds within a week we are going to give you a 10 bounty on all of the hack funds you know there's something on the order of 60 million total that was hacked uh and so you know six million dollars no chump change for for an attack of the sort um but of course those funds were not returned in in whole to uh to curve and so curve at the same time as they announced that hey we're going to give you this kind of bug Bounty window that if you return you know all things are off we're not going to pursue you they said if we don't get the funds returned within a week then automatically we are going to place a bounty on basically figuring out who you are so doxing uh whoever the attacker is so that doxing Bounty is now live so it's about 1.85 million dollars for the doxing of the hacker and or of you know successfully achieving a conviction on the hacker so now the race is on I don't know if there are crypto bounty hunters out there who are capable of unmasking this guy only thing I find kind of funny about this is some of the people who are extremely vitriolic against Arkham for docs to earn which arguably is not that different than this uh are really promoting this and I'm just like I don't know like pick a thought if you're gonna be like you know don't do docs to earn then like you can't kind like I get that this is more morally you know less dubious than generic doc Stern but I did think it was kind of funny to watch like people's sides flip for this particular case because we talked about argument episode what's your take on Dr earned generally in terms of like a normative stance do you think docs aren't generally fine generally not fine special circumstances okay I I mean I totally get it for this security reasons um and I I you know I don't hold anything against people doing it I just wouldn't want to be participating as a bounty so there's a difference between like do you view the someone else doing it anyone doing it as acceptable versus do you view yourself doing it as acceptable I think I'm much more in the camp of like hey look for the security stuff fine it makes a lot of sense for someone to do it but I do think like the generic thing can get unwieldy but I do think the people who were very vitriolic against it were very anti-vitriolic here and being like bounty hunt this person and catch them like in a way that was kind of like well maybe the Arkham people proved something about you to yourself you know um Robert do you have a view on this question yeah I mean we had the Arkham episode two weeks ago three weeks ago I I you know what they're trying to do is get law enforcement information to find a hacker that stole funds from the users you know I think in this case in general like they're free to use capitalism to what I think is creating more public good in the aggregate at the detriment of one individual who acted maliciously to steal the funds so I think in this case especially you know with the wild west of crypto it's going to be more effective than them not doing this penalty and solving the problem yeah Tom what's your take yeah I mean I think it's kind of like a proof of Innocence versus proof of guilt kind of thing right like at this point we know that the person hacked the protocol so you can rightfully place a battery on his head versus like you know requiring everyone to uh prove who they are if you know even if they maybe have not done anything wrong or it's purely for some other self-motivated reasons why you might want to know what an address is and so there's a little bit of that component to to it too but I think you used to learn more kind of about the forensics that they're using to identify something because I feel like there has been a pretty high success rate with boxing addresses in the past um and some of it is is obvious right it's like somebody off boards through like a exchange and I was like well exchange has your kyc so it's like obviously that's not going to work but some of them feel a lot more nuanced and so I don't know what's going on in the back end and I think there was a um there's like the nice seal 9-1-1 uh telegram channel that got announced this week of uh sort of a collection of white hats where you can uh report that you're uh exchange has been hacked or your protocol has been hacked but um I'd be curious to learn more because of what the recovery process looks like and what they're doing Beyond sort of the most vanilla stuff yeah it just seem like most of the time they are triangulating with uh exchanges and this is one of those places where it really is kind of a improvised set of rules right there there isn't you know these exchanges are acting internationally there is really no binding constraint that forces them to cooperate um they just do because there is a certain moral Authority when a big important D5 protocol gets hacked and everybody comes together and is like hey now's not the time to be kind of stopping and asking is this okay to do this or not let's just like go roll up our sleeves and help so I think it does feel quite different than just a generic like Arkham I mean the problem with something like Arkham is that you can really kind of use it for anything you can use it to Blackmail people you can use it to threaten people you can basically be like hey do this or I'm going to go put your name on Arkham and you know try to dox you and you know blah blah blah I think there's there's obvious room for harm in the same way that like in a in a prediction market like obviously prediction markets can do a lot of great things you put an assassination Market together and also all of a sudden capitalism can have really nefarious side effects on individual people and so I think it's wise to have some you know I don't know again I haven't spent that much time thinking about ARCA maybe they've already thought about all this and they're like yeah we take down we have some kind of moderation committee or something that takes down requests that seem to be malicious but it's hard to tell in principle right of like hey here's an address tell me who it is but but this case is one that's very clear and I think one thing you see over and over again is that pretty much everybody in crypto whether they're in exchange whether they're a stable coin issuer or you know whatever like they will all rally around you know [ __ ] the hackers and this is this is one of the most obvious cases where this whoever this hacker is is clearly kind of a Loose Cannon and um people I think will will be very quick to try to bring them to justice if they can the upside of this whole story is that uh it seems like now the worst is over we were talking a lot last week about uh some of the side effects and some of the um the collateral damage so to speak Downstream of of curve like in Ave and in frax at this point the CRV price has recovered significantly it's now back at 60 cents I think it hit a bottom of something like 40 cents so it's up more or less 50 from the bottom um you know all the loans that Michael igorov has outstanding are pretty safe uh with respect to their collateral ratios and the TV Allen curve has also been recovering so it's up to something like 2.5 billion from a low of 1.5 billion so it seems like it's more or less over although you know we it's always possible for something something something to happen again to trigger these fears uh tarun you you were spending a lot of time kind of making um recommendations to some of these protocols now that the dust is cleared is there something that you feel like needs to change in D5 like is there a kind of broader lesson behind the lesson or sort of a metal lesson that we need to learn from this Beyond just okay you know Viper compiler bugs blah blah yeah I mean I think there's there's a lot of lessons that are kind of have to be learned about doing some of these things in a decentralized world in the same way that you know the bug bounties are a little bit unstructured I think the responses are unstructured um I don't think there's like a immediate set of things to say right now like we spent some time writing a postmortem and just posted it actually a little bit before the show um and I think one important piece to understand is you know every D5 mechanism has some amount of flexibility to to either the users or to the community at large that control it I'm understanding the limits of those and knowing what which protocols have which limits and which protocols don't have other limits or is very important and I think oftentimes users or voters and Dows don't quite pay attention to those details and so then they're like you know maybe you don't necessarily view certain things as as risky as they should but I think hopefully over time that changes I think there's there was certainly a lot of things where particular protocols were like hey we completely solved this in all situations and that's it's not life is not so simple there's always some trade-offs that you make in these designs and I think as long as the community is marching towards just greater understanding amongst all Market participants uh in a way that's easy for them to understand over time I think this will get better but yeah there's not like some like hey here's the god solution that solves everything type of answer if that's what you're you're kind of hinting at is is there not something around just hey having a single borrower like thinking about a single borrower uh I feel like that that was a lot of the story was that like one dude basically had what like a third of all the outstanding CRV Supply and he was like 40 percent 40 yeah is that not the story that feels like a big part of the story that should be the story that I mean there's there's certainly that part of the story but you know there's also a lawsuit around that 40 so you know I guess maybe you should just follow the lawsuit and you'll find answers but I I would say the the bigger thing is just more like one thing and this is probably true in all lending institutions not just in defy people are reticent to remove customers that earn them money and you know removing assets removing things is very hard for a community sometimes because they have sort of either a Sentimental attachment to it either uh like hey it's actually generating it's a position that technically generated a lot or generates all the revenue and again I'm not just saying this is a D5 thing this is true in in centralized land too like look at JP Morgan paying these like huge fines for Lending to Epstein right like arches like like my point is like it's not it's not something that's it's just that I think people in D5 maybe some of the participants might be newer or hadn't quite thought through some of these Hazard issues and you know even when presented with some of that information kind of didn't you know versus like well this is you know our best customer or whatever so I I it it's a quite nuanced thing uh I'm definitely not trying to to to say like hey like XYZ [ __ ] up and this causes wise cause W I'm just trying to work I feel like you're being you're being uncharacteristically diplomatic about this whole situation like I feel like if I feel like normally I would hear you like swearing and talking a bunch of [ __ ] and like just kind of throwing your weight around and I can I can feel you tiptoeing through this political landscape that you're that it seems like you're in the middle of so anyway that's just a comment I know that you I know that you're I know that you you've got a bunch of enforces maybe let me let me ask Robert we didn't hear from you last week obviously the interesting thing was compound was the One Lending Market that did not have this problem what's your take on the takeaways maybe what tarun can't say you know my takeaway is you know and I'll use the archangos analogy there shouldn't be a situation in which one person has 40 of a token and is borrowing up to pretty much the maximum capacity against 40 of the asset whether it's a token or a stock you know in the traditional markets whatever like there's so many examples of some entity that gets like in horrible trouble because they borrow against a massive massive massive position and it creates this reflexivity for the asset in general like icon Enterprises recently was in trouble because like he was borrowing against like his entire stock all of all of the Hindenburg research shorts have actually just basically been yeah this is a public equities around the world that where one person owns like a crazy amount of it and is levered to the hilt against that asset this is this is fundamentally unsound practice and like I don't know how any system allows it frankly and I think there needs to be more thought that goes into designing systems where you can't just borrow against 40 of the supply of an asset whether it's icon or you know any other stock targeted by Hindenburg or whether it's curve like there needs to be more checks put in place and like you might view them as a good customer but it's a good customer until it goes horrifically wrong and so first off nobody should own 40 of a crypto asset second of all even if they somehow do like no protocol should allow some of the bar against the entire stack let me let me ask there are a couple different ways to try to parse uh what you're describing there so one is the problem that there was 40 of the supply of CRV that was being barred against period or was the problem that that 40 was owned by a single person whose actions were going to all be basically correlated well instead of being a bunch of different borrowers great question if it was a hundred different borrowers borrowed against 40 of the supply of CRV they would all have different liquidation thresholds they would all have different preferences they would all have different vacation schedules they wouldn't all be functioning at the same type of risk that diversification actually will create some safety and like it's not 40 of the supply that would be at risk if it was spread across 100 borrowers it might be like five percent okay and when it's concentrated in one person what you see is you see Market participants hunting them like people on Twitter were joking around about this but like very seriously you know there were Market actors that were trying to liquidate eager right they were doing so because one of his positions on fraxland used an interest rate model that was honestly frankly quite interesting uh but also dangerously led to people trying to hunt his position by Max borrowing against curve in fraxland to juice the interest rate model now unlike most protocols where the interest rate models are like some chart that's a function of utilizational frax lend this particular interest rate model was like a PID controller type model where as a function of utilization over time the interest rates could go parabolic and so on this Market the interest rate to borrowing this curve was going parabolic went from like 15 to like 75 percent over a day or so and it was projected to keep on increasing parabolically to the point that Michael would have been unable the finances position he would have been liquidated and there would have been this crazy potential Cascade risk if there was a Liquidation on one market because it could have just triggered like a global decrease in the price and so what wound up happening was he had to essentially start selling and unwinding his position starting with fraxland because that was the subset of the overall position that was most at risk and so this really only happens when opposition is so large and concentrated in one person like if it was split up amongst many people who cares if one of them would have gotten liquidated it wouldn't matter but if it's one Uber whale with 40 of the supply you're jeopardizing the whole asset so here's the the tricky thing though so I I agree with you and that makes perfect sense that you don't want the entire supply of an asset moving in lockstep in crypto in defy where we actually we don't know you know if igorov had a hundred addresses there's no way in principle for compound or Ave or fraxland to be able to tell that oh this is all the same guy right so how do you control that risk in D5 and in C5 it's straightforward because you know you could ask the beneficial owners you figure out okay even if you have some SPV I'm like okay I know this is really you um how how do you prevent that nd5 well the easiest way is for an individual protocol to cap or limit its exposure to any one asset like at a contract level so like a great example is I think the current version of Ave allows this I think the current version of compound allows us where you can say oh the protocol is only willing to accept 15 million of CRV or like some amount that's safe enough that even if things went horrifically wrong the protocol could shrug it off that's the easiest way to like avoid made the majority of the downside risk but the other way to do it is like you know you could basically but I guess that's the easiest way to go about it there's more complex Solutions but I think the easiest is just limiting exposure to one specific asset especially if you know it's not incredibly liquid I mean another point is like how you know correlated or the liquidation prices for all the positions right there's kind of no difference between a hundred borrowers at exactly the same liquidation price and one borrower I mean gas fine Mev also goes up so but like roughly speaking they should be roughly the same and so how distributed or liquidation prices how is the you know volume liquidity adjusted at each of those price levels you know this is the type of stuff that we spent on time analyzing and so like I I it is it is there are ways to do it you know unfortunately some of the early versions of protocols didn't have caps and so that's kind of one of the reasons we got into this position but I think you know in general people are obviously hopefully learning a lot from this I think you know like I said I think community members in general probably hopefully have you know this this is their hopefully archangos moment and they understand that it's definitely a very teachable moment it's one of those times where I think people are able to actually learn a lesson when they see how kind of close to the brink everything came in D5 so I'm hopeful and I think I think I'm very positive that people are going to learn from this there was another interesting experiment in defy that just took place this week which was with maker Dao so makerdale uh their stable coin is called die there's this yield that die pays out called the die savings rate the idea is that if you lock up your die into this vehicle call it which is the die savings rate uh you can earn a yield just by just passively sitting on your die um there's a few other kind of cute things like chai which basically allows you to tokenize uh die that's sitting in the die savings rate but basically the die savings rate for the last however long has not been very popular because the amount of yield that the die savings rate was paying was very low I believe it was like but one percent or sub one percent for a while and they recently started jacking up that rate so that rate the treasuries obviously now are north of five percent the die savings rate was up to what was it like two to three percent it's like 3.3 and then recently they started jacking it out they went up to eight percent um about like a week ago or a few days ago and that's kind of what uh caused this entire sort of uh situation now I guess with the DSR Yeah so basically there's this uh there's this thing called the enhanced die savings rate the edsr and edsr is this experiment to what happens if we jack up the interest rate on die to eight percent uh now that is a that's that's a that's a rate that's sort of at the margin as more people start depositing and very quickly you had I think over half a billion dollars of diamond did uh so they could capture the yield in the in the edsr um that yield has come down significantly now it's uh I think closer to five percent um as opposed to eight but the my understanding of this experiment was it was it was a way to kind of see if we offer more yield to borrowers what is the elasticity of demand such that you know how much more Capital are we going to get into the protocol and more diamond and potentially more liquidity created for our sample coin uh just by offering you know a relatively small amount of yield that we don't have to pay for a super long period of time uh and so I think this is in a way die uh maker now kind of experimenting and trying to model out what happens if we start offering one element of the end game plan for maker dial which is this in a big master plan that involves potential yield farming uh if we start offering additional yield or juicing the die yield uh what's going to happen to the dye Supply and how can we model that out and it seems like maker is sort of poking and trying to see what happens if we do this and if we do if we do this we want to make sure that we're being intelligent about how much we're spending on on the yield and attracting more deposits and trying to make a play at becoming this super stable Point let's say any thoughts on what Maker's doing here well I think if they really want to go for it they should just you know take anchors 18 interest rate and start there because eight percent I mean yeah that's not going to get you the 40 billion dollars of stable coins well the difference is that anchor guaranteed 18 regardless of utilization which is completely insane a maker was only offering this for the marginal dollar and as more people came in the yield went down slightly facetious yes but but just to be clear for the audience because I think a lot of people would hear that be like oh [ __ ] yeah it is it is very true that one thing I've realized being encrypted for the last five years is there are still lots of people I talk to who don't know the difference between usdc dye and UST and they're all just like oh they're all stable coins all bad all good there's no like there's no Nuance to like splitting the splitting them into good basket bad basket um so yeah it is it is kind of funny I think the idea of doing these elasticity experiments is interesting although I think this one was kind of obvious that it was going to be dominated by large players because the the key metric is the spread between borrowing against your die versus sort of minting you die so the idea is like hey look if I can borrow die and pay three percent but then I can earn and then I can use that to create new die and earn eight percent there's a five percent spread and I can recursively do that a bunch of times I think the end games goals are were not necessarily to like reward the largest holders but of course just structurally such incentives generally tend to to be harder to capture for the smaller users so it's interesting to see they're already like kind of changing and you know we'll see what the the outcome of this experiment is yeah it feels kind of like a wash like um basically the amount of dye in circulation went up by almost exactly the amount of incremental dye that was added to the DSR so it was definitely like turn inside of these whales who come in see this carry trade where you can borrow a diet three four percent uh you know deposit it and then or eight percent and like you can just leave it it's I think the idea is not wrong right it's sort of like um you know a bank offering like an instructory rate that obviously it goes way after a period of time but it's not really having the intended outcome of like actually introducing um you know meaningful incremental demand for for dye um and and sort of people actually being able to treat this like a you know like a savings account in some way yeah it does appear like the financialization of dye is mostly going to appeal to Smart Traders we're going to arbit away pretty quick that said it it did I don't know if this was the intended effect but it did get a lot of eyeballs with the headlines of oh my God dye is offering eight percent I don't know if that's good or bad because I think for most people it's pretty obvious that that's a negative interest rate margin for die I mean for some people they might be like oh man maybe I should start paying more attention to the maker navigator system I think for some people it's like oh God I guess we've been learning lessons from 2021 so I I'm a little bit mixed about like whether even just like the headline of you know whether or not it's a short-lived experiment the headline of die is offering eight percent now on uh on in the DSR is actually good or bad net for defy yeah I I agree I think a lot of people have PTSD to like uh Tara and an anchor and every time you say stable client or any yield related to a stable coin uh the the kind of uh flashback to that um I think like like the DSR is also I think kind of strange like like die you know the end goal is right you want this to be an actual currency that is accepted that people use that they save in that they you know engage in Commerce in um and that's really only possible if it's liquid people actually use it and it's it's out in the world and there's there's demand for it yeah with the DSR yeah they have chai which is sort of this like um wrapper on top of the DSR that creates a tokenized version of your deposit but the die in the DSR like isn't out there in the world right like if all the die we're in the DSR it wouldn't really be a very good stable coin because it would just be locked in this contract and not really tradable and if you sort of split between chai and die then they're not really you know liquid either and so I I understand sort of the incentive but I think from a from a product perspective it's just not super usable like it doesn't have the right ergonomics for what I think uh uh maker is trying to trying to do with it it seems like the DSR is it's kind of like the um the risk-free rate or something in defy where if the DSR increases it kind of forces interest rates everywhere to follow in lockstep so it is I mean it's not literally risk-free for obvious reasons I mean it's tied to a particular D5 protocol um but it seems to have that effect in some way on the yields in across D5 and it's interesting because I haven't thought about this very much so I'm curious Robert arroon if you how you think about this but you're to Tom's point if you raise if you raise the rates of the DSR right they're basically kind of incentivizes people to create die but then kind of lock it up so essentially just like lock up ether or lock up you know whatever they're minting die with usdc whatever um and just have it sit there and do nothing whereas if you just instead lowered the interest rate on vaults you kind of have the same effect but you increase the the circulating die instead of increasing the amount of collateral that's just sitting there doing nothing so why would you want to increase the DSR and not just lower the interest rate on vaults well I think you could like I think at the end of the day what they're creating is a system in which you know interest passes from those who are borrowing to those who own the asset and it really should be the same roughly to increase the interest rate that you're paying or lower the interest rate that you're charging to get to the same equilibrium supply and demand Dynamics uh roughly but I think in this case like because the savings rate was so low it just makes more sense to start on that side one tiny thing to note in that regard is uh interest rates are strictly positive numbers and so they're sort of uh going down has slightly higher you could think of as higher weight than going up if you have equip probable ups and downs partially this comes from the fact that sort of like the geometric mean is less than the arithmetic mean but maybe that's too much of the In The Weeds on this but the idea is like when I'm looking at things that are ratios and I can only go to zero like zero is a point of infinity and Infinity's like I'm always a finite distance from zero but I'm always an infinite distance from the maximum possible rate so I'm sort of like biased uh and so that sort of means that your lever going down which is sort of the The Collection rate is like less effective than the increase rate in some way it's like less elastic uh which is why you might see the experiment behave better by doing you know increase the interest rate paid by 10 versus decrease the borrow cost by ten percent it's it's unfortunately this like tiny there is some tiny bias to those two but the technical detail yeah this is this um Monet Supply who's uh involved in maker governance which talks about some times of like you know there's sort of this mental model of how we think Maker Works here we think D5 works of Market is very efficient capital is very fluid uh people move to um you know normalize rates across different venues in practice like people it's actually not that um elastic when you when you actually adjust interest rates like a lot of people still stick around they don't even realize that the rates are moving like there's there's a lot of lag and it's not quite as responsive as you would imagine it would be in like a truly sort of efficient optimal market so um maybe some some evidence to Children's point but we just need more AIS involved in this process who are making all these decisions for us instead of human beings well I hear I hear the AI hype has taken a summer vacation a little bit is that right at least that's what's open the the API and Views numbers seem to suggest okay well let's let's say on the stable coin subject for just one more story so the big story this week that a lot of people are talking about is the new launch of a stablecoin by PayPal so this stable coin is called pyusd Pi USD which somebody might become something called python USD so this is a stable coin that's issued by paxos much like busd binance's stablecoin uh paxus you might remember kind of took a beating last year or earlier this year I think I guess earlier this year uh for their involvement with binance um but they're they're back at it uh so they're they're launching this stable coin they're it's gonna be uh primarily I get it seems like it's going to be primarily used by PayPal itself I haven't seen any exchange listings yet for pyusd or any other distribution Partners um the fees on pyusd look to be pretty high so if you're if you're buying pyusd or swapping through it on PayPal itself uh you pay 1.5 percent on a swap that's north of a thousand dollars which is pretty rough that that's like you know that's coinbase fees basically it's like a pretty pretty aggressive uh fee schedule but I apparently that's like par for the course for PayPal they they seem to charge pretty high fees for consumers I've seen mixed reactions to the story I think some people are like oh look this proves that you know web 2 companies obviously PayPal is the largest fintech as far as I know I think it's still worth like 70 billion dollars uh by market cap so it's a very significant company PayPal doing this is a Vindication that hey you know the traditional fintechs see the importance of crypto they see the importance of stable coins and they take this industry very seriously at Tom can you pull up a a chart of the of the coin itself and we can see some of the numbers on wait is it actually live I thought it was just announced well I know the toe I know that token has been deployed yeah the content a contract that solidity that solidity developers have enjoyed vlogging yeah so there's been a lot of uh there's been a lot of smack talking on Twitter about the particulars of the contract apparently the contract was written in solidity 0.4.2 I believe okay which is a very old version 29 000. uh 26 mil also only has six decimals which people were annoyed about it doesn't make it ergonomic with uh usdc you know yeah yeah I no no I I actually generally am like all right who cares like it's not like these stable claim contracts are like pushing the engineering limit of any programming language they're always like the most boring contracts you could look at so who cares that they're not that great you know okay so there's 27 million tokens right now PayPal usds one nine folders though yes 25 million that's probably PayPal themselves no yes yeah Treasury and then a bunch of uh 25 million has got to be PayPal on behalf of everybody else yeah and the rest is like 20 bucks 16 bucks these must be like tests so right now it seems like only paxos and PayPal themselves I say we challenge ourselves to play a game live on the air where we predict the total minted supply of PayPal USD on December 31st and the winner gets the case of lifetime supply of Red Bull yeah yeah a lifetime's five friends uh all right all right pal is listening and the PayPal is willing to fund this endeavor because I promise it will only bring you great success to your future staplecoin I agree okay in order to do this that we have to do it blind so does everyone have like a piece of paper that they can write their guess on okay everybody type it into the private chat okay on the count of three okay good okay hold up hold up hold up all right um okay three two one okay I'm gonna read off the I'm gonna read off the guesses not from very bullish from highest to lowest okay has guessed that PayPal USD will end 2023 at 499 million Tom has guessed 250 million 100 million and Robert 70 million okay I guess we'll check back at the end of the year uh viewers make a note in case we forget is that we have we have a lifetime of Red Bull Supply that we gotta Supply uh if uh for to whoever wins whoever's close um whoever's close whoever's closest whoever's close yeah okay interesting are we doing are we doing geometric mean or are we doing no okay I'll leave that for Terraria all right okay interesting all right why so why do you guys think it will be so low I guess Robert you you had the lowest estimate why do you think it'll be 70 million I don't think there's enough incentive for people to pay the one and a half percent fee to get PayPal USD to take it into token form to use it it's like it's not like they're gonna be like you know incentivizing some curved pool and like creating some crazy yields on like PayPal USD like so frankly I think it's going to be really low because I don't think by year end there's gonna be that many use cases on chain or reasons to hold it and so people like experiment with it but like no one's gonna be like dropping the big bucks into like PayPal USD my logic is just more of that the only announced use case they had is that PayPal and venmo will both have wallets and you can transfer between PayPal and venmo Via Pi USD I didn't see any other use cases but again I I could have missed something from the announcement that use case I'm sure that they will fill with some amount of money as like their normal business process instead of them doing it via bank account so do it via USC and they'll maybe waive the fee for themselves effectively because they're paying themselves I just can't imagine that they'll do a huge amount of volume and like I don't know what I was trying to guess what the volume of that is by end of year that and that was my guess yeah it's very fair just a point of clarification on the fees so so far the understanding is it's for going from any crypto to Pi USD it's it's 1.5 but there's no fee obviously on dollars because then you just kind of create this weird Gap and spread and so it's similar to coinbase in that regard right if you just go through the coinbase app you're paying like two percent or something crazy but it's free to Mint and redeem you know usdc I think um every issue was just I agree with everyone else there's like not really an incentive to use this thing um and I think overall like crypto has not been a huge winner for PayPal um I pulled their 10K from last year and they listed their uh AUM at 600 mil for their crypto products so overall like very small and I you know scaling off of that I I don't really know where they incredible demand is going to come from from a new stable coin that doesn't really seem to have any any benefits yeah I mean I I largely agree I mean we all pick small numbers right nobody picked a big number not you crypto terms so far yeah I do have the biggest guess of 499 million I was hoping somebody's gonna pick 500 and I was gonna yeah exactly but unfortunately I ended up just a very very large number um and so I think uh that why did I choose this number honestly like even really crappy stable coins have managed to achieve reasonably large numbers in crypto because I don't know why like they just happened they just do and it's like hard and ex-anti to think of the reasons I don't think this will be on finance which might be my reason for why I don't think I'll get a thing maybe maybe not maybe not I mean was gusd listed on binance um was I mean obviously true USD was in Gemini land though right like yeah yeah that's yield farming like they also they also paid people to Mint it in the early days by selling it right discount to all the OTC desks and trying to like jump start I just don't say PayPal doing any of that type of stuff like it's just hard maybe maybe maybe maybe they won't maybe they won't but I think for PayPal I think they find this business line clearly more palatable especially in this market environment than crypto itself right I don't think PayPal was ever gonna go hard on crypto quad crypto but I can absolutely see PayPal going hard on stable coins because they see the market they see that this Market is big they see circle is getting a lot of revenue from sitting on all that USD Supply and I think that when it comes to uh targeting Enterprises as opposed to targeting um you know consumers per se I can imagine them having a lot more success not a lot more success but I can imagine making a dent in what circle is going after which is like trying to get corporate treasuries and other things to like use their stable point so I think there's a story there 500 million is not a success story in uh single coin land right 500 million is a tiny tiny stable coin by by most measures but it is what happens when a really large very I mean to be clear like PayPal is three and a half times as valuable as coinbase it is a massive massive company so if they want to really you know like grab the shovel and make a move they could well we're going to see who gets that case of Red Bull and how sweet it will be a lifetime supply I the irony the irony though is that like the utility of the three of you combined for this is like infinitely lower than mine for a lifetime supply I was the one saying lifetime supply I don't even know how you measure a lifetime supply like 30 years used to be in like those commercials in the 90s it was like technically this is 30 years or something I saw the movie you guys recommended to me or TV show Pepsi wears my jet about yeah like I I bet you there's some court case on this lifetime supply things because no one ever says it anymore I feel like that it's true like until sometime the mid-2000s and then it like disappeared and I I kind of feel like someone like actually went after someone for not giving them their real lifetime supply how much would a lifetime supply of PayPal USD be [Laughter] um okay I'm looking up on Reddit apparently it says the lifetime supplies are turned by the rules set by the company different companies do different things all right so here's what we'll do we'll find a commercial from the 90s that specifies a lifetime supply of a drink and that's what we'll use to adjudicate this event so we'll do a lifetime supply according to 90s rules of Red Bull also receivable also receivable in dollars or in paper no not in dollars not receivable in PayPal USD payable and PayPal USD or in Red Bull those are that's why PayPal that's why PayPal has to pay for this because they're getting minters for how much we've been showing uh PayPal minting I don't think we're showing it I think we are giving an honest analysis and critique that's true so actually my question is like okay let's maybe zoom out a little bit if we look at like the most successful non-exchange public company that sells crypto it's like probably block I guess Square yeah because of like so one question I've always wondered is like why have why has PayPal or other fintech players like in general like I know a bunch of them left like revolut just left the US market and stuff but what why hasn't anyone been able to like beat block at the Bitcoin sales is it really just because Jack of Jack's marketing I can't be that well okay okay hash app ux for buying Bitcoin is really quite simple and like I know a lot of normies that are like yes it's easy to buy Bitcoin using cash app and like that's it that's like it's easy to buy Bitcoin using cash app but but is it's just as easy now using venmo and PayPal right like they added all the same features yeah people actually use cash app as their Bank like if you're young like you that you just keep cash in there a lot of that person rapping about cash app PayPal PayPal Red Bull rappers two r's the two r's of success for you yeah I'm looking at the uh defilement list of stable coins and there are some very strange ones towards the bottom bring up the page what do you got yeah okay come on we gotta get something we gotta we gotta get this on video we gotta see unstablecoins.com six thousand dollars outstanding wait is that this real Sello dollar s I think the data is wrong here it's Gotta Be yeah I was like wow there's no way there's no way there's 160 000 outstanding yeah I don't know why this data is wrong but 0.88 dollars neutrino ooh I remember neutrino oh yeah that's foreign I want to know how many of these are off Peg spice USD 28 cents meme dollar point zero two cents when do you de-list a stable coin as like not a stable coin before you go up we we still have another way of having a bit of gambling slash guessing which is each person has to guess what rank the first coin that is over their number is right so like say like the 50th say the third it's the first coin was was 71 million this is too hard I guess fine I guess that 70 million is stablecoin number nine I think 15. I would guess 500 million is six five five I guess five I'm gonna go six Dom six for 250 yeah all right let's scroll down all right let's check it let's check it let's check it uh I was close Okay no you're eighth so if PayPal dollars eighth then I'm right they just have to be above Paxton that does not seem hard to be like that same as Pax dollar or Gemini dollar that seems very doable that seems very doable I think I'm gonna win this also guys I think I think one I think it's time to call it I think I think I kind of got this a lot if you guys want to buy out I will I will accept uh partial payments I don't even think you guys want the prize only I want them it's cash settleable whoever wins can sell it to tarun who's willing to pay the highest price okay okay oh wait wait one thing we forgot to talk about I remember the first time the PayPal stablecoin news came out maybe 2021 wasn't it supposed to be on like another chain not ethereum or was it supposed to be in ethereum always sorry I thought it was supposed to be on an L2 and they made the switch to ethereum okay I think maybe not L2 um I was reading this story as well I forget where they were supposed to be yeah something changed in the so now I read this announcement I was like something's odd but I can't figure out exactly oh it was supposed to be on Solana was it okay I think so yeah yeah I thought I read it was originally supposed to be on Solana and after the fall of FTX they pivoted interesting but I'm literally remembering the Tweet yeah so you thought one is a weird choice if you want a mainstream stable coin but um doesn't seem like a weird Choice people going retail heavy yeah prior to FTX right so much usdc was on sale on it it's not that's yeah but I mean somebody on Twitter made this point like you you meant something on ethereum L1 it's going to find its way everywhere you know if people actually are using it they can move it on Arbitron they can move it on I think that wasn't as true in 2020 like mid 2022 because everyone got very afraid of bridges like it there was like a bit of reflexivity to that so yeah okay well I think we've uh successfully Gone full d-gen on the show we now have a have a bet I'm gonna do a bit of research on what 90s uh lifetime supply rules are and I memorialize exactly what the content of the bet is this week on Twitter well we should just get a football to agree to give us what they Define as a lifetime supply totally totally but assuming they don't do that assuming they don't do that then we're gonna have to we're gonna have to settle it ourselves okay that's right that's right uh so for now we'll check back in next week that's it thanks everyone [Music]
