hey guys this is a personal note from me I was in a documentary that I think might be of interest to you all it's called crypto Pia Bitcoin blockchain Zin the future of the Internet and it was finally released after the cinema world tour was cancelled due to kovat 19 joined the award-winning filmmaker Torsten hoffman who made bitcoin the end of money as we know it in 2014 as he dives deep into the crypto ecosystem and blockchain technology and discovers the good the bad and the ugly of this movement and the people behind it can we really trust them to build this trust list cyber utopia or are there projects just as unfairly distributed and easily manipulated as our current financial systems and tech platforms crypto Pia film was filmed on four continents over two years and features many of the big brains and big egos of this controversial industry including Andreas Antonopoulos myself flourishing wences Casares charlie leaf italic veteran previous already dr. Robert Kahn Roger ver Sampson MO and many others be sure to check it out at wwq topia film comm again that's wwq topia film comm hi everyone looking to unconfirmed the podcaster reveals how the marquee names and crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines and gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon I am your host Laura Shin in response to the challenging times crypto TOCOM is waiving the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases download the crypto dot-com wrap today today's guest is dan Moorhead CEO of Pantera capital welcome Dan Laura thanks for having me back your April 30th newsletter was a sobering read it went into detail about the economic impact of the coronavirus in' talked about some of these big macroeconomic trends you said that you thought it was clear that this recession wouldn't be v-shaped and Kathy would of Arc invest actually came on Unchained recently and said she thought it would be so why do you think we won't see a v-shaped wrist recovery these shaper recessions and recoveries happen when there's some kind of exogenous shock and everything returns to normal right after it and we've seen that with either massive natural disasters or September 11th where everything stopped for a very short period of time and then life as a resumed you know very quickly thereafter and in this case we have this physical and invisible barrier to commerce which were still trying to contain and and fight and that is going to probably persist for you know quite some time and it prohibits people from going out and doing the usual commerce that they would typically do and so I can't unfortunately don't see it bouncing quickly back and then secondly that virus is created essentially a psychological dimension to this and so even if a panel of experts said you know this thing is contained and gave everyone the thumbs up go back out and resume your life as normal I think it's going to take a while for people to get the confidence to wanna you know getting a crowded airplane or go into a movie theater and then you know one of the silver linings of this is you know people may have learned new positive attributes to life and they'll realize hey maybe I really just don't need to travel for these business meetings I and I can do in a monsoon or you know maybe I don't need to you know consume as much as I used to consume because actually it's nice just kind of hanging out with the kids and you know so there I think it's going to be a very slow bounce-back and we even saw in the 2008 nine recession it took three years to achieve the same level of absolute GDP as before the recession and I think this one unfortunately it's going to be somewhat similar and so you mentioned also in the newsletter that you expect that recovery will resemble an L so what does that look like in practice like what businesses do you think will be able to open or you know won't be affected as much like what will people be doing like how do you expect things to look kind of maybe your or two out yes other things we've profiled in our letter is the dynamics of school and with so many with basically almost I think there's one school in rural California that's open right now but with the other 5,000 schools the United States closed all those kids are at home and so parents you know responsible for their children and according to the BLS 40% of American families have a child under 18 at home so you know almost half of American families have a youngster at home and then the surprising thing is even when both parents work even when in married households 64 percent both parents work so that there's no kind of flexibility there and 93 percent of men with kids under 18 are in the workforce and even 72 percent of women are in the workforce so it doesn't it basically it means everybody with a kid is in the workforce and so it's gonna be very difficult to restart the economy before you restart the schools and you know that's one of the impediments there's several like that so I think with the psychological impacts and were these kind of practical impacts that it's hard for parents to get back to work if the schools and daycare centers aren't open yet it's gonna mean a very slow recovery coming out of this how do you think the government's response in terms of monetary and fiscal policy will affect the recovery yes so this is a global exam every country is trying their own mix of policies and so you're seeing some countries like before the show we were chatting about Korea which has done an amazing job containing the virus and essentially eliminating new cases and then there's you know 200 other different policy mixes out there I'm citizen the US and I work in the US so I know the most about the US and in the u.s. the policy mix is much more centered on fiscal stimulus and that impacts my job as a crypto currency trader because as you create you know enormous amounts of you know new paper money it essentially devalues the a paper money relative to fixed asset things like gold or stocks or or cryptocurrency and the scale really is such an extent that I don't have adjectives for it the deficit in the United States is about twelve and a half percent of GDP of fiscal stimulus on top of what was already a very large structural deficit and so firms like JP Morgan are forecasting the deficit for this year will be nineteen point five percent and you know everyone out there you know trying to throw adjectives like unprecedent or whatever it's really hard to get your head around that to my mind the easiest way to get a sense of how staggering it is is that deficit is larger than the widest deficits during the Great Depression and it's even larger than the average deficits the u.s. incurred fighting World War two so you know these really staggering size two deficits you lived and traded in Japan in the early 1990s as they entered what became their lost decade and you wrote in your newsletter I've watched with professional fascination as the Bank of Japan invented QE deserve or z IRP and buying equities with printed money lots of interesting stories and a few current thoughts but TLDR not a pretty picture for their currency and then he wrote hashtag buy bitcoin can you elaborate on on what you saw there and what you think that means for today yeah i think it's a great example they have led the rest of the developed world into what is now ubiquitous quantitative easing that essentially printing now unlimited amounts of money the zero interest rate policy that they enacted in 1990 and then they went on to start trying to prop up their equity market they had a price keeping operation as what they called it I still actually don't know what the policy goal of fixing equity prices is supposed to do for the whole citizenry obviously it's great for shareholders but if the US you know follows down that or other developed countries follow down that path I really think it you know has lots of policy implications and you could you know talk about the fact that in the United States there's three Americans that have more wealth than half of Americans combined so you know the distribution of wealth is very inequitable and so you there's all kinds of very interesting policy questions about whether it's a correct objective to set equity prices as a policy objective but if you do do that the impact it has on my world as a currency trader is it takes trillions of dollars to do that and that has already had its effect we've seen that with the US stock market is now up on where it was May 31st of last year so this massive inflow of money is supporting equities but it also has to support other fixed quantity things like gold or Bitcoin or other crypto currencies and what we saw in the japan case in their in their currency specifically is as they keep printing more and more Japanese yen the value of each one of those young relative to other things like other countries currencies has to do you know debase or be devalue and the graph that we put in our Investor letter shows the price of the Japanese yen adjusted for inflation and weighted against all of their trading partners so it's kind of a single price of the end going down from 140 units on an index down to about 75 and so you know they lost almost 50% of the value of their currency over that time period Wow so obviously I can see how you know that would fuel your buy bitcoin hashtag but one other thing ice on your March newsletter is um you at that time said that you thought tokens would outperform venture and I was curious why did you think that and then how has that thesis borne out sure so when we wrote our investor letter in like kind of week after the the crisis started in mid-march we've made a short-term forecast that tokens would outperform venture and that as has it actually happened and we think it will probably continue for the next few months and and the reason being tokens have the unique characteristic amongst all software protocols and having a real time price feed that's sometimes a really good thing sometimes a bad thing that everyone focuses on the price of Bitcoin at the price of eath or the price of XRP when you know they really are multi-decade projects and maybe we shouldn't obsess about the short-term movements but we do have that and so they reset very quickly on March 12th cryptocurrencies went down you know almost 50% and then so you get an instantaneous price reset whereas Ventures is kind of asynchronous that you have a whole bunch of sellers of venture the developers or entrepreneurs or building companies who don't reset in their valuations as quickly as the buyers and so when you have a crisis like this you essentially get a period where very few transactions actually happen and it's it's very analogous to the residential housing market that when you have a bubble in housing and the bubble pops and the buyers bids all go you know say down 20 or 30 percent you basically have a period of several months while the sellers are kind of getting their heads around the new lower prices and so you have a very low transaction amount for a couple of months and then everything resets and gets going and we think that's basically happening in venture that with the financial markets in turmoil prices will probably reset much lower but it's going to take 2 or 3 or 4 months for that all to kind of work its way through the system in a moment we'll further dive in a crypto during the time of coronavirus but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible in response to the challenging times crypto comm is introducing three measures to help the community first the 3.5% credit card fee for all crypto purchases will be waived for the next three months second you can now get up to ten percent back by using the MCO Visa card on food and grocery shopping lastly you could buy gift cards on the crypto comm F from merchants like Whole Foods Safeway Burger King and more and get 20% back on food and 10% back on groceries download the crypto comm app today back to my conversation wits and Moorhead there was a time when it was thought that crypto assets were an uncorrelated asset but obviously as we saw on March 12th now dubbed Black Thursday they seemed no that seemed no longer to be the case so do you think that since then crypto has been uncorrelated or has it been correlated and why do you think that at least on that day it was correlated well that's a it's a super important question and one of our main arguments for advocating crypto as a new and important asset class is that it does have essentially zero and this the important adjectives long term correlation with all other asset classes historical correlation between Bitcoin and equities gold commodities bonds is 0.08 so you know very very close to zero the important caveat though is in times of very stress risk aversion markets Bitcoin does become correlated and there have been five examples of this since Bitcoin was first traded where the SPS had a very large down move and Bitcoin has been correlated for a short period of time and that's the key here according to our analysis it's averaged in 31 days where it's been highly correlated and then over a period of 70 days that correlation kind of tapers back down to essentially zero and then after that they start to trade independently and that is that was our view in our March investor letter and that's that's still our view that Bitcoin was highly correlated for about a month and that's true it's correlation was about 0.8 over the last over the first 30 days after march 12th but that that correlation will slowly dissipate and it's supposed to happen over 71 days on average and that's actually happening right now we're almost at that period and so we can see a regime going forward where Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not very well correlated with us Pete and you're actually seeing that now Bitcoin is up 23% year-to-date and the equity markets are still way down and all the other asset classes like oil or you know getting crushed so bitcoin is decoupling from the SP and then we think over the next couple years you could see an environment where Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies go up a ton and you know maybe equities go down over the next couple years and during your answer just now you were occasionally singling out Bitcoin and I wondered if Bitcoin in particular has behaved differently even from the broader crypto market and you know I was curious to know what your view was on that and how the rest of the crypto market would perform yet that as well as a very important distinction Bitcoin has typically performed better in crises than the rest of the market and the measure of bitcoins market share called Bitcoin dominance has on average gone up seven point eight percentage points in a crisis so in those five big SP crises before Bitcoin dominance has gone up and that typically has lasted an average of four months and then it kind of dissipates again and we believe that's going to be a smaller impact this time that for a handful of reasons but we think Bitcoin will go up and it started this crisis about sixty two point five percent Bitcoin dominance and it's now around 68% so it has gone up five point five percent and it'll prob n about two months since the crisis really started it might persist for another month or two and then at that point we think the essentially non Bitcoin tokens will start regaining market share so in our own trading we did overweight Bitcoin in the middle of March and we still hold that position but we are certainly very conscious that at some point the next month or two we're gonna reverse that and there is an even in Paris important event that everybody's looking forward to which is the halving next week what do you expect to happen both kind of like in the you know immediately after the having as well as further into the future yeah it's a fun one you know everyone gets super excited about it and then the having in 2012 and 16 everybody got got really excited and and in those cases they were right it caused a huge change in the markets and so you can have people that say theoretically if efficient markets theory holds and we all know this is gonna happen and we've known this having is gonna happen for 10 years because bitcoins money supply is fixed and known it should all be priced into the market but there's this great line attributed warren buffett that goes against that dogma saying that the markets are almost always efficient but the difference between almost and always is worth 80 billion to me and that's my view is that some things that we all know are going to happen still do actually impact the markets and in this case i think it's really easy to visualize how this would happen all the money supply bitcoin is issued to the miners who provide the security and transaction processing and they sell all their bitcoins to buy faster chips and more electricity and more Rackspace right so they're in this constant arms race to keep growing and and so every Bitcoin that comes in they sell if that number which is the supply of bitcoins gets cut in half and demand is constant if we go back to our econ 101 it's going to drive the price up and that has actually happened and you know what the past doesn't guarantee the future so I'm you know we only have two data points so with that caveat the past two having's have had a really large impact on the price but it's diminishing and I think it will diminish again this time and we we published some interesting stats and our Investor later work in the previous two having's the market for Bitcoin bottoms on average 459 days before the halving so year and a bit before the halving and then it kind of ground up into the halving and that's done at this time the market bottomed about a year and a bit ago 514 days exactly ago and the markets up 168 % cent it bottomed as we come into this having and that's roughly in line with the past having's the interesting bit though is what happens after that having and in the previous to the markets exploded to the upside after the halving and we put a new type of analysis where we're analyzing the stock to flow ratio in Bitcoin in our letter and I think it actually explains a lot of what happened in the past and might give us some insight what's going to happen in the future and the all the data is in our letter but just to the the summary is in the first having we were going from 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes to 25 and at the time we didn't really have that many bitcoins outstanding so it was a really big impact there were only 10 million bitcoins outstanding at the time and we were cutting the supply over the next 446 days which is the typical period of the rally by over one point six million bitcoins so that was over 15% of the outstanding supply was being you know reduced or cut in the halving so the market exploded up in the second having in 2016 obviously we're only cutting half as many out because that's the whole point of a halving so we're only cutting out twelve and a half bitcoins every ten minutes and at the time we had fifteen million bitcoins outstanding so there's 50% more bitcoins and 50% less being cut so it impacted the outstanding supply by only five percent so it was one third of the the impact and and then this having of course is half as big as the last one and now we have 18 million bitcoins so there's even more outstanding bitcoins in it so it'll only be a 2.2 percent impact on the supply of bitcoins and those ratios actually match the ratios in the rallies the first rally was 3.2 times bigger than the second one and so if all this holds and again you know obviously this huge caveats on whether the past does predict the future but if those relationships hold the rally here would be about 40 percent as big as the previous one in 2016 and that would imply Bitcoin going to 105 $10,000 per Bitcoin and I recognize that sounds absolutely ludicrous to most people today but our first price estimate of 5,000 pound elude occurs when we're at 65 and I think it's all I'm saying is it's way more than a 50/50 chance that Bitcoin goes up over the next year and a half well yeah I mean that is a huge number and yet at the same time the graph when you look at this kind of stock to flow ratio and then also map it on to the history it is true that that it does seem to fit at least you know broadly roughly so who knows what we'll see what happens so one other thing I want to ask about was you also did mention in your newsletter that venture investing in crypto during the crisis or well I just want to ask you how has that been affected during this crisis so it'll be fast and see how it plays out we're only you know seven weeks into this I would think the number of transactions and go down very steeply so there's a lot of investors that are pulling back and not you know wanting to invest until you know essentially all the dust settles and I see where it is we're actually much more kind of constructive or engaged and so we've done four transactions since the crisis began a couple directly with companies we're going to announce one tomorrow and then we are also adding to positions we already have in the secondary market from you know early investors that need some liquidity for you know other reasons and we have featured a table in our Investor letter from Cambridge Associates one of the largest advisors in the space in the endowment space that confirms the intuition that venture investing after a crisis is actually the very best time and it goes through the ten years of venture prior to the last crisis so 1999 to 2008 those had an average IRR of 6.28 and then the years directly after the crisis the ones that could buy assets at much cheaper is those are the ones that had very high teens and sometimes 20 plus IRS and the average return of the post-crisis vintages was eighteen point two one and I think that's gonna repeat itself within venture generally but then you know we're obviously only interests in the blockchain sector and so we're very excited about investing in venture now because we think prices will be cheaper and returns will be higher over the next four or five years an Alaska question before we go stable coins have seen a lot of growth during this crisis but how would you say that business model will do with interest rates at or near zero yeah so stable coins really have finally come into their own and you know we follow our portfolio company circles stable coin US DC and that increased sixty percent after the crisis began so the outstanding issuance of US DC's exploded because people want to use it either to store their wealth or to have a very instantaneous transactional currency and I think their usage will really grow throughout this because if you if you think back to the last crisis you know would you rather have your savings in the Lehman Brothers of 2020 or token you control which is fully backed by US Treasuries and I think more people will realize that a stable coin backed by US Treasuries is going to be way more safe than you know any kind of levered you know finance firm the business models such as it is for things like Libra or US DC is to retain essentially the float off of the government debt securities that they own and I'm a firm believer that the zero interest rate policy is going to be with us for you know at least a long time if not forever and so it will reduce the income basically of these stable coin projects that doesn't make him any you know less likely to happen they're certainly going to happen because they have a ton of utility but the companies that sponsor these stable coin projects will probably earn less revenue alright well we'll see how this all plays out and I have to say after listening to you I definitely would say this probably does sound bullish for Bitcoin but it sounds like also we'll have to wait at least I don't know what do you think 18 months before we'll know oh I really you know I've been fascinated by this for nine years I this is the time right over the next two years I think we're really going to see blockchain prove itself so for all of us that have been in a community like you and for all these years I'm really excited we're really going to see this stuff play out over the next couple years alright great well I hope the listeners stick around for the ride thank you so much for coming on the show it's been great having you on unconfirmed Laura thanks so much hey everyone it's time for your favorite crypto news recap a head of the Bitcoin having there was a lot of Bitcoin news first up hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones buys Bitcoin futures billionaire hedge fund investor Paul Tudor Jones published a macro Outlook newsletter about the coronavirus and what he calls the great monetary inflation GMI and he defines it as quote an unprecedented expansion of every form of money unlike anything the developed world has ever seen in the newsletter he writes about how while wondering which assets would become more prominent due to the great monetary inflation he thought of Bitcoin quote it falls into the category of a store of value and it has the added bonus of being semi transactional in nature the average Bitcoin transaction takes around 60 minutes to complete which makes it near money it must compete with other stores of values such as financial assets goals and fiat currency and less liquid ones such as art precious stones and land the question facing every investor is what will be the winner in ten years time at the end of the day the best profit maximizing strategy is to own the fastest horse just own the best performer and not get when to an intellectual side that might leave you weeping in the performance dust because you thought you were smarter than the market if I am forced to forecast my bet is it will be Bitcoin there you have it if you are King for a bullish sign going into the having this isn't a bad one and for all you Bitcoin nerds out there in his newsletter he even quoted Satoshi Nakamoto next headline Bitcoin volume on squares cash app explodes in q1 2020 someone in facts a lot of people a lot of whom I'm betting aren't billionaires got the memo before Paul Tudor Jones the block reports that Square saw three hundred and six million dollars in Bitcoin revenue in the first quarter of 2020 earning seven million dollars in gross profit that's a near doubling of the gross profit from q4 2019 and an increase of three hundred and sixty-seven percent from a year prior during an investor call in March CFO Amrita Ahuja said quote adoption and engagement of fractional equity investing in Bitcoin has accelerated in recent weeks given recent market interest and volatility next headline how hash rate derivatives could help miners coin metrics introduced when it is calling the coin metrics Bitcoin hash rate index CMB I and another metric called observed work these stats could serve quote as the foundational pieces of financial products that can provide markets with the required tools to effectively and efficiently trade and/or hedge bitcoins hash rate these tools could be important in helping Bitcoin miners hedge their risk the hash rate index is designed keeping in mind that first in the short term the hash rate can be gamed second that hash rate tends to follow an oscillating pattern so the outcome of a trade could depend on whether it is settled at the top or bottom of an oscillation and third that the rate at which the contract closed might not account for what happened over a long longer time period such as whether the hash rate was 20% higher during the term of a contract as opposed to when it opened or closed for observed work they used two figures the 48-hour implied hash rate level multiplied by the time taken to the most recent block from these from these two tools coin metrics

their case the coin metrics team invites financial service providers who might want to build financial products on these tools to contact them we will see if anyone bites next headline but most bit next research on aetherium 2.0 exceptionally complicated so you guys I tried reading this detailed report on aetherium 2.0 after I interviewed cz and also conducted my next unchained interview both on in the same morning and what I can tell you is that you need a fresh and focused mind to be able to absorb the highly complex beast that is etherium 2.0 and if your brain is already fried it's not really gonna work so I couldn't do it despite thanks to us pit mixes thorough report but their conclusion is a good TL DR first they say that the eath price could go up if a lot of eath gets locked in the beacon chain which is this is phase zero which is probably gonna be launching in july then they say quote however the real question is whether aetherium 2.0 will drive long-term value and for that supply does not only need to be restricted there needs to be sustainable demand so I'm sure some of you are thinking well I don't care about the price I just want to know if it very impulsive and to that question bit Mex research says quote in writing this report there is one thing that stands out to us above everything else a theory of 2.0 is exceptionally complicated with so many committees shards and voting types it seemed as reasonably likely that something will go wrong and that there will be significant further delays however despite all these potential issues aetherium 2.0 is still probably worth a try if this does succeed that potential rewards are considerable next headline Libra gets its first chief executive Stuart Levey has been named the first chief executive officer of
