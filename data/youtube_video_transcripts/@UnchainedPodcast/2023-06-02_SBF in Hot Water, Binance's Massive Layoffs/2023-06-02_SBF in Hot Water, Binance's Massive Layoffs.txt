before selling off the remaining tokens time for fun bits everybody's been saying that the US government is trying to kill crypto listen to Jenny from Unchained who has some thoughts on whether it's actually a secret recently I've seen what feels like hundreds of tweets and articles about the US government's secret war on crypto which definitely makes me question the definition of the word secret and it's Democrats fault apparently Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has warned that the Biden Administration has it out for crypto and he is going to get the troops to go fight it just as soon as he has conquered Mickey Mouse at least that's what people say he says I I couldn't hear I only heard static Elon Musk also thinks that crypto could crash if Democrats keep power and I trust him because he is the world expert on platforms that crash they're not the only ones who think that crypto will die if Biden is re-elected which I think is kind of optimistic you really think crypto is going to make it to 2025. I also think that people with this concern are maybe giving the government too much credit you really think they know how to kill crypto just the other day Dianne Feinstein asked if Bitcoin was a very small coin also not to State the obvious but if crypto is capable of getting killed by the government then it totally failed at its purpose Unchained is produced by Laura Shin with help from Kevin Fuchs Matt pilchard me Zach Seward wadaranovic Sam sriram Genie Hogan Jeff Benson Leandro Camino Pam majumdar Shashank and Margaret Korea thanks so much for listening foreign
