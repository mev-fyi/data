beefy welcome to a new world of crypto friendly banking with cross riverbank request your fiat on off ramp solution now at crossriver.com crypto today's guest is andre tarnovsky founder of chat roulette welcome andre hello for people who haven't read my book it may come as a surprise that andre has any involvement in crypto at all but a quick heads up for listeners who are worried about spoilers we won't give away too much that's in the book for those of you who have read it and want to discuss the parts that involve andre i will be doing book clubs where you can discuss the book with other people who've read it so nobody has to worry about spoilers so andre before we discuss crypto why don't you tell us your background how did you come to found chat roulette i was a typical geek like many kids playing with computers but it was a pure chance that i put something together that went viral many projects tried to do the same but they're not succeeding because it's a bit like lottery and i was just on the receiving end of that lock so made the website went viral uh got a lot of attention from people from society from them from mass media from from the venture capital that was 12 years ago during the course of development developing this project i kind of run into similar problems that many digital entrepreneurs are experiencing running into such as working with people kind of one of the issues with when you work with people is that because like it's such a strong monopoly you are always you're very dependent on them and you're in for instance if they ask you something and they don't like the answer you have no recourse and they might lock your account and it's kind of funny how private companies can have such a power that you actually beg them to bank you and that's actually a pattern which i frequently experience that actually people want banks to bank them like they they're begging and the banks say no that's like completely twisted logic right it's not like free market that's actually what i see that people want and then there is two types of people i mean one is of course where it's the banks are running after them and then there is one where they are trying to get a bank that will open the bank account and i mean that's only the case for russians today uh but it's in general was always the case for anybody who wanted to do international uh well maybe not always the case but at least in the last 10 years it was always a challenge to try to get the banks to explain like why is this like russian kid wants to open a business bank account here uh wait so even even with the popularity of chat roulette they they didn't even even even with the popularity of chatter led because people in the bank they don't always google you know i mean they for them it's you know it's just like bureaucrats uh if you run into somebody you know who knows chatroulette then it's easier if somebody doesn't then you get the full uh array of questioning so you couldn't add paypal to chat roulette or no i could i could but i just saw all this bureaucracy and etc it's a bit known story the 87 website called paypal sucks.com where people learn people are complaining that paypal frees their account blocked their account you know it never happened to me anyway so it's it's it's all like this uh digital payments it's just uh you know every aspect of it is so messed up again as i saw it as a merchant i think that's like the angle that public doesn't know because the public sees it from the perspective of the end user and they maybe and users actually don't really see the whole value of crypto but the but the merchant side the merchant side is paying for the fees he has to deal with this middleman and i mean nobody likes middlemen you know so i think it's kind of natural instinct when you see crypto but you have a lot less dependencies and i mean one of the reasons for being an entrepreneur in the first place is to be free right to not be a wage slave and then if you're if you made it but then you're still kind of uh you're still accountable to a private company or like a bunch of private companies it's a bit like a shadow justice system right because the companies get to decide and it doesn't go through like proper due process so i don't know if i fully understand so you were able to add paypal to chat rooms but you you acted as if you couldn't or something i i i was but i just know how difficult it is and how tense tense it is to to accept payments and they are always very touchy about it you know and they ask a lot of questions and you never know that if it will work tomorrow you know that's kind of the thing and one other thing i wanted to ask you about was i mean you were just a teenager so i don't know i'm assuming maybe you know you you didn't come from a wealthy background but after you create a chat roulette i imagine that your life changed and on that score so can you just talk a little bit about that yeah uh for sure i mean uh that was something i mean uh yes definitely came from from like a normal family maybe uh on the upper end of normal because my parents were working in university and that's well that's i mean makes a big difference of course in terms of how you grow up but in terms of finances well i i was actually i was feeling like a bit like rich kid but i mean what means rich in russia is different and what means rich here like you know i still had to do like then all the other kids like save up two years for for for a new phone and just all these typical things you know and i was living in the same exactly the same like typical like a comic blog apartment i mean again i maybe my classmates had like uh a computer uh that was 10 year old i had five-year-old computer you know it's like i had the latest video video card you know they had one before or like you know things like that but actually i was i was the first one who had a computer in my class i mean actually for the first five for the first like five six years of my school i was like one of the only kids who had a computer and of course that was also creating like traumatizing me socially because just imagine the distance i mean it's like people who don't have a computer they live completely different life just imagine that someone who is uh socializing every day uh out on the street and yours like sitting like a dork you grow into different directions cognitively so after you founded chat roulette how did you get into crypto i saw the problem of middlemen of just this impossibly impossible problems you have a monopoly the monopoly is not even efficient because it's again it's because it's rich right so they don't need to optimize everything monopoly doesn't care about small players all sorts of reasons monopoly and i'm not even talking about like monopoly abusing its power right and just even on the efficiency level you will expect from monopoly something like that it would not work on the weekends you know or it will work only two hours a day this kind of like if you try to go to embassy embassies work like two hours a day once a week look for instance like app store in the on the phone it's it's a brilliant idea to have an app store really it's one place where all the apps are and it has like all this moderation and reviews what users want and it's secure because apps don't get from outside but again in practice it's a bit like dystopian what happens because in the end then the big one company private company starts to get all this power they send their apps that compete with their own apps they start to say okay if you take payments you should give us a cut so then at some point you must have heard about bitcoin or something is that yeah i i yes uh was it like 2011 or 2012 or not remember but i think it was maybe 13 actually i heard later than others like when the price went to 1000. probably yes and i i me i bought after the first bubble collapsed and so did you become interested in it right away because of this experience that you had no not really not really you know like russians are are skeptical of of crypto because we had in 90s experienced a series of ponzi schemes and just all these high-yield investment schemes and it just in general like i mean this was like a value that was taught in my family that you should do useful things for others you know don't think that you can buy some coin or a stock and get rich because i mean even mathematically that doesn't work right because if everybody would do that how would what the world work right i mean you know it's what it's can't said only the things that are right are the ones that would be valid if it would become universal law like you cannot say as a strategy buy coins to get rich because the strategy doesn't work for others for everybody it's uh there's a lot of it but it's also interesting how in in the professional in well it's not professional but in all these investment books that you get from amazon it was always saying the opposite like it would say do not think you can beat the market because if it's everything is already priced in so basically be a good boy and you know just buy into a fund a diversified fund and you pay less leased fees and you're diversified and again if you think you can beat the market you are under of some kind of cognitive bias because more than half of the drivers think there's better than other drivers you know this is they they you read these books and you stop believing that you in yourself that's kind of funny that in crypto i think the people who made it big you're either too ignorant of what the professional advice is or because they they they had like the balls to read this and say you know what i disagree with this i am actually smarter than others you know right right i've written things saying that yeah you should just buy an index fund and etc etc but so then how long after you found out about bitcoin how long did it take you to decide to buy some i don't know i was uh it's slowly i mean again first i had this reaction because it was like it's unsustainable you cannot have an asset that grows fundamentally as an activity i mean i have if i have a real job why do i need to like gamble and to be honest i this is something i think even today that if you have uh your own business that's where you should invest because and not crypto because if you have your own business you have an edge you have a private information and you have you know depending on others so you're you become the master of your own destiny and and when you touch the markets you just cannot control how other people behave so but then it's actually more complicated of course because crypto becomes a bit like hedge that everything else screws up right so it's more complicated anyhow i slowly uh progressed at me and i was i would say one of the strong statements in crypto again for me i feel like i was always not taken seriously because i was always somehow not right you know either like i'm somehow kind of as you wrote that i'm not perceived as someone like someone serious and you know like it's like two types of people the ones who have like a hollow effect and they get like the benefit of the doubt i was the opposite you know and and what i like about crypto is that crypto just doesn't care it doesn't care how unlockment you speak who you know what kind of credentials you have you have private key for tech people it's perfect because it's like it's it's ultimate meritocracy but by the way tech people tech people hate crypto as well and because i'm also reading tech forums i mean the ones who didn't buy the no coiners they are very salty anyhow but again tech people like meritocracy because tech people can't compete on looks and appearances yeah i'm gonna have to disagree with you but we're gonna we'll talk about that after a quick word from the sponsors who make this show

you and i know you haven't read my whole book but you've read you know the parts that involve you you are a whale in crypto and as people will read about in my book or maybe they've already read it whales have a lot of influence so i wonder do you think that takes away from crypto's claim to be a democratizing force in finance there is the theory in this practice you know right but you were saying that it's the ultimate meritocracy but it's but based on the events that actually happened i disagree i was sold on the vision i was sold on the vision like on the theory of it you know of course there is the pure mathematical model and there is reality and the reality is that it's not a pure meritocracy this is based on the events that i discovered it's it's oligarchy it's oligarchy yeah yeah now you're back you're saying different from what you said before i know i would say the truth is always in the middle right so it's it's or maybe it's not which is also a fallacy but uh i would say again this was the vision that i was sold into i was i bought into and i think that's division many other people are buying but of course the more time you spend into in it the more you understand how things are more difficult than you originally perceive them to me it looks like exchanges treat whales like you very well i mean do you think that everyday users of exchanges get the kind of treatment that you get it's complicated like i say it's on a case-to-case basis you know i also i think in general crypto isn't like one thing it's many different ideas which are organized you know i mean i guess this gesturalization is one thing but for instance bittorrent was also decentralized you know i mean crypto as in that cryptography is used okay that's also exists but then you also always had this pgp you had before way before pgp corporation uh probably the the inventor of bitcoin was employee number two you know halfini because pgp corporation i mean it's used in every i mean again this this was a thing before crypto i think every browser has this like support for pgp and it's it's like a de facto standard for us communicating encrypted uh messages over internet with public key crypto i mean but in particular pgp and hal fini was employee number two i mean you know so i take that pretty seriously and i mean so anyways so you have these crypto punks so you have the centralization you have crypto punks and crypto isn't about blockchain crypto is about you usage of cryptography right cypherpunks cryptopunks the nfts are different from cypherpunks yeah yes again and then of course you have this like things like proof-of-work and proof-of-work was also it's like also independent strand because originally designed to combat the problem of spam yeah it's from the 90s 1993 yeah i guess the ledger is the one it is the breakthrough right the blockchain the one that united at all so i would say yeah probably blockchain is the big concept but also blockchain can mean different many different things you know they they also say that there is the technology is neutral right that is that it depends how you use it right right right but but that's what i'm saying that that with this i don't know i definitely think after writing my book i have a much greater awareness of just how much influence whales have that's only one factor out of many you know the whales i would say it's i mean it also depends what is your criteria of success what is the goal i mean this is all very complicated like you you you have an artifact which is this invention but you have to separate what is being promised and who is promising what because that's also what people say ask me people ask me well isn't it a bubble isn't it isn't like is it like a ponzi scheme i'm saying no it's not a ponzi scheme it's a bubble because the ponzi scheme you have you're promised something encrypted you're promised nothing so like nobody's promising you anything in crypto you know so i also have to separate that like it's it's just a blockchain it's what you make of it you know yeah but like i said i do think if you have a lot of coins you get treated differently yeah yeah but you know i think it's a bit like constitutional monarchy so you yes you are treated differently but there is still some framework around so that like the average guy every joe has a chance i'm sorry you called it constitutional anarchy one uh constitutional monarchy but constitutionality is also funny but constitutional monarchy you know which is like you have essentially a person who has a lot of power but there is still some constitution that puts some boundaries on this power and also gives an average person some kind of chance okay yeah oligarchy i guess because there's multiple power players not a single one again i say it's about boundaries that you you have these people who have tremendous amount of power but still an average joe still has a chance he's he can still buy his his coin and he has a chance to make it big in the real world we don't have that because you know the investor protection yeah okay i do agree i do agree on some level with with what you said so we've just talked a little bit about bitcoin but what's your take on ethereum what do you think of it and how to hear about it and get interested well i fell in love i mean i moved to zuuk then after i moved to zuuk and why zuk it's really the most logical choice for just for tax reasons to minimize your taxes in europe you don't live in europe and it's not from outside obvious but europe is very socialist and it has extremely high taxation rate i mean so most of the countries when you're in the upper tax bracket there is minimum 50 of income tax that you have to pay so like you can look you look at scandinavia beautiful countries but if you move here you will pay 60 of your income will go to the budget to the state i mean that's how they make the countries beautiful they you pay high taxes and then you get all you get the beautiful country yes so in whole europe there is only limited countries which you would move to if you want to pay a reasonable amount of tax really very few it's like monaco lichtenstein andorra maybe you can work out some non-domicile agreement in uk but it's like it's really like uk switzerland again you just have really few countries and even within these countries is only very few places you can move to because for instance uh in switzerland you also have different countries depend different taxes depending on the canton zurich for instance it has a 39 income tax zook has 22 so if you just run this uh like algorithm find the cheapest taxes you just arrive to zug okay so you move there in 2016 i believe and then afterward you found out about ethereum how did you hear about it and what were your thoughts about it i heard about it i i think from wikipedia i i i sort of took and by the time they already moved out i mean obviously uh it was no brainer it was everything that bitcoin had but better because you can i felt actually i was mistakenly thinking that on ethereum you could do like a proper decentralized apps like decentralized websites like chatroulette i was thinking that bitcoin is just is decentralized money sending and ethereum is like the centralized platform for any apps so you could like make like a reddit on it or something and i actually that was i invested based on that idea but actually it's not true and we all know you know it's uh the practical limitations the the the fees the throughput well the fact that it's so open is good but also makes it make we create some challenges to to make an app like chat roulette anyhow i was thinking this is like uh decentralized cloud you put your app and nobody can stop it stop it uh it was in that direction but it was it was a subset of features but actually quite like crucial features what we see now we have uh we have these ideas coming but they all come as a separate probably the future of blockchain since caracilia uh but it's like where you would you could put like images and stuff you know not just the code for the financial transactions and of course like their experience people will disagree with me because they will say well you have ipfs for it and i'm not going to get into that one thing i do describe in the book your involvement in the dough and i've seen people talking about it on twitter and obviously we you know promised we wouldn't divulge any of that so people who haven't read the book won't have it spoiled for them but i was curious you know you did not reveal your role in that for many years so then why did you decide to talk to me and and reveal that in the book because you asked because nobody asked nobody else oh really there no there were no other journalists that ever asked you no no oh okay because i don't know if you remember that eye because he didn't have the contact well but do you remember that i initially was contacting you on signal yes yeah and but i can't remember how long i did that it was for months and you kind of just were being cagey so it's it felt like you were on the fence well that was also true but i mean it's like it's it was an intuitive decision i didn't want to push it you know because you were you were very mild in your initial request and uh the second time around you were more insistent and you had more details because initially it was like cold call cold mail so and then after that you already were like look these people and that people and and you know i felt that it would be a shame if if you only have bits of the story because i mean at the end of the day i uh yeah i wanted to help you i guess why not and i mean i'm i'm it's i mean it's all interesting guy from like from his story his historiography perspective i i mean it's all like life is a case study you know there are the facts but then there is the analysis of the facts and there is the experience so i i like to talk about uh i like to reflect on the meta level about things uh because like otherwise what's the point of life you know if you like if you just like solve problems one by one but you don't stop and think back that's kind of boring so anyhow no i i think what you did is great because not you're right i personally think that the historical record is important so for people just to know what are the basic facts but then at the end we also have your reflection about it and you know that that was interesting to me to see your arc as a person even with the kind of small role that you had in the book you know you've changed by the end which is fascinating people can read about it but i definitely think it's one of the most interesting story lines in the book and i really have to thank you for for sharing it because i just feel that you know the understanding of what happened at that time would not be complete without that story and i love it that you also reflected on why you did those things and it showed you know how much you had changed as a person in that time how do i uh carefully describe it without spoil making giving the spoilers well i think what you said about how you had been kind of a troll and immature and then later you you know i would say there is i would say there are layers to this i mean that's like one dimension that i thought it was funny all these games with the it was funny to see and play in all these games around this dao uh white hat black hat and i i feel like i don't regret that you know i feel that's yeah it was like living in a movie you know i mean uh i i do see some other people are a bit more tense and took it more more seriously than i did i mean particularly like a white hat group because they were they felt the pressure of all these funds on their shoulders but it's also like a mindset you know because that's one view but another view like holy like we are now playing with millions and we we are now like on the forefront of innovations and yesterday we were nobody and now we are like rescuing the community i mean holy  that's amazing i mean what else can you ask for like that's highlight of your life in a way you know but i think there's different mentalities because as you can tell i'm more like i'm more treating it in a way that i treat more like life as a game more like an abstract way and some other people they get really serious about things you know yeah but also you and you also said that some of it for you was an intellectual exercise which i also think is a good point and really interesting academic academic yeah and i would just say to give more nuance i don't look i think i think if we set a we should say just we should just say b especially to the readers that watch this after reading the book right because uh let me just describe it in my own words wait so are you going to spoil because if you are then we should tell people that if they haven't read the book then maybe they want to do that before they finish i just find my commentary to be a bit out of context if it's like if i like okay let me try to give the commentary to people who read the book without giving the spoilers okay let's continue that again i think that there is like basically again there is a lot of players here uh for this is one aspect of it let me just talk about like dao again as a spoiler i was not the hacker right so it did not hack anybody but uh i for instance i don't think that hacker is a bad person yeah did you read my article about who i yes yes yes well yes okay well whether he's a good or bad person is a super topic i don't know him personally i noticed that his project went from like billion to to seven million so probably that's maybe even worse than what he has done in dao so that's maybe like yeah i think it was more like 535 million to yeah yeah but imagine how many people bought into it so like you know like karma came back there now through you so it's not the even initial hack it's the ico i would i find even more concerning but the initial hack i actually think was brilliant i believe that the whole idea of smart contracts is that we don't want to use private company because we don't trust humans so we want to use algorithms because they're better than humans and then someone someone finds the flow in this algorithm and people lose the money yeah but you know if people didn't want to to do that they should have just went to the i don't know wells fargo is i mean i i just i just fundamentally don't agree to the people with people that would think that hacking smart contracts is in any way unethical i mean wow it's like it's a strong word it's maybe it's maybe an ethical yes it's an ethical it's an ethical but it's not it's not it's not like uh illegal you know it's it shouldn't be illegal like you know like if you hack a smart contract i would say don't take hundred percent you know take ten percent okay yeah i mean well in this case they took 31 percent yes and that was maybe a bit more than they should have if they would have taken 10 or 20 there would have been no hard fork but wait but wait because like in crypto all the time there are researchers who find flaws and instead of taking the money what they do is they fork the code to you know a safer version and then rescue the money and so but you think that they should instead just hack it and only take 10 is that what you're saying well look everybody has different reasons for doing things you know like uh you have to separate as well that if people perceive that there is criminal liability and they want to sleep well at night that's one aspect they just want to have simple life and i mean i i can say if i were to find an exploit i would definitely today not exploit it i would not so you would tell the developers and try to to fork into some things okay but you just said that you would or or that you think it's okay if people take ten percent it's it's more it's more complicated like for me personally i wanted to be like in harmony with society with government because i want to sleep well at night i don't want to have anything to hide i don't want to you know i want to be free you want to pay your low taxes yes like like now you know i'm free so i want freedom yeah and because i'm like i'm already rich why should i have more problems you know but again for someone else the calculus might be different but i would still separate it from the person on the personal level honestly even if if i lose money i would probably also seek like legal recourse for because i can because government is also a system right which which people will read you definitely uh seem to like doing that like i know this maybe is going to veer off the topic a little bit but i am curious because right now you are in russia and it has this conflict with ukraine and we've seen crypto being used in this historic way in this conflict and well i don't know i mean you texted me i don't know if i can say this that you're trying to leave russia i'm just curious what your thoughts are yes i think it's almost unethical to not talk about it today because that was something happening a lot more important than thou in the short term it's a mass murder you know now it's like really it's uh it's there is darkness there is mass murder and there is no way back you know when the first kind of people killed are killed there is no way back yes it's basically uh it's shocking personally i'm blessed to not be affected uh so i cannot fully even fully emphasize with the people that are that maybe have their some body injury or have their relatives uh it's i mean health health is is being alive and healthy is the is the biggest wealth you can have right so and now these people are at risk but as you're watching crypto being used here uh in this way what what are your thoughts well uh fantastic uh fantastic i mean uh crowdfunded war well the like you know the water finds a way right so innovations they trickle down when wherever whenever they're needed uh i would say probably russia should if ukraine ukraine added this donation wallet russia can do the same and i would not be surprised if some people donate to russia as well and then we will have like two wars two sides crowdfunding war from both sides yeah i'm surprised russia hasn't i mean i don't think they won't get much in donations maybe that's why they haven't i did want to ask you you know obviously you have been very engaged in crypto even if people didn't know it until now do you have any plans to launch anything on crypto or do anything entrepreneurial in it can i just like finish to the topic because i think the initial idea was to talk about the crypto aspect of it because now we have we have a sanctions uh i think that's the kind of that's an interesting topic more like less controversial with where russia is being sanctioned now and uh crypto de facto today becomes uh i mean this is like a no-brainer but i have employees in russia and uh i was just told by the bank that they're gonna take that the bank cannot send uh any further transfers to russia so it means i cannot pay my employees and seems like the only way is to use crypto so at least on my personal level uh it's happening from every direction russia is is blocking outside transfers to preserve the foreign capital inside the country so if you want to make transfers in into russia or outside of russia crypto already becomes probably if if not already it will become one of the only options so i i could expect a demand for crypto to go up from russia from ukraine and you know already ukrainians and russians have uh 11 12 percent i i read somewhere there is a study that 10 of russians have crypto as in ukraine and again especially now with all this political instability there is a strong case for crypto you know it's like gold went up six percent in the last month and gold is a very big market so six percent is a lot again for sanctions uh for the reasons of sanctions for the reason of political instability there is a strong case for crypto even stronger than the case during the covet because in covet people were also fearing the end of the world so this is a similar situation now so does this inspire you to try to launch anything in crypto there are some people uh who think that decentralizing chat roulette could be interesting i think that chat red can be decentralized because just this model of peer-to-peer connections essentially already decentralized so it's not that much work but it's more complicated you know because for chatroulette the question is like why do people need decentralized chat roulette what problem are we solving so it's it's it's uh because look do you want to meet people or do you want to meet people in decentralized way you know so it's uh there is more complicated case for why to do that because uh when you decentralize the project you don't just offer this installation digitalization to your end users you're also creating a dao and in dao you're you can let your users own a piece of the platform you can also source talent and you can compensate the talent and as i as i was told there are many people today that would actually not like to work for a traditional company anymore and they would prefer to work for a dao so if you want to tap into this kind of pool into this kind of talent pool it seems you can you you might consider decentralizing your project just for that but uh it's a it's a big decision because chatroulette unlike other some other projects already exists and already has real users and i don't need to make like a white paper and push some coin i actually for me i'm thinking in terms of the what value it brings to the end user you know and it's kind of decentralization is you have to pay tax for it because look at china china is very centralized and that's why it has some efficiencies which democracy democratic countries don't because for a decision to be taken in a democratic country it has to go through multiple layers of approval if you look at the how projects are built there is actually a lot of centralization built in to them in the back door like uh that defi projects like compound finance they do have the operator has a back door that to make a change inside oh even now now i don't know but it used to have and i wouldn't be surprised if they don't because if you remove a back door you it's very very dangerous it's you know you want to have a back door what we learned from dao is that it's there's always an illusion that if things work today that uh they will work tomorrow but it it's it's amazing when you have a complicated system that there is always comes up edge cases which you could not have thought up in advance right and actually there is a theory behind it right it's called uh halting theory that there is certain properties of the program which you cannot predict upfront without executing the program because of the loops so if if you don't have loops just like one direction you can kind of like uh do static analysis you can see all the states that can happen during the execution of the program but if you have loops it becomes what mathematicians call a weak formed problem because you cannot like compute that if you have loops okay because if you don't know if you if the loop was taken or not long story short you need a back door and i think also on the government level you need a back door that you can have a bureaucracy but you need also a back door where like an individual can intervene if you can see something going wrong and that's why we have in europe we have we have a constitutional monarchy where uh monarchs have a veto power like they don't have any other powers except the veto power so that is what's like backdoor is i would make i would suggest to do the same for projects like look i i think the goal is not complete decentralization from the day one you know you leave humans yeah you know like it's called mechanical torque right where you put humans in in kind of certain stages you put humans but you put like a boundary around them so you can say okay here we need a human confirmation and here is like uh the public key of this person who who should confirm and if we're not happy with this person we should vote and put someone else's private key in a private public key anyway sorry i'm not i'm i'm going to technical but i do some of the projects that i think they've started that way but then obviously because of in the u.s you know the sec would come after you if you're too centralized so i think over time they they try to shift away from that they're centralized but they're hiding it or they decentralize over time they start decentralized and then they shift and i mean like look the thing is there is lots of interesting problems around dao's that people don't understand upfront for instance one for me one of the first learnings was that dao is not just to ask all the people for the vote and then 51 decides what is right vitalik talks about that but even in real world if you would run the companies like this what would happen is that 51 percent of the shareholders would say look this 49 of the shareholders didn't attend this meeting we are here so let's strike them off in terms of the majority is correct right majority is right but is it fair no and that is why in the traditional corporate law we have minority protection and then another problem is insider trading it you also uh in traditional world you cannot announce something that you cannot sell your shares then say okay you know what we have some big problems then uh the price dumps and you and you say oh you know what never mind and you buy them back cheap because they are inside the trading law in dao there are no protections so there is lots of things like this and i would say it's layers of layers of security and checks and balances and redundancies because look for instance russia is being attacked there's not a democracy but what we forget is that invest democracies were being evolved for for hundreds of years for centuries because essentially what every government experiences every year is a kind of form of a dow attack because someone finds an edge case in all these regulations and exploits it and next year they make like an ad hoc patch and that's why we have like a hundred hundred hundred books of tax code which is another problem it has been so great talking to you thank you for coming on the show thank you for talking to me for my book um i'm very interested you know for more people to read the book and uh hear their opinions on what happened i think i will be doing some book clubs so maybe what we can do is have you back for one of the book clubs and then you can talk to people who've read the whole thing we can talk freely no worry about spoilers and yeah and so then that will be then we can get into the details but thank you so much for coming on unchained thank you thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about andre and my book the cryptopians
