happy to be here this week the commodity Futures Trading commission dropped a Humdinger of a lawsuit on binance it was 70 Pages filled with detail after detail about all the ways that binance allegedly knowingly flouted U.S regulations while at the same time catering to U.S institutions what are the exact violations and what did you find to be some of the more shocking or surprising allegations of the report yeah so without getting exceptionally technical about how the cftc operates I would say fundamentally in the United States if you're trading certain forms of derivatives on Commodities you're required to register with the cftc and registration with the cftc has a lot of strings attached to it right there are rules around what sorts of trading activity are allowed what sorts of data you have to provide how you treat your customers how you handle funds it is to put it bluntly non-trivial and as an example I used to be at both JP Morgan and City I would tell you cftc compliance derivatives compliance was significantly more time consuming than anything that we were doing for the SEC at the time so as you look at this the cftc is actually making some very serious allegations here that bidance is running essentially in unregulated derivatives platform and in specific did a couple of things that are going to be pretty concerning for most U.S courts if proven to be true because I want to be clear we've only seen one side of the story here and that's the cftc side of the story so as a general rule all of these at this point you should probably take them as allegations though the cftc does not file frivolous lawsuits as a general rule number one is they are alleging that binance knowingly had U.S customers and failed to register so what that means is not only did they run a platform that didn't register with the cftc it's that they knew they had U.S customers and in fact they were alleged to have induced us customers through their actions onto the platform so if I was running a derivatives platform and for argument's sake I only served people in say Mongolia you don't have to go register with the cftc there's no Nexus of U.S business there here in this case like it's not just that oh we had a few that got through like a kyc AML onboarding procedure by defraunting us here it's we actively helped them get around all of these controls to onboard so that that's a pretty significant allegation the second one that's pretty material is that in the process of doing this whole scheme bidance was alleged to have had a bunch of internal accounts trading against people on this platform without adequate controls around it so then you get into issues like front running abusive trading insider trading type behaviors that for pretty much all of the US regulatory you know apparatus around trading it's defined in slightly different ways in each place but nowhere is it okay right the idea that you could be doing something like deliberately putting in orders to take advantage of your clients or seeing information and acting upon it is not going to be acceptable and so to have many many internal accounts without controls around them is a very sort of negative set of facts if true and then the third part about that is that they were alleged to have essentially defrauded some of their commercial Partners about the controls that they had in place so there's some specific you know stories in there one of which involves mild employer paxos about how when binance was asked for information you know the cftc is alleging that essentially they just created fake reports and fake information to deliver outwards to give the appearance of having taken actions as though they were in compliance but actually were done yeah another one that struck me was an open discussion they appear to be having about how Hamas a known terrorist organization was using binance to launder money and I'm just going to quote directly from the complaint uh which refers to Samuel Lynn who was the chief compliance officer quote in February 2019 after receiving information regarding Hamas transactions on binance let me explain to a colleague that terrorists usually send quote small sums as quote large sums constitute money laundering Lim's colleague replied quote can barely buy an AK-47 with 600 bucks and with regards to certain binance customers including customers from Russia Lim acknowledged into February 2020 chat like come on they are here for crime and then finances money laundering report officer I think is the title agreed quote we see the bad but we close two eyes so when you take that along with this other part of the report in which Lim clearly seems to understand the law and the consequences for violating it he had written in a chat U.S users equals cftc equals civil case we can pay fine and settle no kyc meaning no no your customer rules which like take you know personal identifying information equals Bank secrecy act equals criminal case have to go to jail so given the kind of Disconnect between his knowledge of you know what not following those rules could mean for the exchange and for himself and then you know this conversation about Hamas I'm curious what you thought were the odds for a criminal charge brought by the Department of Justice yeah so I would say one um Sam is correct that the cftc is not a criminal prosecution Authority like the cftc doesn't put people in jail they can put people in you know what I would jokingly call Financial jail that is to say they can kick you out of the industry but what they can't do is put you in literal like physical jail that's a doj type problem I would say based on what's Happening Here one of two things will occur with binance one is that if they want to defend this case they're going to open themselves up to Discovery if they open themselves up to Discovery and there's worse things that come out and or those things are already in the possession of the US government I think the odds of doj action in this case are significant right it's never a hundred percent but those comments are not the kinds of things that typically people are just going to let fly and sort of you know close their eyes at when they're discovering so I would say if true it's not a good fact pattern I mean even you know without having seen the entirety of the messages you don't even want to joke about those kinds of things much less say them truthfully so I I would have a heightened level of concern shall we say about criminal prosecution coming and then again the question becomes are we talking about fine cessation of operations material changes to business keeping in mind also that many of these allegations are from to the best of my understanding 2019 and 2020. so the other question that we don't know is how much has already been remediated that is to say if people further up the chain saw this since I know this is bad and are already deeply into the process of fixing it before the doj shows up that's going to be received very differently than if it's still kind of an ongoing tire fire and then the doj shows up yeah I think that's a possibility but the other thing to keep in mind about the cftc here you know you know I reference jokingly Financial jail earlier they could put by dance in a position where it's simply impossible for finance to operate the United States going forward so even if there's not you know a criminal prosecution the oh we just pay a fine sort of thought around the cftc is way too gentle of an interpretation of the cftc's powers right because if you read the suit they're asking for it to be declared that by dance many of their companies and many of their senior officers are not legally allowed to register in the United States period right that basically means you're done here you can never operate here again and at that point started to Flap those kinds of things puts you in much greater danger as well all right there's so many directions we could go from this but one thing I have seen is so much commentary about that I just want to ask you to clarify things for a lot of the crypto Community is people are very curious how it is that regulator has got all these chat logs as well as information directly from the phone of CZ or Ching Pang Xiao who's the CEO so can you explain how it is that Regulators were able to get those details and also information directly from his phone well I was going to say that uh there's a couple of potential ways that can happen uh as somebody who had to be involved with some investigations previously cleaning up some other messes one is that you've got a bowl right that is to say somebody inside the company Who provided those to Regulators if you have a whistleblower if you have somebody who thought there was wrongdoing who had access to all of those things that's part one part two is it could have been the case that binance received a bunch of requests and turned those over as part of you know some sort of legal action you know you could get subpoenaed by people you can deliver all of these things sometimes they'll privately request the information and if you're trying to play ball especially if they're in the case of having materially improved controls off the back and senior people took it seriously it's not always the worst idea to just deliver all the information and show that you've done it you know the third part is that you know speaking realistically about how the United States operates is somebody could have compromised their security and just stolen all this information right if you read some of the controversy around like certain criminal prosecution and parallel construction type problems of the judicial World which what that means is that the government acquired the information through some way that is not judicially like call it legitimate so you could bring it to court but that knowing what they know they go and reconstruct it with warrants and everything in a way that appears much more judicially like relevant there's no knowing which one of those paths we've gone down as of yet with the information that's in public but people in crypto should be aware that all of those are possible I would as a generic statement tell people if it's on the Internet it's forever even if you think it's in an encrypted app or something like that like no all right so in a moment we're going to talk about some of the other elements of this case but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible ever wanted to use D5 without being tracked railgun is the leading D5 privacy Solution on ethereum it's available on BSC arbitrim and polygon 2.

app at railway.xyz to find out more back to my conversation with Austin so you know as we just discussed there is the potential for criminal action here and the complaint went into detail about how much control CZ has over binance even mentioning that he approved for instance a 60 expense or um you know uh showing just How Deeply involved he was um in conversations about different clients or the kinds of reports he was receiving so at the moment um CeCe is believed to live in Dubai he's a Canadian citizen but what kind of peril do you think he's in do you think he could travel to any country that has an extradition treaty with the us could he travel to the U.S as svf once jokingly asked about like I did see some commentary also saying that there could potentially already be a sealed indictment that hasn't been revealed to the public yet so what are your thoughts on all that so one I would say the uh the United States has a very long reach to capture people internationally there's a short list of countries they're not going to extradite you to the United States that you could feasibly live in for long periods of time right yeah so for instance you know another uh shall we say crypto fugitive dokwan was recently apprehended as well it's going to be hard if there are warrants outstanding for you for you to evade the United States Forever Without simply going somewhere like say Cuba and never leaving so number one would be if there's a sealed indictment and they actually want to extradite it I like their odds of getting him or he has to become a certain form of like call it pseudo captive in a nation that doesn't have an extradition treaty and more importantly and this is something people often don't think about won't have what in the future because if you're there for five years and then they improve relationships with the United States well guess what's going to happen with you so what I would say if they really want to get their hands on him they probably can or he's going to be hiding out with some of America's like genuine enemies two I didn't see anything in that indictment that would indicate to me he had deep personal knowledge of the shortcomings that approved of them right again we haven't seen everything this is just the initial indictment so that's not a statement that anything is guaranteed but one of the things people should know about how Corporate prosecutions work is you've really got to zero in on who are the actors and who knew what at what time right this was a problem for the people who were Prosecuting Enron for instance it was a problem in 2008 of being able to prove that the CEO was fully aware of the actions of all of their subordinates it endorsed them is something that's actually relatively difficult because it's not enough to have somebody running around saying these things internally you have to prove that it's CZ knew about them and that he endorsed them right because if later on he disagreed and took actions to remediate neither sidelined or fired a person that's going to be perceived very differently than giving them a giant bonus for these actions so I would say on that topic like just being genuine from what I've read more information needed I would say hot takes in either direction or probably premature but these things do come out over time one of the things people should keep in mind is judicial proceedings are slow right like if you think you know compared to crypto banking is slow try going to a court where you can take five years to go through an entire case um one thing that interested me was that Bloomberg opinion columnist Matt Levine basically asserted that he felt that the allegations here were not necessarily ones that um the cftc would always go after um I'm really paraphrasing but he was essentially saying that the complaint is largely about these big International proprietary trading Market making trading firms that were operating on binance that were you know were the ultimate beneficial owners were U.S persons and um his conclusion was the cftc cares about this activity not because quote not because it wants to protect big U.S high frequency trading firms from the risks of trading on finance but because binance is the biggest crypto exchange and this is a lever to crack down on it do you agree with that assessment so I think there's a couple of parts to that if you look at the current U.S like regulatory framework um I would say I think that's about half right there one thing to recognize in this suit now actually think this may be the single most important Point that's fallen out of it is that the cftc is now in a federal court bluntly alleging that Bitcoin ethereum and two of the major stable coins busd and usdt are commodities this is a direct contradiction of some of the things that the SEC or at least the chair have been saying right so they now put their cards on the table in court the way that is contestable saying these things are Commodities and one of the elements of this case can be seen as a marker of where the lines of regulations begin and end right they're very clearly saying this sort of activity at least on these tokens is under our jurisdiction and we intend to proceed accordingly and that has a lot of implications for U.S consumer protection in general so I would tell you the scope of the actions here should not be read solely within the four corners of this case but rather thinking about some of the second order effects that go beyond it two I do think that it's important to understand that even if obviously protecting like big U.S high frequency Traders is not the goal here what happens with these sorts of Arrangements is there's a lot of smaller Traders caught in the middle who just get crushed as the giants walk around and that has always been a concern for the cftc they is a general statement or pretty pro-commercial in terms of like experimentation letting companies try things like allowing Innovation but they're very very Pro fairness which is to say they wouldn't want it done in a way that disadvantages the smaller Traders and there are hints that that is their view throughout this suit I was curious so at this moment um we have seen a lot of crypto community members are tweeting things like this could mean the end of Finance um as some people also just say oh well maybe it'll suffer the fate of bitmex and drop from number one to like number 20. so what are your thoughts about what is likely to happen in binance at this point so if you look at this case so if I were on the other side thinking about strategy from the binance perspective I would say you've really got two good options here option number one is try to find some sort of settlement with the cftc about this so I would say the fact that this was filed either indicates those discussions failed if they were had already or the cftc is not particularly interested in settling it probably feels like one of those two your other option is I do not think this will kill binance but there is a non-zero chance that it kills binance us and it kills binance's ability to operate in the United States right and not in the sort of oh we don't operate but we're quietly letting people in the back doorway but no you actually literally cannot operate the United States and what that would mean for them is right now they're number one with a bullet right like very dominant Global exchange and the moment you start regionalizing these things and forcing them out of the entirety of the U.S space that will shrink their influence probably the single biggest winner from that would be coinbase right is the exchange operating onshore who has at least tried to color within the lines so much as we even know what the lines are in America and so you know that goes back to the fairness concerns of the cftc they don't want binance operating in one way through like offshore but inducing all these onshore clients while coibase has a much stricter set of rules to face the same people so again it could be a real leveling of the playing field I think would be the most likely outcome here I think this being fatal for bidance probably would depend on say the doj piling on and you know alleging much more severe criminal issues and then just because this took up such a big part of the complaint I was curious if you thought The Regulators would go after those trading firms that are written about at length for having traded on binance and having done so uh despite you know having ultimate beneficial owners that were Americans the question you would have to ask there is what are those trading firms do wrong right in many cases the registration requirements and like policing the platform In fairness in the cftc framework fall on finance if you could show those people who are trading and deliberately abusive fashion and taking advantage of people then yeah maybe you've got something but I think this came for binance first because they're the lowest headed fruit right like if you look at where the legal liability attaches had I been at the cftc discussing strategy with the I would have gone after by dance as well compared to trying to go that route that'll be significantly more difficult because those people are trading largely for their own account for profit making purposes they're not holding themselves out as like oh we are fair Arbiters of an exchange who faces retail all right so as you alluded earlier one of the additional issues that has arisen because of this lawsuit is the fact that now both the cftc and the SEC have asserted conflicting statements about the status of crypto assets aside from Bitcoin so um what happens to sort of decide whether cryptos like ether or you know as the cftc asserted Litecoin are Commodities versus whether they're Securities yeah and so this is getting to where the rubber meets the road for the SEC of the cftc the answer is a judge will decide that right you're looking at a situation where the cftc is making some pretty blunt assertions in court those could be challenged but if they are not uh I think everybody will be preceding a pace and then at least in the circuit they've filed it you now have a statement that these things are understood to be commodities right so if the cftc wanted to assert regulatory Authority great it's already there if the SEC wants to assert it they have to contest that and why weren't they in this case contesting that it just starts to build a body of case law that tells you know these are commodities also if this were to get appealed or they were to fight as they go up to like the Appellate Division or the Supreme Court now you can get rulings that are binding on much larger groups of people so ultimately the answer in the United States to whether something is 100 to security or not is judicial right these are rebuttable presumptions by the SEC and you can go to court and fight about it and essentially the cftc and you know I want to compliment them for doing that I think this is the clarity that we need but they have put all of their cards on the table in the Forum where a final decision can be made as to what these things are and made their view very very clear we'll see if it stands up but you know I I would say this sort of clarity is what you would need it would be nice for instance if the SEC would just take say the top 500 tokens and tell us which ones with certainty they think are securities are not and why but they haven't so this is kind of how you start forcing that process so for that issue of whether or not ether and Litecoin and other crypto assets are securities versus commodities it how does that get decided as a part of this case like shouldn't it be kind of separated out into its own case or how does that all work yeah so a court proceeding has multiple layers to it and one of the important layers is actually jurisdiction which is to say the judge asking am I the right person to hear this case and are you the right people to be participating in this case which is standing for those people and so you know one of the things to think about like one of the simple examples in this space would be if you're in California and I'm in California and we have a commercial dispute with each other about something that happened in California and then I go sue you in New York they're going to tell me to leave right they're going to tell you that the venue where you should be doing this is perhaps unsurprisingly California and so a judge is looking at that first saying am I the Right court for you to have shown up in and then are you the right parties because the other part of that is if you and I are having a commercial dispute in California but some unrelated third party with no stake in it tries to sue us about this it's like no please go away like you're not a party to this dispute so one of the things that's going to get answered here is is the cftc the correct regulator to be in this action and they are a Commodities regulator so what are the decisions the judge is going to have to make is are these things Commodities because if you look at these and say well Bitcoin ethereum these stable coins Litecoin all of them are securities the question will be cftc what are you doing here like get out of here the SEC has got to bring this action and so the fact that the cftc is bringing it is going to force the judge to confront that issue of like do you have regulatory authority over these actions which necessarily involves a determination because another option for instance to leave the SEC out of it is if you look at usdt and busd and say no these are unregulated banking products like essentially this is an unregulated Bank you may need somebody like the OCC showing up instead to confront those issues and you know it is essentially a way to have a final determination at least within the walls of that court case of what are these things that is a precondition to the cftc proceeding because again if it's not a commodity or a commodity derivative they probably shouldn't be there wow so okay so what's going to happen is that even before the binance case really is hashed out the first step is to determine whether or not the cftc has jurisdiction and therefore whether or not those crypto assets are securities or commodities yeah and that that's part of jurisdiction there's many other parts to it right like is there a Nexus of activity Etc but one one thing that has to be answered is does this fall within the four corners of the cftc authority and that's okay and then so when might that happen would you expect I do not make predictions about timelines in court cases somewhere between now and forever is basically the correct prediction for most of these things because here's part of what we don't know is somebody else going to intervene and try to argue that they're not is binance going to try to argue that they're not because if nobody contradicts the cftc they kind of win by default because the judge only has one argument in front of them to consider that argument is that they're Commodities so the other question you have to ask is does somebody want to fight about it oh oh well I mean doesn't it seem like the SEC might do because you know chair Gensler has been going around saying that only Bitcoin is a commodity and everything else is the security so do you think that might happen and if so is that unusual because that feels like that might be kind of unprecedented or something usually Federal Regulators do not show up in federal court at first to each other and start punching each other in front of the judge I would say that would be highly unusual ah but then again a lot of Highly unusual things happen in crypto so you know I'm gonna fall back on Yogi Berra here and just say predictions are hard to make especially about the future okay okay I have to say that sounds extremely interesting to me all right well this has been a fascinating discussion thank you so much for coming on Unchained thank you very much really
