I think there's a lot of experiments that have yet to actually be tried as far as using tokens to vote you know and and really the most popular method still is one token one vote and what we've seen over and over is that doesn't work for decentralization that method with the the money the amount of money that's involved with it is absolutely going to end up being captured by Regulators or governments down the road just because it's clear you have these parties that have five ten percent of the voting power they're saying this thing's decentralized but they can sway things in so many different ways that's that's not working you know it's not working for decentralization now I think you know there's other things going on out there other Dows that are trying different things quadratic voting or time lock voting and stuff like that but that stuff is less profitable for a venture capitalist you know so
