so there's no question that the FTX situation this fall has changed the trajectory of regulation in 2023. I think the focus on crypto regulation is going to be higher than it's ever been before 2021 was the year of nfts while 2022 ushered in the crypto winter as well as the downfall of big companies in the industry well 2023 be the year of regulation in the crypto world at certain point governments were going to say hey guys we need to regulate this a little bit further regulations and safeguards you think need to be put in place this Bitcoin business which has basically been used and abused by the worst actors uh in in society as the conversation heats up what could be the outcome is this the Lehman moment for crypto so what more can be done to protect consumers
