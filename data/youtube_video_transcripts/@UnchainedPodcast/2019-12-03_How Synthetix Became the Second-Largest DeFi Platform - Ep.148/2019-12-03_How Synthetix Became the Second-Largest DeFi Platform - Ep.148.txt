DC and a lot of the regulated stable points that they launched and I just meant that the the kind of market for a centralized sabre coin was much smaller than it had been and so we looked at the model and we said okay what can we do with our model to kind of create some differentiation and one of the things that we saw was this ability to you know pre-press debt and move between different synthetic assets so we had a synthetic US dollar token but we were able to launch a synthetic gold token so that axillary token and people were able to move between those tokens with zero slippage which was kind of the advantage and so at that point we decided to focus on you know synthetics exchange and that ability to trade synthetic assets yeah and I think what's remarkable is that you've gained quite a bit of traction in a short amount of time so let's talk a little bit more about kind of like what that journey was after you started creating some of these how did you become one of the biggest projects in defy I you know kind of gradually and then old ones I guess so you know we so you know we have the second most value locked and you know the way that that kind of evolved I guess is we as we've launched more synthetic assets like that Bitcoin synthetic gold synthetic silver new awareness and an interest in the project grew really rapidly but in addition to I guess pivoting toward synthetics we also made a decision to change the monetary policy of the the protocol so previously like most OSI pony tokens that launched in 2017 or 2018 we had a fixed fixed supply of a hundred million and we decided that you know we weren't really seeing high staking rates we weren't getting people participating in the protocol and you're kind of doing what we needed them to do and so we changed the monetary policy and essentially started paying inflation to the people who were staking who are actively participating in the network and that immediately had a very powerful come feedback loop that are created where people you know got more excited they started you know to to understand the project more and dive in and the anti-growth kind of accelerated from there great so yeah let's talk a little bit more about what people are doing on platform what are some of the most popular scents so we actually just launched a bunch of new since this week including a defiant index turbine and so this D Phi index token is essentially like a basket of tokens in the deepest pecks so there's maker they are obviously linked SMX is in there we've got zero wax etc so what you can you know essentially do is hold this token and get exposure to kind of you know the entire D Phi space or at least all the tokenized projects within D Phi and so that's I think a pretty novel and interesting asset that doesn't really exist anywhere else but in addition to that we've got you know things like you know synthetic bitcoins synthetic ether where a lot of the volume happens but we're starting to see you know definitely demand grow for things like synthetic maker and some of the inverse tokens so during the transition to multi collateral die over the last few weeks the demands for synthetic maker and inverse maker has really increased and then this long volcanic volume happening there which is kind of good to see this is super interesting yeah there's so much to unpack I guess why don't we just start with the NT Phi token first in a way you know it's it's sort of like I guess it's like an index how do you decide like what the waiting's and stuff should be yeah so we wanted it to be kind of representative of the space and obviously you know we can only track the things that have tokens so we contract something like compound right now for example but we took the waiting's by market cap and then you know tried to kind of normalize it it was actually one of our discord participants one of the synthetics members who kind of normalized the waiting's and proposed it I'm Arthur 0x who I'm sure a lot of people follow on on Twitter as well and you know the community then voted and reviewed that waiting and they're happy with it we also did some polls to work out what people wanted to include in the index so it was you know kind of an open governments mechanism to determine the weighting and constituents of the the basket and then for a sense like the Bitcoin since why is it that they wouldn't just buy Bitcoin yeah it's a it's a really good question I think you know the advantage that we have with something like synthetic Bitcoin is if you want to hold Bitcoin and your long time holder it makes sense to just go buy a Bitcoin and spot market but like most derivatives the advantage is in kind of access right so if you're holding Bitcoin and you know you've got it in your wallet going from Bitcoin into eath or into USD or something like that you know there's friction there whereas if all you want is the price exposure and you know you're not necessarily a long-term holder your ability to go from Bitcoin into say gold and then back in the US dollars within synthetics exchange with zero slippage is quite powerful and so that's why I think we're seeing a lot of people who want that price exposure but also want the flexibility of being able to move out into a different asset fairly quickly and if but is there anything that they're doing with the Bitcoin in the synth Bitcoin that they couldn't do with VTC as well a site just from being able to trade in and out of it without slippage no that's basically it it's just you know people looking for price exposure so you know think about it is kind of the difference between you know gold futures versus the the gold spot market you know people who don't necessarily want physical delivery of gold they just want price exposure to gold this is sort of a similar you know mechanism you just get the price exposure to Bitcoin but without your having custody the asset or right to the asset or anything like that and then I was also wondering about some of these since that are similar to stable coins like this the s USD so I don't know if this would technically be called a stable coin but I did happen to see that the amount of value in it is ahead of for instance gemini USD which is an actual stable coin but then since the synthetic USD is backed by s and x is that essentially just like a riskier version of a stable coin and so it has kind of like different properties from misty or like how would you compare this to a regular stable coin so I think you know in in 2017 2018 we kind of saw three different types of stable coins emerge there was you know the Fiat backed put money in a bank it's a right to kind of convert that token into the fear style standpoint so you know that's your paxos in genuine at Rio ste et cetera and tether ostensibly and then we had crypto collateral backed so obviously maker and dye is the biggest example of that so using ether as collateral to issue a stable UST asset and that's really what sust is it's the same kind of principle it's just using snx as collateral instead of eath and then there's the third category which is like the algorithmic stable coins so things like basis which obviously unfortunately didn't launch so we didn't really get a chance to kind of see how that would play out but I think there is a few more algorithmic stable coins that have launched recently and what are people doing with the synth USD well so one of the nice things again about you know the sort of synth ecosystem I guess is that you can take that synthetic asset and convert it easily into a different asset so you can go from your s USD into gold and so I guess that's kind of a bit of a different property to say something like no gemini or you know tether where you need to find a counterparty to trade with in order to convert it into Bitcoin or some other assets so it's sort of one of the interesting properties of synthetics is that once you've got any of this debt whether it's USD or gold of the coin you have the right to repress that debt into any other asset and we talked earlier a little bit about how the defy a synth was formed but where did the idea or where does the idea for like any particular synth come from I mean typically comes from our community you know so we've got a lot of traders in our community and a lot of people who are very into crypto and crypto trading and and you know that sort of thing so we look at what the demand is from the community so things like s link which we launched recently SXL P were kind of coming from the demand that the community was was displaying you know discord in other places and I heard that you're also coming out with decentralized futures we are yeah that's something that we're working on so essentially it will be a decentralized bit mix or debit or any futures exchange you'll be able to take a leveraged position on you know something like Bitcoin or eath and open that position and it'll be a perpetual future so let's walk through how this works so let's say I'm a user I come near platform and I want to create some kind of synth for myself what what do I need to do so if you want to create a scent you have so you can't actually create a new scent if you are just arriving in the platform you can only choose from the existing sense and one of the reasons mentis Oh gotcha okay that right so view yeah that's right yeah if you want to mint a saint then you know you need SN X and you essentially will turn up at Minter which is our dap that we use for minting and part of maintaining your position and you'll lock SN x and against that value of that collateral you'll mint a synthetic asset so within mint or you can only mint s USD but with the contracts you can mint any of the synthetic assets so you can min synthetic Bitcoin for example and again it's very similar tool I can make her vault or make her CDP where you lock eath and then you get issued this debt which is a synthetic asset priced in u.s. dollars oh wait okay so sorry let me walk through this again so I show up at mentor and then I have to give it ethan order to get SN X is that it sorry yes of you if you don't have SN x you need to get SN X from somewhere so you know you would either body as an expert if or for something else but once you've got SN x you can lock that SN x and issue synthetic USD against it okay so I go to mint or with my SN x and then I turn that into s USD and then from there I can move into any other sins is that that's wrong is that it that's right yeah that's it so in order to create that snx so people need to over collateralize and i think it's my like roughly seven hundred percent why is it so high because the liquidity of snx is still quite low so you know the idea is that eventually as SN x accrues value and as liquidity grows we'll be able to low with that collateralization ratio but it's sort of a reflection of the risk profile of SN x versus a eath right in-house collateral oh okay well do you have any plans to add any other types of collateral we do actually we're working on a proposal to add it as a form of collateral to the network which hopefully will go live later this year or early next year okay so earlier you talked about how one of the ways that you got traction on the platform was to change the monetary supply and I guess give some of the rewards to people who are stinking so will that still be the same if they're staking ether other than SN x no one it's a slightly different approach so the the people who's taking SN x will get the full rewards from trading and the inflation so the trading fees on the exchange as well as the the inflationary supply people who lock eath just have a right to come and trade synthetic assets so once each collateral goes live you'd be able to turn up with eath you wouldn't need to have SN x you'd be able to mint synthetic eath against that eat and then start trading on synthetics exchange immediately and the advantage I guess to someone who's holding eat is that it doesn't force them to convert their eat into SN X or into you know one of the sins they can still hold their eighth and trade without kind of taking the risk of selling down there eath position well I seem ok so this is sort of like how currently amongst people who have created SN x only about 80% of them I think well actually tell me if I understood this correctly I think about 80% of them are staking it is that right about 80% of the supply is state so okay yeah okay and then so the remaining are doing what trading it yes I'm some of them are just sitting on it and not staking you know some of them have it sitting in exchanges it sounds probably lost on State ball you know something happens in crypto networks so you know there's any number of reasons that someone might decide not to state rather than participate in the network okay so essentially when you start adding eath as a collateral or when you add it as a collateral type then what is likely to happen is that the currents takers will still basically have a similar incentive but they might earn more in fees because there might be more trading activity something like that that's exactly right yeah that's it it's just an easier way to get people to trade more okay yeah I was just wondering because as you know the the well actually this is an interesting question so let's see here so first it's like in so many other systems taking you know is correlated with security is that is that really the function that it's it's providing here it's it's slightly different so you know you're securing the pool of assets I guess so the pool of debt by putting your collateral there and you're taking a risk so when you lock s and X you take the risk of the total value of the debt pool that's that's out there so you know you're providing that service to someone to allow them to turn up and repress their dad so you're securing the the debt pool essentially but obviously we rely on the etherium Network for the actual security of the tokens themselves and your consensus etc okay so this is like a slightly weird question but we were talking about this really high collateralization ratio and how snx isn't very liquid is there any possibility of some kind of like a Black Swan event or something where like people some somehow suddenly cannot actually pay back their you know their positions definitely you know that's one of the big risks that you take as someone who's minting so if if something happened to the Deadpool such that the Deadpool you're increased by you know an order of magnitude then there would be more debt outstanding than the collateral value of SMX which you know would create some kind of a downward spiral potentially now there's mechanisms that are in place to kind of prevent that from happening but you know it's definitely possible and in fact back in July we had an issue with the price beads with our Oracle which created just that scenario so there was a bar that was trading on the exchange and the price feed for the Korean Won failed and then that bought was able to essentially create about two billion dollars worth of debt which obviously was significantly higher than the market cap of the next collateral so that was something that you know was kind of indicative of one of the risks that exist in the system right so I was gonna ask you about this so when it's creating two billion dollars worth of debt that basically means that then if that bought or whatever wanted to kind of like close out of the snx system then they would need to pay back two billion dollars or so is that is that what that means what does that mean so what it means is that the ball has two billion dollars worth of debt outstanding but there's only you know at that time I think there was about thirty million dollars worth of collateral so the ball would basically never be able to cash out that position there's not enough collateral value it would be like if there was you know a million dollars what the beep locked up to issued I and then all the sudden that died supply was inflated to a billion dollars you know there's only a million dollars worth of beef there so the first million can be claimed but then after that you know if there's no there's no value there to be claimed so essentially the system was insolvent and the ball was unable to to close out that position and then get the profit okay so we're actually gonna talk a little bit more about what happened there in a little bit I actually just wanted to talk a little bit more about this the shaking and the snx and stuff so the I think some other thing that's a little bit interesting to me about how the staking works here is it's not it's not similar to staking on other platforms where people can basically just earn passive returns am I am I right and thinking that yeah so you know typically with staking you know you have some level of responsibility you know you're you're providing a service you know there's things like you know live pier where you're providing a service running nodes you know if you're staking an e 2.0 you're providing the security to the network so typically there is some responsibility and some action you have to take and in our network that action is that you're providing it that's collateral essentially for the networking and securing the debt okay all right and so all right so then we talked about how now you're gonna add and when are you gonna add when are you gonna add either as a collateral type we're working on at the moment and we're hoping to get it done by the end of the year but it's looking like it might be early next year wait things are tracking and for the monetary supply you said that you know right now it's pretty high inflation but that's gonna go down so what is like the the monetary policy yeah so it's actually an interesting questions at the moment we have a an inflationary supply that halves every year and that hardening event is coming up in March but some people within the community have proposed a change to that installation schedule to smooth it essentially which was something that I was personally against initially but I've come around to the fact that I think it makes sense so it's it's basically been passed we've had a couple of governance polls where it's been discussed and you know the community has kind of reached consensus that it's the right thing to do there's a couple of minor things around the parameters for the terminal inflation they're still being discussed but there will be a vote on that hopefully in the next you know week or so and then it will be implemented so that's something that would probably change by the end of the year and it will mean that you know the inflation goes from a million tokens that had started out to somewhere around 300 million tenants okay and is that just in perpetuity or is there ever going to be a cap that's reached so that it looks like the consensus is to have perpetual 2% inflation approximately it might be a little bit higher a little bit lower and the intent behind that is to ensure that we've got some additional supply of snx to fund the incentives that are outside of the system and so we've got some incentives at the moment around unis want to incentivize liquidity they're lab so we want to make sure that we continue to have that snx supply to be able to incentivize those external things outside of the protocol alright so in a moment we're gonna discuss Oracle's and we're gonna talk more about that bot that could have made the system insolvent but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the

integrity of the system is highly dependent on the quality of the Oracle and as you mentioned there was this incident with the trader and I believe you know the way that their bot was able to take advantage that the system was something to do with the Oracle so can you tell us exactly how they were able to to make that hack happened yes oh so they were looking at the price feeds that were being published on chain and they were reading the mempool so they're reading all the transactions that are sitting waiting to be confirmed by miners and they took the those feeds and they were able to essentially run were on the pricing changes so they would detect the price change was going to happen and they would move into that that asset and then as soon as the price was updated they would leave the asset and we had some measures to prevent that speed bumps and things like that working on but they the bob was fairly sophisticated and was pretty good at detecting when a large spike was gonna happen and you know it was fairly profitable it was making you know around 10% a day or something like that you know with its trading but then we had an issue where there was this cascading failure of our Oracle for the Forex safeguards so we have a number of api's there million eyes and several of them failed in different ways simultaneously which we didn't have a good mechanism to prevent or you know to allow us to and the block was running and essentially detected this anomaly in the the KO w price and was able to trade i think it was five times back and forth between eath and KO w and it was able to generate about two million dollars worth of synthetic AIDS at the time so you know that essentially made this system insolvent and we then had to work out a way to kind of roll back that that trade well so let's just give a little bit of context on how it is that the price the oracle prices get pushed as far as i understand right now its synthetics or at least back then it was synthetics pushing the price is that correct and if so like how are you determining the price and yeah so yeah so we we had some commercial api's that were essentially being pulled into a system and then yeah the aggregates were taken Allies were engines well these were 4x api's so they were coming from your commercial forex providers so you know there's a ton of them around and we picked what we thought were you know four or five pretty good ones unfortunately the the for exampie eyes are less robust than the crypto api's from our experience which was kind of surprising to us so we had a lot more protection around the crypto 8 the eyes because we were worried that they were gonna be this like year but it was actually the Forex ones that that created the issue okay and so one other thing that I wanted to ask her was like later on this same trader then wrote this reddit post and this was like a few months later actually and this person complained that you had jacked up their fees deleted their balance and forced them to trade their synth for s USD this doesn't appear to be sort of the same incident it's kind of like well let me recap and you can correct anything that is incorrect here but essentially like after the first incident you had kind of said okay we're gonna pay you this this bounty fee and now anything you know that you do is basically gonna help us make our platform better or something like that or actually why don't you just sort of describe what happened yeah so you know it was as you can imagine somewhat of an adversarial conversation you know it was a bit of a hostage negotiation because the trader was well aware of the fact that the system was insolvent and if they didn't cooperate with us you know we would have had to walk the system or you know if there would have been a significantly larger impact so getting them to rollback the trade was definitely the the best solution and initially they wanted a pretty exorbitant amount of money to to do that and we were able to negotiate them down to something bit more reasonable we ended up paying them about $40,000 worth faith to cooperate and roll back the trades but this this you know trader was pretty as I said pretty adversarial and pretty aggressive and arrogant about you know what they were doing and their ability to kind of form around the system and our inability to stop them and so you know we basically said look you can keep attacking the system we're working on a number of mechanisms to kind of prevent that and you know it's this is crypto it's adversarial right we're going to try and fight back and you know work out whatever we can do to kind of make this less profitable and unfortunately the kind of calculus that I guess we we came to was that if you don't have any punishment if there's no downside to someone who's attacking the system the optimal strategy is strategy is just to keep attacking you know if the worst you can do is not profit there this was only gonna escalate and so we're we basically worked out that we would need to have some kind of slashing condition implemented in order to reduce the profitability of these BOTS and so we implemented that it worked were able to slash this trader and then you know if they came back and said well I'm gonna continue to attack the system they did and you know it was kind of this running battle and and it has this is kind of kept going on with different traders in different BOTS I probably feel like the last six months it's been a big amount of effort that we've kind of had to implement a number of different pieces of functionality to prevent this from running which is kind of a constant service I guess Wow okay I bet it's making your platform that are very very very fast one thing that I was wondering about though is like what what exactly are they exploiting so I understand so I understand that it's this knowledge of you know a tree that's about to happen and kind of what the Oracle price is but as part of that also because maybe just like the frequency with which you can update the prices is like a bit slower than you would like yeah that's exactly right it's just latency so they're observing what's happening in the real world and we're observing it we publish something to say you know this is what's happened in the real world and they're able to essentially publish it on train faster than us that's that's their intent that's what they're trying to do we've gone to a point now where we've basically been able to reduce the front-running to or at least reduce the profitability of front-running you know to maybe half a percent a day or a 1% a day which is in kind of I guess within our risk tolerance from from where we're sitting now but again as I said this is an arms race and you know every time we make a change the bots update and they try and you know attack the system and improve their BOTS so it's definitely improving the system and it's making its making it much more robust but it's it's certainly been a lot of effort and a lot of engineering time to kind of work on these issues of last six months and how do you make the improvements anyway if as he mentioned in the original incident the API is that fee weren't even in your control so you know what have we basically been doing is operating the article and we're working on I'm moving the article away because synthetic still runs the article but hopefully by the end of the year we'll start migrating away from our own centralized Oracle to chain-link and we've been working with a chain link team to build a set of articles that will be much harder to run and you know put some mechanisms in place to prevent people from trading and you know to to cover some of the educators that they've been using if they are trying to front along the system but as I said it's it's kind of a balance between usability because some of these things impact the usability for you know regular traders and so we've have to kind of try and find a balance where you're never really going to get rid of front-running completely but you can reduce it to the point where you know it's less profitable or you know or not so impactful so I don't know what ton about chain link but can you describe how that system will differ once it's integrated than what you have now so essentially they're just doing what we were doing ourselves but they've got a distributor group the people that are consuming these external API sites of crypto API etc and a lot of them are data providers that already have the data so they've got access to that data themselves and they take these different node operators who are kind of aggregating this data and then median eyes and publisher on chain and so you know what you've essentially got is our Oracle x yeah seven or twenty or thirty depending on the asset that the price is being published for which just makes it so much more robust you know then then what we're using right now so we're pretty confident that once we get that in place we won't have any future issues with Oracle outages but it doesn't necessarily solve the front-running problem we still have some edge cases that we need to handle there and it will that increase the frequency by which you can update the Oracle's it actually won't you know this this kind of a fundamental latency that you have over the theorem so something that we're also is layer two solutions that will allow us to publish prices much more rapidly so right now the only way we can prevent people from exploding that latency is by forcing them which is what you know some centralized exchanges do that put us to be bump in to prevent people from being able to in your high-frequency traders being able to publish things before you know everyone else can and so we were putting these speed bumps in to ensure that if someone can't look at the transaction being broad constant right in front there they're going to definitely slow within it but as I said yet does a trade-off between between that and usability of the platform because if the speed bump is too aggressive then it makes it harder for regular traders to trade I saw it in a blog post that you wrote that once chain link is integrated that will allow anyone to build and run an Oracle to obtain price feeds for sense so what does that look like exactly and how would you expect that would change the platform I think it changes the platform because you know it moves away from this centralized control that the the team has now you know our core team has so once we get to a point where there are these external Oracle providers anyone in the community can essentially request a price feed so you know palladium weirdly enough people ask for very regularly so you know the the community can say we're putting a proposal to add play diem token and then provided these note operators who are running you know chain link nodes can source a price for palladium and you know kind of credibly produce it we can add that synth and it doesn't require necessarily intervention from you know the team directly to provide that price feed so you know that's obviously going to be beneficial when we look at things like synthetic equities so you know Apple s Tesla etc interesting hopefully neum thing threw me a little bit I feel like this is one of those moments where you're like encrypt oh and then you're like oh there's yet another rabbit hole I could go down yeah yeah there's people who are deep into plug-in for some reason so yeah it is what it is I guess okay so you also had a recent tweet storm about moving to chain-link and you talked about how some people objected to it because it's not maximally decentralized and then you wrote something that I found really interesting you said quote we are very comfortable not using maximally decentralized Oracle's because chain-link is more than sufficient to move the oracle attack vector to the bottom of our censorship vector stack which means governance and other issues become become the highest priority so what did you mean when you said that chain leekens more than sufficient to move the oracle attack vector to the bottom of your censorship vector a vector stack so essentially what I was saying is you know at the moment you could theoretically round up five or six people in the community and you know throw us in jail and shut the project down right you know and again I think about these things from you know a very adversarial perspective right that you know even though that's not likely right now it's it's possible and so so long as something's possible we want to eventually be able to prevent it from happening and you know the reason why the main reason why you could get away with that and you know lock up five people and shut the project down is the Oracle once with Oracle and once the price speeds are being published independently on chain and the protocol is just consuming those price feeds then if you were to do that if you were to you know round up those there's four or five people and lock them up it would be very easy for the community given that everything that we're doing everything other than the Oracle is open source to essentially fork the protocol or you know do a hard spoon and migrate state and you know redeploy it on chain and and keep the system going and you know I think we're getting pretty close to that but the limiting factor right now is definitely the article so you know as soon as the Oracle is not us and as soon as it's independent it's going to be a huge qualitative state in terms of the censorship resistance of the protocol hmm it's super interesting so something we referenced earlier that we didn't go into much was you talked about how somebody could sell you know like a million dollars worth of Bitcoin or what and there would be zero slippage slippage so how how is that possible so it's possible because someone is able to repress the debt so one of the rights that you have if you're holding debt whether you minted it or whether you bought it from someone for ether or Bitcoin or whatever you can turn up the contracts and you can say I have you know ten synthetic Bitcoin and I want to convert that into synthetic US dollars and the system will quote you a rate based on the current spot price and and what the article is publishing for those two assets and then take small fee so 30 bases one fee which goes into the people so that's just a write that you have within the system which is obviously very beneficial and and I think I brought up maker earlier there was someone on Twitter I'm Andrew Kang who actually did an analysis of the slippage on you thoughtful maker versus synthetics and I think this look each was about fifty percent less for trading maker on synthetics exchange so during the the kind of MCD transition when maker pumped up to like 650 or 700 and then drop back down a lot of people were trading s maker an eye maker because it was actually more efficient to trade on synthetics exchange then on the spot markets and why is it that it's more efficient on synthetics than on unit swap so you nice well because it uses the like automatic market making function it has you know kind of this built-in slippage so you know the the larger the order you trade the more slippage you'll get so I think yeah so like 1% slippage for like a $50,000 order for example whereas with synthetics I think it was you know 35 basis points or something like that okay yeah and also I guess just to I mean it's probably obvious to people but why don't you just talk about how synthetics differs from other Dex's and then therefore how the trading behavior on synthetics differs from another Texas yeah so you know typically other Texas excluding you nice lob and so you know you news welcome synthetics are kind of in their own category of these like period of contract decentralize exchanges but in a typical Dex like wearing out relay or something like that that's using you know 0x protocol you need to find a counterparty to match your border so you know if you want to trade maker and you want to show you $50,000 with the maker they need to be someone on the other side is willing to buy that and you know in any market where your matching counterparties is gonna be slippage and so you know that's something that is kind of exacerbated on Texans and it's one of the reasons why Yunus whop is so powerful because you don't need to wait for a counterparty to trade you just have to accept that there will be some slippage but you'll always get a quote you know you'll never be in a situation where you can't sell you know the the asset or trade the asset that you want to trade it's just a question are you willing to deal with the slippage and synthetics exchanges is kind of similar you can always turn up so long as you've got debt and trade that amount of debt for a different asset and repress it and I think I saw you we're saying that the average trading size on synthetics is a lot higher than another exchanges or at least on other Dex's is that right yeah that's right yeah it's it's typically quite a bit higher because you know you you just have people who want to trade say you have $20,000 or $30,000 that they couldn't trade on on other debts but obviously you're not centralized exchanges there's there's more liquidity because they're just much bigger markets but as the the synthetic asset pool grows as the devil grows you know it's possible that we could see orders of near five million ten million dollars for example alright and so how are fees set on synthetics so at the moment it's a flat 30 basis one fee and then there is an additional fee if you're moving from a long token to a short token when this is again one of the kind of trade offs that we built in to prevent front-running so if you go from s maker which is the long version to AI maker which is the short version you pay 60 basis points and who decides what those fees are well the community side so so we had the fee set at 50 points up until a few days ago and one of the community members put in a proposal to reduce it back to 30 basis points which it kind of has been sitting at historically and that passed pretty unanimously and so the things were updated so it's kind of again you know handled by a rough consensus within a desk or Channel and within the community and we have talked about you know swap a few different times but as far as I entertain you know swap also has been kind of pivotal to the success of synthetics how so so there's this very strong kind of symbiosis I think with uni swap you know when you nice lot was announced it was very obvious to me that it was going to become quite powerful for defy protocols and particularly for us because we need liquid on ramps and off ramps and we need to know that those own are always going to be there you know we need people to be able to get into the Deadpool and out of the devil in order to trade on synthetics exchange and so what we did earlier this year was to incentivize people to put the quiddity into the synthetic ether pool and so that's an out grown to be the largest pool on you nice pop you know and it does typically it's in one of the top exchanges in terms of volume on a daily basis as well and so now you know you can move in and out of synthetics exchange by this uni swap pool and slippage is pretty minimal for you know trades of like ten thousand dollars or so which is pretty good so the average trader trying to move in and out of synthetics is change can go through eating slop pretty comfortably and something that you know we were talked about earlier was how you changed the monetary policy and you know how you started the project one way but it ended up going a different way and you know how you had maybe one thought to do a synthetic stable coin and then later you realize people wanted volatility and I've also heard you talk about the importance of iterations so just with like all the different twists and turns that your project has taken like tell us kind of what the less for you have been and like kind of what the different things are that happen that means you realize like oh it's better to you know go this way then that way I mean I think you know startups just operate that way you know there's a lot of opacity in trying to run a start-up and trying to kind of predict what's going to happen it's almost impossible and you know really you just need to kind of play small bets and respond to what the market says and you know so we we placed a very large bet which you could argue was kind of dumb that regulated stable points wouldn't be a thing and then when all the sudden they were we realized that you know at the market that we were attempting to address had kind of been you know pulled out from under us and you just need to respond to those sorts of things so you know we looked at what we built and we're pretty comfortable that it was a very powerful protocol and would have a lot of value but we just need to define the right market for it and so you know we started issuing assets and again you know another kind of small bet that didn't really play out was this idea that if you had multiple fiat currencies people would be happy to move in between those via currencies and that turned out to really not be the case either there's not a lot of demand for that but what we did see demand for he's you know trading these volatile assets and and having access to a number of different crypto assets and fiat currencies and commodities and other assets on a single platform that was where you know we really started to see public market fit and it generates some real interest don't worry about that moment when you had this confrontation with the trader who had built the bot that you know had nearly a major system insolvent like at that moment what do you feel like the lessons were for you and for other entrepreneurs in the space I mean you know I've been running startups for a long time and most of them have failed my startups tend to do and you know you always have these crisis moments and and I do think there is a point where you know after you've been through so many crises the the you know crises you you kind of become a mirror to them a little bit and you can kind of detach and and not become emotionally invested in what's happening and you in that moment it was really just about okay how do I resolve this specific issue that's right in front of me and not really thinking through you know the implications and consequences but it was almost three hours I think that we were negotiating with him to kind of roll back the system so it was it was pretty high-stress environment but you know again I think having gone through you know similar issues and other startups where you know things blew up you just have to kind of roll with it and you know treat the situation that's in front of you and deal with that directly so something also that's come up a few times in this show is you know you talked about how you made this decision to change your monetary policy and it could just imagine that when you decided that that you thought that that would be a good idea that you might be nervous about presenting it to the community so was there any community input on that and if so how did you factor that in yeah we you know I actually had originally came up with the idea you know almost eight months before before DEFCON 4 and so at DEFCON you know there were a number of people that were stakeholders in project that I kind of pulled aside and said hey what do you think about this and you know it was it was reasonably positive there was definitely some skepticism around it and you know is this just kind of some Hail Mary to try and you know I guess get attention for the project or something like that but you know I was able to kind of make the case I think that you know the issue we had was we weren't properly incentivizing people to understand protocol and you know when you look at things like Bitcoin for example and how Bitcoin generated its network effects it was because it was paying people to understand it you know the protocol itself paid people to learn how to install my own software and understand your block rewards and all that stuff and I think if that didn't exist it probably doesn't get in the traction that that it did and so you know I looked at that and I said we need something similar to incentivize people to care about this into you know to want to actually learn about it and you I think we were able to convince most of them but even still I was pretty surprised I expected a lot of pushback from the community when you know we announced it but interestingly they were they were super positive about it I think mainly because most of them already understood the the networking you know we were essentially saying we're gonna pay you for understanding it and you know people who are not actively participating will be punished and so you know it was it was much more positively received than I expected by a very very wide margin yeah and this is kind of like a theme of the conversation where there's this tension because certain elements of what you're doing are centralized at least at the moment but then you know just even the things like you know when I asked about the exchange fees and stuff you said oh well actually that was you know set by the people in the discord and like that the defy index was decided by community members so what it you know what is going on with governance like right now I know you guys have a foundation but at some point I think you'd like to move to a dow so what's your vision for how this will be governed yeah I mean you know obviously we're we're quite a small team I think people don't realize how small our team is and you know how how hard-working the the engineers and everyone of the team is to kind of keep the project going but it's just impossible for you know seven or eight people to kind of anticipate everything that could happen you know we can respond to things but but trying to kind of understand where we should go next just requires the inside of a much larger group of people and so you know the community has kind of you know really stepped up and become pivotal in helping us to you know understand where we need to go next and see some of the issues and you know oftentimes we don't necessarily immediately agree you know the the core team might kind of look at proposal and say oh we don't think that's a great idea but you know the rough consensus model kind of allows for those debates and those discussions to kind of evolve over time and you know most of the time we kind of reached consensus both internally within the team and within the community and are able to kind of you know move forward but it's just not possible with a project as complex as this is to not have that outside input and so we really try to foster it as much as possible and be as open as we can to dependent bringing in those outside views but then I mean for the future do you think that you might move to it ow I think I think we might you know it's something that we're we're looking at right now you know in order for us to I guess stay ahead of the the kind of potential regulatory issues that are coming up we need to not be in control of protocol and so you know rough consensus is helpful and bring in those external parties but at some point we need to I guess relinquish control you know the protocol upgradability and so that's something that we're looking at you know that potentially could be managed by a down but you know it's something that we obviously need to I guess you know understand a little bit better and work through what the implementation looks like as well as you're working with the community and and letting them kind of I guess help us to understand what they want from from that because you know if you if you move to Unchained governance and you implement it Dow and the Dow is kind of controlled by this plutocracy as we've seen in a couple of other projects kind of emerge I think it has a really chilling effect on participation within within the community and so we're we're really wary of trying to thread that needle and kind of manage that I guess and as mentioned earlier you guys also did an IC o---- and I think he raised about 30 million is that right in 2018 yeah yeah that's right and and I believe from a conversation that we had you think it was maybe from about 70,000 wallets is that right so there's about 70,000 wall to hold our token but a lot of that came from a very large airdrop that we did that was I think about 65,000 wallets so there were about five or six thousand people who participate in the sale you know in there in the open sale and then you know there were bounties and air drops and things like that okay well in addition to that you also recently did a small VC raise like what was the purpose of that raise so you know we have a large Treasury obviously that you know is mainly ask next tokens and it was really about bringing in I guess some new stakeholders and and there had been a lot of interest in people participating in in the protocol and you know one of the challenges I guess of having not that much liquidity in the spot markets is that if someone wants to get you know two three four five million tokens they really can only get it from the foundation and so as that demand grew and and more people were interested we started to kind of you know have some conversations and fete those people and we ended up going with framework Ventures who've been amazing that you know they're participating in all aspects of the system they're kind of helped to work on the inflationary challenge as well so you know we I think we picked the right team to kind of come in and help us but you know we need as I said to bring in external stakeholders and people who can kind of help to push things forward so you know if you find the right people in the future we'll probably look at you know selling tokens out of the Treasury to them as well to to get them into the ecosystem and there were also rumors about entries and Horowitz taking an interest what was that about I mean you know there's a visit wallet that is controlled by by a 16z that has this next tokens in it it didn't come from at the foundation directly but you know it looks like they're they do have a position in it synthetics if you look on chain so you know I can't really find it much more information than that because yeah that's that's findable I know but you know there's a lot of people in our community who are very good with the chain analysis and really what got what was coming on and and you know it was on Twitter before I knew anything about it so it was kind of an interesting incident I guess there are so many incidents like that in crypto oh no well yes like the whole space in other interviews that you've mentioned that you have confidence that decentralized finance will consume centralized finance eventually but that right now there's a lot of challenges what are the the biggest challenges I think the main challenge is that we still haven't abstracted enough complexity away for you know the average user and that kind of flows all the way through the stack right so you know user interfaces and user experience is still you know pretty far behind centralized finance I think you know the other issue is there's a lot of friction getting money in and out of the system getting value into the system so you know it's gonna take at least you know a few years I think before we can kind of bring all of this this kind of complexity much lower and just remove it and it kind of provide I guess experiences for users and products for users without them needing to really understand what's happening in the background alright well we'll see how you and others resolve all these problems are all these challenges where can people learn more about you and synthetics best place is probably to you know if you really want to dive in to jump into a disc or channel but you know you can go to synthetics on i/o if you want to have a look at the system and get an overview we also have a dashboard which is dashboard synthetic star IO which gives an overview of the network which is kind of cool you can see all the different since and what the open interest is etc great well thanks for coming on unchanged thank you very much for having me
