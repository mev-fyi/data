use cipher trace to comply with regulation and to monitor compliance today's guest is Ryan's earner former chief commercial officer and director at the web 3 foundation and former principal and partner at poly chain capital who recently proposed a new Dow that is also called V Dow welcome Ryan hey Laura thanks very much for having me on super excited to be here and talking with you again yeah I'm also excited because I feel like there's this new trend or it's sort of like an old trend that is being revived which is dows and you are proposing one that is basically a throwback to the infamous dow so what is this dough that you were creating yeah so it takes some of the the tenants from the original Dow you know principally that this is a pool of capital both financial and human capital that's designed to you know generate value and and so we're excited about about that mission but then it also has a number of new architecture components to it that were really excited I think the space has moved a long way since the original down in 2016 and now we have sort of the sets of tools and technologies and lessons learned from you know previous mistakes made that we can compose kind of a more thoughtful elegant dhow structure that allows people to come in and participate and generate value and hopefully participate in some of that value and so what are some of these differences or improvements on the original Dow so one really interesting sort of keystone to dowse that I'm very excited about is the the opportunity to have a reputation weighted peer review so what we need is a mechanism where people can come in and and perform work and propose deals and you know make things happen and they can have confidence that if they if they propose great things and values created that they can share in that Val and that upside and that allows you know really talented people the confidence that if they bring their talents here they can you know they can can capture significant value if they generate great value and so I'm really excited about a new set of technologies coming out of protocol labs a project called source cred that mixes some objective components that uses Google Pagerank on things like github commits and discord posts but then also mixes that with some subjective components which is reputation weighted peer review so for example like in the context of protocol labs where the founder of Juan Binet is sort of like the spiritual and and technical leader of that of that team he has a lot more weight when he gives out cred to his team than say somebody who's only been there for a few weeks so having this very thoughtful approach of mixing objective measures like at what you've done them on on github with how you've interacted with your team and what kind of things your team thinks that has generated the most amount of value for that team is a good way to remunerated participants in a decentralized organization and that's really a big step forward for us something that we didn't know and we didn't know how to solve at the time of last Dow we didn't know how people would you know would essentially be paid for their participation in that Dow I like the idea of a more objective measure but the one thing is that some of the components of what you just described are objective and then there's one that to me appears to be subjective which is the one where it's like you know Juan Bonet can rate one of the coders on his team or something because I could see that getting political and then it's sort of like what we saw the financial crisis where the ratings agencies were being paid by things and then therefore they kept giving good grades do you know what I'm saying like like the other things like the github commits and stuff that definitely seems subjective to me but but how you know do you have a way to kind of prevent that other one from becoming a you know you you pat my back I'll Pat yours type situation yeah absolutely and so I think the goal here with this shout doubt generally as well as source cred generally is to try to grandfather end sort of decentralization and a objective approach over time that you start out being probably more highly subjective because on the flip side you know things like github commits and discord posts and things like that could be gamed and now there's there's a really elegant approach to this using Google Pagerank so that it limits gaming but you still can you know effectively game the system in and in some instance so at the start of the project you want to have some level of checks and balances within like the human part of the organization and then slowly migrate to be more and more objective over time so that say as politics would naturally increase in an organization over time in fact you're taking the the edge off of that that political sort of beast so to speak and making things more objective over time thereby limiting the politics in the organization and hopefully then actually leading to an organization that has say less politics in it then then you would otherwise see in an organization that just scales okay yeah and oh yeah man gaming these algorithms that's definitely another really big issue well so another thing I was curious about is like so why why did you decide to revive the Dow I mean that is easily one of the most notorious projects ever in the history of crypto so what made it what motivated you to I guess try to redeem the name so incidentally this started right from from the death of the previous Dow I mean I was really excited about that Dow had then in the blow up sponsor the white hat group and got to know some of them the the great team that that led that white hot group like Geordie ballina and now it's venison in those guys and then after that and really at the start of the Dow I wanted to you know do what I do find good deals and proposed proposed that to the Dow and participate in the Dow as an investor but also work for the Dow and I thought this was kind of the coolest most sci-fi thing I could be doing in the space and it really excited me so then when it blew up I was like okay well I gotta go and find something else to do here and that's what led me to to find all off and cede poly chain and then step into poly chain an operational capacity in the weeks um following its inception and so but I've always really wanted to have the Dow back and today I make the observation that if the Dow had survived today would be the largest capital pool in the space and the quality of the due diligence that we were seeing in those early days of the Dow was far better than anything we saw in the ico craze of you know circa 2017 and so if the Dow had survived a problem would have actually tempered that that hysteria that we saw in 2017 because the bar to to get over and and have the review and the due diligence done by the dau community would have been really high and a lot of teams that went on to race subsequent money in and I SEOs probably would not have had that really important signal from the Dow and the community-led due diligence that I was very very impressed with and so really it's just been a strong internal desire ever since to to like live kind of the true crypto anarchist ideals of working for this kind of sci-fi futuristic organization and then also a recognition that it was doing really good work at that time and so I would like to see the experiment be played out in its entirety and see if we can't you know crowdsource deal flow and if we can't get great decisions and strategy using the wisdom of the crowd I think it could be really compelling and then I've spent a lot of time in China over the last year and have found that really for me web 3 is happening in China more than anywhere else on the planet and I've been really inspired by a lot of the work from that developer community and fact that they're you know really using this stuff and I would love for a mechanism that allows a kid in Beijing who may not have a you know government ID but may be a really badass coder be able to contribute some you know some of the capital that she has but then also contribute some of the the intellect that she has and be able to work for this thing and and understand that if she works hard and she does contribute significant value to to this organization that she can she can you know be remunerated and be recognized and be proud of the work that she does and so i think the tools have come together now and we've had enough experiments with douse that that we can that we can revisit this this grand experiment once thought Larry we're gonna discuss how this down will work as well as the legality of it but first isn't word from the sponsors who make this show possible will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate

back to my conversation with Ryan sir so why don't you briefly describe kind of what the structure is for this Dow and how it's gonna work sure so I would recommend anybody who's interested to go and take a look at the white paper on the github github slash the - doubt em you know we're super open to feedback from from anyone but essentially at the top level you have a clean capital pool that anybody can on board or or off board from onboarding to her upward from and then the work of managing a professional fund is all pushed down to what we call leagues and these leagues are our dows in and of themselves that are service organizations and they perform services for the down there and they're paid by the now via and inflation mechanism so the Dow only pays out it doesn't pay the underlying capital that it receives so it'll receive say some ether and wrapped Bitcoin and maybe MKR and certainly a lot of dye and things like that and we'll hold the capital pool and then that capital pool you've got a proxy token which is the DAO and then that the dau token inflates in order to make payments payments for services and also payments for investments so the V services necessary to run a professional fund like compliance and ops and you know venture deal flow and treasury management and dev due diligence those are pushed down to the league's and those leagues perform these services for for a fee from the Dow and then the multi-sig certain certain league's come together in order to agree to inflate doubt oaken's in a given mandate to make investments and a mandate is during a period of time a set of leagues will perform a series of activities that is governed by some permissions and intended to create a specific output so for example a mandate could be the league's will deploy 10% of the capital into you know privileged opportunities over the course of one year and no single opportunity can have more than one percent of the Dow I'm deployed into it and you can put on whatever other permissions that you want and so then these people go out find and evaluate deals and and then when those deals are to happen inflight doubt tokens issue those two to the projects the projects then have a token which has an underlying collateral to it somewhat similar to dye or maybe like BnB or something like that and at any point the the project or an investor can redeem the underlying collateral so that's a basket of eath and wrapped BTC and and and Dayan and other things like that but if they want they can just hold that doubt oaken or use that for a payment and it's generally long the space however not as volatile as any of those single underlying assets so we call this stable err coins right it it's a it's sort of a basket coin that you could spin up on mellon port and and be again long crypto by holding it but not irresponsible in being exposed only one asset like Bitcoin or eath or or whatever single asset you would you would take capital into so at a high level that's kind of the the overarching architecture but then we can kind of dive deeper into some of the the principles inherent in this doubt well one of the leeks that I want to ask you about is this compliance League oh because they at least from what I could glean from the white paper they're sort of like the dowel curators which for people who weren't around for the first Dow were a group of people who were kind of like big names in aetherium basically who would essentially kind of vet proposals before they went before the Dow just to make sure that the the people that what they were proposing actually matched their code and that they were the people that they were saying that they were and you know just kind of almost like a verification yeah but so for your compliance leak it's not kind of like a point of centralization and I definitely know that in the SE C's Dao report that the curators were you know one of the key reasons that they expressed that Dow tokens were security since the profits from the Dow could be said to depend on the actions of these curators so how is your compliance link different or is it not are you are you gonna make your down token security tokens or how will that work no so certainly the token it is not a security and within kind of dive dive deeper into that but to to the compliance League so the compliance League itself you know from the first mandate and beyond would be its own doubt the the big question is how do you do the first white listing of the different options of mandates so that you're not Sybil attacked and you endow token holders don't have to decide between you know a hundred different proposals of mandates and then you and then each person has to evaluate those for themselves we want kind of a whitelist so that Dow token holders only if they want to only have to interact with the Dow say once per mandate let's let let's assume that amend eights like a year in time we don't want over participation by Dow token holders so how do we get tool to a whitelisted group of say a multiple choice question ABCD and E being you know four sets of different proposals and then e being none of them you know redo the the mandate proposal period and for that as of right now we propose using Aragon court as a as an initial whitelisting mechanism Aragon Court is a decentralized dispute resolution process that can be used for some esoteric decisions such as this and we're working with Aragon to have an appeal mechanism that would go to the dow token holders so that you're not say subject to ante holders now we've seen Aragon and the Aragon token holders make very coherent dare I say intelligent decisions as a group thus far so we can use that as a whitelisting mechanism to start and then from there once you've decided on a compliance Li which should hopefully be you know a collection of lawyers adequately you know geographically dispersed and and so on and so forth they act in that compliance fair manner as a check and balance for all the deployments but they don't act alone right so let's say you're making an investment into into a project that investment requires a multi-sig to be signed off between the Treasury who makes sure that it checks if the the investment is in line with the permission so in our example say not above 1% of total assets under management and so on and so forth it has to be proposed by the venture League was founded the deal and basically negotiated the deal it would need to have a check from the developer League so that technical due diligence is done has been done and then it needs to have a check from the compliance League which again is a Gao hopefully made up by lawyers around the world who who will check that you know we're not doing anything inherently wrong here and say like funding a dark Dao or something that that that shouldn't be funded and these being doubts in and of themselves I would argue is not necessarily a point of centralization or it's decentralized enough that it's not say just a committee in a room the way that the original whitelisting process was set up for the original Dao we thought a little bit further on that and created a series of checks and balances between these different entities and one other thing that's important here is so let's say the compliance League you know turns malicious or any one of the league's turns malicious there's a mechanism that we call a bene switch and this is named after Benedict Arnold the famous American trader that quickly allows doubt token holders to stake and make a proposal for a new mandate vote and switch out a malicious league so if you've accidentally voted in a mandate where league where a league is acting maliciously or maybe it maybe even just incompetent not not acting maliciously but just not in line with the ideals of the Dow you can quickly switch them out on the staking mechanism which again these more advanced crypto economic models lead us to the conclusion that you know it's very very difficult to classify this as equity and I would argue that the you know the attempt to to say classify something this complex as a security isn't just trying to fit a round peg into a square hole it's really trying to fit an octahedron peg into a square hole right that's it that's an E theorem joke I guess but it makes sense I mean this is quite a different animal from a traditional security well so how much do you aim to raise and when do you think this will be deployed so we would like to get this out somewhere around the end of the year however I've been fortunate and very grateful to accompany many project launches in this space and I understand very cutely that the security audit process it can often delay projects and this will be one of the most robust security audit processes that are spaces that will be away no amount of resources will be spared and ensuring that could you imagine if this like blue echo oh my goodness I'm amazed that you're laughing at that of course I'm laughing but all right and then actually we're over time but just one last question why are you calling it doh just like the old doubt so it's really to be honest a placeholder until a you know until the community comes up with a name that they resonate Ryan don't you know that the old name was also a placeholder yeah but it just fits so well right it's just like we had an honest man we had dozens of different names up until now and they're kind of floating around and early versions like originally actually was called um VC doubt not like venture capital Dow but value creation doubt but then it just you know we we just decided to embrace embrace what it is and I went in and spend some time with Christian gents who was kind of the the the spiritual and technical leader of the original Dow and asked him for his feedback and blessing on the use of that name and and we had a good joke on how you know it was just a placeholder then and it's kind of a placeholder now and hopefully if if we you know we can get to a point where the community scales I'm optimistic that you know if the wisdom of the crowd leads to good investments the wisdom and the crowd will lead to good nomenclature and so we'll find a we'll find a name over time and if not I'm perfectly happy with the name the way that it is all right all right well we'll see if that ends up being a curse or a blessing that you're matching the down already on those points all right well it was great having you well thank you so much no oh yeah no it's been fun I mean yeah when I was reading this I was like this is definitely very interesting it's definitely very new very different in certain ways from the previous dose oh yeah it's one of these citizens at this point in my career in the space I just want to work on something that feels really inspiring and sci-fi that I can't let go around and and share the ideals of this type of community with with people all around the world and yeah well one thing is actually reading it I was like oh this really draws on ryan's experience yeah certainly my fingerprints are are are in different points and it's very much designed to really disrupt the kind of the mental models and and I'd kind of start-up economics in Silicon Valley which I don't understand why they continue to permeate that way and and and hopefully we can create a community that's centered around delivering great value and I'm excited to watch the experiment unfold yeah me too for sure okay all right well thanks for coming on
