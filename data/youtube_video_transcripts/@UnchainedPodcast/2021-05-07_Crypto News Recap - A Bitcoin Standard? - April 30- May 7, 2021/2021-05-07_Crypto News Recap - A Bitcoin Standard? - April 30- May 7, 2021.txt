crypto isn't so fun on this week's unchained the pod ended with annabelle huang partner at amber group giving advice for women thinking about going into crypto saying for the women out there who are thinking about this it's not as crazy as you think that's why i had to laugh at a recent thread posted by john sue marketing director at bright loom that certainly pumps the brakes on romanticizing the crypto lifestyle and gives some insight on what actually goes on behind the scenes i recommend the whole thread but i'll end the show with my favorite lamentation regarding poor sleep cycles for crypto founders john writes crypto never sleeps and guess what that also means that you never sleep half your audience is in the west the other half is in the east singapore time is almost entirely during sleeping hours in the u.s have fun with that perhaps going all in on crypto might be as crazy as john depicts but as i can attest leaping into crypto is totally worth it alright thanks for
