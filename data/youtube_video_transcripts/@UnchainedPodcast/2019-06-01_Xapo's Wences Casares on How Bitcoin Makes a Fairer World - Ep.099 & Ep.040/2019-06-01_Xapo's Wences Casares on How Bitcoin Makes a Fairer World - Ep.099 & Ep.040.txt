vaults and wallet company Zabu welcome wences Thank You Laura for having me in the show you're a serial entrepreneur who founded Argentina's first Internet service provider in Latin America's first online brokerage firm and you serve on the board of PayPal which isn't a small company and yet you've often said you think the coin will be bigger than the Internet why well I can imagine a world in which if Bitcoin succeeds for a few billion people if you ask them where they prefer that you take away their internet which is access to information or their Bitcoin which is access to their money that they'd rather and have you take away their internet but not their Bitcoin and I also heard you say that I you believe the unbanked are what what number is that there's a billion to 1.2 billion people who have a checking account and a debit card or a credit card away you and I understand those products everybody else has much much more restricted access to very basic banking services they may have a bank account that the post office that it only lets you make deposits and some good rolls but not really make payments much less use it online etc and you said that you've understood or that you understood bitcoins potential early because you saw your family lose all its money three times while you were growing up due to actions by the central bank what happened at those times I grew up in Patagonia in southern Argentina and growing up I saw my family lose everything three times every time it was because of something that the government and or the banks the first time that I have a memory of that there was a massive hyperinflation where prices were changing constantly every day literally sometimes several times a day and how old were you when that was happening I was fifteen that was in 1989 and what do you mean when you saying you saw the price has change every day I remember my mom came to take us out of school in the middle of the morning she'd never done that before me and my two sisters and she was carrying two plastic bags full of cash and that was she had been paid her salary she was a receptionist at the government Bureau and with a modest salary and that money salary took two plastic bags full of cash and she took us to the supermarket and she gave us each an aisle with a list of things and we met at the cashier and when there was some money left after that she sent us back to get more stuff to spend all the money and when one of my sisters asked her why don't we save some money for tomorrow my mom explained that tomorrow it was not gonna be worth as much and at the time there were no barcodes or computer systems as we see them today so there was one person who worked for the supermarket whose job was to change the prices and our job was to go in front of that person the person went through all the aisles putting the new prices and when they finish it started again so you literally saw the prices change before this person our job was to be ahead of that person it's crazy but I saw it happen well done well that is that is really crazy so you also said that you saw these times when you know when I guess money was affected in Argentina that you saw it change the conversations your parents had or you saw the people around you becoming desperate what did you see people saying and doing and what do you feel was the lesson you learned after those experiences my memory of those events is not really an economic or even a financial memory my I was a kid so my what I remember is sort of quite emotional and what I remember is the discussions my parents had because of what was going on and and their their frapps creation and their anxiety and how everybody else around us was having the same issues and it was like a collective state of panic and distrust nobody trusted anyone with anything it felt like the very basic fabric that keeps society together was breaking apart and and it took a long time something that broke very quickly took a very long time to rebuild I have a very clear memory of how this impacted worse the people who who didn't have any way to protect themselves from them some some people who are are better off we're able to either buy property to keep the money safe in the form of property or even have a bank account abroad or other things like that but most people who don't have much money didn't have any of those options and those were the ones who were hit hardest and as you know a lot of Bitcoin believers at least especially in the early days were big libertarians but I don't know if I've ever really heard that kind of rhetoric from you but I would imagine that these experiences would give you those kinds of beliefs did it I have a lot of respect for libertarians and sympathy for a lot of those ideas I am more pragmatic than I'm a libertarian and it's hard for me to imagine a world without a government maybe it's my unlimited imagination but I do think that there is an important role for government and I believe that we're better off with the right amount of government often I would like to see less government but but the libertarian idea of absolutely no government doesn't is hard for me I wouldn't consider myself a libertarian that way it's true that a lot of the libertarian ideas are are appealing and interesting and I have a lot of respect for them but but I do think that there is a place for government and that it's hard for us to live without money and how did you first learn about Bitcoin I first learned about Bitcoin because a friend of mine from Argentina suggested that I send money using Bitcoin in 2011 I need a group of childhood friends were contributing to a common project and I was already living in California and at the time Argentina had banned all forms of sending money and you couldn't pay pal wasn't working in Argentina Western Union wasn't working and it was very complicated you had to send the money to the Central Valley and then there was a way to claim it from the central bank but it was very very hard for no more people to do so wait why did they ban things like PayPal because this is very recent Laura 2011 Argentina had currency controls so you couldn't the the peso wasn't freely convertible and you couldn't send money and they were all these controls for you not to be able to send money the only one who could buy and sell pesos at it was the central bank and and they had a control of you know every dollar that comes in and out of the country so anyway this friend of mine said hey why don't I was trying to figure out if my sister could give my friends the money in Argentina and then I could somehow pay my sister some other time and one of my friends said hey why don't you look at Bitcoin what's Bitcoin and this is a friend who is not very much into technology not very much into fine and so I was skeptical and I looked into it I found someone who was willing to sell me some Bitcoin in person from this person in Craigslist we met at a cafe in Palo Alto I broke two thousand dollars in cash and we did a transaction with with our phones via QR code I gave him the two thousand dollars he gave me $2,000 worth of Bitcoin when I was walking back to my office in Palo Alto I sent the Bitcoin to my friend in Argentina and then I some time later that day I was my desk and my friend I mean even saying thank you I got the Bitcoin I already sold them I have the pesos in my hand and I was like wow would it just happen and that's when I started trying to learn as much as I could about it huh and so I just wonder you know we were talking about your personal story and as everybody says you were bitcoins patient zero in Silicon Valley and I just wonder was there anything about your personal story you know with the way that you saw money Handelman in Argentina that predisposed you just seeing the potential in Bitcoin huh yeah absolutely I don't think I would have understood it or believed in it if you weren't for the things so growing up in Argentina to me it was very clear and always frustrating that the government's take advantage of the people who are weakest if you will and I always thought that technology would change that but forever he had not and when I saw it Connie was the first time that I said oh my god maybe this is the answer maybe this has all all the the qualities to be able to let people protect themselves from what governments and sometimes banks do so yeah I think it would have been hard for me to understand that if I had not grown up in Argentina and seen the things I've seen even though it wasn't an immediate thing I took me about six months to go from very skeptical to all-in into Bitcoin and a lot of a lot of reading a lot of playing around with technology with a with with a client mining meeting people learning from them it was quite a journey for me and whenever I'm telling people about Bitcoin for the first time I tried to remember that it took me quite a long time to to get my arms around it too well yeah so I was wondering going back to how you did get so many other people in Silicon Valley interested in it you know obviously I'm sure many of them had grown up in the US where obviously the financial system is quite different from the way it works in Argentina so how did you get them to understand the import of it in in general did you find it easy or difficult for them to grasp I find that it's very hard to explain Bitcoin in the u.s. is probably the hardest country and just like Argentina maybe one of the easiest the u.s. maybe one of the hardest and I think it makes sense because when you talk about money to an American it's a little bit like talking about water to a fish you know I'm sure the fish don't even know that water exists is invisible to them no you're talking about money has always worked for American transport for them and for their parents and the grandparents they always use the same form of money in Argentina each generation has discarded some form of currency at least once and probably more than once right imagine that for some crisis you get rid of the dollar and you have a new currency a new American currency that it's called something different but not dollar it sort of just changes significantly how you see money and take it as this given instrument that works but it makes you question a lot a lot of things that if money has always worked for you you'll never question so I went now we're from twelve thousand eleven to two thousand thirteen I really didn't convince anybody I tried I tried super hard people were making fun of me and oh here comes once a Bitcoin again and I think well time health but quite frankly the the price action helped a lot right when when the bid comprised began to move a lot in 2013 people begin to pay attention and and there was a little bit of sort of chicken and egg there and at a conference with a lot of important people from Silicon Valley were all present I started circulating Bitcoin from phone to phone just to show you know that I didn't know any other way you could do that just move a lot large amount of money so easily and yeah well I have spoken about this movement before in the podcast because it's a scene in a Daniel poppers book and it's pretty striking at least for me being a reporter who covers finest because the amount that you guys passed around from phone to phone was a quarter of a million dollars so for someone reading that it's like wow like I did it for effect right just for for show just to say well show me any other way you know in which we could be doing this and we were in a circular table about ten or twelve people all around and he went all around the table from phone to phone until he came back to me and that happened the first night at this conference and all the people the the it cost quite an impression the people at that table but then they began to spread it and you could see the price move as it spread through this conference and I think for me that was a moment where something tipped and people were a lot more receptive and then they started buying that they were buying start moving the price and and then it becomes sort of a virtuous circle I know what year was that that was 2000 either the end of 2012 or 13 or the beginning of 13 can't remember okay okay yeah 2013 was the year when I started moving up so out of all the businesses you could have done with Bitcoin why did you choose to build zappa with you know the vaults the wallet the debit card I once I understood Bitcoin I became very very optimistic that if Bitcoin succeeds it may be the biggest leap forward we've ever seen in the democratization of money and he will make for a much much more equal and fair world in my opinion but the fact that it succeeds is not a given it could still fail so I decided that I want to spend the rest of my career helping Bitcoin succeed I don't see this as a job where I am running a company to make the company grow and make money that's not what motivates me what motivates me is when I am old and hopefully my grandkids come and ask me hey grandpa what did do you do with your career I want to be able to say you know what I was part of a large group of people who help it go and succeed and for me the best way to help it succeed I see sup was a platform to help it can succeed and we tap on we focus on what we see as a biggest bottlenecks to success which right now in our opinion are security make make it so it's very safe for you two to hold VidCon to buy Bitcoin receive sand and whole Bitcoin and an ease of access there's a lot of friction between someone deciding that they want on Bitcoin and actually getting those Bitcoin right and and it's different challenges in each country and how do you turn cash into Bitcoin in India is very different than in the US and it's very different than in Turkey is very country specific or and or with a local bank transfer etc so subbu is an instrument to help it can succeed where we focus on what we see as the biggest friction for for Bitcoin to become what hopefully will be the the most widely held asset in the history of humanity and when you were talking about how converting the bitcoins to local currency is different in different countries like Turkey and in India do you have to I guess get special thinking relationships in each of those countries for people to use your services there it depends on on each country there are countries where you can do it without a banking relationship it depends on the current infrastructure of the country there there countries that have very well-developed cash collection networks cash collection and cash disbursement networks and those networks already are used to doing cash collection or disbursement for our digital uses our for for other type of spend that happens worldwide in in those cases you can work with them without any banking relationship and in some other countries the the most the cash collection and disbursement networks with the most capillarity are the banking networks and in those countries you need to have a banking partner but it is different in each country it's very very different in each country very country specific and you also told me a few years ago that 96% of your customers account for 4% of the dollar value of the transactions and that 4% of your customers account for 96 percent of the dollar value transactions or some some ratio like that are those ratios still the same today and if so why does it break out like that we serve a lot of institutions who want to hold Bitcoin no the the some of them make it public that we are their custodian like the the public instruments to hold beacon in the US like like gbtc gbtc in the US or xbt in Europe or CVT in can they they all have to to make their custodian publican and they all use support as the custodian of their Bitcoin we have many other customers like them who have very large amount of Bitcoin that may represent anywhere from 10 20 50 million dollars and sometimes in excess of 200 million dollars so those customers are a very small percentage of our customers but they represent a lot of the bitcoins that we have in custody and that's why it's so concentrated mostly because of these institutional customers who have very very large amount so imagine how many if we have some fund who has 200 million dollars in Bitcoin that represents a couple million customers in in Asia right so that's why it's so concentrated okay and for the smaller customers like the ones in Asia that you mentioned what are they using Zappos services for mostly people are using us as a way to buy Bitcoin and hold Bitcoin we are not seeing a lot of Bitcoin payment activity and at there at the retail level and small transactions most of the payment that we see it's cross-border where someone from one country is paying someone else in a different country a part of that it's hard for us to know exactly what what they are paying for some of that could be remedies but a lot of that is just cross-border goods and services and I believe a while back you also said you thought people were using them for mobile phone payments but has that changed now that the fees have risen yes we've seen a lot of payment use cases slow down or almost disappear because of the higher fees we have a lot of transactions that happen within SAPO right because the this the supportive supple transactions don't need to go through the blockchain so they don't they can happen in real time for free and so today we see about 20 support to support transactions for every transaction that we run through a blockchain oh wow okay and let's talk about your storage solution how do you store the bitcoins that your customers entrust to you we keep 97% of all the because we have in custody in deep cold storage which means that it sits on servers that have never been online and will never be online that are inside a vault deep underground in different types of bunkers we have five bunkers globally we make public our main bunker vault location in Switzerland but we have other bunkers in other another continent and basically to take bitcoins out of that cold storage we work with skimming which each Bitcoin address that we control has five private keys of which three are needed to move the kids we did it that way so we can lose two locations to natural disaster or theft and still have the ability to move the coins to a safe location or a safe address if for whatever reason we thought that that address wasn't safe anymore so we we have five private keys for each address and we keep each private key in a different location we'll run a process daily where we send transactions to be process basically withdrawals from from the vault and we need to get at least three of those signatures back to be able to to move the coins it's a very manual process well I was just wanting how you prevent employees from stealing customers bitcoins the process is designed assuming that you could have not only one but a number of rogue employees that could collude to try to get bitcoins so all the processes are aside so no so even if you have a bad actor oven or a number of mobile actors that are coordinating they cannot take bitcoins out right so no not one person can access the customers by themselves do you worry about Zappo being undercut by some new competitors that are coming online like there's a new custody solution coming out from coinbase coinbase custody and ledger the hardware while it is is coming out with ledger enterprise there's actually another one in stealth mode do you worry about being undercut by these competitors no not really I think that at this at this stage it is a very nascent industry and we need a lot more people doing what we're doing to really make sure that the entire world is using Bitcoin I would worry if we were the only ones because I think Bitcoin would have a very small chance of succeeding if there's only one decent custody solution so I think we need a lot more I I used to to run an online bank in the year 2000 in Europe and we were the first one in several European market and we were spending a lot of advertising dollars on TV basically to get people to have an online bank account that paid a lot of interest and we the money that we didn't have to spend in branches we spend it in advertising and paying more interest and this worked extremely well and because he worked really well we had a lot of large banks copy us and our first reaction was like oh my god this is gonna destroy us it we're gonna share this pie with a lot more play with many more players very very aggressive all of them they were all spending more than we were spending on and TV advertising but our numbers kept getting bigger every week and it was like hard to understand what's happening how can it be that we have one new competitor two new competitors each one spending more than we're spending now three competitors now all of them spending each one of them more than we were spending and the numbers keep growing and what happened in that case is at the Oh season this was a new category and more players advertising it heavily created a sense of sort of created a category made market realized that this was an option to have an online bank account where you put your savings because you have better return etc and I feel the same way with with Bitcoin I think it'd be very hard to make this market happen and if we were by ourselves or if any company was by themselves it takes a very large occur systems of trustworthy companies to make something like this happen and why not offer your custody solution for more than just Bitcoin right now I don't have the conviction I have for Bitcoin I haven't developed it for any other crypto asset and I can explain to any of our customers why I think it's a good idea to own a little bit of Bitcoin but very often I can't explain why I think it's a good idea to own something else so I just don't want to be I don't want to be responsible for making people make bad financial decisions if at some point that changes there is a crypto asset that seems that has the same risk reward and potential a Bitcoin has I'd be happy to serve it but right now I have I do not feel like that about any other crypto asset we're going to talk about the failed Segway 2x hard fork and Bitcoin cash but first I'd like to take a quick break to

for being such a fabulous sponsor of this show potential sponsors this ad spot could be yours if you or your company is interested in sponsoring unchained please send an email to Laura chin podcast at gmail.com that's la you are a Shi n podcast at gmail.com I'm talking with Wednesday's Casares the CEO and founder of zap Oh when sis you supported the segment 2x hard fork and when that failed you tweeted quote bitcoins most important quality is it censorship resistant the rest will follow I got too impatient with 2x pictures also took too long to download in the early internet bitcoin will eventually be able to process more payments the day you tweeted that I actually I did I ran the numbers the transaction fees were on average 10 dollars and 37 cents and within a few weeks the Bitcoin price skyrocketed rising to nearly $20,000 and with all that activity in the blockchain the average transaction fees also skyrocketed and they rose to as high as 59 dollars and 70 cents on December 22nd since then they've come down to about $8 and do you think it was a mistake to not go through with a Segway 2x hard fork do you think that your site was proven right that the hard fork was needed at that time no I think that our site was proven wrong in the way we wanted to do that block increase I I think that it may be a good idea I still think that it may be a good idea to increase the block size so we give more time to the second layer solutions to be market ready but I think that the way we were trying to do it was the wrong way to go about it and for me the biggest learning from the failure to the 2x upgrade is that protocols have a very different way of evolving than companies do and even if we have a very good intuition for for the timing of companies and for the cadence of companies and you know to get a sense of something has traction or doesn't have traction in the context of a calm bunny is very very different from having the same intuitions or correct intuitions for a protocol right if you look at technology overall and you look at the companies that have been the dominant companies in technology over the years it used to be that Intel was dominant company we had a time where son an Oracle were the dominant companies there was another many years in which Microsoft was a dominant company and I won what Google was dominant company now we have this dis landscaping with Facebook Apple Google Amazon are very dominant but it's hard to find the company now has had that dominance for more than 10 years it's quite fluid and change is very thematic very dynamically very quickly when you look at the same landscape for protocols it completely different you know we started using Ethernet protocol about 40 years of ours 30-something years ago and still if you have cables at home it would be hard to find something different than that Ethernet and same thing for tcp/ip it's protocol that powers the internet or HTTP for the web or SMTP for emails once these protocols get established they stay there forever they don't change the way companies do and they and having to if you as a journalist Laura had to report on the evolution of Ethernet or SMTP would have been a very boring job for a report to say because it took a long time and every day there's a little bit more of everything but nothing really creates report on oh there's more users there's a little bit more capacity there's a little bit more usage what have you and I think that bitcoin it's an over probably it's a protocol it's not a company and it's developing more like those protocols Anik then then then a company and if I am impatient that's my problem that's not a big problem because all the patience in the world it doesn't have a board it doesn't have capital it doesn't have earnings it has all the patience in the world and if you are impatient that's your problem not the protocols problem and that was for me the biggest lesson from the way we try to do the block increase so I'm not concerned about the level of fees today I think that eventually Bitcoin will be able to process all the transactions that people may want to do that there and they will be able to very quickly and very cheaply it just may take a little while just like it took a little while for the internet to power Netflix there was for many years in which that seemed impossible but it would have been wrong to bet against the internet because of that so you've talked about how impactful you think Bitcoin will be in the developing world but now with fees ranging from $8 to $60 what kind of impact do you think Bitcoin will have there I think this doesn't this doesn't change things right people can I was never pitching Bitcoin for payment I always said that I think that the first stage of Bitcoin is to get established as a store of value and once hundreds of millions of people own Bitcoin as a store of value and more people own Bitcoin than ever owned gold or dollars it will naturally turn into an important payment mechanism but this first stage which may take another five years at least and maybe a decade a solo or a store of value and you have never heard me pitch otherwise so I am as concerned with fees today as I was four years ago which is not really care about them now and by the time it becomes a payment mechanism the fees will not be a problem well when it comes to being a store of value you've often made that pitch because it's scarce and there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins but how well does that argument hold up now that we have Bitcoin cash ethers e-cash Manero all these other crypto assets do you still believe and you've said this before that you believe Bitcoin will someday or could someday be worth 1 million dollars do you still believe that I still believe that Bitcoin that is there's a higher than 50% chance that Bitcoin will be worth more than a million dollars in five to ten years and I think that the as you know there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash and all other 800 cryptocurrencies do not change that I think that we have to figure out a lot we are all learning and there are a lot of things that we have to figure out but in my opinion the market will eventually figure out that there's that Bitcoin is in a league of its own when it comes to how much we can trust it and the censorship persistence and the robustness of the protocol overall and I think we are going through a period in which we Durst we're all learning and doing a little bit of discovery of new things and I know not unlike what happened with the dot-com boom where there were a lot of assets that were overvalued and hidden within those assets there were gems that were undervalued but I think we're seeing the same the same process here well let's talk about Bitcoin cash even some of the die-hard Bitcoin core supporters admit that Bitcoin cash is now trying to fill fulfill the original vision of the Bitcoin white paper which is the version of the coin that you originally fell in love with so why don't you support Bitcoin cash I would put it another way which is why should I support it if you tell me well because you want to do cheaper transactions I would say I would rather use light kinda because it's cheaper and it's an hour faster transactions again I would use light coin is faster than Bitcoin cash so with protocols it doesn't really matter which one is the best protocol it only matters which one is the most in use and in the case of Bitcoin in particular and cryptocurrencies I'd say the only things that matter the hashing power number one the number of users number two and the number of transactions number three and in all of those numbers bitcoin is in a league of its own right and so I could make the pitch that then I have a protocol that competes with email that is much better than the email protocol because the email protocol handle spam very well and you cannot prove the identity of the sender and it's pretty poor to handle attachments and video boys etc so it's not hard to come up with a better email protocol is quite easy actually it just hard to get people to use it the same thing with this it doesn't really matter it's hurtful for me too I think it's a mistake to engage or or follow a currency just because it may have temporarily better functionality a lot of people made that mistake with the internet where they bet against the internet for other protocols because supposedly the internet was never gonna be good enough for video or good enough for voice or good enough for a number of things and they were wrong and I think the same is true with Bitcoin and what about etherium you know in terms of the different kind of characteristics that you were saying were important to look at I mean I think etherium would score well in those you know there's definitely an extremely vibrant developer ecosystem obviously there's a lot of users and we've already seen in this past year just how quickly things can take off in aetherium such as you know with additional coin offerings and the crypto kitties so definitely there seems to be a lot of activity on that blockchain what do you think about aetherium I think it's maybe the most interesting thing going on in the space outside of Bitcoin I think that there are a number of companies developing the technology so all of that functionality that we learn through aetherium we haven't generally to be able to run on top of the Bitcoin blockchain just like we forget now but at the beginning of the internet there were people who were betting that we were gonna use the Internet only for low latency low bandwidth applications like the web and email but for high bandwidth applications we were gonna use x.25 so you and for no latency applications we were gonna use frame relay which is equivalent of saying we're gonna have one network for the web another one for Skype another one for Netflix and that even though we may make a lot of technical sense it didn't happen that way you know all of the track there's only one transport layer that matters in the world today and that's tcp/ip or the Internet everything whether it's voice video data of any kind if it's moving its most likely moving on top of tcp/ip or the Internet I think the same is true for value if something settles in any form of value eventually you will have Bitcoin underneath and it may happen in higher layers but it's most likely I will it will be one prevailing blockchain for values there may be other block chains for things that do not have to do with value but today Bitcoin is in a league of its own in terms of being something that is really trustless and it's really uncensored and robust so I think we will learn a lot from other cryptocurrencies including etherium but a lot of the best lessons will be implemented on top of Bitcoin and why do you think it will happen that way rather than a theory I'm just continuing to grow because it already has so much traction Bitcoin makes in a week more users than a theory I made it in its lifetime right actually more users and all of the other cryptocurrencies made in a lifetime theorem is still controlled by a person they've already shown that they can change the blockchain by just saying so that that is very very very far from from Bitcoin were the only the only block chain that has a combination of hashing power and that is distributed enough where there's nobody really who can change it or control it and that's at the at the core of any blockchain how it's a blockchain different from a database it's because nobody can control it the only one who is really not not controllable or an sensor or that scale today is Bitcoin it may be that you're right Laura and and the in the future is not written I'm just giving you my my my opinion it may be that that a plays out in a different way I just don't see it it's hard for me where I sit to believe that yeah and I don't want anyone to think that the question that I asked is my opinion or my view that it will happen that way when I am looking at how things might go going forward I can see it going in you or you know the way that you outlined however I definitely cannot ignore how much traction aetherium has and so I sometimes wonder oh is this you know gonna eclipse Bitcoin you know I don't I don't have a particular opinion about how it's gonna go but I could see it happening either way at the very beginning of the internet there were none Internet services like American line and CompuServe who made very similar arguments is like look the Internet is cute but it's very slow and complicated and so we just use computer or just use the American line don't use the Internet and we will give you graphs and we have these cute sounds and even some video and all these things that the internet cannot do right and it's true and for a period of time they were important and and but but open always wins in technology and in this case open and sensor all and and completely trustless and so so yeah there there may be a there may be a time where there's a place for that it's hard to imagine a world in which we need multiple protocols for the same thing okay well one other thing I wanted to ask you about was you I think in your video with Dan Shulman of PayPal you outlined a vision where a Bitcoin is used as the global standard for foreign exchange how can you describe that vision and then also describe how we got to that point I think that if Bitcoin succeeds he will become a global standard of value and a global standard of settlement a global we had a global standard of value for 5000 years and we haven't had one for about 500 years or the last 500 years the global standard of value have been the currency of the dominant of a dominant power and the first one was the Portuguese for about a hundred years or the their currency was used globally then after that the Spanish then the Dutch then the French and now the American dollar for so for over a hundred years and before that these 500 years gold was the the value and gold is the one that resembles most Bitcoin in that it wasn't controlled by any one country and it was truly a political the way bitcoin is a political we we take it for granted today that if we want to make a comparison of like I said in that in that talk say if I want to compare the square footage of the first cabin my grandfather had in Patagonia in 1940 with the square footage of some grandparent of yours Laura came to the US and had cabin or house somewhere it's very easy to compare the square foot try this your father had a house that was 1500 square foot and my grandfather had one that was a thousand square foot and when we want to compare how much they paid for it even if we have access to the exact amount they paid we have to adjust that number to compare them and we can use adjust them to inflation or we can even inflation we have to choose inflation of probably the currency that we're using or we can turn it into some other into gold at the time there are many different ways we can adjust it and in choosing the way we we are gonna use is somewhat subjective and therefore the final number is somewhat subjective with the result being that the comparison that we are doing a value is a very subjective comparison and it shouldn't be it should be a subjective as comparing square footage right and today we can't do that and I think a world in which Bitcoin succeeds it's one in which Bitcoin becomes this non-political and objective measure of values and when you ask for things that matter globally like the price of a currency that currencies are pricing Bitcoin and commodities are pressed Bitcoin and an international trade is done in Bitcoin it doesn't mean that any currency in the world disappears it just means that the meta currency that connects all of those currencies is now a non political currency with non political value and with non political settlement with absolutely anyone can settle in that currency on a Sunday at 2:00 a.m. between with anyone right and that that's new that has never happened before and it would be very powerful yeah but a lot is gonna have to happen for us to get there because right now Bitcoin the value of Bitcoin at least in u.s. dollars is extremely volatile so I would not imagine that would happen I don't know I mean you and I are roughly the same image I think it would be like near the end of our lifetimes or something I just I mean how do you think we're gonna get there don't you think it will take quite a long time yes I think it will take a long time for Bitcoin to fulfill that function it needs to be worth trillions of dollars so that's why I think it would be worth more than a million dollars a coin and the only way to get from ten thousand dollars or whatever Bitcoin is worth to a million dollars is with that the only safe way is with this kind of volatility right I think there is no safe way to get there in a smooth way because volatility is what keeps people from putting money they shouldn't put into Bitcoin and that the worst thing that could happen to VidCon is people put money they shouldn't put in there so I imagine many years perhaps decades which Bitcoin keeps going up with this monstrous volatility and then once he gets to occupy that place is slowly has less and less volatility but I think it's the only sort of way a copy-paste of what we seen for the last nine years you copy/paste it to three more times and 10 20 30 more years and you get there it's a very boring way to get there but is the best way to get there well maybe for journalists it's not a boring way at least the journalists see right about price movement well you know on the way there though don't you think that it would start to pose a threat to central banks and governments no I don't think so I think that that the one country that would lose the most which is the u.s. because it would replace the dollar as the global reserve currency but at the same time the u.s. is the country's better position to take advantage of the pros of Bitcoin is probably the a country that can take the most just like it took the most upside out of the internet the u.s. did it's likely to take the most upside out of Bitcoin so net net is not clear for me that it will be negative I think that the US can still come out ahead and and when you look at policy makers around the world I haven't seen one policy maker believe that their role is to prevent Bitcoin from becoming a standard so their currency doesn't suffer it you know just like it didn't it didn't happen with with gold before III I don't see I don't see within governments a person or an office that is that has the responsibility from this not happening on the contrary when you look at what the financial regulators are doing and law enforcement they are all advancing in the same direction which is they all start a little scared about Bitcoin as they learn they learn how how it can be regulated how how for the economy it's better to have money in Bitcoin and it is in cash etcetera etcetera so all of the progress we've seen in regards to regulators and policymakers in the last five years has been a very positive one and I expect more progress in the same direction not the opposite direction but what about in China where we've seen outright bans on Bitcoin exchanges China could have made it illegal to own beacon and they have not chosen to do that right it's it is legal for Chinese consumers Chinese individuals to own Bitcoin I think that the Chinese government had a concern about the free trading and they stopped at anything that a sensible policy they also have a concern about anonymous trading so they want to make sure that people who are trading have a proper kyc an AML just like you would in any bank I think those policies are very sensible but none of those policies ever went against Bitcoin right or or against in a country that decides what websites you can see and you cannot see and that's that quite effectively would be very feasible for them to say Bitcoin is illegal and they haven't chosen to do that and what about an Argentine how is the coin used there today and has it been used hasn't it been used to sort of circumvent governmental controls yes it has been used to send money into Argentina or get money out of Argentina when it was complicated to do that I think that today bitcoin is more important for Argentina than Argentina is for Bitcoin meaning if you are sitting in Argentina either at a bank or a government Bureau then um the Bitcoin activity matters to you because it's non-trivial but if you are sitting at in the Bitcoin ecosystem all of the Argentine volume is sort of not Material for Bitcoin so you've been thinking about or working with Bitcoin for seven years now what lessons do you feel you've learned over that time that you keep in mind as an entrepreneur as the space continues develop I would say the most important lesson is the one I told you before that Bitcoin is a protocol is not a company and he has the timing and the rhythms the needs of a protocol which are very different from from a company I would say that the most important the most important lesson that I summarized in that tweet that you read which is I think that Bitcoin most important quality is its censorship resistance and that everything else will follow from that great well I've been speaking with one Cisco Soros it's been fantastic having you honest I guess where can people get in touch with you or see your work twitter at wences great okay well thanks so
