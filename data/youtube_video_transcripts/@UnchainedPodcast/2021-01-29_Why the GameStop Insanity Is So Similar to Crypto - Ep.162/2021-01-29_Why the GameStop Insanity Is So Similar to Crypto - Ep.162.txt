bankman-freed founder and ceo of ftx welcome sam hey thanks for having me this has been a crazy week in stock trading particularly for the video game retailer gamestop which you know has been a mainstay of suburban shopping malls not traditionally thought of at the moment as like a hot stock so yeah what happened yeah no totally i mean this has been a completely wild week and you know and what happened was basically a sort of string of events that played out maybe exactly as you would have expected if you're sort of you know thought about it very well but certainly not as anyone did expect going in or at least not as most people did which is that i you know some hedge funds got pretty short game stop uh because it was you know basically thought overvalued relative to you know sort of like earnings or you know dividend stream or fundamentals um a group of of day traders on wall street bets uh was not happy with that and decided instead to get very long uh gamestop and yeah with wall street bets being a subreddit that's right and they they describe themselves as foot like 4chan with a bloomberg terminal that that's basically right this is very much thinks they're you know the the target audience of blue of uh of robin hood and so you know basically there's i mean i don't know if like a a tug of war is quite right but i think it's like about right i as for how to think of it which is that over the course of the week i mean you know traders on wall street get bets just bought more and more gamestop and i mean it probably like a billion dollars of it um and at the same time uh the bearish hedge funds sold more and more gamestop and got shorter and shorter and i mean that the size of the shorts kept getting bigger and the volume kept going up and it you know eventually after about a week of that um it just sort of boiled over and you know the resolution as it turns out was that uh there is more buyers than sellers um there's you know wall street bets was buying more than the short sellers could short sell and eventually uh stock price went from you know 20 to 40 to 60 to 80 to 100 and you know somewhere along the way a lot of the hedge funds that were short started getting liquidated basically and they started getting margin called um a few of them you know very prominently so um i think like melvin was maybe the biggest um capital yep and and you know all of a sudden now you've got wall street bets buying you've got hedge funds that are buying because they you know are now uh you know basically buying back their shorts forcibly and uh and so the price goes to 100 and 200 and i touched 500 i think at the peak uh right around the open today um which is you know an absolutely insane rise i mean it's you know up more than 10x um in the last week and and not knock is the fundamental news because of you know this sort of tug of war that happened and and i knew who ended up ultimately winning it and so anyways uh pretty crazy but that's what happened and uh you know the result of this was i a lot of hedge funds lost a lot of money yeah so um just you know some little facts to shore up this tale vox reported that there was one wall street bets subredditor who claimed he or she had turned 50 000 into 11 million dollars and then meanwhile for this multi-billion dollar hedge fund melvin capital they had to be bailed out with three million three billion dollars from citadel and .72 um because they had such massive losses and um also it's just really interesting to see how the establishment um financial world is reacting to this because nasdaq's ceo adina friedman said on cnbc that if something like this happened in a stock trading on nasdaq she would like halt trading in that particular stock um so it was kind of interesting also because on cnbc the billionaire tech investors from off palo habitat and said that basically the only difference between what wall street vets did versus hedge funds is that they did it transparently in a forum rather than at a quiet dinner in the hamptons and he said quote what this proves is this retail investor phenomenon is here to stay there are 2.7 million people inside wall street bets i think they are as important as any hedge or collection of hedge funds and then like referring to what has traditionally been called the wall street edge he said quote that edge is gone now all of a sudden retail can be on the same footing and they don't have to be the bag holder to wall street so do you agree with that assessment that this is just sort of like upending kind of the traditional way finance works i think i grew some pieces of it and in particular i definitely agree that this is a really new and powerful phenomenon that doesn't look like it's going away anytime soon and that really has been brewing for a long time and i think you know you can start seeing this with tesla where i mean a sort of similar phenomenon played out except over two years instead of two days and you know tesla stock it's up many many many hundreds of percents in the last few years on the back of enormous amounts of buying from among others a lot of retail traders and a lot of serve outsiders from the traditional financial world a lot of short sellers from the traditional value investors and eventually again one of those sites just won that tug of war the short sellers had to buy back and it went up even more and you know you see this in crypto a lot and and this is sort of interesting this is the most crypto like behavior i've ever seen from stock markets yeah so can you actually elaborate on that like what are the ways in which this is similar to crypto so you know one way that you can think about a stock if you want right is you take apple and you're like what is this apple stock worth well um it builds products and it gets revenue from those products and it has expenses you know you sort of calculate earnings from that and then those will eventually turn into dividends and you use some you know time discounting rate and or inflation rate or something like that and you're like all right you know what are 20 years worth of earnings gonna be and you're like yeah 1.5 trillion dollars is our estimate if you know that of the dividends over the next 20 years and so that's what the stock's worth that's sort of like and obviously i'm sort of like oversimplifying it but at its core that's sort of one way that you can think about pricing a stock and if that's the way you're thinking about it right if apple stops trading at 100 billion dollars you just buy it all you're like buying it and getting you know 15 times the dividend stream is great and if it's trading at 20 trillion dollars you short sell it because it's trading at way too high of a price like a sort of price that makes no economic sense and it's it's probably a bubble and gonna fall back down and there's sort of a group of firms that think in in a in a way that has a lot to do with that and obviously there's more nuances to what they're doing but that's sort of the core approach you know another way that you can think of it is it's a ticker it trades there are buyers and sellers and it goes up if there are more buyers and it goes down if they're more sellers and say what you will about fundamentals or dividends or revenue or whatever those are just words if there's a lot of buyers it goes up and if there are a lot of sellers it goes down and and i mean both of those are important effects for markets um but you look at crypto markets right and for most stocks there's there's not dividends or revenue it's not like bitcoin is a yield bearing token it's it's a different sort of thing um and it's it's much more akin to the order flow based thing where the use case of bitcoin is people wanting it and you know the failure cases no one wants it and so it goes up if people buy it and down if people sell it and and that's very much you know the order flow base a version of it and that's what we've seen some stocks start to turn into more of a representation of yeah yeah what it reminds me of is um how you know people do like to look at that network value to transaction value ratio but you know there is like a band within which um the price tends to go that's right and it's also asymmetric and i think this is a really interesting part of it if you look at apple right so i told this story about if it if it you know went down to 100 billion market cap on no news i think buying it's just great right you're just buying this valuable company and you get its dividends and you make money right the other side doesn't work so well necessarily right if it goes to 20 trillion dollars and you shortage you're like okay this is only ever gonna make two trillion dollars like there's no reason for to trade at 20 trillion dollars well it's not like you can just sit there short forever owing dividends that's not going to help you right it's if you're shorting it you're sort of hoping that the market corrects to what you think fair value is um and so while there's this sort of arbitrage on the buy side where if you buy something below its economic underlying value it's just good if you sell it above that i don't know maybe it has additional value because people like buying it noting it and maybe that's not going to go away anytime soon yeah yeah when you short you know your losses are like infinite because if it just keeps going up and up but what you can gain is like limited so and that's not to say you should never short something but it's not you know you can't sort of have this rock solid proof that shorting something is ever good yeah exactly all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about how this um relates to crypto but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per year on your btc download the krypto.com app now to see the interest rates you could be earning on btc and more than 20 other coins once in the app you can apply for the crypto.com metal card which pays you up to eight percent cashback instantly reserve yours now in the crypto.com app back to my conversation with sam bankman freed so another factor in this is that the hedge funds had actually shorted 136 of gamestop shares which meant that they needed to buy back more of the stock than existed to cover their losses um and so that just kind of further drove up the price how would a financial system that's built on blockchain technology affect the ability for investors to do that it's a really good question and you know the answer is sort of like it depends on how it's built and in particular um you know the the the sort of thing that plays the role of um goldman sachs's borough lending desk in crypto is something like uh you know compound or off a um or you know one of the the other sort of bar lending type protocols where you know you can see a similar effect of people want to get leverage long or leverage short so if you want to get long you you buy it and then you can lend it out and other people can borrow it and short sell it and you can actually get a similar thing where it just cycles through a lot and you get this mountain of shorts building up and you know sort of like mountain of longs building up so depending but it depends on the parameters of the protocol and you know what it allows what what sort of leverage it allows what its liquidation parameters are how much collateral people have you know you can build the same structures in d5 and people will um but there's this question at the end of the day of what actually happens in practice and one interesting thing is you know let's let's sort of ignore short selling without a borrow which is generally only a thing you can do very temporarily in in financial markets in order for for the world to be able to get very short they need to be borrowing right somehow they need to actually be finding a physical person with a bunch of gamestop shares that they can go short sell right that they can borrow and short sell and then have a debt of them and where are they getting it from like whose shares are they selling exactly the answer probably is wall street bets probably and i don't know what's going on behind the scenes but if i had to guess to tie this story up something like you know a lot of traders are buying gamestop they're buying it with one of these various retail platforms you know whether it's robinhood or e-trade or something like that they accredited within their account um the platform as when we make money um engages with some borrow lending desk loans out the shares that they have on their platform and then the hedge funds on the other side of the trade borrow those and short sell them and so it's a very bespoke mysterious process in traditional finance where these shares come from it's often quite surprising in crypto it's much more transparent and there's just a question that people getting long what would they do would they in fact take whatever they're getting long and put it in a borrow lending protocol to get interest and if they do then someone could borrow them to short sell if they don't then all of a sudden there's a lot less available supply for people to borrow and short okay so what you're saying is like just depending on how these d5 protocols are built like that would influence whether or not yeah it would influence a lot and depending on what the buyer is if the buyers chose to lend out their tokens or if they chose just to put it in their metamask account and you know that would also have a big impact on whether i how how big of short positions people could put on yeah i'm just trying to think about how this would interplay with something like the yield farming craze where people were being incentivized to do that it's super interesting and you know probably a lot of people will lend them out right because they're getting especially if they're thinking yeah right exactly it's like we'll pay you you know and and trust me i i think that like they could get a lot for this like at the peak how much do you think people were willing to pay to short game stock i bet a lot of people were paying a percent a day or or something you know i don't quite got that high but very high you're talking about the hedge funds yeah that's right what they're paying now i don't know if they actually work because again this market is really weird and in fact it's not like an open order book it's like they call up goldman's like yo what's the borrow rate and some guy's like ah five bips and that that's like how it's determined you know there's no and like what's it who's loaning it out like people on robin hood who aren't getting paid any interest and aren't even aware of it so it's like a sort of arbitrary market indeed it's a lot more transparent and there's a sort of negotiation between buyers and and borrowers about you know how much interest do they have to be paid in order to loan out their shares right right so so there's like kind of more knowledge for the two people in the negotiation and it's more direct so that maybe would potentially lead hopefully would lead to more rational outcomes yeah i think i i think it might and at the very least it would probably lead in interest being paid to the people who are long you know instead of just being entirely soaked up by the middlemen right right which is also um in my mind at least to benefit a nice democratization of finance which is supposedly the goal of crypto although i don't know if it's been borne out yet but i mean it maybe it's making some progress in some places it's not i wouldn't say it's drilling straight towards that goal it's taking some detours yeah on you know food token lane and you know vegetable farming lane yep um so ftx actually then quickly moved to list a tokenized version of gme yeah what are you seeing with that and tell me a little bit about you know what led you to do that yeah i mean it's in the end you know when we think about what products to offer on ftx we want to offer what people want to trade that is like the most fundamental answer to what we want to offer we want what our customer wants and um you know we could divide you know design our favorite product in the world super cool in a lot of ways no one wants to use it it's just taking up space on the site and there could be a product we think is stupid and like we don't get why anyone cares about this but if if it's what everyone cares about then i mean that's like where we say no and so when we sort of woke up today i mean you can probably guess what social media feeds were saying you can probably guess what messages we were getting you know no one was saying like hey guys like um look here's some like 2018 all coins that you haven't listed could you kind of round that out a bit and there are days where people ask for that right because there are days when that's what's happened not today today there's everyone's asking for gamestop and and then once we list that everyone was asking for uh you know for for for blackberry everyone was asking uh you know for amc for nokia and um and and so you know we're really just thinking like you know what is the product that would make people most excited to use our platform and can we offer that in a reasonable way and as it turns out we can um you know because this partnership with uh dag and cm equity we can offer stocks to our users super exciting and and so we could you know just go ahead and and launch them and you know we tend to be we're not a huge organization in terms of people or way way way smaller than many other exchanges uh but we're way leaner and quicker moving and so you know it's a lot harder for us to take on things we don't think are important and just kind of like grind out like mediocrely designed pieces to the site we're very you know rate limited on that but if there's a few big things that we think are super valuable to get out today you know we can just like get on a zoom call and like quickly repurpose everyone in like five minutes to churn something out yeah and then so how does that work on the back end you mentioned this partnership so how does that enable this to yeah so you know there's sort of two pieces to to this one is the the customer facing piece and the other is like the actual stocks the customer facing piece one of the cool things is actually not really that different like it's it's just another you know ticker trading on a market on ftx like you know what's the difference between uh amc march features and link march features from the technology you know technological point of view they're the same thing right it's a market order book matching engine risk engine you know uh gui api and that's one of the super powerful things about exchanges and something that we sort of realized somewhat early on is that almost every part of ftx is can be repurposed to trade almost any product and it's just tech wise super simple um and so you know whether that's crypto stock fiat currencies prediction markets uh or anything else um and so then there's the back end which is all right sure we we labeled it you know gme what what's that why does that have anything to do with gamestop like it can't just be three letters that that that you know sort of evoke you know evoke memories of a stock um and and that's that's the tricky part obviously with this um and and so what we did is um you know over the summer formed a partnership with um a regulated german financial institution which basically has the licensing to offer among other things uh equities to uh to global customers and so they have all of the licensing net necessary to offer the equities they don't have the venue but they have the the licensing and they have you know the equities accounts and in fact they have the licensing to offer tokenized equities and we have the exchange and so basically you know they they custody the actual equities and you know potentially they and and us um base customers in these trades and then you know tokens are issued which basically represent you know those those equities and then those tokens that you can trade on on ftx um and what ultimately ties them is that you can create and redeem them so you can you know go uh you know create your account with with uh ncm equity and then you know go buy you know tokenized apple on ftx and then transfer that to to cm equity and then actually get it credited as literal apple stock in your brokerage account and vice versa and so it's a little bit clunky of a process right now but you can do it um you can sort of actually you know convert between the the tokens on ftx and and equities in your brokerage account oh interesting and then also with your index for the wall street bets favorites so then if you were to cash that in you would get individual shares of each of the companies in the index if it were a spot product that's how it would work as it turns out for simplicity's sake instead it's a cash settled future which settles to a weighted index of the ftx markets on those markets so it settles to you know the average of the nokia market and the you know amc market and the gamestop market and things like that um but you can still basically do that full trade eventually where you buy the future you hedge it at expiration by buying the basket on ftx and that sort of guarantees that you actually get the price you paid for the future and then you go take those and you redeem them and so it is in the same way that bitcoin futures ultimately can sort of be turned into a bitcoin because they expire to the value of a bitcoin um you could ultimately kind of do that arbitrage to convert these futures into the actual underlying equities oh interesting all right yeah well just one other development that i wanted to note here was that robin hood now is restricting restricting trading and things like gme and amc yeah i said what do you what do you think that move says yeah i mean i'm obviously super interested what's going on behind the scenes and what they're being told and i mean maybe they're just things we're not seeing right but it's it's like you mean some kind of like regulatory sorry exactly i i'm sure the sec is talking to them and i don't know what what's happening in those conversations but it's a weird move and it's particularly so whole thing trading is the thing that happens in stocks and you know in some cases can be reasonable right some stock is going through completely wacky price movement and you know i think a reasonable approach you could take is look people should be able to trade what they want but sometimes bots have bad parameters and just go haywire and get in these feedback loops and it's just like turn it off and on again and like give you know give a hard reset to the market for five minutes um just to break any sort of like unnatural feedback that like no one wanted and then if people really do just want to keep buying they just keep buying right right actually you know the way i phrased it was wrong because it's not that they restricted trading it's that they stopped they prohibit people now from purchasing but you can still sell so it's different it's different that's very weird it's very different than what you normally see right and yeah the five-minute circuit breaker is totally defensible this like only go one direction trading is not something that i've encountered really before and it's and and when you see it it's always because of like weird like like okay you hit a price band right it's up so much on the day they can't go up anymore for 15 minutes okay those rules have their issues in a lot of cases but at least after 15 minutes it gets lifted and then you can do whatever you want again and it's like an automated thing this was not that at all this was clearly a human judgment call unrelated to like specific price points or or mount movements like all right no more buying yeah it feels like somebody putting their thumb on the scale yeah it does and it's i mean it's weird like this is not something i mean i you know i was on wall street for for three and a half years and it you know traded a bunch of equities and i i i don't think i've ever seen this before i can't remember having seen it um at least not in the united states and i a lot of people took issue to it and i kind of see why they did i mean it's it's like right like it it's it's sort of like biasing markets in a particular direction it's like a it's sort of like not normally what regulators or exchanges are meant to do and it's it's not clear there's like a principled reason for it i sort of think i can guess why they want to do it but like it's i mean it's not something you usually see people doing because they like kind of think it's what they should do or something it's not usually how markets work you know and it's you know i will note so one thing you will notice that like they didn't do the really bad thing like the really really bad thing that you could imagine that having done in a different directional thing is like some people have shares of it and like restricting selling so you can't sell their shares and that's terrifying right so you've like invested in something and then there's like banned from selling it out and i mean that that that's like a super serious investor this was just stopping people from opening up positions i still don't want to defend it you know it's it's it's not the worst thing they could have done but it's not it doesn't feel great no because i i just noticed just from today alone the price of gamestop uh had an open of 265 it hit that high you mentioned if it was actually 482 at least according to one of my apps yeah and then it plunged to a low of 112 and it's currently at about 230 something but yeah um and by the way we're recording at like noon ish or 1 p.m for listeners on thursday and 1 p.m eastern but i just i'm a little bit like wait is is that part of why it you know what i mean it had that like crazy crash because think about it from 42 down to 112 like you know is it only because people could only sell and there like weren't people on the other side that could buy and i don't know you know and i don't know how big of an influence robin hood would be but anyway it's just yeah i think this street for the answer to that is yeah very well may have been that would be a pretty straightforward answer and it would i that'd be my next guess is that that is what was going on and it went down people weren't allowed to buy but they were allowed to sell yeah so people got screwed which i feel is you know it's yes it's not it's not a good look on on the part of of of robin hood or or the regulars or whoever it was who sort of like ultimately made this call and um and it's not a normal one and it's also not something where like they kind of renounce that i'm like this is how this works like you know if something goes up too much we're going to stop buying if they'd announced that at least you know at least they're sort of like everyone understood that yeah informed risk yeah right this is it's not even just it's not even what you would like guess might happen here yeah okay so last bit um i just want to know how do you think this is going to end like do you think the hedge funds or the retail investors will ultimately be the winners yeah it's an interesting question and one thing that i do want to say is that like wall street is not a singular entity there's a lot of different types of firms there and i mean this is sort of a you know classic thing where like you know you look at industry from the outside and you sort of average it together and you're like that's what it's like right and then you go in there and you talk to someone in there and they give this rant about someone else in the industry and you're like you two are the same in my mind like i was putting you in the same group but apparently you cannot stand this other guy and think they're scum of the earth and now i'm trying to figure out like what's going on and the answer is like i mean you know everyone has their own frame of of reference and you know ultimately what do i think here it's it's gonna have really different effects on different players in wall street you know we've been talking about a particular type of financial entity there uh or a few particular ones one of which is this value investing hedge fund that sort of looks at revenue streams prices equities off of them and then gets long or short based on that um and this is not a great trend for that type of hedge fund like this is further dislodging stocks from their model of them and making it more based on supply and demand so that's one one side that certainly is not looking so good right now it's not looking good necessarily for some intermediaries robinhood being an obvious example i mean this could have been their best day ever and there's actually a little bit of a pattern right now like the last four days that could have been their best day ever how did they end they like all ended quite poorly for robin which is pretty weird i i'm like actually kind of surprised at how cons but so like remember that like the the busiest day ever on the retail buying craze of like hurts and stuff back in spring yeah and robin just crapped out and like was off for the day and as soon as crypto goes gets very busy they run out of crypto for the day and turn it off and i mean today should have been their best bidet ever in history they should have made like 50 million dollars today of revenue and i mean they certainly is not a great ending for them um and i think it's like starting to create this pattern and i don't really know exactly what the sort of like root cause that leads to all of those are but it it's this is been a great year for robin hood but it's not been a great follow-through on the biggest moments and and and i keep saying robin hooks is emblematic but you know i think similar things are happening with a lot of products in the space this is i think bears a lot of resemblance to something we saw in like late 2018 with crypto derivatives exchanges where they were making a crap ton of money still are more than half of all volume was flowing through two exchanges in fact more than half of all crypto volumes flowing through the derivatives components of two exchanges and they were completely incapable of handling it i mean one of them was would just crash whenever volume got large which is exactly when they're most important and when they could be doing the best making the most money and the other uh couldn't handle big market moves uh they lost 300 million dollars to improperly liquidating accounts in a single year or rather they didn't lose they imposed that loss upon their customers and it those are like pretty big ups and and sort of like you know it was late 2018 we were sort of staring at this and feeling like geez these are like probably the two most central entities to crypto wait which two which two are you talking about yes it was bitmex and okay x at the time okay and you know these are processing more than half of all volume in the entire industry and they're really struggling with it and why is that is it endemic to the task and it is a tricky task but i think that wasn't all of it and obviously eventually we're just like like i i think we can do this like i think we can do it better and that that's the reason ftx exists it was you know the sort of day after the biggest fiasco of 2018 with derivatives exchanges which was the the the worst settlement of a future i've ever heard of uh on a bitcoin cash features and there's i mean it's hilariously on one hour notice expired a future two days before it was scheduled to expire and they expired into the futures price instead of the index price and the index was the wrong index and it was a limit of price there's like six reasons why it was and anyway so i just moved to hong kong and that happened and it's sort of sitting there and i mean we've been playing around with this idea in our heads for a while but that was actually the final straw and called up uh gary and flew him out and and that that that's when we started making ftx and then so it's sort of like i don't know i think there's some of that going on here where this is legitimately putting a ton of stress on these businesses but also like it's also i don't know they i kind of think they could be handling it better than they are and i think that's sort of like you know there is i think there's an opening there yeah i feel like this is i mean this has just happened time and time again in crypto where things blow up and then they um bump up against the scaling limits of whatever it is that they're using whether it's ethereum in the ico craze or the crypto kitty craze or um the actual exchanges themselves you know coinbase even recently has been having a lot of outages and all right okay well it's super interesting what you just said about the history of fdx or the inspiration for it um all right well i think we're going to have to see where this goes um and by the way crypto people i also want to let you know that dogecoin is somehow involved in this in this well yeah and they turn off buying on dogecoin that that can't have been the sec right anyway all right well you know we're well past time but thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed this was super fun yeah thanks

recap first headline as revealed in mid-december coinbase will go public later this year on thursday the crypto exchange stated it intended to do so via a direct listing rather than an ipo in a direct listing instead of new shares being created and sold to the public only existing outstanding shares will be sold this is not only a less expensive process but also enables coinbase to avoid certain restrictions that must be followed with an ipo such as lock-up periods that keep insiders from selling their shares next headline more institutional investors pile into bitcoin bill miller of miller value partners and the former chairman of leg mason wrote for miller value partners q4 2020 letter that had purchased shares of microstrategy's 0.75 convertible bond after a detailed analysis of why it believes in bitcoin's promise as well as a rebuttal of common criticisms of the cryptocurrency he writes that the microstrategy bond offered quote very little downside and an almost free call option on bitcoin meanwhile coindesk reports that the harvard yale brown and university of michigan endowments have been buying bitcoin directly on coinbase and other exchanges a fact that was alluded to in coinbase institutional's 2020 year in review because of the institutional demand for bitcoin exposure pantera capital one of the oldest funds in the space is launching a new fund in the next few months for institutional bitcoin investors the block reports next headline ethereum 2020 year in review transferring more value than bitcoin josh stark of the ethereum foundation and evan van ness of the weekend ethereum newsletter published a 2020 year in review for the second largest blockchain by market cap the first takeaway was that 2020 was the year was the first year in which ethereum transferred the most value 1.6 trillion dollars worth of assets 60 more than bitcoin's 1 trillion dollars worth of assets transaction fees on ethereum at more than 600 million dollars were also almost double that of bitcoins another trend cited was the growing creator economy on ethereum with crypto art volume totaling 23 million dollars which sounds small but makes it about five percent of the 500 million dollars paid out by patreon to its creators in 2019. the report also noted the rise in decentralized exchanges with volumes averaging between 17 billion dollars and 26 billion dollars in the fall coinbase's institutional 2020 year year in review report also saw an increased number of institutional clients investing in ether which will also get a boost next month when cme launches ether futures contracts coindesk quotes dennis vinokurov head of research at digital asset prime broker bequan who says that many see eth as a way to get indirect exposure to d5 protocols he says quote not everyone is comfortable with the risks that are still associated with defy but the hyper growth of these projects boosts activity on the ethereum network and thus supports capital appreciation meanwhile the ethereum foundation in reddit announced a partnership to quote help accelerate the progress being made on scaling and develop the technology needed to launch large-scale applications like community points on ethereum next headline grayscale files for several new trusts including some in d5 on wednesday grayskill investments the largest digital asset manager filed for five new trusts for crypto assets ave cosmos polkadot monero and cardano over the weekend coindisc reported that grayscale had also registered trust for chain link to central land livepierre tazos and filecoin it's perhaps not surprising that a few of these are defy related the block reports that otc desks are seeing an uptick in interest in d5 genesis is seeing trades and defy coins such as uni crv and sushi richard rosenblum the founder of gsr trading said quote now that bitcoin has had time to calm down people are looking for the next thing to invest in similarly volumes on dexes hit 45 billion dollars in january more than double compared to december next headline paradigm's guide to optimistic roll-ups paradigm published an in-depth explainer on how optimistic roll-ups work it starts with the problem of the system wanting to scale without losing its properties of low cost and low trust both of which help keep the system decentralized it explains that the root optimistic roll-ups take in scaling is to limit on-chain transactions and to use fraud proofs to cancel invalid quote state transitions or changes to the state of the blockchain since fraud proofs are on chain it also has a method to dissentivize fraud called a fidelity bond that's required from so-called sequencers who store and execute the off-chain transactions and submit a minimal amount of data about them called merkle routes to the ethereum blockchain if a sequencer's data is proven to show fraud then that bond would be slashed and distributed to the so-called verifiers whose role is to watch out for fraud it's a complex system but paradigm does a great job of explaining how it works for those inclined to learn more about what is likely to be the short to medium term scaling solution for ethereum next headline for the math minded vitalik's introduction to zk snarks another potential scaling solution for blockchains is zk snarks which vitalik buterin the creator of ethereum recently cited as the most promising long-term solution as the technology improves this week in a new blog post dedicated specifically to zk snarks he explains how they make possible solutions to two problems that blockchains face scalability and privacy as he describes it quote a zk snark allows you to generate a proof that some computation has some particular output in such a way that the proof can be verified extremely quickly even if the underlying computation takes a very long time to run also he adds and this is the part that makes it a potential privacy solution quote the zk or zero knowledge part adds an additional feature the proof can keep some of the inputs to the computation hidden he says that this would make it possible to prove that you have the right to transfer some asset without revealing which asset you received he says quote this security without unduly leaking information about who is attracting transacting with whom to the public those are the main takeaways but for those interested in the details about how this works he does go into more detail but just a warning that it does require a fair bit of math time for fun bits crypto twitter can't stop with gamestop if like me you can't get enough of this game of chicken between redditors and the 0.1 here is a roundup of choice tweets from crypto twitter author and speaker andreas antonopoulos tweeted time to regulate
