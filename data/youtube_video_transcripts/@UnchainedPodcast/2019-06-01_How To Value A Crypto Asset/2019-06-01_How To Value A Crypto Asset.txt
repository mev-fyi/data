Laura Kris you are the first guest to come back on the show how do you feel about that that's very exciting that means I'm changes is going strong that's it because you came back on the show no it just means there's been you know given the rate of progression in the crypt of space and chain has been around for 10 years now right yeah someone was saying to me that a quarter in the normal world is a year and it is equivalent to a year in the sorry what you gotta say a quarter in the crypto world is equivalent to a year in the real world acceleration of dog years right one typical year is $7 years one typical year is fourteen crypto years or I want to go about it oh wow okay if I that measure and the Unchained has been around for 20 years okay so as you can see there's been a lot that's changed since you were on in that previous episode for people who haven't listened to that that was one where Chris was on the show with Adam white of coinbase and they talked about the coin representing a new as a class in today's episode we'll dive even deeper into evaluating this new asset class but before we get there I actually wanted to ask you Chris a little bit more about your personal background because we didn't go into that when you were on Unchained the first time so why don't you tell us about how you got into Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sure a friend an enthusiastic friend dragged me down to crypto rabbit hole on in college in early 2012 I was at Stanford at the time and so a tech focused campus and there were pockets of interest here and there it didn't stick with me at the time I was intrigued and interested but there wasn't the infrastructure and community around Bitcoin at that time that there is now for example coinbase wasn't even around it was really just mount GOx and your main major application of Bitcoin was the Silk Road and it was hard to dissociate you know Bitcoin from the Silk Road at first blush a couple years past and you know I stayed interested in the space never considered it professionally until I joined arc invest in 2014 and I joined arc as a next-generation Internet analyst and arc was a start-up at that time just getting off the ground didn't even have funds trading and so I got the opportunity to help design along with our portfolio manager Cathy wood and director research Brent Winton arcs next-generation internet strategy and as a thematic strategy it includes elements like machine learning cloud computing Internet of Things and it was clear to us that we wanted to include cryptocurrency in there but since this was mid 2014 there weren't any instruments for arc as a public fund manager to get direct exposure to cryptid assets so we held things like Taiwan Semiconductor which fabric on the fabrication plants of that firm I used for some of the Asics and GPUs that are used to mine crypto assets or Nvidia you know one of the classic GPU producers then we were approached by greyscale actually late in 2014 because they had the Bitcoin investment trust that would shortly become a publicly traded instrument in gbtc and that justified me doing a deep deep dive on Bitcoin which you know really dragged me down the rabbit hole and so I ended up transitioning to focus on the space exclusively really because I lost interest in the equities that I was covering and in September 2015 art became the first public fund manager to make an investment a direct investment Bitcoin through grayscales Bitcoin investment trust and then since then I've been doing a lot of research writing speaking on the space you mentioned the book which is now out which is exciting and have started a firm with Joel managua formerly from Union Square Ventures called placeholder okay wow that's quite the journey and and I think something that's interesting for listeners to know and this is something that Chris and I have bonded over is that use you were interested in doing something with like environmental science right isn't that what you studied at Stanford yes I you know I grew up a Nature Boy little known fact I'm I'm still a hippie I may be a closeted hippie but I I lived in Hawaii when I was twelve to eighteen and picked up surfing there and always had that sort of slant from my my dad was big into nature so I studied biochemical around the ocean in college had no conception of working in finance no desire it was actually probably the last place I expected to find myself working but in a large sense that was because I had stereotyped the entire industry and finance was just this one big black blob and as I came to learn more about it through arc I realized you know there are many nuances and many verticals within the financial services industry and so during your time at arc and it can you remind me what what year did you join I joined in 2014 okay yeah so you know that was like shortly after or 2014 was I guess the year that started with the big mountain ox implosion where almost half a billion dollars where the Bitcoin was lost um and then the price just sort of steadily declined up until I think it was like early 2015 and then it like languished it around the same it kind of in the low to hundreds for a long time so I'm just kind of curious like while you were at arc how did you see bit coin and crypto assets change and how did your thinking around them change as well you know it was fascinating because 2014 was a dark year right Bitcoin was not cool in the way that Bitcoin is cool in 2017 because exactly as you said November 2013 Bitcoin hits twelve hundred and forty two dollars you know we're well on our way to the moon everyone is super excited then there's a number of things that happen from you know China's statement that this isn't a real currency with real meaning to mouth  and that precipitates this slide all the way to Bitcoin lost eighty-five percent of its value fell to $175 by January of 2015 and sort of in that period is when I am doing my due diligence on Bitcoin right and then through 2015 as you mentioned Bitcoin sort of was in this trading range of 200 to 300 dollars and so what was great about that for for me coming from arc as a technology analyst was there was no hype right there it was really just a deep investigation of the technology and the merits of Bitcoin as money over IP and so that led me to do things one of the first papers I put out is called Bitcoin securing the network looking at the long-run security model for Bitcoin miners when basically block rewards phase-out or the issuance of new Bitcoin phases out and is supplanted purely by transaction fees so that that's just one one example of you know arcs approach was really to develop deep conviction in the technology and also in the price of Bitcoin and the potential for appreciation because as a fiduciary arc has to do that and that just allowed us to develop a really robust base free from all the hype but then you know when we made the investment in September of 2015 and put G BTC the Bitcoin investment trusts into two of our CTFs we drew a lot of fire we probably drew more negative reactions than then positive fanfare people saying I mean you have to remember in that time - that was blockchain not Bitcoin season that was when you know that much of the financial services considered these native assets to be irrelevant or a distraction at best and so we had tons of people saying you consider yourself to be a specialist in technology you're missing the boat here like it's not about Bitcoin anymore that's you know so 2013 it's about blockchain and so that just led me to dig my heels into the ground more and more and more and also at this time is when aetherium is kind of percolating right a theorems network goes live in the summer of 2015 and I felt kind of blessed in that you know I was ramping intellectually in the space through 2014 and 2015 and so I wasn't ever forced to be a Bitcoin maximalist I always sort of came to the space with an open and rational mind or at least as rational as I could hope to be and that's what led me to explore the space as crypto assets as opposed to Bitcoin this single cryptocurrency Oh interesting what where is you feel like if you had learned about or gotten involved in Bitcoin earlier than there would have been pressure to assume that Bitcoin was going to be the only encrypting I said that would dominate is that what you're saying uh somewhat yeah that's that's a good synopsis I've seen a number of friends from the industry over the years especially the ones and and had explicit conversations about them with this I think Erik Voorhees has talked about it as well you know if you got involved in say 2011 there were all coins coming to market I believe under that years when litecoin launched but you know there wasn't all that much innovation it was a lot of copy and paste coins and Bitcoin maximalism was born out of that right and and with merit there Bitcoin was the main community with a lot of innovation going on and there there were things going on around it but Bitcoin was the only one at that time worth paying attention to and so if those blinders got put on at that time for some people they're still working to take those blinders off and so that's that was just I got lucky with sort of coming in in what I would consider to be the second wave not the first wave and now we're in the third wave and when you were at arc I wrote about this paper that you co-authored with Adam white that's basically why I had you guys on the podcast at that time um and you said that Bitcoin represented a new asset class how did you come to that conclusion yeah and that's another example actually of a paper that drew a fair amount of negative reactions although people did like it a lot as well so the the way we approached it tried to be as academic as possible and just let the the numbers and the graphs speak for themselves so I read as much of the academic literature as I could along with Adam white from G Dax and just to get a basis for how is an asset class defined because it's a classically fuzzy definition and so working off of some prior work for example from Robert we're who wrote this paper what is an asset class anyway we developed a bit more of a robust framework and really boiled down to four main areas to look at first is the asset class needs to be sufficiently investable to be considered an asset class and so this is where we looked at you know daily trading volumes you know at at that time bitcoin was trading and in the range of billions of dollars daily so you know you're starting to see sufficient liquidity in those markets and so that was just really checking a box the next three were we're where it gets really interesting in terms of differentiating crypto assets from other traditional asset asset classes and so that included an investigation of the political economic profile so that mainly includes the supply schedule so this is where crypto assets are extremely different in how the supply is mathematically metered from them our traditional asset classes where it's really based on you know the the whims of a human mind the next one is basis of value and so that's looking at as we'll get into later how are these things valued and then use cases and again use cases this is where Bitcoin starts to get very interesting you know as a currency so a means of exchange sort of a unit of account but also a technology right whose use cases can go beyond what you would classically consider a currency to be then there were things on the other two were looking at correlations so how does Bitcoin play in the market compared to the other assets and this is where we found there's near zero zero correlation of returns to bonds equities real estate gold you name it which is which is a pretty amazing feature and that shows yeah but I wonder if that will hold well so that's that's a great point right now I think it indicates that this is an emerging asset class right so there's not that much overlap between crypto asset investors and traditional capital market investors but as that overlap increases you know I think you will see an increasing negative correlation Bitcoin with mostly traditional asset classes that's because people use it as a risk off hedge what was fascinating about this study in early 2016 was there was zero correlation and just basically meant you know they're totally separate the last thing and and people can find the paper online if they search for it was just looking at the risk reward profile so absolute returns volatility which sums up in the Sharpe ratio which are adjusting your your returns per the per the risk taken yeah and I wrote about this at the time and from reading your book can actually see that some of these ideas even informed the book but to move on to kind of like or to go back to what you were saying about your career so you left arc somewhat recently why and how did you decide what to do next so I had been at arc for three years and you know developed arcs crypto practice and really pounded the table within the firm on on this as a something of strategic importance and I explored different business development opportunities at work it was actually a large part of what my last year and a half was comprised of because as an analyst you know there there wasn't that much that I could cover in the crypto asset realm that would be suitable for arc as an investment right there's really only a handful of things so I had to justify myself from a business development perspective and did a lot of work with different traditional infrastructure providers and regulators and it is important work but very slow-moving process and so I ultimately decided that if I wanted to get direct fast moving in the weeds exposure to the crypto at ecosystem I would probably have to have to leave arc not because our clocks and innovation by any means it's one of the most innovative traditional financial service firms out there with this open source research ecosystem and all that but now you know arc is approaching two billion in assets it's a firm it it manages ETS and mutual funds and so on and so forth and so Joel and I decided to to make this leap to work directly with the developers that are that are making this ecosystem come to life and just out of curiosity why the name placeholder well the simple answer is that our lawyers picked it because in in in the early days we weren't we hadn't settled upon a name and so we were just putting placeholder in brackets in all of our documents and we found we kind of liked that it was music but as as time time went on and we we thought about it more there were things we really liked you know as a venture firm we come we help the developers and entrepreneurs get off the ground and then you know when our job is done we no longer necessarily have to hold that asset and at that point you know we may transition out and pass the asset back to the utility holders and at that point we have just become a placeholder right we just we just take up a little space and time in the development of the community so you know that's that's one way to think of it there are other ways the other ways think of it it's it's it's a it's a bit of a shrug at the naming establishment I suppose as well a little bit like lowercase capital or whatever it may be okay and so obviously we want to get to the book but why don't you briefly describe what you guys are gonna be doing at placeholder well as I said we're just a venture capital firm that specializes in the decentralized information networks incentivized by a token okay all right so let's get to the book now how would you briefly describe the book for listeners the book is so I have a co-author on it Jack tater and it's our best attempt to put everything that we thought a someone who's curious about the space that may or may not have a strong financial background putting everything that we we would think that person would need to start to get involved in these markets and you know the reason we decided to do a book is because information out there is so fragmented you know you do a fantastic job Laura covering the space but you know you've written I don't know over a hundred articles by now I would imagine on on crypto and they're scattered around the web and then there's Reddit and medium and Twitter and telegram and all these things we just wanted to a gregarious ich ste I don't know that I want someone going 60 miles an hour in this market after reading the book but 55 seems like a reasonable ending so let's get into some of the nitty-gritty around how to evaluate these assets if someone comes to you and they are wondering you know how to figure out well you know what the value is and whether or not something is like under price or overpriced what would you advise them well first and foremost I don't give price targets or public investment advice so I don't build these models for example or share them with the community to have people say okay I I should buy this right now because it's it's under priced I'm more build them to understand what the levers to value are on a long-term basis right on a on a ten-year buy-and-hold basis so and what are those levers so I can I I can talk through the the framework if you'd like yeah okay so the first foundational thing that's important to set is the use of what's called the equation of exchange which is also referred to as MV equals PQ and within traditional monetarism MV equals p q is a equation to map the flow of money through an economy and so just to dimension out the variables so that you know we can progress M as in Mary is the monetary base so the size of the monetary base necessary to support an economy so you take something like the US dollar monetary base is around four trillion dollars bitcoins monetary base right now is around seventy-five billion dollars V so M times V V refers to velocity and velocity is a bit of an abstract concept but it refers to the number of times within a certain time frame most typically a year that a currency will turn hands right so if I pass one Bitcoin to you Laura that in that year has a velocity of one and then you know if you pass it to say Joel again that at that point has changed hands twice and it has velocity two so on and so forth so the US dollar you know velocity has been in this this five to ten range it's it's come down a lot since the financial crisis which is another conversation then on the other side of the equation you have P Q and P Q the P refers to the average price of a basket of goods in an economy and Q refers to the quantity of goods and when you multiply P times Q that is where you get GDP where this is traditionally used right and so what that shows you is multiplying the monetary base by the number of times that that monetary base turns over in a year so that's MV equals the size of an economy in a year now how does this apply to crypto it applies to each crypto network because we can think of each crypto network as actually being an economy that operates in relative isolation there is you know increasing and operability and flow of assets but if we think of each protocol as an isolated economy then we can actually use this equation to map the flow of the crypto asset to provision the digital good or service that this crypto economy so to speak provisions and so are you with me there before I before I move forward yeah yeah okay so it's very you're explaining us very clearly okay great I've been practicing so I'm getting better at this over over the years but so that's that sets up you know sort of this this baseline theory when I approach valuing a different crypto asset I always start with the supply schedule and that is to basically look at okay how many units of this crypto asset are going to be issued each year and what is the total amount that has been issued over time and so the reason I do that is I need to know in finance it's that we refer to as the float what number of these assets are in the float and available for use within this economy and so if I take something you know that say has has had a hundred million tokens issued you then have a hundred a hundred million out there but I need to then take into account the percentage of those assets that are just being huddled right just held and not moving at all because those have a velocity of zero in a year so they're actually pulled although they've been issued they've been pulled out of the float and then there are other other instances where you pull assets out of the float for things like bonding so with proof of stake or you look at how filed coin may work and a lot of these other systems they will require some of the nodes to bond a certain percentage of the assets to be one of the the providers in the network so you know in the work I did with coin base for example looking at their user base roughly 60% of their user base I think in 2016 approached Bitcoin purely as a store of value which means it had a velocity of zero and they just held it which means you know only 40 percent of the Bitcoin really was being used that was in the flow and that's that's an overly simplistic example but just to give to give context so once I have the total amount of tokens that are in the float I then you know have an idea of okay these are the number of tokens that are going to be used in this MV equals PQ equation which then takes me to figuring out okay how is this crypto economy functioning right and that requires me to look at the price of the good or service being provisioned and the quantity of the good and service being provisioned so to give a very practical example we can use file coin I can figure out you know the price per gigabyte of file stored that will be charged by the file coin network and I do that using assumptions right looking at what storage is charging or SIA or these other existing crypto file storage networks I need to assume a caustic line right because these are deflationary technologies and each year the cost to store files will decrease so that's the P side and I draw that out each year you know into infinity if if I want then I need to figure out the quantity side the Q and I do that by looking at the total addressable storage market so how many gigabytes of files are stored out there what percentage of that would be suitable to be stored by file coin and then I need to layer within that an adoption curve an S curve based on a number of variables like when the network will launch how quickly it will be adopted how long and and basically the steepness of the S curve is it going to be really steep is it going to be this more more gradual takeover and what that allows me to do is to say okay I think that file claim will take this percentage of the storage market and therefore store this number of gigabytes so if I have filed coins storing X number of gigabytes in a year and I multiply that by the dollar per gigabyte charged by the file coin network to store files then I get the dollar value of of that economy in a year right the transactional volume of that PQ necessary to support that economy now if we go back to this equation of MV equals PQ I only at that point q if I want to solve for the necessary size of the monetary base I need to divide P Q by V right so I have M equals P Q over V and that requires me to put in an assumption around what the velocity is and that's that's a whole nother conversation we can maybe come back to that in a second but let's say I have the five-point economy you know supporting twenty billion dollars worth of annual transaction volume to store files and it has a velocity of say five I divide that twenty billion by five and I would say filed coin would need to store four billion in order to meet that that demand that is how I back out the monetary base necessary and then there's a last step where I have to look at the monetary base and divide that monetary base by the number of tokens in the float to get the utility value per token in the flow each year okay wow I love this I have a whole bunch of questions actually about what you just said but before we do that let's do our sponsor break I would like to tell you guys about on-ramp if you're starting up a new project or need some design or branding help on an existing one on-ramp has you covered on ramp is a full-service creative

helped passionate entrepreneurs achieve their dreams go to think on-ramp calm thanks on ramp for being a supporter of this podcast and all of our listeners I'm talking with Chris Byrne Ischia of placeholder' ventures and author of the new book crypto assets so some of the stuff I wanted to ask you about was around some of the assumptions you mentioned like the percentage of the market that file coin might take or the steepness of the adoption curve and by the velocity how do you make those assumptions and I'm assuming maybe you do a range of them to come up with kind of like a range of reasonable prices or how does that part work yes so you can definitely do scenario testing right where I where I try different inputs and and I look at how all of that plays out I think something that may be helpful for your listeners is the crypto asset valuations piece that I publish on medium where actually it's one of the longer medium posts I've I've posted I walk through this whole process in in detail because we didn't even get to the sort of discounting future values back to the present in terms of you know these these inputs say take take velocity velocity is is one of the hardest ones and this is why it's very explicitly an assumption in my model right and there's there's that famous quote right you assume something and you make an ass out of you and me and so you you have to be you have to be careful and and explicitly understand that these are assumptions so with velocity if we if we look at bitcoin historically you know I think in in 2016 the velocity was around 6 and the way to calculate that for for Bitcoin is let's just say you know roughly a billion dollars in transaction volume a day so that means 360 billion dollars of transaction volume in a year and let's say so so that is PQ right and then let's say the monetary base has been roughly sixty billion right so then to solve for velocity velocity now being PQ over m I divide that 360 billion in annual transaction volume by a sixty billion dollar network value and I get a velocity of six right and basically what that means is the monetary base in aggregate had to turn over six times in order to facilitate that transactional demand now the tricky thing here is as I talked about with the supply at the start not all of the Bitcoin that have been issued you know currently in circulation or currently being used as maybe a better way to think about it or currently being exchanged is more precise so for example if we take you know this roughly 60% that is just being held and I would posit that it's actually higher that has a velocity of zero right and so then I actually need to look at well what is the velocity of the stuff that's actually being used and so if I take this 40% that's being used as a means of exchange right it turns out that 40% needs to have a velocity of 15 in order for Bitcoin in aggregate all of its units to have a velocity of 6 I can walk through that math it's just a weighted average but it's the right yeah that makes sense yeah the the point being that there's a big difference with these assets between the aggregate velocity of all of the use cases of the crypto asset versus the means of exchange velocity and for Bitcoin I would argue that you know this 15 number which is higher than traditional fiat currencies or most of them makes sense but it'll probably go even higher and I wouldn't surprise me if many crypto assets give velocities that go into high into the double digits or even into the triple digits and that can actually it's it's a bit counterintuitive but that can actually erode the necessary value the necessary network value or monetary base that that crypto asset needs to provision a an economy right so well I have so many questions um but one thing about what you just said is why do you think that the velocities will go higher is it just because the technology is so much faster than moving money via the traditional thinking services the traditional thinking infrastructure yes if you think about you know what are things that pull down velocity a lot of its its friction right friction is what pulls down velocity even just if we're thinking about it from a from physics right from first principles what's going to slow something down decrease the velocity it's after there's friction and so friction with traditional assets like if we think about say gold right that has a very high friction because I'm not going to you know lug around my gold bar and give it to someone else and and with fiat currency that's you know that friction has been ameliorated but there's still you know a fair amount of friction to the the physical instantiation of fiat currency even though lots of it is digital now with crypto assets this is our first digital native asset class right there is no physical representation of it and so that actually decreases the friction necessary to move it and therefore I would posit will increase the velocity now I think that yeah if this reminds me of that somewhat famous scene in Nathaniel poppers book digital gold where one says casares introduces a whole bunch of other Silicon Valley types to Bitcoin and they're amazed as they watched it was I forget out the amount do you remember the amount it was some huge sum of money yeah yeah like $250,000 or something that they basically has the big coin around to each others you know I don't know what what accounts he opened up there I'm I don't remember the details but you know if you were to do that with a traditional banking system it would be what at least I don't know one or two days for each person and depending on it foreign different countries it could be even being like a week between each individual person right so you know to past around five people would take like a minimum you know five days but probably longer or potentially up to five weeks if we're all in different countries so right and so this is where this is where it's really important you know I philosophy has kind of been somewhat neglected concept within monetarism it's it's a I've been finding with the different market traditional macro economists I talked with that it's a bit of a polarizing topic that's really interesting um but this this idea of these these crypto assets will have hybrid velocities composed of you know the percentage of the asset that is a store value is really important to pulling down the hybrid or the aggregate velocity right because those things have a velocity of zero versus you know maybe only 20% of the crypto asset will actually be in the float and it could have a super high velocity right say maybe 50 or a hundred but so long as enough of the crypto asset is being held by the hog lers and the the bonders or the stickers you know and they're holding the the howlers are holding based on an expectation of increased utility about the value in the future so long as there's this this equilibrium which is very nuanced then there can still be significant network value but if the entire asset base is just you know whipping around and being used within this digital economy you could make an argument for some of these protocols supporting you know hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity but actually storing very little because you can just be recycling the same unit over and over and over and over in the exchange for the good or service provided by the protocol so it's just an important thing I'm actually doing research with a couple of professors Steve McKeon who's been ramping within crypto and writes some great pieces on medium and Alessio Ceretto on looking at you know trying to do cross sectional analysis and longitudinal analysis on the top 100 crypto assets to see you know are there patterns falling out about these velocities because it's such a new space huh that's really interesting so one thing I wanted to flag for listeners just because this is an expression we often see written but maybe not heard Chris keep saying hot lers which is from I think it was originally a typo right for someone wrote like you should hold but they spell the H odl well yeah so it isn't that where that yeah it's it's it's a hilarious sort of piece of Bitcoin history from Bitcoin talk where this guy got caught I forget which which downmarket he got caught in but if you search like hotle Bitcoin talk or where does how it will come from it'll show up and he's clearly drunk he's clearly infuriated that you know he bought at the top and all these other traders are making money and he's like I'm not a traitor I'm just gonna huddle and he's just like you know clearly just pounding at the keyboard with a fifth of vodka or something at his side okay all right um so I just yeah cuz in case you didn't catch what he was saying that's what you're saying so I think what's really interesting about what you're saying about velocity here is that unless a cryptocurrency has some mechanism built into kind of incentivize people to want to hold or Hottel the the asset then the velocity could potentially bring the value of these crypto assets down is that correct that's that's a good summation okay and do you see a lot of crypto economic systems building in some things that will prevent that from happening increasingly increasingly so the there's there's a few different baskets of people right that could have a let's call them zero zero velocity folks there's the the ha dollars and that is really just based on an expectation that this crypto asset will have increased utility value in the future over now and therefore you know I I am better this is a good store about you right but then there are you know with proof of stake systems which we're re seeing more and more of and depending on where theorem codes we could have a massive sort of switch into into proof of stake those the asset holders in that case become the new miners of sorts right and they actually have to bond their asset in order to become part of the consensus process or you have some teams requiring staking or bonding more for reputational purposes right I mean proof of stake it is kind of a reputational purpose but more to avoid civil attacks so you know if you look at what - has done they require you if you're going to be a master node to stake I think it's a thousand - and that's just to avoid you know people who are now intentioned from becoming part of that network so I think we're going to see an increasing number of teams doing this and you know in the work Joel and I do with different developers crypto economics is top of mind for us especially because a lot of these teams are amazing engineers and you know you can only sit there and look at them and awe but not at all not many of them want to spend all that much time with the crypto economics or even know necessarily where'd up again there's a lot of indexing off of sort of what prior supply schedules have been even though prior supply schedules have cryptic assets have largely been experimental and so that's you know something where we work with the teams and we're seeing a lot of traction in interest yeah I'm increasingly thinking that the correction the crypto economics of any system are going to be crucial to whether or not it survives because you know these are basically little economies that you're creating you're trying to incentivize the different actors in different ways and if you don't get it right it's it's not gonna take off I'm a branded like it's code you can change it but you know there's there's a benefit I think to getting it right early I actually want to jump back to what you mentioned earlier about discounting because I do think that that's also a super super tricky part of kind of the different assumptions that you make so can you describe a little bit what that is and how you do it yes discounting again coming from the the theory of finance is this basic idea that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar a year from now because I could take if someone were to give me a dollar today I could invest it maybe get a five percent rate of return and so in a year I would have a dollar and five cents so either give me a dollar today or a dollar and five cents in a year but don't give me a dollar in a year because that's a bad deal and so what I need to do is if someone were to try and give me a dollar in a year I would divide that dollar by 1.05 because that's you know potentially the interest rate I could get which would mean that dollar in a year is worth ninety five cents today and so this is widely used within the pricing of assets because markets don't price assets based on their current utility but I actually the expectation of future utility and the way that shows up with the pricing of stocks is you know the classic pricing mechanism within stocks is called the DCF discounted cash flow model and it discounts back future cash flows in aggregate to the present to say you know what is all of this worth and so I do a very similar thing with crypto assets although the important thing with crypto assets is these things are not companies and do not have cash flows so instead it is you know having walked through this economy what is going to be the size of the economy in the future what is going to be the velocity and therefore what is the necessary monetary base necessary to support that economy and that gives me the network value right and then I divide that monetary base by the number of tokens that are in the float to get the current utility value each year so maybe I have a current utility value in 2017 of 25 cents right or something like that but then in the future it is say 2025 there will be a different current utility value right and so I need to take that future current utility value or future utility value and discount it back to the present to get an idea of okay if someone were to offer to give me that token at that price in the future versus now what would it need to be worth now for that to make it a good investment and it's going to be worth less right because I have to discount it back and you know I'm using discount rates of thirty to fifty percent which is extremely high you know you you think of traditional equities you're using discount rates for high-growth equities in the ten to fifteen percent range and again that that is to represent the risk inherent to holding this asset because I need to be compensated for the risk I'm taking as an investor so now this is all somewhat abstract I'm sure there's some people who are getting frustrated as they listen to me so the the the medium post on crypto asset valuations really walks through on all of this in detail yeah and you do also mention it in your book which I do want to just plug for a second to say that I do think it is like a really good primer on just a lot of I mean it goes and - I mean it's just such a range of things you know it talks about kind of like the history of other assets and how they also began maybe in a speculative fervor and then how they became more established it talks about kind of even more technical things in crypto assets like mining but it has you know a lot of this kind of like more financial and substantive analysis which which is why I wanted to bring you on the show I really find the way you think about these things really interesting let's switch gears really - uh-huh because I I super appreciate you taking the time to plug my own book and mcgraw-hill would thank you because it's something I I need to to get better at for sure but just for your your readers if they're wondering hey is this book a good fit for me or not as you mentioned you know there's these three sections right there's a what section what are these things right to place crypto in the context of what we have out there give some basics about Bitcoin and blockchain technology cover the phenomenon of blockchain not Bitcoin the history and taxonomy of different crypto assets I then launch into the why right so why does this stuff matter why does portfolio management matter how does Bitcoin perform in a portfolio get into you know why these things aren't Ponzi schemes although you know exploring a lot of the history of financial speculation and then the last section is how so you know very practical stuff how do you value these things how do you choose your wallet how do you choose your exchange and again that was just a what why and how to help people you know whether they're a millennial in their mid 20s who knows they need to start investing but don't really know where to begin or whether they're a financial services professional in their mid 40s early 50s late 50s 70s I don't care but that are interested in learning about crypto assets and have a financial background it works for sort of a whole gambit yes I definitely agree it's funny because actually when I was reading it I was like oh I've read about a lot of this stuff maybe not some of the you know more like you know this stuff that we've actually cover in this podcast like how to evaluate these cryptic assets but a lot of this I was like oh if I had pulled together my articles into a book then you've known me for a few years now so I've shared all of my secrets with you oh I know well in case listeners don't know in case you only listen to my podcasts but don't read my articles um Chris is easily one of the most quoted people in my stories because he's one of the smartest people I talked to encrypt up so um anyway well um so I do want to switch gears because you did touch on a Bitcoin ETF in your book and since you do come from traditional financial services I wanted to hear your take on how you think this revolution will play out in a particular crypto assets how you think that will play out in traditional financial services like when we'll start to see things like a Bitcoin ETF or you know however else you think it will it will play out well I would say it's only a matter of time until you know we see more and more traditional vehicles that securitize Bitcoin another two assets or provide this well understood and easily recognizable rapper to this new asset class but you know in terms of how much time I don't know it's it's really hard and you know that was part of you know my my later time at our cuz was realizing you know right regulators get it regulators understand they're there but this is going to take years and so if you look at the SE C's rejection of the Winklevoss pecan ETF in March of 2017 you know they had clearly done their work on the space and we're making the decision from an informed position and they came down notably hard in terms of saying that they found Bitcoin to largely be on regulated markets and so if you think about you know from the perspective of how the SEC approaches stocks the SEC has good visibility into you know all of the stocks that are traded giving you know all the infrastructure that has been built up and all of the reporting and all of that but then you approach Bitcoin and while there are a number of you know what would I consider to be top-tier crypto asset exchanges Cheeta X being a great example that follow the letter of the law there are also exchanges and markets where you know it's there's not as much clarity right and so I can see for the SEC there's some some uncomfort there and if they want full transparency into all of the Bitcoin that is traded globally to avoid insider trading and that kind of stuff or to spot it out that will be harder there's a case to be made there in terms of you know we don't see all of the gold that's traded globally but we still have gold ETFs so I think that you know the the most tangible thing I can say is you know derivatives first and you know we've already seen a fair amount of activity on the derivatives front in terms of swaps and futures and that's important and the CFTC in the US has been kind of the regulator that's that's been early on on on wanting to work with the the crypto realm and then you know those instruments are important for institutional investors because they set up you know well-known infrastructures and traditional financial institutions know who their counterparty is and it just checks off a bunch of boxes for the risk committees and that will get these these bigger firms to play more in the markets and then you know I think it's a progression over time some people don't know this but gold ETFs I don't think GLD the biggest gold ETF came to market until 2000 late 2003 maybe early 2004 so that hasn't even been around for ten years or just over ten years and gold is an asset class that we've had for thousands of years so you know for me there's no rush right like it's gonna happen eventually I'm not overly fixated it's not my job anymore either I'm not overly fixated on when these things will be securitized but it's gonna happen because this is a new asset class and the inertia is is inevitable well so something that I've been thinking about is that the rate of innovation that I feel like I'm seeing on the public blockchains is happening so quickly and when I read stories are here people like Jamie Dimon making the comments that he made I and I realize just sort of how to how out of touch he is and how little he understands about what's going on i and you even mentioned in your book you said that distributed ledger technology which is the phrase that people are using to describe bringing blockchain to traditional financial services to make their systems more efficient but not really fundamentally change them you call that a bandaid on financial services to protect them from disruption so I'm just curious like how quickly do you think the disruption of financial services will happen and like you know in terms of what we were saying about the Bitcoin ETF sometimes I wonder Oh could we sort of see you know people not carrying at a certain point about a Bitcoin ETF because the public block chains have taken off in such a way where it maybe doesn't even matter anymore so such a fascinating question Laura and I feel like we could talk about that for a podcast and itself so to start with the ending bit about Bitcoin ETF and maybe people won't care and then we'll come back to DLT you know it's interesting I well I I think a Bitcoin ETF would be an important moment for the space it's a bit of a bastardization of Bitcoin in in the sense that you're taking this beautiful really efficient new asset class that doesn't need to be securitized right - it's almost redundant in a way right to custody it and to securely transmit it around the world you're creating this extra layer unnecessary layer so that it you know fits it becomes a recognizable puzzle piece that fits within what the traditional financial services will accept it's kind of like you know within biology where different proteins need to fit together and right now bitcoin is kind of this weird virus amoeba whatever and financial services doesn't quite know how to let it attach and an ETF will let it better attach now in terms of but longer-term you know okay maybe much of the financial services as we know it will be commoditized and and I don't think it goes away I think you know the middle man gets commoditized and squashed and therefore maybe ETFs are less important than you know just tokenized baskets of crypto assets or whatever it may be but let's let's jump to the idea of distributed ledger technology and Jamie and sort of that longer battle that you and I have witnessed over the last few years you know I alluded to it at the start of the podcast but 2014 and 2015 was rough right people were saying bitcoins not necessary bitcoins going to zero blockchain technology is where it's at and I write about this in the book you know October 2015 Blythe masters comes out on the cover of Bloomberg magazine with blockchain stamped across her body The Economist publishes a cover article called the trust machine there's all that kind of emphasis on blockchain and then the term distributed ledger technology started getting used to dissociate right from Bitcoin and bitcoins blockchain in that confusion and sort of what the financial services considered to be this quickly dying and dirty past and now you know you look at into 2016 there was still a lot of distributed ledger technology hype and aetherium started to catch people's attention certainly given its meteoric rise in 2016 but now 2017 things have swung back to the the public block chains and the crypto assets that are necessary to incentivize their functioning and that's really exciting and it it actually fits you know perfectly and and Joel and I have been saying this for a while now this whole progression fits what we classically see with disruptive technologies and innovators dilemma right we're a new open highly disruptive technology comes out generates a lot of interest but disdain from the incumbents the incumbents then say okay this may be kind of important I'm gonna take components of this technology co-opt them put them in my existing business models but leave out all the components that I don't like that commoditized my existing business model and that was what DLT was right it was OOP I will take out the asset and I will just use this cool new database technology then what happens as the incumbents are sort of playing within that smaller pool the truly disruptive and an almost always open version of the technology is gathering momentum momentum momentum and then there's this explosion out of nowhere and it catches the incumbents off guard and I would say that's what 2017 is shaping up to be I was at a credit suisse conference speaking yesterday and it was filled with suits and ties and everyone it was a crypto conference it wasn't a DLT conference it wasn't a blockchain conference it was a crypto conference and so I think now people are waking up to oh my god these are open permissionless bottom-up innovation networks classically that always wins out over the private networks maybe we were wrong about TLT and you know that's that's a point that I make in the book that you know DLT sure it's important it has a role to play it will make things better faster cheaper but over the long term it will pale in comparison to the size of innovation and value creation within these public blockchain networks yeah I I agree okay well this has been such a fascinating discussion thank you so much for coming on the show how can people get in touch with you the best way is Twitter I am constantly a recovering Twitter addict and I can be found at sea burn iski so I might just first and then last name and the book there's a website for it just very simply Bitcoin and beyond.com where we will Jack and I will be listing upcoming speaking events and different things that we publish and and maybe I'll be coming to a conference near you sometime who knows okay in Korean well thanks again for coming on the show thanks for having me Laura it's always fun and thanks so much for joining today's episode with Chris Byrne Ischia placeholder ventures to learn more
