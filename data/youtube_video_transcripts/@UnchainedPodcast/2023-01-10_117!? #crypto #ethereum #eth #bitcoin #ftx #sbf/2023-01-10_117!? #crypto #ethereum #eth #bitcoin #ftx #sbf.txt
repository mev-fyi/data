okay just a little update on everybody's favorite new California boy Sam bankman freed so according to Illegal filing from Sunday night FTX is now trying to sell off four of its remaining businesses I know what you're thinking ftx's remaining businesses but they do and they're trying to sell them and they have 117 interested parties which is believe it or not more parties than SBF has ever been invited to in his entire life just one issue though a US trustee has filed an objection saying that these companies can't be sold off because they contain information that is relevant to ftx's bankruptcy I wouldn't worry about it though I saw a quote from a very reliable source this morning that said that SBF is definitely not doing anything shady wait let me just oh you know what no no okay I'm looking at it now it this quote is from his mom
