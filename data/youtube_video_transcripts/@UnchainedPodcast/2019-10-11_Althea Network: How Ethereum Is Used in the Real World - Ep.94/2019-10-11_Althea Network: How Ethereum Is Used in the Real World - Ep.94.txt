hi everyone in case you missed it last week I've rolled out a new feature a nun confirmed a weekly news recap this summer I conducted a survey to find out what you listeners wanted and a number of you said you'd be interested in weekly news recap on the show I've now added a few minutes onto every episode of unconfirmed where I go over the big news stories that week so today after I close out with my guest be sure to stick around for my weekend crypto recap now on to the show hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the podcast that reveals how the Marquise meets in crypto are reacting to the week's

Network welcome Deborah thank you for so much for having me what problem are you trying to solve and how does healthy a network address that problem so we're trying to solve the problem of big telecom being highly monopolized and right now we see that legacy Internet users are paying high prices for slow speeds because last mile networks are are siloed by ownership and have long lock in when you have Internet service to your home you're locked in with just one one device and one internet service provider but with Althea instead of one company owning all of the infrastructure of the network via software lets us leverage existing homes and businesses in an efficient way and then we can build out these centralized internet service providers we're neighbors pay neighbors for bandwidth and so you live in an area where people are using this tell me about where you live and why you you guys don't have easy to access internet yeah so hi livin classic and I Oregon which is a rural community that's that's typical like many rural communities where this this process population there's this some lower-income folks um you know blue-collar people and some challenging geography and many people there see at megabit per second speeds as their normal home internet and cost is also a barrier but that's not like the the whole story there's actually is fast high speed internet through the center of town it just can't it's not well coordinated to be able to reach the the people that don't have good good internet service so so this is why we set up to decentralize I'll see a network there and it's a it's pretty exciting to see now that we have people that don't like a farm and or a business or a house are or setting up some attend equipment and forwarding backwards to our neighbors and getting paid automatically for doing that and this also uses aetherium oh yes so basically people get aetherium from like the coin base op or you know any kind of app for exchange on your phone and then they get that into the router by scanning a QR code on the dashboard and then once it's actually in the router it bridges to X I so it has a stable a stable component I don't know what X is so exercise a stable coin on the the PO in network oh okay Oh interesting so this allows people to buy the easily available aetherium using the debit cards but still have that stabilized out in that router so that their internet bill doesn't fluctuate between twenty to forty dollars based on the price of aetherium okay so they're basically paying each other and dollars using this table coin yeah it feels very much the end user like they are that that they put $20 on their router and that pays our neighbors for for the bandwidth and so physically like what is the setup and like where did the different players on the network get their hardware or equipment and how do they pay for it like do they have to pay it up front and then they like wait to get paid back by the neighbors or like how does that part work yeah so we also realize that in the service providing space there's kind of a need for you know if something goes wrong you're gonna call somebody or you know maybe you need somehow vocals installing equipment or someplace to buy the equipment from and so we haven't also another incentive for what we call the group of organizers right so and this in this particular network in Oregon it's a cooperative and they're there to help people get installed and and also there are there's questions and that kind of thing as well so basically but they have to like pay it up front and then they get paid back yeah so for people that want to participate and resell bandwidth they buy their they buy their equipment and then the network organizers help them set it up and then I quote for example we have won a relay her name is Linda she she lives on a farm and she hosts a connecting antenna and a couple of sectors antennas that connect her neighbor up and in a relay is what somebody who's giving internet access to others ok yeah so they're they're taking bandwidth from the the sort of high speed fiber backhaul and then they're connecting their neighbors up and the backhaul is like we're kind of your little community connects to the main Internet is that that's a good description yeah so Linda she she know that she has her Hardware set up her router in her home is like a normal consumer router but it's running off via software so as her neighbors her connected neighbors use the bandwidth she gets paid automatically to her router wallet so about a once every couple of months she cashes out her one hundred hundred fifty dollars okay and our is the payments is that like per usage or is that unlike a monthly payment and like you know do I like if I'm using it and I'm not a relay do I like have to manually pay it or is it like automatically done yeah so that's that's the key is that users load their routers up with they buy aetherium and they load their routers up with token and as they use it and that is as they use bandwidth on a per gigabyte paces basis then the routers automatically compute the billing and pay the upstream relay oh wow so it's like pay-as-you-go basically yeah yeah absolutely and this allows different relays now one thing I did want to mention really briefly is that one of the components of all theater what they call a price of we're rounding protocol so that if if you're an end-user and you're connected to more than one upstream provider our protocol will switch automatically second by second to the cheapest link so as in that sort of automatic competition oh wow so the neighbors can link or the relays can charge different amounts yes exactly Oh interesting okay well so then they're incentivized to like yeah we have we have one user we have one relay that will go every weekend with a bottle of wine to his neighbors and see if they want to get connected to his relay so that's also that kind of viral growth oh that's cute that's funny and then what about like privacy issues because like if I'm you know using somebody else's internet essentially like is that something that you know could be a security issue yeah so first I want to just make sure I clear up any kind of miscommunication it also it's not a Wi-Fi hotspot so when users connect to your neighbor you're using long range antenna equipment on your roof so you're not using the Wi-Fi hotspot of your of your home connection and then also we encrypt all of those links in the in the local network using wire guard and and then that's decrypted at a server in a data center and how much are people generally earning from this so lint is a good example she is about six or seven connected people and she makes you know she offsets her own usage so her own usage is basically free for her and then she'll you know make maybe a hundred dollars every two months or 150 something like that oh well okay so she's not paying for her usage yes she's not paying and then she's also making some money okay and how many users do you have overall so we have around 40 okay yeah I would get started about March of this year and now and we're also rolling out with some new networks coming soon - oh cool well so tell me how you even got started doing this well I I had been in the net neutrality and internet freedoms kind of space for a while and then in on a little legislative perspective trying to you know move move regulation to protect the freedoms of our internet and also just a mesh networking enthusiast really excited about that but I've been doing that for a while and realized that I wasn't you know able to make traction that way I wasn't able to effect change to protects our you know key freedoms or change the sort of monopoly big telecom has and it was at that time that I met the other two co-founders Jehan Trebek and Jessica Patrick who had been working on Althea before me and I had I had a company at that time called cascade and mesh net and that's when we started working together alright so in a moment we're going to talk about how Althea got started and where they're going next but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto comm have you seen the MCO Visa Card a metal card loaded with perks with up to 5% back and unlimited airport lounge access they pay for your Spotify and Netflix - what's not to love with crypto com not only can you spend your crypto but you can grow it to earn up to 8% per year on the most popular coins like BTC eath XRP and up to 12% per year unstable coins join the over 1 million others and download the crypto comm app today will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations cipher trace is working on this vision of the future sign up to stay up to date on the privacy enhanced compliance initiative and receive authoritative crypto AML reports quarterly WWF retraced calm / keep Krypto clean back to my conversation with Severus impure so when you were saying like you know you got involved in this like did you kind of just recently move to the community and then realize like oh they have this problem or like how did you guys figure out that this could be a solution for you go ahead so I moved a community about thirteen thirteen years ago so no I had been there for quite some time and had always envisioned that a community network and a sustainable network like this would be the answer but before before the technology even to run a wireless Internet service provider would not work while in this community because of it actually some of the geographical challenges the the way that the network would have to be configured around a centralized tower would not make physical sense Alethea allows us to set this up in an agile kind of decentralized way that allows us to get around some of these physical barriers even to that was not possible so so really it was off the ASEC nology that made this network possible and what were the physical barriers so a klutz and I lies in a valley and and there's these large hills so you if you have one tower on one hill you would not be able to see under the shadow of that particular Tower that particular hill and it's it's pretty much just a bunch of hills and valleys and also large trees and so these relays then maybe they can see four or five houses around that corner and then they bounce to another house and in fact we have one link if you don't mind I'd love to share with you that it bounces from the central it goes from the central part of the town to out in the valley to up on the hill to another relay up on the hill and then from up on the hill and other three miles out to where the river is someone knocks up someone out there though there would not have been any way possible to connect that person up before oh wow they went from having a megabit per second DSL connection to you know 40 to 50 megabits per second a broadband internet because that was possible oh that's great yeah it's there's something very rube goldberg and about it but like it works you know yeah a little bit I think that our networks you know coming online we have some urban networks that may look a little bit more standard and then the network we haven't caught can either there's definitely some challenges there um and so before we get to like your expansion I'm curious like when you were trying to explain the crypto aspect to the users on your network was it something that was easy to do or like kind of what were the difficulties in doing that yeah absolutely I think that's really really kind of interesting aspect so of all those users that we have I think maybe one of those had any experience with the crypto currency at all before and many of them are senior citizens I'd say about a third of our network is senior senior citizens and I think that the the reasons why we had such success and I feel like it actually has been pretty pretty successful and pretty pretty overall frictionless is is that we do spend some like some brief you know ten minutes of one-on-one time with someone kind of walking through the process and then we we've also found that using words like digital currency instead of crypto and a payment app instead of an exchange it's more accessible for people interesting but otherwise they seem to get it like yeah I mean they don't necessarily do you think they need to understand all the inner mechanics of it to be able to use it like how most people don't necessarily you need to understand the inner mechanics of iCloud in order to benefit from it and I think that so I think in that case in that perspective they do and just if I can briefly I think what is kind of interesting that when we talk about decentralization and what it actually looks like you know originally we something's network up selling people on the idea of faster and cheaper internet and they bought into that but I am also now hearing that they're excited about the ideals of ownership and choice and resiliency and all these sort of values that we we think about about decentralization that just kind of came into the equation as well Oh interesting that makes sense yeah it's really cool yeah and I love what you said about how all they need it's just like something that works and they don't need to understand how it works and actually that's why I wanted view you because I was kind of like oh this is like a really interesting little experiment where it like it seems kind of separated from like what a lot of people might talk about here at the conference but like this is like usage and adoption and like actual real people benefiting from you know blockchains and cryptocurrencies so yeah so why don't you then tell me about how you guys are expanding and where you're expanding like this is this only for rural areas or can you you know Pi in urban areas yeah so we're excited about some of this network starting we have one in an urban area south of Seattle called Tacoma Washington and this is a community of about 12 neighborhood of like 12,000 people so it's very urban and then within a couple of blocks there and the what we did with this list is we started what we call an Althea hood so the organizers there went and they they did some canvassing and they they pre-register people that pre committed to this when it rolls out and so we've already have 80 people pre committed to using this system in their community and they should looks like be rolling out shoveling the dirt in about a month so that's very exciting we do have another rule network in the Napa Valley in California also coming on it online and in Abuja in Nigeria it's a developing world as well so that'll be interesting to see I think how how that traction happens and how did you even connect with that community so we do we to organize our outreach you know just seeing you know so people come to us and say I think this is a good fit for my writing network my neighborhood and then we have a training program that helps them learn about it and start networks and if it sounds like it's a good fit then they continue to before were them and in what situations would it make sense for urban populations to well we think of urban populations is all having high-speed Internet access and one of the things about being in that community in Tacoma was you know if every maybe six households didn't actually have any internet access or they were only using mobile and and it wasn't very accessible to them so I think that and this was also a lower-income area so that we could compete on price okay so you you need we do find that a lot of people are upset about their internet service provider currently you know but that in isn't enough to gain enough traction you have to have some clearly better value proposition so this in this network it was having a community right network that was also can be competitive on the Pais and how does it compare to typical prices so in that in that neighborhood that folks are paying about $70 a month and our network will be able to comment around 40 okay oh okay well so saving fifty bucks a year huh um okay well is there anything else you want to say about your experience here at def con or or what's going on with all the yeah yeah I think there's some really exciting things coming and I'm so excited to see people working on UX and user facing applications and excited to be here I thank you so much for having me and thanks again great well thanks for coming on unconfirmed thank you and it thanks to you listeners for putting up with what might have been a kind of slightly on like interrupted show because there was a lot of noise in background but anyway don't forget next up is the news recap so stick around for the second edition of this weekend crypto after

guys thanks for tuning in to the second edition of my weekly news recap this one is titled upcoming crypto trend the heir tax and I also like my tagline for the newsletter which is you get attacks you get attacks you get attacks greetings from Osaka Japan where it is almost 4 a.m. and I have not been on Japan time at all this week except for like one day but thankfully I'm leaving in just a few hours ahead of typhoon hagupit I think it's pronounced so my body will soon be where you with the time zone that it just flat-out refused to give up all right so before I get to the headlines I just wanted to say make sure to listen to this week's episode of Unchained with David and a photo of the Federal Reserve Bank of st. Louis he had a very pragmatic approach which I found both refreshing and frustrating when I asked him about the possibility of the US dollar losing its global reserve status he said who cares so it wasn't really expecting a Federal Reserve economist to be that blase but anyway it's getting a lot of interesting comments on Twitter so I think I think people are finding it really fascinating also you just heard my interview with Deborah's impure of the decentralized Internet service provider Althea Network I was searching out examples of how etherium is being used in the real world and I really found it fascinating to learn about how her community in rural Oregon uses etherium and I apologize that the interview may have sounded a bit rushed it was not easy finding a quiet place to record and even when I did it was also really difficult keeping people from barging into the room so I basically just tried to race through the interview alright first headline this week new tax guidance on Hart forks and airdrops not entirely clear so the IRS released more crypto tax guidance and it caused a bit of a ruckus I did clear up at least some accounting related questions but then there were these other rules around taxing airdrops and hard forks that people thought would be either difficult to implement or based on misconceptions and so the difficult to implement part is that you can receive cryptocurrency via airdrop not be aware of that and still have to pay taxes on it so as coin Center put it quote it's like owing income tax when someone buries a gold bar on your property and doesn't tell you about it it's absurd and impossible to reasonably comply the other wrinkle that they pointed out was that they feel the IRS did not use the terms airdrop or hard for it correctly and that the agency sometimes conflated the two on crypto Twitter coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburg also pointed out that actually one of the scenarios of the IRS used it's guidance is something that has never happened and watching president and chief legal officer Marco Santori said that the guidance seems not to take into account the possibility of receiving an airdrop into a custo into a self custody wallet however on the opposite side of the spectrum crypt a lawyer Patrick Merck did express the unpopular opinion that the hard forks and ear chops guidance actually makes sense next headline aetherium lots of aetherium news this week etherium released more details on the transition in 2.0 in the middle of DEFCON 5 and the myriad other adjacent events etherium creator vitaly Butera managed to publish two posts addressing some of the bigger questions overhanging the shift to 2.01 addresses what exactly what exactly developers will need to do for a smooth transition which is mainly increased gas costs and download the code to implement the upgrade but otherwise he says the changes for applications and users will be quite limited the other question he answered via a blog post is whether applications will be able to talk to each other once sharding is implemented and surprise surprise he says yes we will see how that actually turns out it's all TBD next up the SEC denies bitwise his Bitcoin etf application all I can say about this is at least they gave it careful consideration the SEC released a 112 page rationale for the disapproval bitwise his Matt Hogan released a statement saying quote what matters is continued progress and the investment of time from regulators and that's what we see here and the company also tweeted quote historically the journey to approval for first-of-a-kind ATP's bonds gold non-transparent leverage has taken multiple years it's a good thing that they have that perspective because compound at general counsel Jake chevensky tweeted quote at this point it's reasonable to assume that Jake leans SEC will never approve a Bitcoin ETF next story maker down multi collateral die so long as can as questions their own governance continue maker Dow made a slew of announcements at Def Con including the launch date for multi all day which is November 18th you guys if you did not listen to the two interviews I did with CEO rune Christensen earlier this year we do cover how multi collateral die works you should definitely check those out it they are like honestly I really find the system very fascinating and I think you'll enjoy those interviews but just before Devcon Bloomberg also published a piece on maker Dow and it went into more detail on some of the governance issues that have been dogging the project and I felt that it really raised questions about how compliance with the existing regulatory system and the ideals of decentralisation can coexist all right now time for some think pieces a placeholder wrote a piece on why protocols are not businesses so Kris Pearn is key of placeholder adventurers yes he wrote this great post on why protocols are not businesses and instead says that what they do is provide structure for businesses he says quote they are systems of logic that coordinate exchange between suppliers meaning businesses and consumers of a service in all EAJA of a 16 C crypto had a tweet storm and why he does not believe that there will be one dominant blockchain as he puts it quote the trade off space that blockchains inhabit is far too large and high dimensional for a single blockchain to span all of it I found both both pieces really interesting or at least the latter was a tweet storm you guys should definitely check those out and you didn't think you were gonna get away with no Libre headlines did you because I did find one Wired piece I found interesting which sowed which showed that Libre Association members largely have ties to Facebook so this graphic shows the ways in which more than half the Libre Association members have direct or indirect ties to Facebook in particular investors d'Este and andreessen horowitz seem to be huge connectors and the last headline will put one of the bigger sagas of the year to rest hopefully quadriga ZX Widow to pay nine million dollars to customers coin desk reports that Jennifer Robertson quote will be turning over all as except for roughly 160 2700 dollars in personal assets which include cash her retirement savings at 2015 cheap some jewelry personal furnishings clothing and some outstanding shares of quadriga and affiliated entities and finally I always round out my newsletter with what I call fun bits and this is one where you just have to look at the photo but I propose a new Bitcoin price tracker which is when seska's Horace's hair Zappos CEO when says casseras spoke on a panel while sporting basically a huge fro and VJ boy a Pawnee tweeted quote I personally cannot wait to see what one says his hair will look like when Bitcoin hits 100k so that's it for this week's news to learn more about the topics that Deborah and I discussed as well as the
