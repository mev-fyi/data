Gavin wood co-founder and chief white space overlord of parity welcome Gavin and yota please how did you each get involved in crypto and Gavin why don't you start because I think your involvement predated Hotez hmm well I guess it goes back to I think it was early 2013 when I was sitting in bed reading a newspaper article on this crazy place in Berlin where there was this this guy yoke who was oh he had a bar on this street rapist roster in Berlin and he was talking about how it was kind of quite anteus Bushman there was a lot of kind of artists sort of squatters it was very kind of a very foreign scene from my point of view Aras sort of living in a in a suburb of Leeds at the time and he was talking about how a lot of the businesses were switching to or it was making it seem at least how a lot of the businesses was switching to Bitcoin for their means of payment between each other and it really got me thinking you know this is you know is this legitimately you know a sort of sea change in in how the world could work around the same time Silk Road was also gathering some sort of infamous ot and you know but it was all again linked there was you know Tor crypto bitcoins and together they sort of made me sort of think that there might be some sort of underlying kind of social change happening here so I I sort of said about it doing the investigator bit further and I met a guy also featured in the article called the mir taqi I went out to London to see him just that sort of have a chattin and figure out you know what what's what's going on here that one thing led to another I sort of got to know a bunch of people in the space and eventually vitalik and I I sort of set about working on on ethereum which she'd very recently published a white paper on sort of proposal for if you like a kind of a rethink of blockchain or Bitcoin it was all Bitcoin at the time there wasn't really blockchain back then and I figured this would be a really interesting way of getting to learn about the technology and also in some sense understand at a deeper level what sort of implications it might have for society in general so it was around December 2013 that I I said about coding a theorem basically and things progressed kind of quickly from from there on for me January going to Miami and sort of meeting all of the all the other guys in the sort of space and February we basically kind of launched the thing that I've been writing is that the sort of initial proof of concept of ethereum and yeah I mean a lot of a lot of crazy antics followed and here we are now yeah seriously I mean your stories yeah obviously an important one in the ethereal space and you know - how about you I got involved a few months later around May 2014 so almost five years ago now coming from a bit of a different angle mainly driven through personally I guess like I was I got more concerned after the Snowden revelations like how allies work online privacy what's happening to my data so I was researching like what's the most up-to-date tool for sharing personal data encrypted and and and found discussions online where people were speculating how to use a theorem in that context and that got me interested I think I first came across mate save and then some links later found myself on on reddit people talking about the theorem and then saw that gap would be in Berlin speaking at the Bitcoin meetup but they get back then about the theorem and so I went there and that's how that to know the people and get more interested and so as we have mentioned you know before at theory but really was all about Bitcoin and so why did you guys become so captivated by aetherium itself to me was was really like that idea like how to how to react attacked the web and I think gave crystallized that very succinctly in the post that he wrote it wrote about web 3 and the idea of how to build a complete peer-to-peer stack of the of the web to to fix a lot of the issues that we see these days so that was really really what I what so much resonated with me like being fed up with the fact that I had to rely on all these de facto institutions online yeah yeah when I when I came to the space I guess it was you know I saw Bitcoin before 2013 but I kind of dismissed it as being a bit of a wacky idea this sort of currency that didn't really have any real sort of meaning or grounding in the world and it was only later when I figured that actually there might be some legitimate utility in the technology and be lying in a Bitcoin when etherium came along I could see it was an improvement but I couldn't really understand what the what the real ramifications were like it was if you go back to the initial proposal that metalic made in late 2013 it was really kind of a more programmable version of Bitcoin but it wasn't there wasn't anything you know fundamentally different in how it was in how it was being pushed it was still very much a purely a blockchain solution the idea was that you had they had money the idea was that you could attach rules to the money but the sort of main distinction was that these rules could be true or incomplete and that was that was all all of the real communications about why is Bitcoin why is a theorem different a Bitcoin back then revolved around this churring complete concept and just to explain so but because I'm not a technical person like I have heard like a turing-complete but what what is the significance of that essentially it means that you can you can express any sort of set of rules or process or business logic that you want so chirring chirring completeness is is merely a way of stating that a particular language can express basically any kind of concept that we can come up with so it's basically the difference between Bitcoin being a calculator that can do some specific things and then the computer can do which can do like anything basically in that's right so when we got to actually writing aetherium I remember having a bit of a Eureka moment in January 2014 where I sort of understood that the whereas Bitcoin was crypto currency and whereas some other projects out there were really trying to become the crypto finance well you know introducing financial contracts and so on I understood that the the real sort of tangible utility of ethereum was to become a sort of crypto legal system and that would have that much more of a ramification for society in general and as time went on it became increasingly clear that for aetherium to really have you know utility all the utility wanted to have it really needed to pull together a number of other technologies so it was only one piece of a wider puzzle so the idea with Bitcoin the idea of blockchain in general is to reduce trust between participants right so when we go and do a transaction society typically if we go down the shop and we buy some bananas and we pay with our credit card we involve trusting a number of people that we don't really think about we have to trust the credit card we have to trust the the guy who made the credit card machine we have to trust the bank to process the transactions we have to trust the receiving bank to process they're there and we have to trust any if there's any label on the banana that says hey this banana came from Brazil then we have to trust through ever you know put the label on we have to trust the trademark of the label we have to trust the shopkeeper that he's selling us bananas from that haven't gone off or their arm barred all that would you know didn't have bad pesticides used in them and the list goes on and on we trust an awful lot of people in our daily life and the idea of blockchain and general is to reduce this amount of trust that we have to that we have to put ourselves under but it it only works so far blockchain is only part of the answer another part of the answer is to ensure that there's you know an effective communications mechanism behind the blockchain or to the side of the blockchain that allows us to get information that perhaps the blockchain references but that we can't be sure is necessarily sort of true so the blockchain isn't very good at storing lots and lots of information publishing information or allowing people to communicate between each other so there are additional technology still in the cryptographic ecosystem but that needs to be created in order to allow blockchain to fulfill its sort of duty as the crypto decentralized crystallis legal system by basically allowing people to communicate in a way that they'd have to trust any additional sender so if I want to talk to you for example on email or on Facebook then I have to trust the Mark Zuckerberg or Sergey and Larry to not look at what I'm talking to her about or not change the messages or ensure that they get delivered on time all the rest of it so it's really about trying to build block pain in general for me of this space for me is about trying to build a wholly new set of technologies that can replace the way that we do things which rely on trust I think I tend to think slightly differently about the trust aspect these days it's to me more about making trust a lot more granular so when I think of Google and Facebook like I probably trust Google that they do have really good operation and can do calculation calculation is really fast like but I don't trust them to actually care about my personal data and like being able to make like all these different things that also these companies do and in a way like far more transparent and granular and accessible and untraceable for me that's that's what I hope we can deliver yeah and something I've been thinking about is I don't know if it's even like that then we don't have to trust it's that then instead we're trusting technology because we're still trusting something but in your case where you know how this technology works like maybe Trust isn't the word that you would use but in my case where I don't really know you know I like I can't check the code so the main thing is that you can even if you yourself can't check the code you can find somebody you can go out you can put an advert up you can contact your brother-in-law's mate but you can find someone that you do trust to some degree and have them check the code for you like someone who's an expert or you can pay multiple experts none of whom have aligned interests and get them all to check the code in principle that Avenue is open to you in an in a system that's open and transparent it's never open to you in a system that's closed and opaque like the traditional corporate Silicon Valley style startup where you know these the operations and the internal workings of the systems are closely guarded yeah or on the flip side and also the big Wall Street institutions too and actually one other thing I wanted to ask when you were describing that kind of vision that you had and you were saying that there needed to be other entities in this decentralized legal system like what are some examples of other entities you're thinking of so the main the main aspects of this kind of decentralized economy that I put forward aside from the sort of crypto legal system were a means of publishing information and a cryptographically secure manner it would that be like an Oracle that would be basically a bit like BitTorrent a bit like a means of like just pushing information off to thee to the cloud to the centralized very very thing but not necessarily verifying it but certainly being able to be sure that if you download some information that you believe that you have some digest off so you've been given that sort of key for the information being certain that the information that you've been given exactly corresponds to what it is that you are asked for and that's not something that we have if at the moment if I want some information from a website or whatever I I can go to the website I have a URL so I have like someone's sister says here's a URL go read this news articles and I can put the URL into Google Chrome and it will go and download the news article but I can't be sure that it's the same news article that I read now most of the time it will be but if I live in a in a more repressive state that has a greater control on the media then I don't get that guarantee quite so solidly and what we have here is the ability to if you have to gives me a special key what we call hash or digest then any information that I get I can actually check to make sure that this is that this the digest of this information the digest the news article exactly matches this much shorter herschel digest that Yetta gave me so I can be sure that I'm reading the same content okay so it's sort of like ipfs no way Thanks actually ipfs kind of came along and after BitTorrent but it kind of at least parts of IPS solve a very similar problem and then the other one is like a means of communications between two or more parties could be seen as somewhere between a sort of instant message so the bells that sort of just send a message and then have it arrive in a timely fashion at you know on someone else's computer or it can be seen as a sort of bulletin board where you can post a message and if people know the sort of topic that they're looking out that they want to look out for that your message sort of mentions and they will get your message that can be seen more like Twitter right so you use a hashtag in people who are following that hashtag can see can see your message so something that's sufficiently general to be able to be used for all of these different kind of communication use cases but is also again cryptographically secure so you get certain guarantees you get guarantees that if they don't know the topic they won't be able to read the message that I've got the message they won't know ever existed if they if I send a message and I say it's from me then whoever reads it and knows that it's definitely me who wrote it and again you don't get these on traditional platforms because if you post the message on Facebook it's Facebook that tell people it's you who posted it and if you know Mark Zuckerberg is having a bad day and he really doesn't like you and he wants to make you he wants to sort of make you post something that you didn't actually post then he's perfectly able to go into his servers and insert a message that claims to be from you but it actually isn't of course he's not going to do that but hackers might do that and they could make your life kind of annoying if they wanted to oh yeah yeah which has happened a ton already both in the non crypto space and the real and the crypto space so you guys had these ideas which actually are similar or at least converge and you were both officially working with aetherium and then you left to start parody in late 2015 why what was the motivation for that and what does parody do so there were a number of reasons why you know I like that sort of turn of events happen but the sort of big underlying one was that aetherium was was a project that was at the time it had been launched it was in some sense as far as version one went reaching a degree of maturity so I had been built it was now sort of out in the open there was no clear governance on how it should change and there was no sort of unlike a normal startup it was sort of based around a foundation that didn't again have a real clear roadmap or in terms of execution on how to actually move the thing forward because of course aetherium is a protocol sort of existed and-and-and the foundation didn't have any direct control over that so really we wanted to or at least for me I wanted to sort of get out and and build sort of carry on building build more stuff and I I felt in some sense that the foundation wasn't the right place to be doing that partly you know as a foundation it was sort of constrained and what it's what it's able to do both in terms of resources and in terms of the sort of missions and goals and so it felt a perfectly reasonable thing to sort of stay on good terms but nonetheless work from within a private entity in the same ecosystem so I didn't view it as leaving a theory or my view it is simply you know sort of setting up a an entity with which we could really deliver as much value as possible in the ecosystem yeah and you continued working on a period because you guys have created well not just the parity aetherium client but then also you've been working with other blog chains like doing stuff for Z cash and you also have some consumer facing products but now yeah I think for me it was really I mean I was working partially also on on some applications really like that wanted to use the theorem in supply chain I'm a project called profit and then for me it was really also the realization that it wasn't like even though it was like the first version and it wasn't there yet for so you could actually use it and I felt there's a lot that needs doing sort of on the lower level again and how do you see the right way of doing that and that's what we committed to basically building blockchain technology making that accessible for people yeah which is kind of the perfect segue to your next big you guys will be launching polka dot potentially later this year which is a new protocol how did you have the idea for polka dot and what problems are you attempting to solve with it the idea of polka dot sort of goes back to I think it was late 2014 early 2015 I wrote a small article called chain fibers it's published I think it's still on the etherium wiki and the idea was to put forward a means of scaling aetherium so what's now called sharding and sort of an early version of what perhaps might be called the theorem 2.0 and it was something that certainly for the first couple a year year and a half of parities existence we we wanted to stay very much in line with them with the direction of the affair and foundation and the technology the specifications and so on that they were putting out but as time wore on we kind of thought well you know would we're kind of sat here not twiddling our thumbs but you know we really want to be developing cooler stuff we don't want to let the world move on too far without us so let's start thinking about you know how what kind of cool stuff can we do so I went back to chained fibers and I thought well this is a this is a bit too similar to actually theorem 2.0 so I don't want to do it itself because you know I've much preferred to just sort of stay in line with the with your theorem protocol itself but maybe we can create something from it that fulfills our sort of different task a different sort of Kneeshaw use case and that was that was when I sort of I was like sat in a cafe I think in San Francisco with one of them one of the our sort of founding developers Merrick just sort of chatting about well you know if we were to do something that was you know sharded or parallelizable what be the simplest possible way we could we could push this forward you know how could we deliver something as soon as possible because you know you don't want to take you know three four five years in order to in order to get to this so we took chain fibers basically removed all the stuff we made us the problem as simple as possible I'll give you an example of how we made it simpler in in etherium as it stands and in chain fibers the idea is that individual smart contracts if they want to interact with another smart contract so the one I like spend some tokens for example then that message would happen synchronously which means it happens immediately so they get they get sort of all figured out at all at the same time it's not that it happens seconds or minutes later it's lot harder to make things synchronous because if you have the way that you make a system scalable is you split up you divide and conquer so you split up the problem the smart contracts across lots and lots of different computers and you have them all execute them at the same time allows you to execute that many more it's almost like sailor splitting a workload up between lots and lots of like managers or whatever as factory factory floor workers so they can each do the workload independently and come back and assemble the finished product much faster than if one person were just sort of doing everything themselves but the problem is that if the workload involves those you know several of these people sort of communicating with each other then it becomes harder because they're they're busy working off on their own corner right they can't talk to each other so easily so what we did we made it very simple and we said right well actually they can't sort of talk to each other so as they're as they're busy working off in their own corner they can only talk to each other sort of at the end of the day when all the messages sort of get routed so you got we've got a very simple memo system basically and that simplifies things an awful lot I made the protocol something that we believe we can develop you know in the next 18 to 24 months as as was in the next 18 to 24 months now what we've realized not long after that was why are we bothering all these workers when they're going off to their different corner and doing their jobs why are we insisting that these workers have the same kind of job wiring assisting that there's only kind of one type of job the job of executing aetherium smart contracts why don't we make it so that these workers can execute any kind of a job so we can make them each have their individual special he's the main that they can work in so one could be a doctor and another could be a lawyer and another could be a postman and another could be a bank cashier and then they can all come together and kind of chat to each other at the end of the day with a memo system but most of the time they'd be off doing their individual specific domain specific activity workload and that's really where polka-dot came from polka dot was this idea of saying right well when we scale we don't necessarily have to just scale a single protocol a single kind of blockchain we can actually scale but also have lots of different kinds of blob chains all connected together doing they're each doing their individual domain-specific speciality but still able to sort of chat to each other and critically share in the same security guarantees now again of course you can have many different block chains each doing their own thing we already have that we have Bitcoin doing currency and we have Z cash doing sort of opaque crypto crypto transaction currencies we have aetherium doing smart contracts there are many different block chains out there each fulfilling their their independent domain-specific goals but the problem is that they each need to be secured individually and their security works by basically for a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin and aetherium it works by having people spends money on wasting lots of compute power right so they spend money on basically keeping a small corner of China very warm and and that's like that's not that's obviously not such a good idea for a number of reasons the main one being that different individual block chains would each have to add to the heat as they want to make make themselves more secure because they can't share in the other blockchain security if I launch a blockchain I can't share in Bitcoin security unless I can persuade all of the Bitcoin miners to also mine my chain and with proof of stake the problem is the same so this is a new way of securing block chains but it still suffers from the same problem that you can't easily share the security if you want to add a new proof of state blockchain you also have to find lots and lots of but all lots of money that will sit behind your blockchain and sort of insists that it's it's valid as they create new blocks and process more transactions and really what polka-dot that sort of nice really important new thing about polkadot is that it does allow these lots of different block chains but it allows them to share in the security so they can each by creating more utility drawing more capital to the system they each gain additional security so it sounds to me like there's kind of three main things you're trying to solve scalability interoperability and then security which is basically like like reducing startup costs you know you know the way that like Dropbox can do that now whereas like back in the day startups would have to spin up their own servers and stuff like that and just for listeners kind of like the technical ways this happens and tell me if I get any of this wrong but there's the real a chain where that's where like the communication at the end of the day happens and then the pair of chains are like the doctor the lawyer or the banker that you talked about and then bridges are where you take the already existing block chains they're out there and like make it so that they can interoperate in this system is that yeah okay so something when I was like thinking my best I was a little bit like okay so how did the chains I'll talk to each other because as far as I understand I think like you can be in Anna theory of a smart contract and call it a Zoe's contract or you can be like in aetherium and then make a Z cash transaction happen with it is does that mean that you guys had to write instructions for every possible permutation of cross-chain communication or is there some way of doing it without like literally how you know cuz it just seems like that would be a lot of work for every time a new pair of gene gets out it like you'd have to write 50 you know different instructions for how to talk to all the other pair of chains yeah I mean it's much of the utility of poccadot is really providing this housing for new blockchains that said polkadot is by facilitating what we might say is very sophisticated logic much more so than a typical smart contract we do for we do allow bridges that essentially have to be light clients right so they have to be these quite really quite complex pieces of of logic that can synchronize 2x2 sort of external chains be it like a sauce or aetherium or sea cash or whatever we allow these light clients to sit actually inside our consensus protocols inside polka dot insight as one of the parrot reigns but I don't want to the point of polka dot isn't really to have be a lot of bridges we sort of envision a few bridges but we don't envision like you know hundreds of bridges in order to connect all of the block chains that's polka dot will be much more valuable as as a as a sort of testbed as a as a execution ground for many individual sort of domain-specific projects to bring their own logic and actually execute the logic within polka dot rather than having separate block chains and sort of having this bridge now for bridges for bridging sort of existing systems the bridge component itself wouldn't would would be the the go-between the sort of translator if you like between what will likely be standard messages within polka dot messages that say hey you know I've burn five Bitcoin tokens you need to mint five Bitcoin tokens on your side in order to ensure that all of the Bitcoin tokens in the systems they the total number stays the same those kinds of messages would be interpreted by the bridge and the bridge would do things like unlocking bitcoins on the Bitcoin chain or transferring Bitcoin that was previously sort of under the mission of the of the polka dot validators to wherever it was that the power chain that sort of supposedly holds this Bitcoin wanted it to go so in essence these messages are being translated by the bridge authorities so they're not being it's not the Bitcoin has to learn what these messages are but it's also not that the pair of chains have to sort of figure out first hey is it going to Bitcoin them we need to send this or is it going to a theorem then we need to send that the message is realistically there will be probably just one or two relatively a small like thin standards for these kinds of messages they don't need to be very complicated because polka-dot guarantees things like that the message will be delivered or be delivered once and it will be little delivered where it needs to go so you get very very strong economically strong guarantees on these messages which means the messages just need to be kind of like mint five bitcoins because I I burn to fight bitcoins on my side beyond that the bridges so new pair of chains will likely just build these standards into them but bridges will have to translate between from the standards that polkadot has the sort of polkadot native messaging into the into some action that can be concretely taken on the on the sort of foreign blockchain like Bitcoin our theory okay but the pair of chains it sounds like though even just from building them there will be some like standard way that though they'll be one or two standardized messages I'm sure in the same way that aetherium shortly after it launched we standardized the ERC 20 format for for token contracts okay so they'll be kind of similar similar efforts with interpreter and then also if security is one of the features they are offering why is it only 50 to 100 validators like is that decentralized insecure enough so that won't be that's more as a launch thing with the fact that there won't be very many parrot eanes at launch it takes time for the ecosystem to build up and therefore there's not really any great need to have a thousand validators on day one but certainly once the system is fully up to speed were designing it to have off the order of a thousand validators all that slow down the block timer or the communication or anything no the nice thing is that we have we've built a special sort of new protocol hybrid babe and Grandpa that means that it won't slow down it's actually really clever in how it manages it basically it has adaptive finality so you'll hear some talk of probabilistic finality and of instant finality so probabilistic finality is basically non finality so Bitcoin in a theorem and examples of these this is where as new transactions are added as new blocks are added to the chain you can never be absolutely certain that those transactions will stay there indefinitely they could there's always a small chance that the chain will be reverted and that instead of those transactions whether mutually exclusive transactions will be will be processed and this is what we call double spending now the the newer thing that the sort of thing that a lot of projects that are basing their consensus on an old algorithm called pbft practical Byzantine fault tolerance they're these projects are claiming instant finality and what they mean by that is that as soon as the block is produced so as soon as the transactions are sort of laid out there and published then the there is a guarantee and economic guarantee so you can be sure up to that someone will have to lose a million dollars or something that these transactions won't be reverted that the block will stay there forever ad infinitum that they will never be sort of moved back and then some other transactions in place then it's dead now the problem with instant finality is that you don't get any by linking block production so the creation of this block and the transactions in it and finalization what you're doing is you're saying right all of the parties that are needed for finalization and it's quite a complex algorithm so you need a slice ability of a thousand validators where you need two-thirds of these validators so about six hundred and eighty or whatever to come back and sort of communicate all with each other have to send a message to each of the other six hundred and eighty validators and get a response right and then send another message and they these this has to happen before the block can be even published right so rather than in typical systems like Bitcoin for example where two minor block you really just solve a little numerical problem rather difficult one as it happens but still a very small problem that can easily be recognized and then you just publish it that's it don't there's nothing more than that in these instant finality systems it's not actually very instant right it takes quite a long time for all of this protocol to sort of get itself get its head together and actually make it make its mind up which block is going to be next because you're tying together finality which is a much harder thing to do the production which is very easy so what we've done here with our hybrid algorithm is split off these two things so production is still as fast as it would be on etherium or Bitcoin it's very very easy simple thing you just recognize that someone was the right person to create the block at this time and it's done and then finality follows it and if network conditions are good then it follows it really quickly follows it about as quickly as even in instant final incident finalization innocent finality but if network conditions are not so good where instant finality will actually just never ever produce anything it will just sort of like behind a bit more right so there will be an extra let's say 10 or 50 blocks that are sort of almost certainly final but not definitely definitely finals and that if you're using it for like low amounts of transactions like sorry low value transactions like you're buying a cup of coffee it really doesn't matter you just trust it but if it's if you're using it to transfer you know a hundred million dollars and you want to make sure you've got the hundred million dollars before you let go of the brief of the suitcase of cash and the guy goes off on his merry way then you would wait for the 50 or whatever blocks before you get guaranteed finality so what this allows us to do is to increase the number of validators so we can decentralized further and that's very much opposed to the fast finality route of so called instant finality route where you have to keep the number of validator slow because you can't produce even blocks without having all of these guys basically talk to each other quite a bit and that's that can be problematic and there certainly certain circumstances if you're talking it that there's going to be thousands of validators so aetherium to for example the targeting around that means vaguely the same sort of numbers one to ten thousand validators so we we decentralized further in polka dot though by having a notion of nominators and nominators allow us to decentralize if not the block sort of if not the chains underlying computational maintenance most people in the service at least the funding of the validators so nominators can nominate a number of validators to sort of act on their behalf right so they have some funds they have some capital behind them denominators and they in some sense kind of lend it to the validators for the purposes of getting block rewards that the validators would take and we've got all sorts of economic sort of incentivization to ensure that you know it becomes fair and there's market mechanism so that over overly popular validators don't take you know over over two amounts of funds that certain other systems so far Frances yes which is super important for security all right so we're gonna discuss governance and substrate after the break but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors at

cipher trace comm slash Unchained back to my conversation with Gavin wood and yata Steiner of Paradis how does governance work on polka-dot well we haven't finalized the governance protocol for poker yet so everything that I say here is you know subject to the usual it needs to be audited our research team needs to sort of say that it's say that they're happy with it but I can I can certainly talk about what we have so far so in poker lot in the current proof of concept we have a if you like kind of by Cavill system in some sense on the one hand we have the legislature which is the group of people that or group of accounts whatever economic entities that can sort of pass new laws so to speak which in the context of poccadot means having this kind of super user administrative privilege to alter the code of the chain and potentially also alter storage aspects which alter the state of the chain now altering the code of the chain might mean fixing bugs it might mean rolling out upgrades it might mean correcting for previous for the for the problematic actions of previous blog books now I mentioned there was there were two houses so the other one is kind of this notion of the council so the council can be viewed upon as a an executive body within polka-dot and what the council the council gets a few sort of bonus actions that it can take so the council can put forward proposals for the legislature to vote on so in some sense it's a little bit like the UK's government where the the parliament has as their she's a house of around 650 or the House of Commons at least has about 650 people in it and they can pass new laws through a majority vote and then the government or the current sort of executive which is around 100 to 150 of these people are the ones that can sort of propose by and large they're the ones who can control the timeline that votes that particular proposals for votes happens there's a few interesting tweaks though that we've made so while the legislature is I mentioned that it was sort of a large body referendum so it's a referendum of token holders so everyone in halls bought tokens and the polka-dot system would in principle be able to vote on on measures and their votes are weighted according to the number of docto cones that they hold but they are also weighted according to a second thing which is the period by which they are happy to to hold their doctor because the hobble their doctor gets right to not sell to not move them elsewhere so as holders are more committed to the platform so they give up the optionality of removing themselves from the platform they become they get a greater amount of voting power furthermore there's another interesting sort of tweak that we've made to the referendum systems which is that there's a period between the end of the vote and the enactment of that vote so that whatever the proposal if assuming it passes of course whatever the proposal was was proposing there is a period between a deciding that it will be put that would that it will be enacted and actually enacting it's about two weeks during this period those who voted in approval of it are not allowed to move their tokens at all right so there there's a minimum kind of lock period of this two weeks before it's enacted and also during the two weeks those who voted against it and those who didn't vote at all are able to move their tokens they're able to sort of say well you know we think this is a terrible terrible decision for the system and we're going to move everything that we have out of the system we're going to sell up we're going to go potentially we're going too hard for who knows and this is meant as a means of mitigating things like vote buying since we are coin holder oriented everything in polkadot is decided ultimately by the by the set of coin voters weighted according to their commitment to the platform we want to ensure that those holders that basically third parties can't come in buy a bunch of loan-out a bunch of tokens throw a particular proposal and then exit without paying any costs we want to ensure that no one's gonna want to loan these guys any tokens for the purpose of sort of destroying the system through about proposals and also why did you guys decide on like this kind of you know more activist and basically Unchained governance as we know this was something where like I know the etherium system actually decided okay we're gonna do off chain like why did you decide to go to this direction so if you I view governance as a I view governor's as an as a problem of trust so in much the same way that Bitcoin solved the trust of currency of being able to send tokens without going to trust banks or poor essential coin issuer in the same way theorem is trying to solve the trust of law right of counterparty risk and so on I view governance is another one of those issues it's it's a trust of a of a process right it's the trust of that whoever is has the authority or whoever whichever assembled actors have the collective authority to alter a system to do things that the system you know wasn't in some sense designed to do it's a problem of trusting that they won't act in a way that is against your your wish without giving you a chance to kind of exit or or at least have some sort of say proportional to what your expectations would be so it's it's about making open and transparent the process for how the system will change over time now off chain governance isn't really a thing off chain governance is really just saying well we don't want to have very transparent processes we don't want to have a means of ensuring that the rights and obligations of the various actors in the system are clear what we want to do is kind of just have everything be quite vague and then the current polity as it stands the current people who are essentially in charge and hold the cards and have the power we'll just sort of we believe that that system should just keep going so I view off chain governance really as a we don't want to tackle the problem because we're quite happy with the problem being there I see on chain governance as a means of solving the issue of transparency and openness in exactly the same way that smart contracts solve the transparency openness of counterparty risk and all the rest of it and in the exactly the same way the Bitcoin solves the transparency and openness of currency and how long they are sending value across the internet the only question in my mind is can we are we clever enough in order to be able to design these rules these hard rules by which a system like you know aetherium or polkadot or whatever else should be governed on day one I have no doubt that we will solve it over time like we experiment we find what our what works the question is whether we can sort of get something that more or less works or at least works works as well on day one and that's really the challenge for us now so one thing I was wondering was like if I'm a developer one will it make more sense for me to build an idea as adapt on aetherium versus as a pair of chain on polkadot so I mean one thing that's why we here today I guess one thing we're putting out very soon as substrate that framework that I've been developing to make it easy to building block chains it's used in polkadot and which is I think the best way of getting into it and experimenting like what you can do with it you can also use it like without trying into the polka dot framework and some people are doing that as well but it's really like our learning from having built a bunch of block chains and like making that easy to to come by your own ideas and use like the networking stack and whatnot without having to build it yourselves so I think now is actually a pretty good moment of starting to experiment with it even though it's still a bit uncertain when exactly the launch is going to be yeah so the difference between smart contracts and building your own sort of dapper chain so polkadot pirate chains are really designed to be fully fledged block chains which means they do they do one very particular domain specific thing and they do it well they don't suffer from a lot of the restrictions that you would have on a smart contract system so there's a notion and we were you know during my time at ethereum we were we were happy to sort of have this notion sort of be the bee trumpeted from the from the rooftops that a smart contract system can do anything you can do anything in smart contracts it's sure incomplete you can do absolutely anything you want it's not true really while it is during complete it has very very particular limitation and you know I was I did mention this at the time so I don't I don't consider myself one of the worst offenders but the limitation is gasps right there is this notion of computational resources that your smart contracts can never not respect right if it runs out of gas then it stops and everything gets reverted right so when you write smart contracts you have to be very very careful that they don't use more gas than they're allowed and this isn't necessarily the case smart contract systems are a smart contract blockchain like aetherium is heavily heavily constrains its users heavily constrains the logic that can operate on it by having this notion of gas the gas becomes an economy in and of itself so users of smart contracts don't pay the operators of smart contracts so if I publish a smart contract I don't get well I don't I don't automatically get paid for when a user uses it rather users of smart contracts pay a theory of miners and your theory miners are the ones that take that profit what this means is that as a DAP there are three people to the party when you would really prefer there just be two right you want yourself and your users but if there in forces you to have the etherium miners to the party as well right and they get a cut of anything that you and your users are doing we designed it in this way because you know we wanted the etherium token to be yes valuable and this is one of the ways that you make it valuable but the problem is that for the apps it often makes it just way too expensive to do anything because you're forcing your users to pay for every single transaction they make with the smart contract and most of the time not only will they have to pay the etherium miners but they'll also have to pay you for whatever services that your smart contract offers as well so everything just becomes way more expensive partly because you have to pay the existing aetherium infrastructure to keep doing its job now if all you're doing is transferring money like on Bitcoin then you know hey whatever it's just the sort of small percentage we don't really mind cause a comparison use case that percentage would be way higher so it looks good but when I'm talking about smart contracts and there isn't you're not necessarily transferring money you're like I don't know messing around with crypto kitties or something suddenly these transaction fees look so so so nice especially when you're trying to get it into into the hands of people that are used to having literally everything for free because they're using Zuckerberg or or or Sergey Brin Larry page's sort of offerings so what we do in polka-dot what polka-dot facilitates separate them very much unlike smart contracts is to route is to return it back to a to actor economy again you've got your users and you've got yourself right so when you put forward a pair of chain adapt chain or whatever then you don't have to care about the polka dot miners they do their job but they don't take any cut of your economy your economy stays your economy until you want to communicate with other para trains and then we can talk about you know what though there might be fees associates because then the polka dot guys are actually doing some job for you they're relaying your messages but as long as you sort of stay within your you're yourself then you you don't pay any extra there's no extra tax so the main distinctions between smart contracts and para chains are really this notion that you can control your internal economy that much better you you don't have to sort of leak funds out to their to the sort of system for their for the purpose of securing your your logic that happens anyway that you can sort of get that for free now the distinction of course is the sort of flip side of the coin is you have to pay for one of these pair of chain slots upfront you pay through it through depositing dots you get them back at the end of it but in some senses opportunity cost rate you can't sell them and take the money in a high interest account you have to actually stick them in the system and lock them there until your parrot chains done so it's really offering a very different economic proposal and that means that some systems some daps we'll be more than happy to stick with the smart contract system those DAPs are the ones where you know that it's just a guy they want to push out some interesting logic and they want users to basically pay for themselves they just want a fire-and-forget there's some logic we're done well what we're out of here you use it as you want where is the that's that really want to optimize everything they want to build a real sort of solution and they want to entertain you interacting with eight users and generate a sort of internal economy for them para chains are a more interesting proposal because they will be happy to put forward the initial capital on the basis that they will be able to have full control over their the economics with their users I think that notion off economy also think indicates like it's not going to be just as simple that that does this like that just needs some simple logic on chain but rather like more like the domain-specific all the bankers or like so it's not adapter directly won't see at least until we have like hierarchical chains and baccarat we won't see like one app one chain one power chain but rather a protocol that develops for example that's interesting so there will be like pair of chains and then there will be smart contracts within each of those yeah so that's right there'll be some pair of change that the you know will be domain-specific but the domain will be hosting smart contracts there'll be other pair of chains perhaps ones that just host assets so there's just an assets power chain and you can put any assets that you want on there and sort of shift them around and stuff but they don't deal with any additional logic if you want additional logic you move the asset somewhere else you know if you think of the current crypto economy I guess like that could be a Z cash like chain a Bitcoin like China that's my contract like chain so that's sort of what we're going to see initially rather than an app specification until the apps become really big and it then makes sense for them to like try to have their own parrot own slot because then the overhead becomes too big okay yeah well this was my next question like what the vision of many future vision of any pair of jeans looks like is it just what you described or is there anything else to it I mean that's the next couple years until the system becomes more hierarchical like I mean the ideas in the future there will be like a relay to in everyday terms like scaling it out and and then it becomes much I mean also as more libraries develop like it as it becomes easier to also be a parrot and it's probably gonna look more granular more more sort of depth specific but in the near term it's more domain-specific what we're going to see alright and you mentioned substrate which you guys have built and it's sort of like developer developer tools which make it easier for people to build things on polka-dot as far as I understand so what are some of the different customizable features that people can implement using a substrate so you could use it just as a tool for building your own completely new blocks and completely independent of poccadot your own consensus whatever that might be or you use it okay I'm sorry so I thought it was just for forget about this for anymore for anything so that's that's also why we we're doing this event not like to make people more aware that this isn't like substrate and worker there are two different things in that sense I mean most people who will develop a parrot in would probably use substrate but they're even that they're not obliged to do that it could also be my parrot train without using substrate but it is a helpful tool in both directions so we're actually building polka dot with substrate so not only will substrate be used for creating para chains on polka dot but the relay chain itself is a substrate chain and so this allows us to kind of let the snake ease its tail and we circle back and make the relay chain be itself a para chain and we could sort of make it whole hierarchical and recursive him yeah I heard you say I don't remember where this was that it's sort of like you just like food waste and as you were building it you wanted to like make sure you know the code you know that the work kind of like accomplished more which I totally understand that was like I'm so with go so one other thing that's really cool about it is that I guess it enables people to then upgrade their networks without hard Forks so what are some examples of things you can change using substrate without a hard fork that like you now you wouldn't need a hard fork show accomplished well so what this is interesting basically you can do anything the only thing that you can't touch is the sort of core underlying consensus mechanism so if we you most of the most change I expect will use this kind of hybrid babe and Grandpa that I mentioned earlier but you can change things like the staking algorithm so you can say right well we want to change it from proof authority to proof of steak no problem suppose you want to you you initially have a Bitcoin chain so you have like this what we call unspent transaction output you TXO chain this is a very basic kind of currency chain initially use case of blockchain suppose you want to add smart contracts to it just upgrade can do that suppose you want to add governance to it sure upgrade can do that suppose you want to suppose you want to take a smart contract chain and you want to add operations that allow you to do zero knowledge proof on your smart contracts sure can do that suppose you want to take a blotter polka-dot real a chain and suppose we M the zero knowledge guys the the Starks or the snarks guys make it so that we can interpret parrot we can guarantee that power chain to be a being correctly operated not through actually executing them which is what we do now so we have all the validators execute some of the power chains but rather by providing a short proof that they were executed correctly and this is what the some of the latest research on the ZK stark stuff is is looking sort of towards and you know is what a theorem 2 is also so trying to sort of research a bit as well so suppose we can do that sure we can upgrade that no hard-fought required so basically we can do anything we can change the entire nature of blockchain and we can do so just with a single transaction so something else that I want to bring up just because this is out there is that the community seems to perceive that polkadot and etherium 2.0 will be competitive and even your employee offer you shodhan did write a tweet that framed it in that way that they are competitive so do you agree with that no a free a phrase an outspoken guy he likes to he says what's on his mind the occasional argument they must be said so no I mean a free a free speaks for himself and we we have a general sort of rule at parity that you know don't say anything stupid but you know we're also not going to require that you toe the company line urine people you know we trust you're going to be sensible but no it's not a it's not a sentiment we agree with at all I mean I was chatting to metalic last week in Singapore and it you know it was pretty clear that what we agree on most things regarding poke around theorem to the different systems really designed and geared for different things with different development timelines and different ways of solving problems so it's that they are very much different things now of course there's some in some sense every project that has a token in the space is competing with you right there's a leaderboard of times right now there's a market cap so do you want yours to go near the top so of course there is a very sort of base level amount of competitions but we see more as competition at least with the projects that aren't that don't try and keep everything to themselves we see that competition as being healthy and as being as having only partly competition on partly cooperation and as as we sort of mentioned in the Singapore chat it's we're working on quite similar things there are knowledge proofs being one of them some of the crypto being another and it's you know because we're both projects that that develop in an entirely open fashion it's perfectly reasonable that as much as we're in competition we're in cooperation because we're going to you know use each other's ideas in pushing for the technology in general yeah I mean looking at it just on a technical perspective they don't seem obviously competitive however it does look like because polka-dot operates kind of like at a lower level that it could make a cerium sort of less important which is maybe you know I think that's where some of the fear comes from and I guess we've seen like similar thinking going on when you see them came along people were like oh this is not that more general like will this make Bitcoin obsolete but if we like ya know Bitcoin is still free but one other thing that I want to ask though is what is dot theorem and who's behind it are you guys related to that you know in theory on Twitter that it was all free but you know you don't know no well I'm not told of anything together it's I'm you know I'm kind of interested to see what what what it is myself right but yeah if you if you find out let me know please okay yeah haven't really looked into it but I thought you guys would know because you know dots and whatever anyway let's talk about the frozen funds there is potentially a way to access them in the future what is your best argument for why that should happen I think the the biggest contention in dinner around this is to my mind like around how much sure do people actually perceive the technology is and like some people think like we've come to a state where we shouldn't change anything anymore because people are relying on like how it's working and and or people on the other side saying look and I think we're more on that side like look it's still immature technology like they going to be bugs we need we need methods and tools how to fix them and if we don't like that's not a good argument for people to come along and use use the technology so that's why I'm still confident alike hopeful that we will find some way especially like with the recent hot dog that be included to create too so you could think of it as if something like this had had existed back then then the likelihood of the bug slipping into the code would have been much lower or like there would have been a way of recreating it and whatnot so I think like people are starting to appreciate that the way how the virtual machine works and the technology worked at the time didn't provide us with the tools for creating smart contracts in a safe way and so as we develop these and include them like we should also fix the bugs that wouldn't have existed if we had had the tools at the time yeah I think one of the arguments that I saw against reinstating the funds is that that could lead to a chain split which you know obviously that has happened before there in classic and etherion which actually didn't have a huge effect on aetherium but they were saying that well now if that were to happen then there would be doubles of all the ERC 20 tokens and the crypto kitties and all the games and apps would have like two worlds and and obviously look for something like die where you know that's kind of a now a big chunk of of the etherium ecosystem that that could be to stabilizing there and you know that's supposed to be pegged to the dollar in any way so is there any way to recover the funds without putting all that at risk I mean I wouldn't think of it as putting every I mean again like it's it's about like how much do you care about like what's going to be on the platform and like how people could use it in the future like with finding a solution that doesn't that sound sensible for people so yeah and I think like I mean the discussions we're seeing that there is there is consensus that in principle people feel like the the ownership of tokens should be respected and that's a principle that that should be leading leading the debate yeah I mean as you mentioned a theory implies sort of when its own way and you know it wasn't the etherium was empty at the time there were plenty of smart contracts plenty of ongoing project yeah it was fine yeah people chose one or the other and the projects that you know if they chose aetherium then the projects deployments on ethereum classic just sort of decayed and crumbled and everyone forgot about them so I don't really see that as a particularly salient argument against doing anything I think if there were chain splits can happen for all sorts of reasons and ultimately if the right decision is to is to propose you know some fork in one direction or another that I wouldn't that that in and of itself wouldn't stop I don't think it should stop anyone but I think with so this notion of chain immutability right is is a bit of em I think it's a bit of a fallacy I think chain immutability more or less goes out of the window this as soon as you accept that chains can parade them that the chains should be able to be upgraded and in some sense by placing this difficulty bomb right by basically saying that the chain needs to be upgraded or it will just stop we've already acknowledged that the block chain must be mutable right there must be hard Forks because otherwise it has a life here has a life expectancy of like six months here whatever it is now so something has to change we've already baked that into the protocol the protocol must upgrade the protocol must change the protocol must be mutable so they're real the only real question is well does by mutating it do we change people's expectations more or less so is the expectation that the chain that the n of these funds should be spendable or they should not be spendable who expected them to be spendable and who expected them not to be spendables what were those you know when this contract went down what are the expectations that aetherium would do to it now you can argue this one of two you can take the toad the sort of absolutist things well I expect aetherium to exactly interpret the code and if the code has bugs then it should interpret those books correctly or you can take the I think the much more pragmatist reasonable sort of point of view which is that well the contract was clearly meant to be a Bala and it was clearly meant to have the funds and it be spendable by these set of people that are named in the wallet therefore the expectations should the etherium should you know in principle an immutable aetherium should uphold our that the wallet should should be spending all the funds should be spent in it so I think I think you can't really I think an absolutist point of view falls flat as soon as you say well chain the chain must be upgraded and at that point you just have to go to what are the expectations and I think reasonable people coming to the system would expect that in this wallet the funds should be spent on and I mean it's like all the debates that came also afterwards I mean so yeah what you're saying is basically one one one campus oh you should only do technical upgrades basically and but what's the technical upgrade really like no there are no like every every upgrade or every change that you do has like some some aspect of oh there's you you you give some reference to someone and maybe some reference to somebody else and you you need to always make like it's never just the technical technical decision that you make and and finding a way of integrating those decisions is I think key otherwise everything will still yeah it's political in some sense yeah and actually to go back to get was point that's just reminds me like right after the Dow nobody could well or the doubt incident I'll just call it nobody could figure out whether or not to actually call it a hack because the code allowed them to do you know it was just like this funny thing where people started to use that word and then uh people were like well technically you know cuz it wasn't like they broken anything and they just like did what the concert allow them to do alright well we've gone way over time but this has been a fabulous conversation where can people learn more about you parody polka dot and
