week in a row that I've had some not from coin desk last week's bridge going on going on yes and I should also disclose that coin desk has been a sponsor of my podcasts so all anyone's been able to talk about this week is the coronavirus and it's had a somewhat surprising effect on the traditional financial markets which he wrote about why don't you describe what happened there before we even talked crypto what we're seeing is a fascinating shift in narratives not just in Bitcoin but actually in absolutely every single asset out there what's particularly interesting with what's happening in Bitcoin is that it is now obviously not the safe haven that we all thought it we all hoped it would be I don't see mana thought it would be but though that we all hoped it would be this definitely closes the door on that narrative which is something that we're all going to have to die yes you know the saying when in a crisis or correlations go to one well that is what we're seeing now and what we're seeing that because of some fundamental shifts in bitcoins I guess use-case and also the nature of the participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem I mean we can this we can rewind a bit and talk about why Bitcoin had that safe-haven narrative to start with largely largely because it makes sense I mean bitcoin is a totally different type of technology it has totally different economic premises hard kept on supply no-wake a manipulated decentralized assets etc etc so therefore there's no way it can be correlated and that makes it a safe haven all safe havens are uncorrelated you want to hold something that is going to hold its value while everything else isn't but as we've seen Bitcoin doesn't necessarily behave that way we all wanted it to there also we wanted Bitcoin to be the alternative the thing that was totally outside the system and did not react like everything else did so we started erm spreading the word people started paying attention to Bitcoin the market infrastructure started developing institutional investors started putting it in their portfolios has addy coral i as a uncorrelated asset which the numbers the numbers do show some form some lack of correlation that backs it up then the traders started coming in traders are there for volatility they don't really care about the premise very much I mean shorts I'm sure many of them do but mainly they're there to make money on the volatility they love the volatility that has changed the very nature of bitcoins behavior volatility is one thing that detracts from the safe-haven narrative you can't really have a safe haven that is volatile another thing that detracts from the safe-haven narrative is the risk of regulation we know that Bitcoin will continue whatever happens and we know that there's no way to stop it but if a major economic center decided to clamp down decided to ban it even while Bitcoin would continue it would certainly have a different economic outlook it would not have perhaps the value profile that it has today so traders are betting on that they're betting on the volatility that hinges on all of these factors going on and they therefore will trade Bitcoin along with all of the other assets that respond to volatility and especially when things get really crazy like they have this week Bitcoin is going to react like all the other asset classes and as we've seen today I mean it's a massive fall today they're heading south well one thing that interested me about what you said is you said the regulatory risk and I actually feel like in recent weeks there's been kind of more hope on that horizon with obviously the Indian Supreme Court overturning the ban on Bitcoin there and then now we see that South Korea is kind of bringing that into its regulatory regime so what are the risks still when it comes to regulation with Bitcoin I should caveat that was saying I don't think there is a huge revelatory risk I personally don't think that there is it doesn't make any sense because most of the economic centers are smart enough to realize that it's a fairly futile endeavor however weird things can happen and there is an outside risk that a big ban could come down say the United States decides to do something crazy like that it's not totally out of the question very very unlikely I would like to say I personally believe that the regulatory risk is diminishing I personally believe that we are going to see greater adoption going forward in various economic centers of the world and I personally believe that the regulatory moves that we're seeing is very important government very important economic centers are going to help consolidate bitcoins eventual use or eventual status as a safe haven with just a long way from that yet right now the market moves are dominated by traders who are in it for profit that's what traders do and we wanted that we actually wanted that liquidity for Bitcoin the greater the liquidity the greater the likelihood that the institutional investors remember that big wall of institutional money we used to talk about the greater the likelihood that institutional investors will come in so in a way we built this house that is now crumbling down around us the market structure has evolved to favor traders I mean high-frequency trading is a big thing now leverage is a very important feature of the market but that does exacerbate the swings I don't know if you've seen as the liquidations on bid next this morning that is going to make Bitcoin even more volatile which makes it even less of a safe haven in the short term makes it even more attractive to traders which can become a self-perpetuating loop except for the major shifts in regulation that you pointed out that we are seeing and what could potentially end up being very significant economic centers for Bitcoin development and so you know you've talked about how you feel like this is kind of the situation now but that over the long term things could change so what does that picture look like for a Bitcoin and how does that change happen I believe it looks like greater regulatory acceptance in most most of the economies that we are familiar with Bitcoin is part of the landscape not part of most institutional portfolios yet that may well change also with time once things start to settle down I believe that regulatory clarity which we are increasingly getting over here in Europe and in Asia that's also improving that will encourage what we call investment as opposed to trading longer-term investment and especially given the economic turmoil out there I think it's pretty safe to say that it looks like we're going to recession it will become more apparent to investors and to regulators that Bitcoin does not depend on economic metrics it is not correlated to the world's economy at large that is going to increase the safe haven stories go to support the safe haven story for sure it's going to broaden the type of participant that is in the market and hopefully that way make us less vulnerable to the whims of the trading community and at the same time that will encourage development for a whole host of use cases we probably can't even imagine yet and just for the short term you know as we're watching the impact of the coronavirus play out like what are some of the different scenarios you see that having on Bitcoin for the next I guess year or two to be honest I don't think that a lot of attention will be on Bitcoin because of the coronavirus I think that with the coronavirus scare which is getting pretty alarming I mean you're in New York I'm over here in Europe and we were just chatting before we had on the air about what's going on in our to stay in a relatively in their respective neighborhoods is it is quite something I think everyone's just going to be focusing on hunkering down and getting through the next few weeks and seeing what happens with our loved ones and our our professional environments as well but going forward economic recession uncorrelated asset a much more obvious connection there and we need to bear in mind that there's a very fundamental event coming up in the Bitcoin community in just a few weeks which is the having now what does the whole thing have to do with coronavirus absolutely nothing but what the having will do especially because of the media attention that will be thrown on this as always happens around these having's is highlight how different this is it will highlight the innovation behind this technology and every having does bring mainstream attention mainstream interest at a time that things are really weird anyway at a time when people are probably thinking oh okay things are different maybe I should open my scope of it me open my mind and look at other alternatives when it comes to investment assets when it comes to payment mechanisms when it comes to economic systems again all right we're gonna dive a little bit more into the impact of the Bitcoin having on a Bitcoin amidst the coronavirus in a second but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible are you interested in getting into the

cool perks loaded in one card download the crypto comm app now back to my conversation with Noel Atchison so in terms of the halving though because we've seen that the coronavirus has had such a negative impact on the price of Bitcoin what does that mean for the survival of miners at that time it is worrying what's going on with miners at the moment and we have been looking at figures recently that show that they have been investing heavily in equipment they've been also selling down their inventories and in the light of the recent slump to be able to continue to cover cost so yes it is worrying however if there is a big shakeout in the minor community that will affect the hash rate the economics will then bring other miners in as mining becomes profitable again because of the lower costs involved and it will self-correct of course all of this is supposition this is how Bitcoin was designed to work it probably hasn't had the kind of test that it's having today but it has had many tests before I mean the fall that we've seen so far today is not the worst fall that Bitcoin has had I think it's something like the sixth or seventh worst the others were obviously in twice they're worse since 2013 but there have been much deeper crises to the network and Bitcoin has survived I personally am convinced that it will survive this the minor economics are something we should keep an eye on but most miners these days anyway are professionals they're businesses and they're in it for the long term back in bitcoins early days there was probably more volatility with you know hobby miners I guess we can call them that hobby miners switching their machines on and off and also the machines didn't require the same level of investment that they do today so it was a much more fluid ecosystem today there are professional businesses and many of them have been hedging in the derivatives markets which didn't exist the last time Bitcoin went through this kind of crisis so there is some protection there I'm not saying that all of them have many of them probably haven't but some have this is a professional sector now rather than the hobbyists that we used to have back in the last time we had this sort of turmoil that is true that is true which which is good but I do feel like this was not a scenario that many of them may have accounted for I think before going to record I saw the price was kind of in this $6,000 range which obviously is quite a bit lower than I think a lot of people were expecting yeah so one other thing that I wanted to ask you about was you had written about some other factors and how that would affect Bitcoin like you talked about the impact of the coronavirus on supply chains and political uncertainty and inflation and felt that in the long run that the the things like this could result in a different impact on Bitcoin so what do you see happening with that I I look at Bitcoin in the macro context often partly because it's a very fascinating excite resizer do it but also partly because it's what traditional investors are going to be doing how does Bitcoin fit into the macro context this of course was before things really got crazy when it made sense to do that right now there's no such thing as context early is there yet the role that of Bitcoin in the macro context is going to change as the macro context changes we are going to come in for a type of nice fully expect currency wars to emerge not just as a result of detentions from the coronavirus but also the oil shock which is happening in the side that's a major impact which we haven't really seen the full results of yet currency wars are going to shed light on the manipulations of central banks they're also going to introduce perhaps some inflation which was probably going to be coming in anyhow because of the retreat the unwinding of globalization due to the constriction of supply chains triggered by the coronavirus although it's worth pointing out that the globalization the unwinding stir even before the coronavirus became a massive scare through tariffs and populism and borders being higher higher walls being erected borders I should say so that was a trend that was happening anyway the corona virus has made that you know hundred times worse and that is going to impact on inflation more broadly that is going to impact on monetary policy more broadly and that is going to focus attention on bitcoins lack of monetary policy if you will it's a totally new paradigm that the world did not have last time it went through deep financial convulsions back in 2008 which was the last time we remember there being this kind of a crisis Bitcoin wasn't around yet this kind of crisis is also very different that the crisis back in 2008 was a debt triggered crisis interest rates could make an impact on a debt triggered crisis interest rates can't make an impact on a supply triggered crisis which is what we're dealing with now and also in a debt triggered crisis currencies themselves don't have the protagonist role that they're going to have in this supply driven crisis that we're heading into and when currencies are the center of attention it coin is a currency okay it's not recognized by many economic centers as a currency officially I think that will change one thing is also in a report you did last year you looked at how closely it's correlated with gold and I wondered if you could you know also you know talk about historically whether or not it's been correlated with gold but then also how its performing or yeah what its performance looks like against gold now with a coronavirus impact on the markets correlation everything's correlated at the moment because everything's coming gold has held up pretty well but gold itself is not the safe haven it used to be gold has become as Bitcoin has that we discussing earlier gold has become financialized gold does not have the same monetary policy gold is a real asset like Bitcoin but gold is also susceptible to margin calls and the big swings that we've seen in gold are largely due to that they're due to traders liquidating positions because they probably have margin coal's elsewhere when you're heading for the exit you don't really care what you throw out the window I'm sure I'm mixing metaphors there but I think you know what I'm trying to say there I also and this is a confession I'll make to you I'm skeptical of correlation figures generally any correlations can be calculated in many different ways and depending on how you frame the figures you can get one result or another there's a statisticians have a wonderful thing I love which is if you torture numbers long enough they'll tell you anything that you want them to and the same a correlation we can agree that Bitcoin traditionally has not been correlated with real assets but we can isolate times when they have been same with gold we can agree that bitcoin is more correlated to gold than it is to the sp500 perhaps but we can show you timeframes in which that relationship doesn't hold so correlations are a broad stroke to get more interested in an asset class or not but when it comes to actually banking decisions on them using that figure to allocate assets in your portfolio it's probably worth looking at the bigger picture and not just relying on those numbers is that coin correlated to gold it entirely depends what kind of an answer you're looking for and speaking of correlations though also I wondered whether or not Bitcoin is starting to decouple from the other crypto assets and act like a digital gold yes I actually was looking at that just the other day I was wondering how is Bitcoin doing compared to the others today everything is just very correlated weak and everything is heading south but it is it has been unreal ative Lee uncorrelated relative outperformance but I think that's a blip I don't and again you move the time frames on your correlations and you get very different answers we saw a time last year you probably remember this I'm sure you did a podcast on it where bitcoins what's the word dominance yes the coins dominance was increasing to worrying levels in fact there was a worry that Bitcoin would crowd out everything else in the sector that sort of self corrected as of as the turmoil in the out coins I'll call them that started to quieten down in some interesting use cases an interesting opportunity started to emerge and ether has outperformed Bitcoin easily so far this year I haven't looked at the relative performance after today of course ether today suffered its largest fall in percentage terms ever so maybe that's changed now but ether helped up until a few days ago was significantly outperforming Bitcoin which does hint at a realignment of the crypto asset class as a whole significant not really because we are still talking just a few percentage points difference but trends that are worth keeping an eye on all right well how are you faring amidst the corona virus outbreak in Europe it's very interesting strange strange I live in Madrid and they've closed schools which my daughter is not unhappy about and supermarket shelves looking a little bit more better than usual but we shall see how it goes we just need to we will all get through this this is one thing that we know and I will throw in a plug for European healthcare systems we have a good health care system here in Spain obviously there's a huge risk it will get totally overwhelmed it's probable it will get totally overwhelmed as will all healthcare systems everywhere but we will get through this yeah yeah I I hope so I I how are things we were what I would say is that I I think that we as citizens can do something to keep the healthcare systems from being overwhelmed but it requires a little bit of sacrifice from all of us which is to stay in if you're healthy so yeah I'm doing fine I was already staying in all the time because I'm trying to finish my book so like for me this isn't a big change when's your book do you out um oh it like more than a little more than a year from now cuz a lot of done a lot of work anyway well it's been great having you on the show thank you so much for joining us on unconfirmed it's been fun Laura thank you don't forget next up is the news recap stick around for this weekend crypto after this short break crypto at law is run by crypto oh geez in New York who understand crypto in FinTech they were already operating in the space back in 2013 in the Excel crypto is payment one of the partners a Creek Hellman is known for drafting and Bill's submitted to the US Congress in 2014 aimed at exempting on chained Bitcoin transactions from US regulations the other founding partner his brother Daniel Killman became well known in the crypto law space for his work in the mail [ __ ] civil rehabilitation so if you operate a FinTech business or have a dispute with some person or business involving crypto or you just need legal advice related to crypto info at calment law that's ke l ma n dot law or just go to their website at wwlp.com in hi everyone I'm going to do something a bit unusual today and instead of discussing crypto news I'm going to talk about coronavirus and what you can do humanity faces the gravest eminent danger I've seen in my lifetime from coronavirus climate change being the gravest slow-moving danger as much as you and I are obsessed with and love crypto I'm sure to all of us our families and friends are even more important well it's obviously off my bead and off the topic of the show to cover this the threat is so large that I realized I would regret not using this platform however small to try to help out and bend the trajectory of the virus here in the US given our pretty abysmal a bad start in our fight against it just to establish my credentials some of you may not know this but I did get my masters in science journalism and I have covered science before as a journalist hopefully these tips will be helpful to you and your loved ones this episode will be slightly more us focused but since I believe many of my listeners are either in the US or in countries undergoing a similar situation with the corona virus I believe the information here and these tips will be broadly applicable the first thing is there's no need to panic panic is the absolute worst thing you can do in a situation like this what you want to do instead is take care of yourself first sort of like putting the mace the mask over your face first during what will likely be a stressful time may sure to do one relaxing thing a day whether that's exercise or meditation or a nap or a bath just whatever will help keep you in a level-headed state then calmly rationally seek out knowledge from reliable sources I will be referencing some articles and links for people to read and follow you can check the show notes for those links armed with this knowledge you can make smart decisions help others to do so as well and collectively we can all do our part to help the virus have as minimal impact as possible second it's really important to take care of your own body and health during this time this boosts your immune system making you less susceptible to any health issue which helps reduce what is likely to be a big burden on the healthcare system in the coming months it also gives you a clearer head with which to make better decisions when you're faced with tough choices and additionally it keeps you available to help our neighbors parents grandparents aunts and uncles and immunocompromised friends and family and anyone else who might need our help our doctors nurses and health care practitioners are going to have their hands full if we keep our bodies in good shape we can assist others in this interconnected world in which we live okay now we're gonna get into the Nitty Gritty at the moment unless something major changes the u.s. is going to have to fight this battle pretty much blindly from a data standpoint we are so far behind where we need to be with testing that I believe we no longer have time to catch up a few weeks ago I did have hope that if we could ramp up quickly we could still pursue a strategy of containment but I believe that window has closed also it appears the chemicals used in the tests are in short supply so between the lack of test kits the type supply and chemical reagents and even the lack of capacity and labs to do testing on the skill needed I don't think aggressive testing is a viable solution anymore from the example of the Koreans however I would say we hopefully now know that that would be the best strategy for a few viruses I would love it if by some miracle this situation with the US testing changes but even if it does like I said I don't think we have the time to do all the tests and contain this the virus is already brewing in a big way and we're going to see the effects of the current spreads sometime soon as there's a lag between infection and illness but not all hope is lost we still have another data point that can help us which is what I believe is the number one most important metric to focus on the guideline to use when making all our choices from now on as far as I can tell what determines whether or not a society suffers tremendously from the corona virus or minimally is how burdened our healthcare systems become I got into a little spat with somebody hunt Facebook the other day because she was quibbling about the air quotes true case fatality rate okay people there is no true case fatality rate that exists in some ideal bubble the case fatality fatality rate varies from city to city state to state country to country and what determines that number is whether or not the health care system gets overwhelmed this is why you keep seeing those graphs about flattening the curve trying to keep it like we're all playing some collective game of limbo below that ghostly dotted line what is that line the capacity of your local healthcare system and here's the deal because case fatality rate is determined by whether or not we cross that line you you all of us we collectively are the ones who determine the case fatality rate literally every choice we make pushes that number up or down we can take control of this virus by our collective actions and decisions now back to the dotted line the unfortunate thing is that in the u.s. our dotted line or dotted lines as this really goes state-by-state is lower than in other places for not everyone in our population is insured so we will already have many more people getting sick from the corona virus but not getting tested in over spreading it to others second even the insured may have financial reasons not to get tested with the same result that they'll get sick and pass it on to others just before recording this house representative Katie Porter did secure a promise from the director of the CDC dr. Robert Redfield that he will authorize free coronavirus testing for all Americans I hope he follows through but as I mentioned I'm not sure how much that will help us now so here's the other thing about that dotted line our doctors and nurses and other health care practitioners lack protective gear or enough protective gear unfortunately a Washington Post article from Tuesday said that the national stockpile had not been replenished of face masks had not been replenished since 2009 quote the Department of Health and Human Services said last week that the stockpile has about 12 million n95 respirators and 30 million surgical masks a scant 1% of the estimated 3.5 billion masks the nation would need in a severe pandemic another five million n95 masks in the stockpile are expired this means that we may see a larger percentage of our health care workers fall ill and have to be quarantined so the number of doctors nurses etc that we have to take care of those who do fall ill will likely not stay at current head counts this is also why I do urge people not to hoard face masks and face masks leave them for our health care workers there is a shortage in supply due to manufacturing and supply chain issues being interrupted in China obviously if you become sick with coronavirus you absolutely should wear a masks but until then you have other means to protest you protect yourself whereas our health care workers do not and they are one of our most important lines of defense against the virus if you or any of your loved ones does catch the virus or has any other health issue in the coming months wouldn't you rather deal with a doctor or new nurse who had as many masks as they needed at their disposal the other thing to understand about how crucial this healthcare system capacity line is and how quickly coronavirus can overtake it is that the health care system in Lombardi where the Italian coronavirus outbreak began has a rating from the OECD of nine point nine out of ten nine point nine out of ten that's like the Simone biles of health care systems I will put a link to this in the show notes but I checked around for how various US states stack up and nowhere in the US comes even close to a nine point nine amongst the states I tested newer checked New York is at a six point eight California seven point one Illinois 5.0 Texas four point eight Washington State where they've seen the earliest outbreak is six point one in Washington DC to point O Mississippi zero point six our health system capacity in the u.s. is much much lower than Lombard ease for all the reasons I laid out above we have much less margin for error which leads me to my next point despite all the ways in which were off to a bad start in this battle this is still something we can do to fight back and make sure the corona virus has a minimal impact on our society in any way you can in every way you can start social distancing and because we have basically run out of time start now start today this power lies in your hands anytime you have a choice about whether or not to go out stay home we individually have the power to bend that curve downward to a level that will not overwhelm our hospitals and frontline health care workers the sad fact of the matter is that here in the u.s. our leaders have failed us miserably but now is not the time to focus on that we citizens are smarter and more capable than they are and we by our actions can take control and fight back this virus and the answer to that is simple stay in do not spread this to others because you can spread it a symptomatically before you even get sick even if you never get sick you can spread it to many other people and if you are in a position of leadership where you can make that decision for others absolutely do so and as soon as you can one note the cost of staying home will be different for some than others for this reason the government should compensate those who take a financial hit for the collective good if I have any government officials listening to my show I hope you can see that that cost would be dwarfed by the financial cost of letting the virus ravage as many lives as it would without your intervention by paying a small price now you stave off a much bigger and worse price in the future the corona virus is here so no matter what we will pay a price the only question is whether the price will be in human lives or in financial aid so to sum up don't despair take care of yourself number one stay informed and do your best to help out the people on the frontlines the doctors nurses and other health care workers who will take care of our friends family and ourselves if we fall sick or need to go to the hospital for any reason whether it's the corona virus or something else during this time this is the most important thing we can do right now to keep the corona virus from being as big a tragedy as it has been in wuhan or Italy we can do our best now to bend the curve to be more like Korea or Taiwan though our leaders have failed us we have power in our hands make the right choice anytime you have the ability stay in if we beat this back we can all go celebrate afterward I'm gonna leave you with a final few words which are some selections from a really really great must read essay in Newsweek by a doctor that they say is in Western Europe they say that she asked to remain anonymous because she has not been authorised to speak to the press but this is just a really well done essay I urge you to read the whole thing I'm just gonna read some parts she starts by saying that in Italy they kept schools open in the beginning they kept going to the office they kept traveling then she says quote fast forward two months and we are drowning here's how it looks in practice most of my childhood friends are now doctors working in North Italy in Milan and Bergamo in Padua they are having to choose between intubating of 40 year old with two kids a 40 year old who is fit and healthy with no co-morbidities and a 6 year old with high blood pressure because they don't have enough beds in the hallway meanwhile there are another 15 people waiting who are already hardly breathing and need oxygen the Army is trying to bring some of them to other regions with helicopters but it's not enough the flow is just too much too many people are getting sick at the same time 40 40 think about that then she says until we're past the pink the only solution is to impose social restrictions and if your government is hesitating these restrictions are up to you stay put do not travel cancel that family reunion the promotion party and the big night out this really sucks but these are special times don't take risks do not go to places where you are more than 20 people in the same room it's not safe and it's not worth it I urge you to read the entire essay I've linked you in the show notes stay healthy everyone stay in side in your home stay safe let's all work together for our collective good it's a little weird to read the show credits right now I will do that to learn more about Noel Addison and coined us be sure to
