this coordinated effort to really undermine crypto markets or bring crypto markets within the regulatory perimeter by selectively targeting some stable coins um and and of course there's going to be legal challenges here because the arguments we don't know what arguments they're making um but there's very good arguments potentially that these products are more like uh money transmitter issued products like a stored value instrument or a gift card and these are things that uh money transmitters that are licensed at the state level and have a registration with thinset or even a trust company that doesn't need the registration with thinset are able to offer so these are you know look you can load dollars into your PayPal or venmo account and send those dollars to someone else and that's all regulated as money transmission as opposed to the offering or issuance of Securities and so the the lines are starting to really blur here when we get into the world of stable coins because they really do look like uh gift cards on a blockchain that are transferable open loop gift
