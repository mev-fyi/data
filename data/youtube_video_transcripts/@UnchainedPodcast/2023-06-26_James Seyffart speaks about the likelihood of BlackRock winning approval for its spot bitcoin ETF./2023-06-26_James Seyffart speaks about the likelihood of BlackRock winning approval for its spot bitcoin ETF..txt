Gary's might be facing the loss at uh grayscale and he's focused on all these lawsuits they're all on all coins or things that he's claiming to be Securities for the most part the one thing he said which you've covered extensively is Bitcoin is not a security he'll even though he said in the past that ethereum is not a security the SEC has said it in the past he won't say it now the one thing he's admitted unwaveringly is yes we we don't think Bitcoin is a security so if he's going to give ground anywhere it might be on bitcoin right and coinbase they're not accusing them of fraud or these other things they're accusing them of operating at unregistered Securities Exchange because they're claiming these tokens to be Securities which is regulation via forcement and you've covered that a bunch but all these areas mean like if he's going to give anywhere it might be on a Bitcoin ETF and also if he can then find a way to approve these things before being handed a negative decision from the courts maybe this is the way to do it because he can say look we there is a way to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF
