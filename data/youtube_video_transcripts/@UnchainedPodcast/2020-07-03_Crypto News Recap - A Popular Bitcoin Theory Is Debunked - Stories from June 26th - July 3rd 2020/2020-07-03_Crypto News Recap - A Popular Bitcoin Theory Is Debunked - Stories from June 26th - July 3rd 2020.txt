[Music] hi everyone thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap first headline PayPal and venmo to launch crypto buying and selling you guys so this was actually story from last week and do you do a coffee pace error yes I know that's kind of crazy in my recap last week I neglected to include include this story which was the biggest news story last week which is as the headline says that PayPal and venule will be launching crypto buying and selling although it's not clear which tokens will be available the service could roll out in as soon as within the next three months all right so now on to the headlines for this week defy hacks continue with half a million dollars hacked from balancer the hacks and defy continued this week with another multi-protocol attack draining about $500,000 worth of tokens from automated market-maker pools on balancer the attackers took out a flash loan of wrapped eath on dy/dx and swapped it for a silk logged inflationary coin called cetera ticker sta which meant that there would be a 1% transfer fee charged from the recipient per transaction however the balance rule did not recognize that with each transaction it was receiving 1% less of sta and the hacker made this transaction 24 times to drain s T from the pool and then use the last single one-way sta to get the pool to release more wrapped eath and drain that fool the hacker repeated this with W et Cie s NX and linked the wrapped Bitcoin synthetic token and link for chain link tokens and then because balancer is actually giving out liquidity mining rewards right now these hacker also obtained more balance or pool tokens and then used to get even more rap teeth if you followed all that then good for you so this actually was similar to the lend FM attack in that this stems from a certain type of technology being used in a system that could not account for that technology and also what was similar is that this potential problem was actually flagged beforehand or known beforehand someone had previously flagged this as a potential issue to the balancer team in the unbalance er decided to fully reimburse all aquinnah t providers who lost funds during the attack next headline dex is searching hit a new all-time high monthly trade volume on Dex's reached 1.5 1 billion dollars in June up 70% compared to May's volume which was just shy of $900 900 million dollars it's also up 46 percent compared to the previous all-time high of 1 billion dollars in March unis whopping curve led the pack when it came to Dex volume although total Dex volume is still just 2% of the volume on centralized exchanges the block also did a nice deep dive on Dex aggregators such as one-inch exchange total and para swath unsurprisingly prices are best on the aggregators as proposed as opposed to single Dex is especially for larger orders and this week the 0x protocol launched its own Dex aggregator called matcha which i think is a really good name alright next headline the Bitcoin stock to flow theory turns out to be nonsense well the graph certainly looked credible people may have heard of the stock to flow valuation model for Bitcoin espoused by the pseudonymous plan be a twitter account we mentioned it here on the show such as in the Bitcoin having episode and potentially also in the episode with Dan Moorhead of Pantera capital on unconfirmed in case you don't recall the stock to flow theory says that Bitcoin has an own unforgeable costliness because it takes a lot of electricity to produce new bitcoins and that means that bitcoins cannot be easily faked it then posits that since there's a large supply of gold compared to the new supply introduced to it that gives it a high stocked a flow ratio and that bitcoins stocked a flow ratio is about half that of Gold's currently but will someday be even higher and that will eventually result in the price rising so the theory seems to make sense since we all know that the new bitcoins minted with every block will asymptotically reach zero eventually however a few posts including an op-ed this week by Nico Cordero the chief investment officer and fund manager at Strix Leviathan points out a fundamental flaw in the theory there is ZERO correlation between the stock to flow for gold and it's price there's an extremely striking chart and the op-ed that shows this in the op-ed he says quote we believe the models accuracy will likely be about a successful at forecasting bitcoins future price as the astrological models of the past were at predicting financial outcomes Erik wall the CIO of arcane assets pointed out or he would have opposed chronicling all the people who determined the model was flawed alright next headline Assyrians and investors beat the drum for a IP one five five nine in his newsletter at the daily quay anthony cesano of set protocol eath hub and into the ether broke down how he thought that if aetherium improvement protocol proposal 159 were passed it would both improve the user experience on aetherium as well as help efj accrue value first ew 159 would make it less common for people to overpay miners fees while maintaining the ability to skip ahead in line by paying a tip to miners there's also a function by which the base fee is burnt so that only the tip goes to miners anthony breaks down how apps are currently parasitic on aetherium heap as he puts it quote there on chain activity does not add fundamental value to eve what now happens is that the fee basically just goes back and forth between users and miners he explains the cycle thus quote user buys 'if use your b-minor takes me minor may sell the fee eath back into the market and cycle begins again if i p1 five five nine were to be implemented however since the base fee would be burnt the rewards paid out to stagers in aetherium 2.0 will be less than what miners currently make an overall that would have a deflationary effect on a theory insist that issuance would be smaller than what is burnt on a related note blocked our capitals are appalled we did that he thinks e IP 159 is make or break for etherium he said the reason was because right now the main issue for aetherium and efi is to get big fast since the pace of the space is still so small and he said quote growth 1/8 mark a past market cap has to keep up with the growth in the market cap of tokens on aetherium or you incentivize a wide range of game theory attacks next headline 500 BTC stolen traced to zap oh and endo Dax resulting in lawsuit a German trader named Dennis Nowak sued Bitcoin wallet providers Oppo and crypto exchange in Indonesia called endo Dax after 500 BTC stolen from him which was about 4.5 million at press time were found of and moved who wallets at Zappo and endowed acts as the block puts it quote while lawsuits arising from hacks and stolen funds are common in the crypto space this one stands out due to the degree to which it relied on asset tracing firms like chain alysus and elliptic have developed proprietary systems for analyzing watching data tracking the flow of illicit funds and even identifying the individuals behind it but they tend to cater mostly to exchanges in law enforcement agencies the Nowak versus Oppo case suggests that crypto as a tracing may starts making regular appearances in civil law sets - alright time for fun bits first headline a daily transaction fees on the theorem higher then bitcoins for record 26 days steven jiang head of research at the blog tweeted a chart showing the ethereal transaction fees have only surpassed bitcoins twice and the current streak is 426 stays and counting which is a new record he says that since the start of the street the average Healy fees on aetherium have totaled 790 1571 dollars while in Bitcoin they've been at three hundred and forty-one thousand dollars four hundred and thirty similarly it turns out that the ether options market has now reached the size of the Bitcoin options market
