the long story short is once they were revealed the big reveal that like everybody was waiting to see what these cool new nfts were well they're shockingly similar to the original collection of azuki's in fact I challenge pretty much anyone to go on to openc or blur or you know your favorite nft platform and compare azuki's to azuki Elementals basically it's the same collection and so in essence what has occurred is they've I think like tripled you know the number of azukis out there yes they have a different name but they're azuki's they're basically identical you know Tom's flipping back and forth between azuki's and Elementals and you won't be able to tell the difference and there's a couple differences like there's new a couple new traits that the Elementals have that the original zukis don't have and there's like slightly more frequency of like cool you know Elemental things like fire and lightning and Earth and you know all this stuff but fundamentally there are zookies and they basically use this as a way of like you know massively increasing the size of the collection and so everybody's up in arms the price of azuki's dropped like 40 something percent pretty much instantly upon this reveal and crypto Twitter is captivated by this new mechanism called you know sell more of the original nft there are two main lessons from this first is Robert retiring from nfts was a psyop here and there I will for disclosure purposes state that I do own two Elementals one that I got for free uh and one that I purchased below the mid price uh okay very good uh the second thing is if I and I think I saw someone sort of hinting at this but azuki was maybe one of the only big of the large cap nft projects not to do a fundraise so maybe this is like they needed cash oh they were trying to do a fundraise they were trying to do a fundraise they were they were going out to Market alongside at the same time I don't remember did they close I think they did um but also I don't think they needed the money like I think you know they were making a bunch of money on royalties and even primary events last year so I I feel like it's it's like nfts they're all trying to figure out their business model and how this whole thing works and looks sustainable like do you try to turn this into a media business or like a gaming business or is this just a pure art play and you try to make money on on royalties or you sell plushies I guess if you're if you're Penguins um but I feel like the the the the trick here like the really the The Grail is like being able to do continue continuous new primary issuance like being able to sell 40 million dollars worth of jpegs is like crazy if you enjoyed this clip watch the full episode now on Unchained
