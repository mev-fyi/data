manage and grow your crypto portfolio all from a safer wallet visit brave.com unchained to get started today's guest is tom robinson co-founder and chief scientist at elliptic welcome tom hi laura thanks for having me two arrests were made this week in connection with the bitfinex hack in 2016 and the government also seized 3.6 billion dollars in stolen bitcoin linked to that hack i've seen some misinformation about what exactly happened and i think some people are making erroneous assumptions so let's just uh for the listener explain what happened this week so this week two individuals were arrested for allegedly laundering the proceeds of a hack that happened back in 2016. so in 2016 the cryptocurrency exchange bitfinex was the the victim of a hack and around 120 000 bitcoins were stolen from it at the time that was worth around 70 million dollars but of course over the intervening periods it has increased a lot in value at what point those funds were worth about 8.2 billion so as well as arresting these two individuals the authorities were able to seize quite a large proportion around 80 of those funds so arrests and a seizure of most of these stolen funds and the arrests were for money laundering not for the hack itself correct no so it's still unclear who performed the hack who actually stole the funds that isn't made clear for example in the documentation that's been released this week so no that's still unclear so oftentimes when the government tries to seize cryptocurrency they may apprehend the person who has possession of the private keys to that money but they're not always able to actually seize the money so how did the government do that in this instance so it seems as though these two individuals were storing the private keys for these wallets using a cloud storage provider and so they're able to gain access to this this storage and therefore gain access to the private keys themselves so perhaps not the best security practices um you know if you're storing billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency you should probably be using something like a cold wallet maybe a hardware wallets in order to store your funds and just talk a little bit about that like why is that a more secure way to hold funds um because you have ultimate control of the funds in those circumstances so if you're storing your private keys in cloud storage then you're entrusting them to a third party and of course that third party might for instance get hacked or they might share the contents of that cloud storage with law enforcement that has apparently occurred here so in general a a better and more secure way of holding crypto assets is to hold the private keys yourselves so only you have access to them so you might write down write it down on a piece of paper and put it in a safe deposit box or you might use one of these specialist hardware wallets that are now available on the market so in this case the file that held the private keys it was a file that listed the 2000 addresses where the original hacked bitcoin from the bitfinex hack you know where all those transactions had been sent and and also the private keys so the government decrypted this file because it was an encrypted file typically how easy is it for an outside party to decrypt an encrypted file i personally don't know if this is like an everyday capability or if this is something that was previously unknown that the government was able to do so i'm not sure exactly how it was done in this case and then to be clear we weren't at elliptic actually involved in this case everything i'm describing here is based on the investigations we've been doing over the year using blockchain analytics and through the the documentation that have been that's been shared this week but in general the the process of uh cracking a password on an encrypted file really depends on how long your password is for short passwords that's a relatively easy task for long and complex passwords it's almost computationally impossible to do so already depends how long that and how complex that password was and so going back to the original bitfinex hack which occurred in august 2016 that happened via 2000 unauthorized transactions from bitfinex to an outside wallet that was labeled 1cg a4s so even though the statement of facts did not go into detail about the hack itself just that fact alone what does that say to you about how the hack was likely conducted so i'm not sure what it tells us really i mean there really isn't much clarity on exactly how this hack took place to be honest and that's not something i've looked into into more into detail what we focused on elliptic is is looking at how the funds were being laundered where it was being moved to and potential ways to identify the people behind it so in this case the money was moved in multiple different ways so after the hack where was the money moved so that actually changed over time so this was an interesting case in that we're able to see how the money laundering techniques evolved over about five or six years so the first movements of funds were in january 2017 and some of that went to a dark net marketplace called alpha bay um so alpha bay at its at its peak was the largest dark net marketplace in existence selling everything from narcotics to hacking tools to fake ids so this was interesting why would somebody send stolen funds to a dotnet marketplace well it also can act as a mixer so what a mixer does is break the blockchain transaction trail and make it very difficult to trace it any further so that's probably what they were trying to do here by depositing it at alphabay and withdrawing it again they're able to break that that transaction trial or so they thought and so how is it that it wasn't actually broken and the government was able to follow it well so and this is this is just my theory um so in a few months after they started using alpha bay alpha bay was actually seized and taken down by law enforcement agencies um including u.s law enforcement agencies and what this would have enabled them to do is see all of the internal transaction records from alphabay and therefore potentially link those stolen incoming funds from bitfinex to the outgoing transactions and that's what we actually see happen at sea being described in the statement of fact that was released this week you see the bitcoins move into alpha bay but the investigators are somehow able to trace it through alpha bay and continue tracing the funds to accounts of the exchanges in in the name of uh some of the of the suspects arrested this week yeah the statement of facts also mentioned that there were four different crypto exchanges there were unhosted bitcoin wallets and and i should say those four crypto exchanges who actually owns those accounts is not known and then uh there were also additional accounts that were actually connected to elia lichtenstein and heather morgan who were the two individuals arrested i mean the laundering here was fairly sophisticated there were multiple steps of removal between the suspects trying to cash out and the original illicit source of funds i think what they didn't count on was alphabay being taken down by law enforcement and law enforcement having access to that data yeah so that that was how the the funds were laundered at first but that that did change over time so for example when alpha bay went down they instead sent some of the stolen bitcoins to a dark net marketplace called hydra so hydra is interesting it's a a russian language.net marketplace it's the largest dark net marketplace ever to have existed by by sun margin and it's still active today so it was probably the obvious choice um if they were going to continue using a.net market as it makes them all right so in a moment we're going to talk about more of the laundering techniques used but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible web 3 means freedom from big tech and wall street with more control and better privacy but your crypto wallet is a weak point most wallets are browser extensions a web 2 technology that means

description back to my conversation with tom so you started talking about some of the laundering techniques but there were there were actually many so i don't know if you want to discuss you know some of these like fictitious identities they were using or moving the money in small amounts etc yeah absolutely so they another of the techniques they used were to pass the funds through exchanges where the accounts of those exchanges had been created usually with fictitious identities or exchanges where you didn't have to provide any identity at all so that was another laundering technique they used towards the end so um there was a some big movements of funds from the the theft in january 2021 and around this time they started using what is known as coinjoin transactions so these are special types of bitcoin transactions which are very difficult to trace through so in general the way that bitcoin tracing works is you can assume that all of the inputs of a bitcoin transaction are all owned by the same person you know that kind of makes sense if you're going to send somebody some bitcoin and you're you're using bitcoin and various different addresses to to send from then you should be able to make the assumption they all belong to the same entity but it but in a coin joint transaction that's not the case what happens is people come together and each of their addresses is a different input to a single transaction and so you can't link an output of that transaction to an input so that's quite technical but basically what it achieves is breaking again breaking the blockchain trail and make it very difficult for law enforcement to continue to follow the money trail and in fact they started using a tool called wasabi wallet which makes um coin joins very easy to perform and we see wasabi involved in a lot of being used by uh people involved in a lot of this activity in bitcoin quite a large proportion of all proceeds of crime and bitcoin um now make their way through wallets associated with wasabi wallet and they were also converting to privacy coins can you talk about that as a technique as well yes um so in general the concept of chain hopping is where you start with one crypto asset and exchange it for another one and so that generally happens through centralized exchanges and again that breaks the blockchain trail because you can see uh for example proceeds of crime in bitcoin going into an exchange but you can't trace it any further because those bitcoins have been exchanged for another crypto asset however if the exchange is compliant is keeping records then law enforcement can always go to them perhaps with the subpoena and ask them you know what happened to these funds were they conversed into a different asset if so can you give us the transaction ids so in theory they should be able to continue to trace the funds there was mention made um in the statement of facts about monero i'm not sure how significant that is and whether any monero tracing was used in this investigation because from what's described here i'm not sure that would have been necessary in order to tie this activity to the suspects arrested this week the statement of fx also talked about a technique they allegedly used called appeal chain what is that yeah so appeal chain is a series of transactions from a wallet where at each step at each transaction a small amount is taken from the wallet and deposited said in exchange and so this might take place over hundreds of steps hundreds of transaction steps and what that means is that first of all um the amounts being deposited that exchange are smaller and so are less likely to set off you know a red flag in terms of potential money laundering and it also makes it more difficult to trace back the ultimate source of those funds so crypto exchanges typically use blockchain analytics tools like microleptics to trace the source of funds for every transaction so here perhaps they were trying to introduce more separation between deposit of the exchange and the illicit source of funds to try and overcome that in the statement of facts the irs special agent who wrote a chris janzeski wrote in the complaint that for some of the accounts where the funds were allegedly sent he was not actually able to obtain the names of those account owners so then how did he link those to lichtenstein and morgan that's not entirely clear to me whether that that information is necessary to do this i think that even if you don't have the identity of the account owner as long as you know their transactions then you can continue to follow the transaction trail until you get to an exchange that is willing to give you an identity um so perhaps that's what happened here so in general when you look at all the different laundering moves that were allegedly used here would you say that these were pretty sophisticated laundering techniques or is it that or maybe they were for the time but is it that just blockchain analytics will always eventually catch up or what's your take so yes the laundering techniques used here were reasonably sophisticated and they became more sophisticated over time i think what this shows is that both blockchain analytics capabilities and law enforcement capabilities have advanced over this period such that even advanced laundering can still be overcome you know i think key to this was that takedown of alpha bay in 2017 that was a huge international law enforcement operation which is clearly still paying dividends today um so by you know targeting those key enablers of the cyber crime economy it can pay off in unexpected ways such as potentially in this case and so obviously for that instance that's not necessarily that the technology became more advanced and better it's really that there was kind of an event that just gave a lot of data to the government so what do you think is the future for blockchain analytics as privacy techniques mature and as probably more of the industry frankly moves probably toward more privacy by default blockchains yeah so i think it is true that blockchain analytics has advanced significantly and that did play a role here what blockchain analytics basically does is map the blockchain and links certain wallets to certain actors you know your exchanges donate marketplaces ransomware wallets and so the more entities you have labeled and identified the more leads there are for law enforcement to follow because it's more likely that a flow of funds from some kind of a list activity will eventually reach an entity that is labeled in these blockchain analytics tools so when it comes to privacy coins i think that the challenge for a criminal is how do they cash out the monero where where are there are there any exchanges that can allow you to cash out billions of dollars worth of monero without being quite suspicious about your source of funds um i think that's one of the the key challenges with using privacy coins in these types of circumstances so what remains a question mark at the end of all this was who hacked bitfinex back in 2016. why do you think that was not part of the statement of facts or you know part of the arrest so perhaps it's because the people responsible for the hack while somewhere outside of the reach of us law enforcement you know we've seen that a lot with ransomware and dark net marketplaces perhaps in the country where there is no extradition treaty where they aren't able to arrest people that's certainly a possibility so even though that wallet that received the hacked funds the 1cg a4s wallet was in with a private key so that was in their possession you it sounds like you're implying that perhaps the hackers were separate people from liechtenstein and morgan potentially yes you know i think the the skills necessary to hack an exchange are quite different the ones that are required to launder a huge amount of cryptocurrencies so we often see this we see different actors engaged in their theft or the actual cyber crime and then a different set of actors engaged in the actual money laundering okay so essentially since they had the keys to that wallet that received the funds directly then would would one theory be which i have seen online that they bought the hacked funds for some discount from the actual hacker or something like that or how would they come in possession of of those keys potentially yes they might have um brought those funds off the hacker or they might have been funneling back funding the proceeds of the laundering back to the hacker in some way but this is just speculation i don't think there's any hard evidence about that in the public domain yet okay all right so we will have to see how this plays out clearly twitter was um you know uh fixated on on the news this week and it was definitely you know we didn't even go into the personalities involved but i really just wanted to lay out the facts here so thank you so much for uh illuminating all of us my pleasure thank you don't forget next up is the weekly news recap thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap blackrock eyes crypto kpmg jumps down the rabbit hole a year after blackrock cio rick reader mentioned that the asset management giant was starting to dabble in bitcoin coindesk revealed that blackrock is gearing up to offer crypto trading services to investor clients blackrock will begin by offering lending services using crypto as collateral additionally one of coindesk's sources says clients will have the ability to trade crypto via aladdin blackrock's investment management platform as covered in thursday's unchained daily chris perkins president of coinfund said that this was an important move for two reasons quote first aladdin supports many of the largest sovereign wealth pensions and asset managers in the world and this connectivity will solve many of the operational challenges that have been holding these institutions back he wrote in a message second aladdin typically releases new functionality based on client demand this tells you that many of the largest institutions in the world are asking for crypto capabilities for context blackrock currently has 10 trillion dollars in assets under management which is about five times the size of the market capitalization of all crypto assets in

to wrangle control of crypto on wednesday all eyes and ears were on of all places a senate agriculture committee meeting on cryptocurrencies during the meeting cftc chairman rosten benham made his case to bring crypto into the regulatory fold according to the block chairman benham asked for a 30 increase in the cftc's operating budget for 2022 after acknowledging that the cftc currently lacks the resources necessary to regulate digital assets as it usually only handles futures and derivatives benham cited as precedent as cftc's expansion following dodd-frank which granted the regulator

evaluating the risks related to crypto wait so did gamestop sell millions in imx tokens the short answer is yes gamestop did just sell off millions of dollars worth of imx tokens last thursday gamestop announced a partnership with immutable x an ethereum layer 2 solution and disclosure a former sponsor of my show to launch its own nft marketplace as part of the deal immutablex set up an incentive fund for gamestop that will provide up to 150 million dollars in imx tokens for the gaming company's expansion into the nft space however it appears that immutablex granted the tokens to gamestop without any vesting or lock-up requirements so when gamestop received roughly 39.17 million imx tokens after hitting the first few milestones of the partnership the gaming company could do anything it wanted with the tokens based on data from etherscan it appears that gamestop began dumping imx tokens on the open market the gaming giant made five imx transactions in february in amounts such as 6.5 million imx a little over 8 million imx and 2 million imx with two of the transactions coming before the immutable partnership announcement as of now gamestop's ethereum address holds just 20.18 million of the 39.16 million imx tokens it received since last week meaning that roughly 50 million dollars in imx tokens have been sent to elsewhere the block reports that tokens were sold on binance okx and wobe notably imx's token supply is only about 225 million coins meaning game stops imx token transfer of approximately 19 million tokens equates to roughly 8.4 of all imx tokens being moved the flood of coins into the market from gamestop appears to have suppressed the price of imx which hit a peak above four dollars on the heels of the gamestop announcement last week only to immediately drop back down under three dollars where it had been trading over the previous 14 days zynga to launch a blockchain game this year zynga the mobile gaming company that produced farmville and words with friends has plans to jump into the blockchain metaverse according to axios the firm is reportedly looking to expand its blockchain team from 15 to as many as 100 members additionally zynga revealed that it hopes to release a blockchain game in 2022 that will target cryptocentric gamers on that note matt wolfe zynga's blockchain chief said the company plans to separate its nft game ideas from its current ones so crypto words with friends does not appear to be in the works speaking of crypto adoption cnbc reported that salesforce told employees at a private event online that it would be building an nft cloud russia will reportedly recognize crypto as currency sort of a report from commercant a russian newspaper revealed this week that the russian government and bank of russia are preparing a draft law that will make cryptocurrencies an analog of currencies rather than just simply digital financial assets the newspaper reports that the proposal will be done before february 18th there's been conflicting news coming out of russia earlier in january the bank of russia was reportedly pushing for a blanket ban on crypto however separate accounts show that president vladimir putin is in favor of regulating rather than banning crypto mining within the industry time for fun bits nfts and crypto to appear in super bowl sunday you've probably seen matt damon
