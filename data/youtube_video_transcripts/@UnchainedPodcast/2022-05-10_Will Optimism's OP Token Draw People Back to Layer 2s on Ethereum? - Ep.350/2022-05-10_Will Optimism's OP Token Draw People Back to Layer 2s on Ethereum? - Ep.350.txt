to discuss are kane warwick founder of synthetics and ben jones co-founder and chief scientist at optimism foundation welcome kane and ben thanks laura good to be back hey yo thanks for having me let's start with a brief description of what you and the projects you're working on do and then also how your teams came to work together kane you've been on the show before so we will start with ben then why don't you describe what optimism is what your role is and yes how you have been working with synthetics sure so very excitingly now i can say that optimism is something more than just a company it is the optimism collective which is a very recent exciting announcement i'm sure we'll get into but in short optimism is a layer two scaling solution for ethereum so basically what this means is it gives you a version of ethereum that is not constrained by the same you know sort of gas fees that you're constrained with on ethereum itself but gives you all the same properties makes it faster and it's much cheaper as far as sort of the origin story um you know there's like a whole diatribe i could do about public goods and all this stuff that i'll get into later but basically we started as a non-profit trying to solve the problem of scaling ethereum and eventually that evolved through a series of technical changes we improved and improved and improved and we finally found the thing that we were going to build called an optimistic roll-up and we knew that optimism was a great name for that and here we are today great and kane why don't you describe what synthetics is what you do there and then why synthetics has been working with optimism for layer two yeah so um synthetics is a um synthetic asset protocol so uh basically gives you access to different assets on ethereum so things like bitcoin that are not native things like commodities and forex that obviously are not native to ethereum blockchain you can get exposure and it has you know things like spot since which is just a tokenized version of something like silver but it also has futures as well so you can trade you know with leverage and and other things the the interesting thing i think about synthetics is that early on we realized that the complexity of the smart contracts that were required to support a system like synthetics was just extremely high you know so i think at one point in 2018 we had the most contracts on mainnet that were all connected together and that created frustration as gas prices rose over time because you know people like wait you know when i transfer eighth it costs you know a dollar and then you know i go to make a claim on synthetics and it costs you know ten dollars like what's going on and so we identified really early on that we were going to need to find a scaling solution and then eventually we found that scaling solution in optimism so both of you will probably want to address this question but obviously there are so many ways that ethereum can scale probably two of the major ones that people talk about a lot are optimistic roll-ups which is probably going to be discussed at length here but also there are zero knowledge roll-ups or zk roll-ups why don't one of you maybe just kind of describe the difference between those two and then explain why it is that you know both of you for your projects focused on optimistic roll-ups i'll take it yeah so it's a great question basically what you're doing when you do something called a roll-up is you're basically taking a big set of transactions that you want to be the sort of scaled cheaper version of your transactions right and you submit them to ethereum and basically you can think of this as like a notarization step or like a you know recording so that somehow you can enforce the result of those transactions so this is the key to how you get scaling with a roll-up regardless of of how you build the roll-up ck or optimistic is you take these transactions and you sort of notarize them and that note active notarization is much cheaper than it would be to actually go and execute all of those transactions it costs sort of less gas on the l1 right the layer one to your layer two roll up that you're building and then from there you have some sort of mechanism by which you enforce what the outcome of those transactions should be and you do that in such a way that is different than simply running all of the transactions through ethereum because that would be just as expensive as using ethereum and so there's the zk and optimistic distinction is basically talking about two ways that you can accomplish this so in one way you basically do some very very fancy math involving something called a zero knowledge proof actually what matters more there is really the s if you've heard of like a snark or a stark before it's really the s in front that really matters it's not the zero knowledge it's the succinctness so it's shorter to verify what's going on in this sort of form of very advanced math that you have to do alternatively you build an optimistic system where basically you have a contract that someone goes to and proposes the result of these transactions and you open a window of time for which anybody can look at all the transactions that were being notarized right because they're all in that censorship resistant you know layer one ethereum and they can go and look at those transactions and compare the results that they got get from calculating those transactions to what's proposed and then they go and have a mechanism by which they can go and dispute any faulty proposals and so that is the mechanism by which you enforce the ck i think that zk tech is amazing and one thing that's the case is that they're earlier on in the life cycle because there's an extreme amount of complexity both from a security and just like an understanding perspective for zero knowledge systems but i actually do think that we'll see the these like tend to converge over time and so what we see today as a dichotomy you have the ability to do a lot more because you're not constrained by these very complex you know sort of math proofs you have to generate an optimistic system so we have this thing called evm equivalents where it's truly like ethereum to use our system as opposed to you're sort of using a zk system that's on top of ethereum maybe it's a little bit different but i do expect those barriers to go away over time and it'll be really interesting to see that uh play out and so you want to add gain yeah so i think maybe i can just add the project perspective right because you know there's a kind of interesting situation going on where you have you know a bunch of incredible teams working on the actual scaling infrastructure right you know different versions of roll-ups but as a project you need to decide you're the kind of the consumer of the scaling right like we've decided that l1 is just not going to scale and we need to you know come and consume some new platform we're going to build on and one of the constraints with synthetics that was decided very early on by the engineering you know squad within synthetics is that we didn't want to support multiple different implementations of synthetics we could barely support the one that we had right let alone trying to support different versions and so when we looked at a lot of the scaling solutions that were available back in 2019 when we started this journey of like you know we need to scale synthetics the the challenge was that a number of them required you to kind of rewrite the contracts or make you know fairly significant changes and even optimism back in the day when we first started working with them still required a number of changes um you know it wasn't a perfect edm equivalence you couldn't just press a button and deploy your contracts one of the interesting things i think over the last uh maybe a year or 18 months is that optimism has actually kind of pivoted more towards evm equivalence and i think that's been driven by the projects that you know like synthetics have been working with them saying like this is such a critical component for us right that you know as a smart contract team we're running on at one but we also need to be able to run almost the identical code on uh optimism if this is going to work and so we looked around at the market and we said okay you know we've got zero knowledge um you know solutions in the form of say stockwear stockwear requires you to rewrite code in cairo their programming language eventually that will double change right that will double shift i think and you know they are moving towards evm equivalents but you know it's just going to take a long time so for us it was really about ensuring that we had something that was going to not require us to maintain multiple different code bases for different systems and that we would be able to have that evm equivalent and also that it was going to be production ready as soon as possible as soon as possible turned out to be a little bit longer than we all you know hoped but we're here now and you know we're very happy about it we think that um you know optimism is a system that you know people can very comfortably and confidently deploy their smart contracts to and we have and we're slowly migrating all of synthetics uh you know all of the staking system over to optimism right now and also you know like it's not just that people can scale using ethereum or layer two on ethereum but obviously we now have all these other kind of smart contract chains that are you know some of them are called eath killers uh obviously solana has had a lot of buzz you know about lunch um you know near is one that people are kind of buzzing about now so there's kind of these other options as well and a number of them have evm compatibility or ethereum virtual machine compatibility which should make it easy to you know kind of basically offer synthetics elsewhere so um or even for both of you then you might want to answer this as well but you know i'm curious like why you chose not to even go to some of these other chains that do have evm compatibility and actually well the question is mainly for kane but ben might want to chime in as well yeah so maybe i'll answer first and then can add anything if uh you know if he's got some color there i think for us when we went through this process of determining you know how do we scale synthetics the expectation was that we would stay on l1 you know for the foreseeable future right we would have exchanges and a lot of the functionality that synthetics requires would exist on l1 we would just move the staking component onto you know some scaling solution which we hadn't determined at that time right and the fact that we would be able to retain the security properties of l1 with optimism by moving our staking over there versus moving to another chain that had a whole bunch of different security tradeoffs um you know it might be faster but it might have you know other challenges and this is the reason why we didn't choose polygon early on like that would have been probably the most obvious choice for us but we had kind of decided that side chains which you know probably polygon was right you know and obviously they're moving towards uh something more like a layer two but at the time they were very much a side chain we just said that's not going to be sufficiently secure for having our network you know operate across these two chains and so you know there's there's a few different trade-offs that you have with optimism in l1 but it's still very much within the ethereum ecosystem and optimism and the optimistic roll-ups are an obvious way for you to stay within the ethereum ecosystem and actually scale ethereum itself because it's now not just l1 it's this combination of things collectively which give you scaling and so that was obviously optimism and you know we saw a lot of promise in that approach and we kind of you know went all in and said all right let's work together because one of the challenge i think you have when you're building a scaling solution is you have a very different perspective to a smart contract team smart contract teams have a whole bunch of different challenges you know they're on the ground you know in in the trenches kind of fighting it out and it's very different to um you know someone who's building this you know really kind of critical uh you know infrastructure and very difficult infrastructure to build and so we kind of partnered with optimism to help them to understand what our challenges were and so they could kind of help us to understand how they were going to tweak things and i think together that partnership got us into a place where you know we're both really happy with the result yeah it's interesting because it is sort of well i'm not sure you know i'd have to maybe do a survey but but it feels like a slightly different choice just because obviously with ave or even now like ust or tara they're they're kind of branching out so you know it definitely feels like kind of a certain bet that you made certainly i mean i know salon is not even compatible uh but we have seen uh difficulties there so clearly some of your concerns were valid so now let's just talk about you know why optimism has been in the news there's the announcement about its token and the new governance model so ben why don't you describe what has been going on with optimism sure yeah so i think if you look at recent headlines and the thing that you pull out is optimism token you are doing a disservice and you are reading the from the wrong news sources right so really what we introduce is the optimism collective and i think when you look at the core problems that we um you know sort of face when we want to decentralize things right at some point you have to decentralize the governance of a system and obviously we've seen that in quite a few protocols at this point and something that we have not seen is basically a focus on humanity and humans and non-plutocracy and so very core to what we wanted to do when we set out to decentralize optimism was basically an acknowledgement that just because we have some very powerful technology doesn't mean that the incentives will just work out in the favor of people and if you look at what happened in web 2 right they were the early internet pioneers were convinced that we were bringing in the utopia right and then it here we are now like trying to say that the evil web 2 is going to be replaced by web 3. right so we sort of want to be very mindful of that and so we've introduced is the optimism collective which is the governing system for optimism and it's basically split into two houses the citizens house and the token house and basically together they govern the system and try to put checks and balances on each other the token house is there to be a plutocratic one token one vote system the citizens house is there to be a human-centric one-person one-vote system and so these things together are what will govern optimism not just the token let's talk a little bit about the soulbound nft aspect which is just so fascinating you know just explain kind of what that is and then why it is that you decided to incorporate that piece of it sure yeah so a soul-bound nft is um a terminology that vitalik took from world of warcraft hilariously as as one does with major you know important things in ethereum it is a basically a non-transferable nft that would be an easier way to say it and another way to say it honestly is an identity right because if you have a non-fungible token that is also not transferable not only is it not fungible it's attached to the owner of that token and so this is the concept of a soul-bound nft and really what we're saying is just a cool world of warcraft word for an identity system and what we are basically saying is that the citizens house should be governed by sets of identities as opposed to sets of tokens and so if you could you know buy and sell and transfer identities then you wouldn't have that property and so the sold-out nature of it is what helps us achieve that and then so just talk a little bit about how that will work in terms of governance so there will be kind of the plutocratic side where um tokens will probably determine the vote i'm assuming am i wrong in thinking that even there you'll institute quadratic funding which will weight the votes of as kevin iwaki of bitcoin likes to say the it'll optimize for the poor and the many over the preferences of the rich and the few is that what you're going to do in the token house yeah so we're exploring with that it is not currently how the token house will be structured um we have done in the experiments that we've done so far on the sort of token house side of things even before this went live we gave away a million dollars in our first retroactive public goods funding experiment we'll probably talk about retroactive public goods funding later but definitely what i'll say is that core to what we're doing here is going to be experimentation and so realistically this is an amazing vision but it's a tall task right we want to do a whole identity system is like a real real thing to tackle right and so we were not uh naive enough to think we would get it all right on the first try so the initial government's doesn't governance doesn't have quadratic funding on uh voting on on the token house side we've experimented with that in our experiments so far on the citizens house side but core to what we're doing is to continue to iterate so we will go through some cycles and some experiments and basically lay out a set of hypotheses that the optimism foundation is going to test and run experiments to see if these things accomplish what they want so we're big fans of uh quadratic voting and i suspect that that will answer some of the hypotheses in the positive but it's all about experimentation for us right now okay well then i'm a little bit confused because i thought in the citizen's house that's one sold out nft one vote so i don't understand how you would use quadratic funding there because i thought it was if somebody votes with many many tokens but if you can only ever have one token when you vote i don't get how yeah so i i think that's maybe uh yeah so maybe one took one vote is too simple in that regard so for example you can have the mechanism of quadratic uh voting requires the one token one vote concept basically as a way to determine whether this is one person giving out trying to uh you know fund something for a hundred dollars or two people trying to fund something for fifty dollars so you can basically have a one soul bound nft that people then have an allotment of quadratic votes for so it's kind of like splitting up the one person into a few different votes so then they can allocate quadratically over different outcomes oh it's like each person gets some like portion of money or something to allocate yeah you could kind of think of that as like a vote specific set of tokens and the fact that those tokens are associated with the soulbound nft will restrict how you can spend them in this quadratic manner but then one other thing is i mean how do you really make it soul bound because people could just sell their their nft and you wouldn't know i mean they would just have to sort of promise like i'm not going to use this or you know whatever whatever it is can i answer that question because i i so yeah because like we've we've actually done a lot of these experiments for a long time right like we've been playing this game for you know three or four years now right at synthetics and in the early days particularly when we were using discord voting instead of using tokenized voting you know maintaining this one person one vote system was hard right and people started to try and game it and there are systems and checks that you can put in place to kind of prevent this uh but i think the the interesting thing about assault bound nft is the only way that you could potentially sell that nft is effectively to transfer your private key right to like give you know access to for someone else to have your private key which is very problematic because you know as most people are kind of aware as soon as i give ben my private key he can't know that i've destroyed my access to the private key right and so now he's in this situation where he's like well you should still do it king [Laughter] i'll send you i'll send you one of my private keys and we'll play that experiment but you know like we don't know then whether the transactions being uh created by ben or myself right like it's unclear right because we both now have like this jewel ownership of this uh this address right and we can both sign transactions in theory right now if i you know really really promise that i'm going to destroy the private key and then like stumble across that i'm like oh actually this would be cool for me so there are things that you can do that make it harder or you know add layers of kind of protection on top of the system like this and synthetics has been experimented with this and i'm super excited to see the way that optimism goes because the more individual experiments we have the more we have like cross-pollination of ideas right like we're watching very closely to see what optimism does so that we can say oh actually that's a good solution to one of the challenges that we've had advice for you know so i think right now we're getting into a place where like there's a lot of governance experimentation it's very exciting because more experimentation better so ben when you guys set up this system were there specific problems with governance that you were trying to solve i mean you talked a little bit about kind of how a lot of dows nowadays are sort of like plutocracies but were there other ideas that you had about things you wanted to tackle with this 100 i would say the biggest one as big as the plutocracy issue is the challenge of resource allocation so this i mean this goes back so deep in our history like literally to the start of everything so before we were optimism right we were a non-profit called plasma group and literally what we were set out to do was basically just write do a bunch of research to solve a sort of an earlier version of rollups called plasma right basically look at the the set of problems in designing these plasma systems figure out solutions publish those to the world and this was very valuable we actually had like multiple people that went and then took those you know specs and write-ups and and push those to their you know systems and and build them out but what we faced was a few problems one was funding right we were basically going and pleading for donations from people and that was that was something that we could do but it made it hard to scale the team right and it wasn't always very easy and things didn't seem right so even when we moved to do with the startup with optimism right we incorporated as a public benefit corp so optimism was not you know a limited liability corp it was a public benefit corp literally in the charter in the found in the founding documents of the pbc we talked about the idea of public goods on the internet and enshrining fair access we've just seen this time and time again if you look at the amount of resources that say ethereum has has given as a protocol to miners right if you look at all of the revenue that has been generated by ethereum mining right and you compare that to the revenue that's gone to the people actually building the protocol that everyone is using right this is a there's a massive mismatch if you do the pi you know the bar you can like barely see the sliver of the pie or the little tower for the right so this is a big problem so that is the other thing that we're setting out to do with the optimism collective is to make public goods profitable it should be the case that you can build free open source software and be rewarded for it if it has a positive impact so that is the other big piece that we're trying to solve here yeah famously i mean you guys know i just wrote this book that i don't know if people will be able to see it because i know this will be cut up into smaller screens but anyway people know that i wrote about ethereum and early on people were kind of concerned about what they viewed as low salaries in ethereum and not that long ago people were still discussing this and it's kind of years since that happened so um clearly you know i think there are some issues there with you know notions of fairness and how people have been compensated but one thing that i you know would definitely want to highlight is that one of the philosophies that you want to incorporate into the way that optimism functions going forward is something that you call retroactive public goods funding so can you define what that is and why it is that you've decided to do it this way retroactively specifically sure absolutely so look we just said that we have this hard problem right and we want and that problem is funding public goods right or you know the fair allocations so what do you do to make that fair obviously you have to fund those public goods right pretty straightforward what we realized was incredible was that these l2 protocols basically give you a revenue source in the form of fees to be able to actually distribute right so we now have a revenue source that's not just donations it's meaningful usage leading to fees and so the question becomes how do we take these resources and allocate them to public goods and you know in some sense there's basically two ways you can either do it before the fact or after the fact right proactively or retroactively you know sort of like this is the obvious choice you know this is the obvious two choices that you have and historically a lot of public goods funding is done proactively right you have grants that are you know given out and a bunch of people apply and they say i'm gonna do this grant and um you know please accept me this is challenging one because it requires that you be able to very accurately predict who the right person to get this grant is and that can be hard as a singular grant giving organization and you might be wrong and so the reason that we want to fund retroactively is basically because it's much easier to look at a bunch of people who have contributed public goods and identify which one of those have been the most impactful and so one of the like sort of guiding principles if you go to optimism dot io slash vision and check out is this notion of impact equals profit the idea that the protocol should reward people proportionally to their impact so that's uh retroactive public goods funding in essence is you look after the fact at a set of public goods that you wanted to be improved and be created and you retroactively reward the people who and projects that have contributed the most to that yeah this is so fascinating how you're taking this notion of a public benefit corporation and translating it into a web3 version you know when i was looking at public benefit corporations i saw like warby parker as one or all birds and you know they donate eyewear or you know i actually don't know what all birds donates but but the point is that you know this is really interesting because you're doing it i mean i don't know what all the different things are but it sounds like open source software will be one of them so it's very similar in a certain respect to what git coin is doing which is really interesting but i feel that yeah it's just like a um just something to watch in the web3 space because i feel like it's sort of a new animal that's being born out of curiosity do you have an estimate for how much you'll be earning that you would be able to give out in these kind of retroactive grants yeah so that will be a part of governance we'll be you know determining how we parameterize so like right now we basically as optimism break even and that's you know basically because we want fees to be as low as possible did interpretation of break even changes a bit under different conditions for example like congestion of the chain you can't break even because you have to charge people more to prevent the chain from sort of filling up too fast so there will be uh sort of fundamental stuff that will go to the protocol no matter what it's a long run it's hard to predict and so it's been on the order in the past when you know when we when we had a margin of you know millions of dollars a month and i think the key is that the retroact republicans funding should make the flywheel that makes that number go up basically right the idea is that if you put the money generated by the protocol into funding the public goods that make the protocol better that will make the protocol better and then there'll be more people using it and more fees generated and so on so you get this nice you know sort of flywheel effect so that's part of you know the the core thesis is that whatever that number is it will continue to go up if you fund the public goods that made it a number in the first place yeah i i find it really fascinating so we'll have to see where all this goes in a moment we'll talk a little bit more about governance and what this means for layer two but first a quick words from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 10 million

has been dow first so what do you mean by that and why has that been the philosophy so we decided uh back in 2020 that we believed that having a foundation and having uh legal entities was a drag on our ability to you know kind of lean into community governance and so we made a decision that we would shut down all of those entities and that we would hand over control to the community and to the token holders but this transition was interesting you know it goes back to the point that you know i made earlier where we had a form of one person one vote governance which was basically you had a role within discord that you earned over time through participation etc it actually was totally decoupled from your token holding right so we had you know people that had 10 tokens and people that had 10 million tokens and that same voting power and then we realized well okay this doesn't scale because you know discord's really easy to civil attack and we started seeing people try and you know play games with voting buying voting you know collusion etc and so we said okay we need something that's going to be better and more scalable for you know the next five years or whatever of governance and so we changed to this form of representative democracy where instead of having one person one vote you would have one token one vote but it would be quadratically scaled so we would scale back the voting power of each of the participants within the network and we have kind of a built-in anti-sybil system which is that synthetics is really uh complicated and expensive to use an expensive to stake and so it's really hard to maintain multiple wallets you can but like it you know it gets exponentially harder the more wallets you have right even if you're writing scripts you need to do a whole bunch of things to kind of maintain that and so we had this system where actually what was happening is most wallets were consolidating so people who had three wallets were actually consolidating them down into a single wallet we built this like debt consolidation system and so we saw over time we went from you know about 10 thousand addresses that were staking down to about six thousand as as people from the early days kind of brought these wallets together and then the way that we uh helped to kind of reduce this plutocratic influence was to basically say okay you have one address and it has a certain amount of voting power raw voting power and then we're going to scale that quadratically but then you only get to vote for one person on this eight person council and so you can vote you know uh your favorite person in but the other seven uh you know members of the council you have no influence over right and what that meant is that like on the margins as you went further and further down the council elections uh it got much more competitive and so it became very hard for you know a few whales or a single whale to really dominate any vote and we've seen that play out really well and actually we're about to see this play out in a very interesting fashion due to uh the you know announcement that happened yesterday where optimism basically said that they were going to allow for projects who have been building on optimism to make a claim for tokens to reward their users and their community for transitioning to the optimism network so now we've got this really interesting contentious vote and it's going to be it's already playing out within the synthetics discord to decide how do we allocate those tokens right what's the like optimal allocation do we allocate them to retroactively to people who transitioned early to optimism who kind of helped test out the network do we um you know allocate them to future people but we've got an eight person council that needs to now make this decision and they actually have quite a wide range of opinions about this and interestingly i think the majority of the people on the council are on optimism already and so the people who are on optimism have kind of this vested interest in an alignment with all of the other optimism users who transitioned you know over the last year or so um whereas the people are still on l1 tend to be whales right so we've got this very kind of tense balance between the you know the plutocrats who are still on l1 and you know the vast majority of stakers that have migrated to l2 because the costs were too high on l1 and they were kind of forced to go to optimism in order to be able to save uh gas fees and they've saved a ton of gas fees and they've got a much better experience but we're going to need to work out how we uh how we kind of you know decide this decision but in older forms of governance this would be just not even this would be like trivially easy right like some vc would turn up and say give me all the tokens and they would press their vote button and they would get all the tokens the end right but in synthetics you've got this your multi-layered governance system which makes that uh decision much much more interesting and it's going to take a lot of debate and you know and kind of compromising i think between the community to reach some you know consensus around how we distribute this uh these rewards basically yeah yeah and it's fascinating because uh typically whales have a lot of power um so yeah that was that was one of the things that shocked me when i did research my book i didn't realize just how influential they were but yeah it's interesting because normally the whales would be the ones who would get a lot of the tokens but since they haven't already migrated i'd be interested to see how this gets decided but one thing that i did want to note is that synthetics does have pretty high participation in governance and i wondered how it was that you thought you were able to accomplish that i think coming from australia even though i grew up in in the u.s i've got an interesting perspective whereas in australia you're forced to vote if you don't vote you get fined and that is something that i think you know in a lot of western democracies there's some form of that in america you know people are like oh my god that's the most horrible thing i've ever heard you know how i don't know i don't think it's horrible yeah fair enough i i have voted in pretty much every election but anyway right right i think i think there are a lot of people who uh who see that as problematic right forcing people to vote um you know there's always concerns around people just you know pressing a random button and you know they're not informed or whatever and so what we've done is we've actually set up a system where in order to vote you need to be a participant in the ecosystem you can't actually just vote your tokens so first of all you need to be a staker so that already creates a pretty hard filter if you're a staker you are a stakeholder in the decisions that are being made because you're taking a risk in participating this network as opposed to you know you just have a bunch of tokens sitting on finance right and you know you don't really care but every once in a while you come out and you vote for something because it's in your best interest i think that's kind of the first thing and then the second thing is the fact that you know again we've got this like quadratic uh weighting and you know in order for you to be able to claim your tokens the the fees that you get and the rewards you get are basically weighted against your token holding and you can't actually access those fees during a vote process unless you exercise your voting power so you need to vote your voting power which is based on how much you're participating in the network and if you don't you can't claim the tokens so it creates this kind of forcing function for people to engage and and in our experience most people do genuinely engage right you know it's once every three months they have to turn up and they have to say okay you know who are the people that are available who are the candidates who do i want who i think will represent me and we do see that the vast majority of people are quite engaged around that period even if they're not that engaged in governance in the other three months during that one to two week period people do come in and start asking questions and want more information about governance so it does tend to work fairly well and and you know gets fairly high participation rates in you know in the order of like 60 70 of people end up voting kane i know that you had this theory that you were calling l222 um so why why don't you describe that and then it involves tokens this is why i'm raising this issue and i just wondered if you felt that it is turning out to be the year that you thought if you are thinking that you know having tokens on layer 2 is is drawing people back to ethereum who might have left to other chains yeah so i think we had a period within the ethereum community where we became quite complacent right there was really almost no like realistic competition for ethereum as a smart contract platform um you know a lot of people forget that like finance smart chain existed for like a year and was just like a total zombie chain right like every block was empty they didn't even bother to like fill up the blocks because it was just so obvious that this thing was like not actually functional um and no one was gonna use it and that went on for a really long time and so you know all the people who within ethereum you know were very pleased with themselves and you know patting themselves on the back about how successful you know ethereum was and how you know it was so hard to compete with ethereum etc and then we got to d5 summer and gas prices just spiked to a point where uh it was cost prohibitive for you know the average new entrant in the ecosystem to come in and actually use ethereum and really you know not just transfer eat or you know buy tokens like we did it back in 2017 where you just participate in an ico or something like that but genuinely you know to use defy it was extremely expensive you had these continuous transactions etc and it opened up a window of opportunity for other smart contract platforms that had been you know in the works for a long time things like avalanche things like solana to really take not i don't think the existing market share of ethereum users i don't think there were that many existing ethereum users that really transitioned over because most of the original ethereum users you know the people who kind of stuck it out through the lost bear market could afford gas fees but new entrants um you know that new person who's coming in who's like i've heard about crypto i've heard about d5 heard about all this cool stuff you know and even nfts to some extent right they were like where do i go and then they you know experienced ethereum gas fees and they're like well obviously not here i can't afford this right and then they would go to avalanche or even binance smart chain and so this one finance smart chain went from a total ghost chain to a chain that actually had some like organic activity and people you know were copy pasting uh you know synthetics and maker and ave and all of these projects over and you know people like this is much better i'm paying a dollar to use this right we also had polygon emerge you know and so there was this emergence of competitors in an environment where i think most of the ethereum community was fairly complacent about this i think the dynamic is actually flipped on its head now where a lot of these alt-out ones have had only competition among themselves really um and they've had you know the vast majority of users have been coming in and they've been picking one or two of these chains and so they've had this amazing user growth over the last you know 12 months with very little competition from ethereum itself right and now all of a sudden ethereum has multiple scaling solutions that are production ready and once again the coolest stuff is being built on ethereum so you have things like lyra you have things like polynomial which is d5 protocol built on lyra built on synthetics you've got these multi-layered d5 protocols with all of these cool things and cool functionality and so the builders who've been you know building an ethereum for the last you know two three years are starting to build some really cool stuff that couldn't exist on l1 but can exist on optimism and we're going to see people look around and say well wait a second like optimism costs less than you know this other random chain that i'm using why am i over here when there's all this cool activity here and i think there's a little bit of complacency because of the lack of competition on these you know from these old l1 and i think that um you know optimism and some of the other scaling solutions for ethereum are really going to blindside them and they're going to be so surprised that all of their users that they thought were super loyal are going to come kind of flooding back to l2s on ethereum because that's where all the cool stuff is happening and by the time we get to the end of you know 2022 which is where you know l22 comes from by the time we get to the end of this year we're going to have a mass migration of people back to the ethereum community and back to the ethereum network it's just they won't be on l1 they'll be on rollups and that's where all the cool fun stuff will be well yeah i i like i find this very fascinating you know i would be curious to see by the end of the year if this plays out the way that you have described but that brings me back to ben i mean ben you know was part of um you know the motivation for optimism to roll out governance which includes this token to be you know one of the places to kind of try to draw in new users because obviously going forward you will also have this ongoing airdrop you know i don't know exactly when you guys use that term what that will look like but you know i don't know if that was kind of part of the motivation to to launch this now yeah i would say definitely growth is an aspect of governance that's important right and it's so it's also important to turn over decisions around growth to the community so that's something that we that we've that we've been doing now so that's definitely the case i would i would say that the other piece of this really for us on timing was just that we were finally able to turn to this so in a few months we'll release the next version of optimism which is called bedrock and bedrock basically is actually very similar properties to what you use on optimism now but it's basically us having fixed everything that we learned with kane with synthetics with everyone else over years of building this protocol and getting it right and bedrock will basically be this technical foundation for what we're doing and it has very low technical debt it has very low lines of code it is extremely similar to the ethereum code base it's very evm equivalent and so i would say that also for quite frankly it is also a matter of bandwidth opening up because we've always known that governance needs to be a part of this and we've always known that we want to fund these public goods with this new revenue source the layer 2 presents but quite frankly we were so busy building it you know we had to keep our priorities straight so definitely growth is an aspect and definitely definitely i do believe that there is a responsibility not to sacrifice the values that ethereum brought forward and i think what a lot of these alt l ones do quite frankly is they look at the you know story that kane just laid out a new person comes to ethereum they see a hundred dollar fee and they seek elsewhere and i think a lot of other ml ones have taken advantage of that basically and just sacrificed on a bunch of you know decentralization qualities to get low fees and so that is certainly a very important imperative for us and it always has been is to maintain the security and decentralization so now that we're ready to do that sure it is super important to grow because the reality is that the values which brought us here in the first place are that decentralization censorship resistance security yeah and you know i couldn't help but notice there's these other layer twos that are also going to be launching tokens uh such as next um there might even be i don't know if this would directly compete with you but there was a talk of a hop token for l2 cross chain transfers um so we'll see but i was curious like in general do you feel that when people are on layer twos that it will then be easy for them to communicate with other layer twos or will the layer twos compete with each other yeah so the the question is one uh that basically talks about bridging and so i know laura even you talked about like the cross l1 bridges like the wormhole hack i think i saw it pop up on on the podcast feed recently so what you're talking about there is bridging right and definitely it's the case that in the future users to kane's point of using ethereum meaning that they're using l2 will never even touch layer one even if they have to move between chains so there's a lot of really good bridge protocols out there hop is a great example of one of them that basically you know leverages some mechanisms to be able to move funds directly from one l2 to another and that's actually pretty important because if you had to go up to l1 and down to another l2 every time you wanted to use some other application on the other l2 you don't have any scalability because you're doing a transaction on l1 and it would be just as expensive to get there so that is the case i will also say though that i think the multi-chain narrative that we see today is a little bit different from the one that we see at optimism so the one that we see at optimism is basically that the multi-chain aspects that we see today are very much a property of the space being so early that we are thinking about these things as chains and we haven't built good abstractions so i will go even further which is to say that in the future users will be using l2s and it will appear to them as one thing one like we call this the super chain at optimus when we're talking about this stuff that even if there's sort of multiple chains you know under the hood it's really going to seem to be one thing it's going to be like the new internet web 3. and so the answer is yes but i'll take you a step further you're not even going to realize that you're moving between you know a chain because that would be a very under the hood thing and you'll be think of it as just using optimism yeah but i do i have to admit i think that's quite a ways off in the future because anytime i try to use something where i'm using multiple chains or or whatever i mean it's just uh i mean granted i am not a sophisticated user but it's i find it very challenging well you know the issue is right laura is there's no there's no good money in giving you a better experience there if only there were a way for the public good of helping laura shin bridge between chains to be profitable all right all right i will wait i will wait for that retroactive public goods funding to um to kick in um so before we because i do want to touch on kind of more security stuff and um some other questions but before we do that actually kane i did want to ask you because synthetics is going to be launching its version 3 governance model and i was trying i was curious like you know what problems you were trying to solve with that and also curious about the fact that you have talked about how you would like for this to become its own protocol and so i just wondered what the vision was for that as well yeah so i think what we found in through our like constant iterative governance experimentation over the last four years is that we are slowly iterating towards something that's fairly stable you know it's not perfect and and we're definitely watching other protocols like yearn you know who are working on different things you know there's there's a bunch of uh you know amazing experiments that are going on across the ethereum ecosystem in terms of how to govern things but one thing i think that we are very aware of is the fact that no one has really nailed like full on chain governance right you know so there's things like the compound governance module um you know there's variance of that but it still uh requires like some level of um trade-off and and it makes it hard where you either you're kind of giving up too much power to large token holders right and we've seen that in a few recent votes or you still have some kind of discretionary aspect which is off-chain via multi-sig or something like that and so what the the new synthetics governance module that b3 gm does is try to find the right compromise between those two things right so it tries to be fully on chain but anti-plutocratic and it does that by basically removing any need for multi-sigs and allowing for all transactions to be executed fully on chain but it does this via this representative democracy and by an election process where token holders still have full control of who's elected and then it puts a second layer of protections on top of this elected body this council of eight people such that if they collude or go rogue or do something you know or stop doing anything and stop actually you know executing governance that there are multiple checks and balances where the token holders can actually turn up and say we need to remove this specific person on the council or we need to dissolve the entire council because something's broken and that is a system which currently is really hard to implement on chain because a multi-sig once people have the keys to the multi-sig you kind of can't get rid of them right so you know if uh if there's a multi-stick which is three or five and three people decide that they actually don't want to relinquish control of the multi-sig you can vote all you like but they're not going anywhere right you need to fork the protocol and deploy a new multi-stick etc and so this system actually says no the multi-sig signers have voting rights but it is all and constantly at the discretion of the token holders and then at any time the token holders can turn up and say i'm sorry you're not doing a good job we're removing you from uh your ability to execute governance decisions on behalf of all token holders and it's fully on chain so that's something that we're really excited about and i think that one of the things that we're doing is making it modular so that other protocols can come and say okay we like this as a platform but we don't necessarily like your uh voting strategy right we think that a voting strategy of you know quadratic voting weighted based on your your participation in the network is not good we want to give every token one vote and not quadratically wait it and we just want to see how that plays out and so this platform will basically allow for a lot more governance experimentation so we're really excited about it it's going to launch on optimism natively obviously and we think that it's going to be a place that a lot of optimism native projects are going to be able to experiment with governance all right so um i know we've talked plenty about governance uh but i did want to circle back to an issue that we touched on briefly which is security so obviously now synthetics does have this cross-chain bridge due to being both on optimism as well as uh ethereum layer one obviously i'm sure you are very well aware there have been a lot of hacks of cross chain bridges so i was curious to hear your thoughts on um how security was handled for this bridge yeah i'll speak to this so it's a really interesting question and one of the things that makes it so interesting is that in some sense a roll-up is a bridge i know that sounds very weird and nonsensical but it's actually true the mechanism that we talked about earlier in which for a period of time someone can come and dispute the results of the transactions that were notarized through the optimism system right these fault proofs that mechanism is itself a bridge right basically at basically that takes a week and if a week goes by and nobody disputes the results of the transaction it's accepted by l1 and you can then for instance complete a withdrawal that was included in the output of one of those transactions so the risk of cross-chain bridges is in fact basically the impetus for layer two existing right because these bridges that go between one distinct l1 and another right say polygon and ethereum these are the things that require some other mechanism like a multi-sig or a vote or whatever because these protocols don't directly talk to each other in the same way that a rollup talks to l1 right a rollup sends l1 all of its transactions and gives l1 a place to dispute the result of those transactions so there are trade-offs right sometimes less secure bridges are actually cheaper and so we don't expect a world we do expect a world in which some of these bridge designs continue to exist because you can basically take more risk if you want to and increase capital efficiency but fundamentally a roll-up kind of is a bridge that's kind of all that the roll-up dispute contract is is serving as the you know secure way to bridge withdrawals so there's a little bit of an answer on it and maybe a counterintuitive take is that roll-ups are bridges and they're the entire chain is built to have the most secure bridge possible well so i did see that optimism tweeted recently that bridging on and off optimism just got a major power up and that is now cheaper faster and easier to move assets between optimism layer one ethereum other layer twos as well as centralized exchanges how did you accomplish that and does that also change the fact that when you withdraw from the native optimism bridge that that would normally take seven days great question so the answer the way that this got improved is basically we acknowledge that those other bridges have a place and i should really clarify that there are kind of two types of bridges even as a non-native roller bridge there's like a collateralized bridge and a non-collateralized bridge and so there are actually protocols that are as secure they sort of introduce this capital efficiency that give you and hop is a great example of this that give you the ability to move these assets around faster and cheaper without sacrificing the the security guarantees so what we accomplished there was effectively we basically updated our ui to add some of the bridges that we think are reliable enough and secure enough to be using and we basically gave users the option to use those when the asset and the source and the destination of the bridge works but a lot of those are still secured by the native rollup optimism bridge it's just that they have a smart contract system on top that removes that one week window okay so yeah i mean there's so many changes and i think we'll see uh just how the tokens that you've introduced and also now the governance how that's all going to play out but looking ahead to the future i did also want to raise this ethereum improvement proposal 4844 4844 which you mentioned to me you know you felt was also going to kind of have a big impact on optimism why don't you describe what that is and why you're looking ahead to that sure so i guess it sort of set the stage i think it's about a year ago year and a half ago that vitalik put out this post called a rollup centric roadmap for ethereum and basically what that was was an acknowledgement that the rollups that are being built today are clearly the future of scaling and they're clearly the future of ethereum because ethereum needs to scale and therefore we need to focus in on that okay so what does that mean basically that means that we need to design ethereum to be as amenable to roll-ups as possible and basically the way in which we do that notarization process that i talked about earlier right it's also literally called rolling it up like that's where roll-up came from is this notarization but if you say roll roll up no one knows what the heck you mean they think you're talking about a fruit snack so in any case the way in which we introduced that mechanism into ethereum was really not with some special sort of like notary roll-up function that ethereum had we kind of hacked it then and it was cheaper but not as cheap as it could be and so eip 4844 is one of the first examples of hopefully of course it hasn't been passed yet but of the ethereum governance system becoming more amenable to rollups basically what it is is it is a new transaction type that basically makes the notarization really cheap and imposes less restrictions on the l1 nodes around what they have to do with that notarized data and so the tldr of all this is that if 4844 passes roll up fees will go down another 100x right so they're already like 20 to 500 x cheaper on l2 than l1 depending on the app this will plummet that number to like what 0.02 to a point whatever you get the point it will get much much cheaper about 100 times and so this is 4844 is one step along the path to what's called data sharding which is basically the long-term play that will allow ethereum to scale to literally hundreds of thousands of transactions with those transactions being rollups okay so i don't know generally for eips when they come to a vote is it just there's sort of a general consensus that the conversation is done okay yeah i mean i'm laughing because uh you know i was part of like the early 1559 like consensus building process um which went all the way back to like 2019 or something like that maybe even uh like early 2019 and so you know with major changes to you know how transactions are processed obviously everyone is extremely concerned that we ensure that that does not introduce you know any uh issues for the functioning of the system and so i think that there will be and already has been a fair amount of scrutiny on this eip but i think one of the cool things is that you know ethereum is responsive and like the ethereum community i think i say ethereum like not you know the network but ethereum the process right this rough consensus process tends to be fairly responsive to things that are effective and that there's clear demand for and so i think that if we're in a situation where more and more of the transactions that are happening on l1 are these notarized you know l2 transactions it will become more obvious to people who are you know building consensus around whether or not we implement something like this that this is needed right at the moment it's like oh we can probably get away without that because you know it's not that you know high of a percentage of the transactions or roll-up transactions as we do a better job um and you know as more people transition to l2 and as there's more activity there and more cool apps being built it's becoming it will become more and more obvious that this is something that just needs to happen because the competitive advantage that'll give both l1 and l2 as a combined you know consensus system smart contract system is going to be so huge that we just have to do it um so i think it might take a little while and then i think you know we'll be able to kind of get to consensus we are also as optimism we are working very hard like literally our engineers are writing code to prove that 4844 is safe and works and like get it implemented so it impacts everyone but this is a this is a the mother of all rising tides lifting all the l2 boats so we're ready to we're ready to make it happen okay yeah and i i was chuckling too when we were talking about how it's not clear when an eip is done being uh discussed because i discovered that also through writing my book but anyway uh let's also now look ahead to the merge uh clearly this is going to be a huge undertaking you know moving all the economic economic activity on ethereum over to this new proof of stake chain and i was curious what that means for obviously l2s like optimism but also protocols like synthetics that are built on ethereum you know what are you doing to prepare and kind of how do you think it's going to go i think this is something that and maybe even on like a previous show that i was on right like we we kind of discussed this right it might have been you know back in i don't know late 2020 or something like that right and i think it's one of those things where you need to spare some cycles for it right because it's definitely a thing that is going to happen but there's still not like 100 a sense of what this is going to mean for us right i think you know as synthetics um i think a big part of our focus is obviously transitioning to optimism transit transitioning as much of the code over to optimism and then probably redeploying some new code to l1 to support this like optimism-centric version of synthetics um and so i think right now like we're still thinking about it and it's still something that you know we're obviously monitoring but the vast majority of the resources within uh synthetics the engineering resources are going towards building v3 which will be deployed to optimism and supporting our current version transitioning to optimism well wait no but i was talking i was talking about ethereum's merge no no i'm sorry i get it so like but i'm saying like you know if we're on optimism then it's less our problem what happens he's saying it's my problem i'm saying it's his problem if we transition to optimism then like ben's you know gonna be the one who's working out how the merge and you know optimism works and we can just kind of cruise along on optimism and not worry about it that much right put your feet up exactly exactly exactly so ben uh yeah it's the natural segway right i would say actually the biggest thing that has happened to optimism as a result of the merge is that we have adopted it so this is this is like sort of more of a technical answer but it's really really cool if you think about the relationship between the notarized transactions that go on to l1 and the state of l2 basically what happens if you're running an optimism node is you're watching those sort of transactions appear and be notarized on l1 and then you're sort of pushing them into your local version of the world your node and executing those transactions right they weren't executed on l1 they were just notarized but you want to execute them on your computer what's fascinating is that this is extremely similar to what happens on the beacon chain with the merge and this is literally called in a theme it's literally called the merge api and the idea is basically that you watch transactions occur on the beacon chain and you basically send them to the get and that's a new sort of node software that's tracking the proof of stake and basically you look at what transactions the proof-of-stake finalizes and you send them to the ethereum guest node that sort of executes the smart contract ethereum virtual machine side of things so we are all about making the thing that we are doing not just scaling on ethereum but scaling ethereum itself and that means across the board we use code everywhere that we can that it exists on l1 this is an incredibly useful example of that the same the relationship between the beacon chain or what's called the consensus layer and the execution layer or like geth is exactly the same as the relationship between player one and optimism which is really fascinating so this has been incredible because it has allowed us to basically delete thousands of lines of code and use something that's already being battle tested and is up to the standards of the ethereum you know process to be able to merge it into the main l1 ethereum chain so i think that's the most interesting thing that happens to optimism as a result of the merge is we get to become even more like ethereum which is super cool practically speaking the merge is being handled very well so that you don't have to do much on the application side and the biggest thing that honestly we do is um we don't have to worry anymore about blocks coming like one after the other right away or like very slowly because with the merge they come in a regular cadence so that's like a nice edge case that we can kind of delete the code that we have to worry about that other than that doesn't do much it just moves right over wow okay well i definitely learned something there because i thought um all the applications and and layer twos were sort of like white knuckling it through this part but i guess it's it's really for other people to worry about all right well this has been a super fascinating discussion i'm so glad that you both came on the show where can people learn more about each of you and your work twitter.com ben underscore chain my stage name is weird ethyankovic when i'm not working on scalability governance i am working on ethereum parody songs and you can check out optimism.io for all the lovely stuff that we talked about today oh my god i just realized that's you in the video that i saw at the top of your twitter feed because you're in profile so i i just thought it was some random per okay anyway it's you people should check that out it is it's his pin tweet and it's very funny um kane how about you yeah so um for me it's uh twitter and my handle is k-a-i-y-n-n-e so you can find all my ship posting there and then synthetics dot io and and mainly discord right um the synthetics discord is the place where governance happens where all the discussions happen so if you want to come in and weigh in on the distribution of these op incentives uh that are coming up to the synthetics community come into discord it's gonna be a fun place for the next couple weeks while we would debate this and you can kind of see what decentralized governance in action looks like i'm gonna lurk all right um well thank you both so much for coming on unchained thanks laura thanks thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about layer twos optimism and synthetics check out the show notes for this episode join me this afternoon for the second book club for my new book the cryptopians we'll discuss the news the surprises i found while writing and all the drama from the early years of ethereum there are a few nft tickets left so head over to bits.k.i laura shin and see you later unchained is produced by me laura shin without from anthony yoon
