money laundering tools for exchanges and crypto businesses the same tools used by regulators cipher traces securing the crypto economy in honor of today's holiday giving Tuesday the topic for today's episode is philanthropy and crypto here to speak about the issue our conical opee the founder and executive director of the kiev and joe Waltman the executive director of give crypto org welcome Connie and Joe thanks for having us yeah thanks let's start with your backgrounds Connie how did you get in a Bitcoin and Cumberland bit give so I first learned about Bitcoin probably I'm guessing it was probably back in like 2011 2012 but it was more of just something that I was kind of watching and aware of in the background and then I attended the first Bitcoin foundation conference in San Jose in 2013 which has become sort of this this event that blossomed I think a lot of the startups in the community early on and that was when I came up with this idea of bid give and it really wasn't on my radar in any way it just kind of came to me being in that environment and being inspired by the topics and audience and potential of what I saw coming out of the community and I immediately wanted to see some way of capturing what was about to happen with this industry which is now five years later into you know something that could give back and have a social impact and and help move the needle on on social issues globally and just for listeners who don't know it's because your background actually was in nonprofits right can you describe that a little bit yes it was yeah so I was in a the environmental field for about 15 years I'm still involved as like a board member on a couple organizations but worked in the environmental space in California for 15 years largely with nonprofits and a variety of roles but the majority of the time was spent on finding funds for them to do good work and being you know creative about that and strategic about that and then in a lot of cases creating public sources of funding through advocacy and lobbying efforts so that's kind of how I made that connection to this the potential of this technology in this industry to be able to give back and make a difference in the nonprofit sector and Joe what about you what was your background and how did you get in a crypto yeah I'm much more of a carpetbagger I have a software and for-profits startup background I connected with Brian Armstrong who's the founder of give crypto earlier this earlier this year 2018 heard about the the opening for executive director and at that point thought it sounded like an interesting role I started working with him a little bit informally actually before I was hired and the result of that work changed it from oh this is cool to this is something I have to do this is this looks like really important really interesting really impactful work and started a few months ago and just to fill that out so what were you doing in software before and then how did you hear about the coin or crypto and you know before you heard about give crypto like what what were your thoughts about what it could do yeah so so quickly my background like I said started as a software engineer worked for big companies for the first ten years of my career like Qualcomm and occupy and Sprint the last ten years I've been serial entrepreneur two startups one was sold to Twitter and died a relatively painful death I first heard about Bitcoin more recently maybe a two years ago or shall we say blockchain generally and I think as any as anybody with with technology background and some degree of intellectual curiosity you couldn't help but become fascinated invited immediate by it immediately so let's dive into each of your companies Connie what does bit give do we are a non-profit so and our focus is leveraging Bitcoin and blockchain technology for the nonprofit sector in on a global scale and we early on since we kind of started a long time ago in all this was a lot of it was outreach in education with the nonprofit sector and mainstream NGOs about the technology itself and also fundraising for them in Bitcoin and then over the last couple of years we've been more focused on developing our donation platform which is called give track and we're delivering you know a technology platform that brings together all the benefits of crypto and blockchain technology where donors and nonprofits and the public can all benefit from the faster cheaper more secure transactions and then the transparency of the blockchain to watch the money moving knowing where it got to how it was used and then we also have a you know more less blockchain oriented but project results component as well so the donors and the public can see you know with pictures and videos and narrative reports what the results are the impact was on the ground and who were some of your partners and how do you choose which ones to work with so over the years we've worked with a wide range of vengi o--'s and I would say in size as well as mission some of the earliest ones we worked with receive the children the water project and medic mobile there have been sort of our largest partnerships with multiple projects and more recently with give track we've attracted smaller more nimble organizations that are excited about the technology that are doing a variety of different types of projects all over the world and we're about to launch the next version of give track in early December and we have a series of NGOs lined up to be our launch partners for that as well so we're kind of all over the place I would say geographically mission mission wise as well as size of organization and so to talk about as a give track offering a little bit more when you talk about providing transparency through that product does that require you to identify the wallets of all the different entities that are helping to deliver these charitable goods or services ideally that would be the case yeah but it's you know in reality when when working with these NGOs and with projects on the ground it's a lot more challenging than one would think and I think that's why a lot of other projects are looking at closed systems or more you know like private black jeans or aetherium kind of things and we're using Bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain and so that makes it a lot more challenging to do something like that so yeah it's um it's an evolution like right now it's the with Bitcoin doesn't necessarily have a way of registering and confirming any particular address we used to love the public static addresses especially for something like an NGO but a lot of the Bitcoin services have walked you know backwards from those because of security reasons so it's it's a challenge I think eventually we'll get there but right now we're chipping away at some of the basics around how to make this happen in the real world and on the ground so that's kind of further out so then when you talk about transparency through give track what does it mean if it's not that well everything is on the the blockchain so you can see everything on the Bitcoin blockchain and then we're also working with our SK to notarize everything on their on their blockchain and smart contracts as well but yeah there's still as with anything you know that that level of transparency to the last mile in reality isn't really even happening to in today's world at scale you know being able to even use it on the ground especially in these more remote areas or even being able to convert it in in the developing economies has become a challenge so yeah it's it's more just leveraging the transparency of the blockchain itself and then the RSK technology as well meaning like people contract the funds but if the wallets aren't identified then later on in some fashion people might be able to figure out if one of the wallets is actually not associated with the charity but in the moment they can't or something like like I don't like I don't understand how it can be transparent if if I mean obviously you can watch which addresses but if you don't know whose address is whose then I don't understand when you say it's transparent like what what is it offering exactly well I mean it's a good question I think compared to what we have in today's day you know there it's it's tremendously huge improvement because we don't have in any way today to see turns apparently on a public ledger what's happening with funds that donors give to NGOs and that end up in a you know who knows where so the technology that the blockchain offers is a huge step forward in that sense I don't you know personally I don't know any entity on the Bitcoin blockchain since it's it's truly decentralized distributed system that could confirm you know any wallet address as a third party right so you would always be trusting that someone says this is my wallet or this is a wallet for this NGO and this purpose when they still could be theoretically making that up unless you have some sort of third party confirming that somehow which I'm not aware of so BIC if it's not like I thought maybe you guys would be that entity but you're not I don't know how that would be possible yeah I mean if you know a way that be awesome I'd love to talk more about that but I don't think it's possible to to do that if there's still a level of trust that's involved where someone's claiming and wallet or and how dress belongs to a particular person or entity I mean I guess you could do something the way the banks do now where you would say to them okay you know send me this you know point zero zero two two three Bitcoin or something some like uh you know a strange number and then you could just send it back but then you would know okay that's their address it could be something like that I'm just making it up but yeah what I mean we are of course going through the whole you know kyc process and onboarding process with the ngos themselves that are on the platform but I think what you're asking about is you know many steps down the line when they're actually spending the money somewhere in the world for some particular thing how we would confirm that address is that I thought that's what you were asking about yeah well it's more I mean it could be any any type of address I mean I just was asking what transparency meant and thought that it did mean that you were identifying some of the wallets or something like that but yeah how granular it gets would would be I guess up to you but actually sue one other thing I wanted to ask was so you're sending them Bitcoin directly are you always certain that there are crypto exchanges in those places so that those recipients can cash out or do you help them cash out or you know what what do they do when they receive the Bitcoin because I imagine some of them are working in places where they're maybe aren't really good on and off ramps to the crypto world right yeah that's definitely been our biggest challenges is the lack of ecosystem globally especially in the areas that we want to do work and that NGOs are doing work but yeah we do work directly with them so so far we've had a small select number of pilots so we've worked you know really closely with the NGOs and the projects and we help them identify good projects and locations that we think there's some liquidity we hope there is an ecosystem on the ground they can use it we've come up against a lot of challenges even where we originally knew there was a functioning ecosystem because of regulatory issues and all kinds of issues like the constantly evolving ecosystem especially when you operate globally but yeah that's that's the idea and with the new version there's a lot more liquidity built into the platform itself because we understand the limitations a lot better now and so the expectation is that you know at least currently there are fewer opportunities to use it on the ground or even convert it so we've built in integration with uphold and they the donors can use that for a variety of different currencies in both fiat and crypto to make a contribution but the nonprofit's can also go through uphold as well and offers a lot of different ways of converting it but we're encouraging you know the whole point of the platform is that we're encouraging them to keep it in Bitcoin move it on the blockchain for that transparency for the benefit of faster cheaper more secure transactions to get the money there on the ground so the platform is built to encourage that behavior and be ready for it when the ecosystem catches up to our vision but yeah it's very limiting I mean the the ecosystem is extremely limited especially in in developing economies and in remote areas and so you just mentioned the your partnership with uphold but you only work with Bitcoin so does that mean that you'll eventually plan to add other crypto assets or what why do you guys only work with Bitcoin well so right now yeah we work with Bitcoin and we only have an MVP so we had a really small budget to build that and it was way too complicated to involve anything else but the new version that we're about to launch does integrate with uphold so it opens up a lot of possibilities it was just something that took us a long time and required resources in order to build and integrate and deal with all the legal restrictions around money transmitting licensing and money service business stuff and which is probably boring stuff that you don't want to talk about but it would took us a long time to to figure that out but yeah so it'll open up that opportunity so the new platform is not live yet but will offer integration through uphold for multiple Fiat and multiple cryptocurrencies okay I actually do you want to ask about the regulatory stuff but not just yet let's turn to Joe to find out so Joe why don't you describe what give crypto does yeah so our mission is to financially empower people by distributing cryptocurrency globally that's kind of a big goal what that means in the short term and using normal words is we give cryptocurrency directly to people in need now that said that's kind of a weird thing to do if you have the least bit of cynicism and you should your first question should be why are you giving crypto to poor people just give them cash if you really want to help them out and I I agree with that that's my guess yeah yeah well I'm glad I yeah god I anticipated it for you so I share that cynicism if the recipient is in a place with a functional financial system or a somewhat competent government but if one or both of those isn't true it could be argued that that crypto might be more helpful than then Fiat and some examples of broken money would be hyperinflation some examples of broken government of which there are many we're specifically focusing on stateless citizens refugees so most of our work right now revolves around testing that hypothesis can people in these situations actually make use of cryptocurrency and and basically what we're doing is sprinkling crypto into a number of different situations and and then kind of seeing what happens and I know you kind of did that for your work trial to get this role can you describe what you did there and yeah yeah um well that would that was very very early stage and rather crude I must say but yet the so I I while I was interviewing for this job I don't think they quite knew what to do with me because this is the day being Bryan Armstrong and some of some of the some of the other people who are who were hiring for this role so they gave me $1,000 in aetherium and said go give this to some people in need and report back to us in a few days and as I mentioned previously that that was a really hopefully helpful experience or exercise for them to see if I'm worth a damn but it was I think almost more helpful for me to see what this what this is really like and and and how much impact you can really have distributing funds in this way and we did things like giving some money to some restaurants in Venezuela and asked them to convert it into to cost effectively converted into a number of meals and help people in their neighboring community who probably wouldn't be able to afford to eat at their restaurants we gave it to a gentleman in a who works in a refugee camp in Rwanda and had him distribute some food to the refugees so it was a very much scatter or shotgun approach but but was what was it was really inspiring work and we've continued to do similar sorts of exercises but hopefully more deliberate more organized and and and ultimately more more educational from our end and just out of curiosity in the beginning when you were describing how give crypto works it sounded like you were looking for applications where the actual money itself was going to be what the the people that you were serving needed but just now for the work child the examples you gave were ones where you were giving money and expecting people to get food instead so is that kind of how you're approaching it now like we're here it's almost like earmarking funds exactly yeah yeah it's a good good observation yeah now we're being a little more disciplined about making sure that the or maximizing the likelihood that the the ultimate recipient is receiving crypto in their pockets not some in-kind donation so we're testing a number of vectors in terms of the technical sophistication of the recipient the size frequency and duration of the transfers or donations the macroeconomic situation of the recipients and there are a whole number of other vectors to test but yeah yeah we're we're trying not to do the first thing which arguably is a lot easier to ask somebody to convert some crypto into into some either Fiat or some some good and then transfer it it's it's it's more challenging to give people crypto directly but that's we think that's where the real opportunity lies yeah well can you talk a little bit more about how you're figuring out what those applications could be because so as you mentioned the goals of give crypto are to help people in need but also promote the adoption of cryptocurrency so sometimes those things will be aligned and then other times maybe they won't be so how do you kind of figure out but like what are some examples that you think are kind of prime examples of one that makes sense yeah yeah I mean it and and because we are using crypto to help people we're obviously not gonna be helped be able to help everybody there's sort of a sad irony in this that the the needier you are right now at least the less likely you are to be able to actually use crypto so so we are having to to focus our efforts on on areas where there is some degree of technical sophistication but also some some degree of impetus or or need for an alternative financial product let's say so like I said our hypothesis right now and we're probably were probably gonna involve this as we as we continue experiment by our hypothesis that people have the like highest likelihood of using crypto as a currency a utility phase in places where either money is broken or government is broken so we're focusing on those on those places specifically on on groups that that have a higher likelihood of actually being able to use crypto but also are in genuine need of help and then are there any like those populations that you describe tend to be quite vulnerable you know refugees stateless people and in a way at least for now when give crypto is in its early days you're kind of almost like running financial experiments are there ethical issues around that and if so how do you figure those out yeah for sure their ethical issues and we're probably you know still figuring out what what the best way to grapple with us now we have were definitely not working in the most fragile of places where there are serious privacy socio-political risks at play while we're in this experimentation phase where we're focusing on areas where the ethical risks are perhaps a little bit lower but that's certainly something that we're figuring out right now and and and will continue to evolve our thinking on and we've been talking a little bit about how because it is such an early days in crypto and especially the populations that you guys are targeting are particularly in areas where maybe there isn't an easy way to turn crypto into fiat or to use their crypto so if you could walk me through some of the examples that you feel like were actually effective that you know got into this sweet spot where you had a population that could benefit from crypto currency in particular and yet at the same time they could also turn that into something you know that would be useful in in their economy can you just walk me through what you think some of the best examples are yeah there's one great example just over the border from Venezuela and Brazil we found a minister of church who who was willing to help us out he's been because he's so close to the Venezuelan border he's been helping economic refugees from Venezuela for years now and and we asked him do a couple of things for us first target 20 families that were in most need in his commuted 20 Venezuelan families near his church so he helped us with that but he also set up a little bodega in his church where where we were he targeted the 20 families we gave them a basic income of one dollar per day per family he also set up a store where inside of his church I believe it or not where these families could go and buy food and basic supplies but not just spend their crypto if they prefer to get cash local cash realities in Brazil he would give them cash as well or instead of selling them food so it's a it's small it's contrived but it is a closed-loop experiment where these these these families are able to receive crypto and then either get cash or get get food for the crypto and a couple of interesting things have happened one we've we've learned that these families are for the most part taking this food and bring it back to Venezuela to the town they're from in Venezuela so the next phase of the experiment is to do some remittance / ambassador program where these families help us identify more families in Venezuela that will will add to the program additionally some of these initial families have said you know the the minister is great he really helps us out but he's selling us Brazilian food ah we want to buy Venezuelan food if you give me a little bit of money I can set up my own bodega and sell Venezuelan food to my to my country people so so we're seeing already at a very early stage very pulmonary were already seeing some kind of you know entrepreneurial initiative and and some organic marketplace thriving up that that that we think is super interesting and you know and something like that where where people are sort of helping themselves in a distributed manner is is probably part of the longer-term story of give crypto oh well this is really really interesting I like it it's almost yeah it's like it's like creating your own little what did they call it an economic development zone or something anyway say we're gonna keep discussing some of the other problems that a charitable giving with crypto can solve but first I'd like to take a quick break for our fabulous sponsors face it regulations can stall or kill a fast-moving crypto business new F aft and EU crypto

make your donation if you want your crypto donations to go farther go to We Trust Co slash Unchained and donate through November 27th I'm speaking with Konig Olympia of bit give and Jo Waltman of give crypto so yeah so let's talk a big picture what are the problem or what what is the problem or problems in charitable giving that crypto can help solve so the things that we try to focus on there's actually a lot of benefits so sometimes our message is hard to deliver but what we try to focus on is not the fundraising piece because that seems to be what gets you know the the surface level excitement and almost like a gateway but it doesn't really leverage the technology right as much so we try to focus on some of the next steps the obvious things we can talk to them about which is well if you're if you're gonna fundraise in Bitcoin why not keep it in Bitcoin or crypto in order to then use the blockchain and the ecosystem that's that's been built to move that money which just happens faster it's more secure and it's transparent on a blockchain which you know it's also less expensive with some people will argue with me about that one time when the fees were high for a few months right but we're ten years into at least Bitcoin and that was an anomaly period and I we used Bitcoin every day and it's fractions pennies to send money globally almost instantly so there's a lot of money saved as well so I think those are really great arguments especially on the fees and the speed the security issue is definitely there but for NGOs it's less understandable or less immediately exciting to them but as soon as we get into with them you know the benefits of a cryptography and the benefits of things like moe - signature technology then they start to understand the benefits of that as well and then of course the transparency aspects I think are huge I mean as we've discussed there are some challenges with it right now because the ecosystem isn't really built out but the potential is there the technology provides that opportunity and once we're able to build out the infrastructure in the ecosystem to catch up to the potential of this technology the benefit is there to be able to see in real time money moving all over the world where it's going and what it's being used for and to me that's revolutionary so I'll stop there because like I said it's a lot so sometimes it's hard to to get it all across and do you have stats on the fees that charities pay for doing things like cross-border payments or transfers and also for the speed issue I don't know if there are stats around how long it takes to get funds to those in need after a disaster you know because I imagine that the comparison with Kryptos can be pretty pretty stark for both of those on both of those fronts yeah yeah well so we have I mean I don't know if you call it stats because they kind of wide range as far as different ways of working in the world places systems services all of those things but generally what we say is like we we know that fees when you use the traditional systems right now can be up to 30% which is huge when you talk about paying fees on either side just for the banking receiving and sending there's usually some sort of transfer fee in the middle you may end up you know going to something like a Western Union where they alone can charge 1213 percent and you physically have to go to a Western Union location and stand in line and wait to get your money and in some cases it gets stuck in a bank account there's a lot of governments around the world that have their you know their fingers and everything so even though it appears as though the money is in a bank account that belongs to the NGO in you know wherever Nairobi or something they may have to you know give somebody a little bit to get it out of the bank account right so there's a lot of things I mean I don't mean like a you know a legit banking fee I mean like you know someone's bribing them and saying give me a little bit and then you can get your money kind of thing so there's all kinds of stuff that goes on and we've heard wait times could be up to a month's as well I think that's pretty extreme but it depends on you know where you're sending the money what kind of regulations and government constraints are placed in that area but it could it could take up to a month just physically get the money and so yeah I think you know obviously there's places where the fees and the times may be less than that but those are I think the extreme the extreme scale and earlier you kind of were outlining the difference in the usage of blockchain technology applied here versus the crypto assets themselves so why don't we break it out a little bit further so what are the ways that you think blockchain technology can help solve the problems in charitable giving and then what are the ways that crypto assets in particular can we used to solve those issues or different issues in charitable giving that's a good question I mean I think in most cases they go hand in hand in this context I mean there are lots of other contexts where people are experimenting with use cases of blockchain technology that may not necessarily require a you know financial value or cryptocurrency attached to the blockchain but I think in philanthropy and we've mostly stuck with Bitcoin it's it all kind of goes together so it's the infrastructure itself of the blockchain provides this you know different system outside of banks and government where and many cases there can be fees delays fraud whatever it takes it takes it outside of all of that it provides speed of transmission of funds lower fees cryptographic security to convert or to transfer excuse me so all of those things are I guess separate from crypto but it's really what are you what are you transferring on the blockchain you're transferring that value right so it kind of goes hand-in-hand I think as far as cryptocurrency itself is concerned again to me it's all tied to the whole system because if you want to have a way to empower people and reach them directly peer-to-peer in a way that they have control over their funds or whatever it is you're giving them that's of value you still need the blockchain ecosystem to provide that and Joe our take of it on it is that if you if you abstract out to a certain level charities basically do three things they do targeting deciding who gets the help they do distribution delivering the help and they do tracking determining if the help helped unfortunately most current charities do these things in a rather centralized manner by privileged Ivy Leaguers of Liberal Arts degrees what if we could create a platform that pushes as much of this work the targeting the distribution the tracking out to the edge where there's the local knowledge where there's the creativity there's the true desire to help that that's a very interesting platform if you will to build and you can you can incorporate some blockchain primitives using things like staking like compensation like incentives to we believe to do these things much more effectively at a local level in the communities where the help us actually need it and how do you measure the impact that you have because I imagine that a lot of as even for actually for both of your organizations because bit give is working with pretty different organizations and then give crypto obviously doing different experiments now and at some point well you know just have different initiatives how do you kind of do an apples-to-apples comparison to figure out where you're getting the most bang for your buck yeah I'd love that you're Connie's answer but but measurement is super difficult and and you know there's some there's some really great charities all doing a lot of work around this for example give directly where where they're even going to the length of taking saliva swabs of the recipients of their of their basic income to measure cortisone levels because that's apparently a marker of stress so the in our the way we're thinking about this is what are the things that we can measure at scale with software and one of the things that we can measure with boots on the ground ie the saliva swabs we'd obviously prefer to do the ones that that are scalable measured with software but we're certainly going to want to do both and and what's what's kind of the right ratio and maybe if we find a a statistically significant subset of people were helping and doing the more hands-on labor intensive measurement that's that that's that's an okay approach and when you say like measured by software I'm assuming like you would still need to figure out which metrics to track which again I feel like might be apples to oranges between projects right for sure for sure there are going to be different goals of different projects this is this is a very big question and a very big subject that were I don't have a a great answer on right now because we're still experimenting how we're gonna help experiment with how we're gonna help so yeah that absolutely hopefully you've got the the types of projects constrained to a number of sets and and you understand okay for for type a these are the metrics we care about for type B these other metrics we care about and Connie how are you guys handling that epic of so we I was mentioning earlier through the gift rack platform we have another component that's about reporting so right now the way you know nonprofits typically work is you give them some money you might think it's going to something in particular and then you know at the end of the year you get an annual report that tells you all the things they did as an organization throughout the year you don't really know what happened in between right and you're also waiting a long time to to get that report so with give track it's all in real-time and that's the benefit of using crypto and blockchain technology so we have the ability for NGOs to be more transparent and accountable through the through the platform with the tracking of funds and but also their reporting so they can report back in in milestones so as a donor and also the public you're seeing impact in progress as they go so you upfront you know what their fundraising for whatever the project is and they explain to you what they're gonna do with the money and then you're able to see them making progress towards that along the way and then in the end what's completed so you have to sort of feedback loops one is the blockchain data and the finance data the other is this reporting pictures videos that kind of thing but as far as being standardized like you're saying with metrics and things it is really challenging because if you want to be open to a number of different types of organizations with a variety of missions and projects and places that they work in the world there's you know an exponential amount of metrics you could try to to follow so we're right now we're trying to be pretty flexible about that and we're asking them to share what the impact was in in some more standardized ways like number of people impacted or if it's you know education how many how many more kids were in the classroom from how many more hours or if it's a water project you know how many people are served by that project those kinds of things there's also health impacts environmental impacts I mean it's very difficult to standardize metrics for those things yeah one other thing I wanted to ask you guys about is you guys have different approaches in offer it seems bit give is focused on supporting existing projects and then give crypto is focused on creating projects what are the pros and cons of each of these strategies and why did you decide on the one that you're going with so my background we talked about earlier is in the nonprofit sector so I've worked with a lot of NGOs doing a lot of amazing work and you know I think many people look at the nonprofit sector and they see these headlines like what happened in Haiti or you know there's a number of stories around what happened to the money and it it really negatively affects the the sector overall and most organizations most people in those organizations are doing good work and it's their livelihood to to give back right you know nobody most people don't make a whole lot of money working for an NGO so my goal was to support the existing organizations that are out there and the professionals that work for them and the knowledge base that has been built in that sector around the work they do because like I was just saying there's so many different causes and missions and environmental work and Public Health work in education and refugees and and humanitarian aid and relief efforts I mean you name it and people are specialized and knowledgeable and experienced in these things doing good work so my goal is to support them lift them up find ways to leverage technology to make them more effective make them more efficient provide tools for accountability that raises the whole sector raises the bar for the whole sector and ultimately drives more impact in the end through improving efficiencies and improving standards of accountability and those kinds of things Joe yeah yeah our philosophy is definitely a little bit different were first of all we're very much aligned with the the direct cash transfer belief around around helping that that cash doesn't solve every problem but for the most part people in need know what they need and they're going to do good things if you just give them money and let them do it so we're so with that with that understood our obvious asset is is aren't the cryptocurrency we have and and the software development expertise that that were we have and we're building so our belief is that you can or that that one of the key features of blockchain in general and cryptocurrency specifically is that it is very fast and and very cheap and very easy to get resources directly into people's hands if we were to or and we feel that somewhat defeats the purpose of cryptocurrency to to just transfer it to other organizations who more likely than not will just turn into fiat as quickly as they possibly can because they're terrified of the volatility and then funnel it through their normal pl which which may or may not be efficient so we're building a platform that will hopefully allow people to both donate and and receive this the this new kind of money that we think is especially well suited towards this towards this purpose and so let's talk a little bit about the history of charitable giving and crypto so far I feel like the most high-profile effort was the pineapple fund in which an individual who was early in Bitcoin decided earlier this year to donate a little more than five thousand bitcoins which it probably has to do with the way the prices were gyrating earlier this year but I've seen some accounts say it was eighty-six million dollars and on its own website the pineapple fund says it was fifty five million there has been actually a sponsor of my show that has been advertising recently we trust and they have a new charitable offering but when I checked it very little had been donated even though in ads that they're running they're saying that they're matching all the donations through givingtuesday finance charity foundation also just announced that it was getting started and this isn't exactly charity but the UN World Food Program did have a trial using an ethereal a private ethereum blockchain to distribute funds in a refugee camp in Jordan the man in charge of that program actually was on my other podcast unconfirmed so I will link to that in the show notes it was a really great episode but overall what do you guys think do you think the crypto community is doing enough you know are there important at first I miss like what what do you think it says that in this space where there is money sort of being created out of thin air and everyone has all these has pretty idealistic visions about how crypto can democratize finance like what do you think of these efforts and whether or not there could be more that's being done yeah clearly there can be more that can be done and I've I don't know if I totally agree with this theory but I've heard a friend of mine once once said the reason why the crypto community has has largely ignored the nonprofit space is because nonprofits are so terrified of cryptocurrency that they'll like I said before that they will convert it to fiat as soon as they possibly can and and from a kind of true believer true crypto believer perspective these these nonprofits are losing out on so much upside if they convert it to fiat so what idea that this this friend had was why don't we set up a vehicle where crypto owners could put currency can donate to to nonprofits but the the nonprofits can only convert X percent of it per year so that the the true upside can be realized or that the the hopeful upside can be realized when what appreciation does ultimately happen but yeah I agree that there there are kind of embarrassingly few examples of big crypto project or big charitable projects in the crypto space Connie what do you make of that theory because you have dealt directly with a lot of these nonprofits is that true that they're scared of cryptocurrency in some cases yeah yeah they so we've don't we're dealing with many of them right and I think that that's our role is it's all about education exposure demonstrating the benefits and the potential getting them excited about it and working with the ones who are willing to work with it and excited about it and there's you know I mentioned earlier like I call it the Gateway is the fundraising aspect and you know they they only really get as a as a sector overall they only get really excited about that side of it when there's something like the pineapple Sun going on and that was largely driven by price right so just like everyone else they're you know kind of excited about the value and what it might mean to them which you can't blame them when everyone else is focused on that too but I think there are a lot of NGOs that are excited about the technology itself and largely it's the ones that you know are working globally they're moving money you know from the developed world to the developing economies they're trying to get funds to the most remote areas they understand you know how much time it's taking and how much money it cost in many cases it's you know it's it's dangerous right like if you have someone going to the closest urbanized area to Western Union who works for your NGO to get money and then distribute it to these more remote areas they're a target right I mean everyone gets to know who these people are in these communities and it's not very safe for them to be carrying all this cash around so I mean there's a lot of benefits to the tech itself that I think NGOs do see but it really just depends on who you're talking to what you know what they see in the technology a lot of them the really big organizations are just very conservative and very risk-averse you know similar to like the banks and stuff right like they're looking at this stuff and they have teams that are quote-unquote researching it and whatever but there are these huge institutions that have very conservative outlooks and so even if they are doing projects that's like an RD on a private blockchain right like so I mean it's I think overall in general we have a mainstream adoption challenge for the technology and you know certain parts of NGO sector fall into that same you know in category of conservativism and focused on the price and all that but it's not everyone and and our focus is working like I said on on leveraging the technology itself and working with NGOs who are excited about that and how to demonstrate that and there is one project that was recently announced a 125 million dollar airdrop by blockchain comm and ripple where they're dropping stellar which is probably the biggest one today oh yeah and I didn't yeah I didn't respond to that piece of the question about you know the industry itself and and philanthropic efforts Hague I could say that you know since I've been around since 2013 when the industry just started to blossom you know it wasn't even really an industry it was budding community and we've been going at this for over five years now we definitely have a strong base of support and there is a contingency that you know really wants to see what we're working on happen and become a reality there's a core base that really been you know sees the benefits of the tech itself and wants to demonstrate the benefits of the TAC and they're not you know so focused on you know day trading and exchanges and you know the developed world's focus on basically speculation there they're actually believers in the tech itself they see us as one of the very few organizations that's demonstrating that and pushing the envelope and not just you know feeding the the masses with whatever they are interested in that doesn't benefit from the technology really but I could say that yeah I mean there could be so much more going on in the industry and support for our efforts for give crypto for everybody's efforts who are working on these things it could be much more broadly I think supported from the industry than it currently is and like give crypto and we and I'm sure others have set up structures for that right like we are we're a 501c3 we've been no 501c3 since 2014 to offer the tax benefits to people for off setting capital gains I mean even if they don't need a chair just wind out what just walk through what that means so people understand so it's so a 501c3 is a nonprofit registered in the US every country kind of has their own process but we're here so and it gives us tax-exempt status it provides a lot of different benefits on both sides though so for us it's pretty simple any sort of capital gains or revenue that we bring in is tax tax-free unless we provide some sort of business service and that's a different category of revenue but donations where you're not receiving anything in return are tax-free we focus on taking in Bitcoin or and or holding in bitcoins so any gains we have on our side or any capital gains are all tax-free as well right so that's for us for the donor it offers a tax write-off like they would give to any other charity that's registered but what's interesting is when you have something like crypto that's considered a property and you have gains on that property you can offset those gains and not pay taxes on those gains by donating in crypto right so you don't want to convert it first it doesn't really benefit you as a donor right because you'll pay fifteen or twenty percent or whatever on that right right but I feel a lot of people don't quite understand this and then they got especially last year they got stuck because the price skyrocketed at the last minute the end of the tax year nobody knew what's due and then they ended up with these huge tax bills because you have to make the contribution before the end of the tax year it has to be made during that tax year so you can't wait until April when you're figuring it out and go oh my god I owe two million dollars you know in taxes because I got in crypto early it's too late at that point to offset it but that's to me that's the beauty really is if you have crypto assets that have gains you can donate in crypto and offset those gains we have worked with Libre tax for a long time and they had I don't know if they still do this but in early days they had a really interesting way of helping the crypto asset owner identify the oldest coins with the most gains to donate right so when they're donated the face value is what the charity receives but when the donor chooses their oldest coins with the most gains they offset the maximum amount right so there's a lot of really beautiful things about about just that one topic around this you know yeah so I actually now on the flip side wanted to ask you about what you mentioned before about the regulatory burden for charities working with crypto what are those burdens ah well they're not necessarily related to being a charity so well there's there are some around the accounting aspects which we because we got in so early nobody knew how to handle it so we spent a lot of time kind of you know pioneering and paving the path for like how do we even deal with this in our accounting in our taxes and dealing with the IRS but what I was referring to earlier was actually more around money transmitting licensing and money services business issues so you know we are a non-profit and I don't think you know it's ethically a good a good angle for us to start spending all of the money we've received from donors to get licensed in every state and in every country to be a money transmitter and unfortunately that creates a lot of problems for us when we're trying to facilitate you know funding between donors and nonprofits so we've had to very carefully craft our platform in a way where we're providing a platform we're providing the service and we're facilitating the interaction between donors and nonprofits but bit give never actually touches owns holds transfers or converts any of the money ourselves and you can imagine that's pretty challenging to do so yeah there's another challenge that we're facing looks like good good oh yeah well for both of you why don't you Joe go ahead and you can discard that a little bit further because that's interesting yeah are that the wrinkles we have to iron out are mostly around kyo all these fun acronyms KY caml and OFAC KY so you know your customer ml NT money-laundering OFAC Office of Foreign Assets Control because we're giving money directly to human beings not through some other organization that presumably has some some legitimate status and it's doing some betting on there and we have to do a lot of that ourselves basically means we we don't want to make sure we don't give any money to any bad people as determined mostly by the US government so they're there this that definitely is a is this a non-trivial endeavor and we're right now having a lot of fun conversation with lawyers around how we can minimize the likelihood that that any of our funds end up in the hands of naughty people yeah there's probably a lot more we could dive into there but we're running out of time so I wanted to ask you about something I had brought up earlier about how there's been a lot of talk in the space about how crypto kanter monetize finance and there's just a lot of idealistic visions that are thrown around when people talk about what this technology could bring about in terms of change and good in the world but I sort of feel like a lot of these initiatives are kind of going the way things have always gone where there's the industry doing what it's doing in its you know capitalist world which it's not like I'm against capitalism or anything I'm definitely not but but then charitable giving is sort of like this separate sphere and sometimes it's an afterthought the way that givingtuesday is like the last in the string of these holidays that that are all about like shopping and and being materialistic so they're just gonna garius how do you think the crypto industry can actually live up to this rhetoric that it's been spouting for a long time like what changes do you think need to be made to really get to the to this vision that a lot of the founders in this space are espousing hmm well this is my biggest issue I can say because you know I keep referring back to the infrastructure in the ecosystem and where we're coming up against challenges and that's where I feel it's significantly lacking is all of the interest is in the first world and in you know trading and exchanges and if we want to see the beauty of what everyone talks about this what this technology can actually do we have to build out a global ecosystem so you know what I'm trying to do and what Joe is trying to do is so challenging when there's nowhere that people can use this on the ground or convert it even right so what I always refer to as bit pizza I love them they are so amazing and I feel like they need to be there needs to be bit pisses everywhere you know it doesn't have by the way Elizabeth the the founder and CEO of the pay's she was actually my first guest ever uh nun chained it's an episode for people who missed it I've had people saying you need to bring her back because she was so amazing but she was some people I'll link to that in the show notes it was a great episode they are amazing and like they were at the forefront of exactly what I'm talking about building into essentially like the mobile cache system in Kenya right so if that was still working which it's kind of now a b2b model because of the regulatory issues they came up against and you have to spend like you have to be converting like it's like twenty five thousand dollars you through them right but they've now expanded to like seven other countries because they're like well if Kenya is not going to embrace this we're gonna move on but the concept is there and if there weren't regulatory issues it would be amazing you know you can essentially plug into a system like m-pesa that's cash on the ground that they're used to using that already has infrastructure I was like when I was there I used it for everything I paid for my lodging taxis food you name it I'm from m-pesa you know but there's regulatory issues stepping in out of you know fear of the quote-unquote but I think it's about you know their concern that the power and the influence is being taken away that you know get in the way but that doesn't mean that it's not possible right we have to somehow baits break through these things so I'm going on and on because I'm very passionate about this but to answer your question I think if we could have some more investment in businesses and concepts like bit paisa everywhere in the world where we can have plugins to cash cash based system mobile based systems conversion on the ground ultimately we want to get to the point where we're using crypto without having to convert it but I don't see us getting there anytime soon so we need that middle ground of building out an ecosystem for it to work and Joe what do you think how do we get to this idealistic vision yeah the short answer is I don't know I i waver between trying to be broad and narrow and do a bunch of experiments in a bunch of different places that have very different characteristics versus being very very broad and narrow is that the right anyhow doing a little bit of stuff everywhere or doing a whole bunch of stuff in just one place and one example one place that that is just you know heartbreakingly perfect for crypto is is Venezuela right now they're just they're going through a situation that you know hasn't really been seen since like you know world wars or great depressions in terms of their their inflation and the misery that's happening so you know what why I often times ask myself why are we doing anything anywhere but Venezuela right now and you know how can that be how could that be justified so yeah I the short answer is I don't know we're doing a lot of experimentation a lot of getting our hands dirty giving crypto to people see what they can and can't do with it and then hopefully learning from that and improving the way work we're doing what we're doing well we'll see how it all turns out I commend you guys for your efforts where can people learn more about you and
