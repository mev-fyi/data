description [Music] today's guest is Maria Shen partner at Electric Capital welcome Maria thanks for having me it's great to be here Electric Capital recently published its annual developer report before we dive into all the findings just give us a quick reminder of how you're defining your terms such as developer activity and the various metrics that you are measuring versus what you're not yeah I think the biggest caveat that we want everyone to take away from is that this is going to be an under counting of developers we put a lot of work and thought into County open source developers but there's a lot of people working in closed source so who works in closed source coinbase is closed source openc is closed Source magic Eden is closed Source Alchemy is closed Source some of the biggest companies in crypto are closed source so this report shows us two things one is it looks at trend lines in terms of how developers are trending also I think it's important to understand the health of Open Source in crypto because crypto is unique in that Bitcoin launched as open source code ethereum is open source some of the most important projects are open source it's a very very key part of the crypto DNA and so understanding and evaluating the health of of that core part of crypto's DNA is is really important so to Define some of the terms in order to to find a developer we actually start from the commit code commit level code commit is when a developer creates a code update within that code updates we get information like the files that they change the lines of code that they changed the types of programming language that they used the time at which they changed it and we coalesce a lot of this information to like fingerprint every single code commit within our internal databases we have 250 million code commits and so for any new code commit that comes in we actually compare it to previous ones and for this report we only look at original code so that means that that if the code is forked if it's copy pasted it will not count towards a developer this is not malicious by the way like code is forked all the time that is not a bad thing but simply for for ourselves and and being able to understand the actual number of new open source developers or active open source developers it's really important to actually sanitize the code in this way and so most of the numbers that we'll look at include monthly active developers a monthly active developers any developer who has committed code in a 28-day period we also do further segmentation into full-time part-time and one-time developers a full-time developer is anyone who's committed code 10 or more days in a 28-day period part-time is two to nine days and one time is going to be actually a very strict definition which is you only committed code once in a three month period all right so now let's talk about this report because obviously 2022 was quite possibly the worst year in crypto history at least when it comes to the industry's reputation yes so I'm super interested to hear what the results were from this past year especially because you know like I said reputation is one thing but developer interest is another so what would you say are the top takeaways from the 2022 report yeah I mean this points to why we look at developers as a measure in the first place developers are a fundamental measure of the health of an emerging industry more so than prices prices fluctuate and they're very very prone to change developers tell us how many people are actually building how many people are are pushing new code how many people are creating protocols and useful things Dev tools to bring in more developers applications to bring in more users and so that's why that developer number is really important and of course like one of the really interesting things we've seen is that year over year developers actually increased so prices fell 70 from Peak this time around in 2022 developers increased five percent year over year and that's very consistent with our findings in the past fair market as well and the 2017-2018 cycle after prices peaked in January of 2018 prices fell 90 more than 90 percent as I'm sure a lot of people painfully remember um but developers stayed flat which is incredible right what that means is that prices fell but developers are sticky and so that means that we're actually able to grow developers really significantly over time prices today are back at where they were roughly in January 2018 levels but developers have increased by 297 percent so that's the kind of retention and growth that we're seeing when developers stick around like they do in crypto yeah one thing also that struck me is when I was looking at the kind of like line graph of the growth and the number of developers when you look at 2021 in the first half of 2022 it just was growing at this especially fast rate and I was curious if you could talk about that 18-month span like if you know what you think caused that or just anything else about it like it really stands out in the chart yeah yeah one of the things I find really fascinating is this what you're alluding to which is the speed of growth crypto grew very slowly in the beginning it took us close to seven years to get to 1 000 monthly active developers so from from the first time that Satoshi open source Bitcoin code to when ethereum launched we had a thousand open source developers in the next seven years we actually added 22 000 more monthly active developers and so these are kind of Step function differences and so that's one of the things that we definitely saw in the 2021-2022 period a record number of new developers joined crypto between 2021 and 2022 109 000 more than 109 000 new developers committed code to open source crypto so again like this is an under counting right this is not counting the new coinbase employees or or new Alchemy or magic Eden employees versus 2017 to 2018 44 000 new developers so we had a massive influx of new developers in that 2021 to 2022 period which is where you see that that chart kind of going vertical for developers and we also can see a lot of ecosystems grew significantly since 2018 Bitcoin grew 3x so Bitcoin is 3x bigger than it was in 2018 ethereum is 5X bigger a lot of the ecosystems that we kind of talk about as um as really big players today that have more than a thousand total developers so this would include like polygon Cosmos polka dot um these ecosystems barely existed in 2018. they had fewer than 200 total developers monthly active total developers um so there's really been a kind of a tremendous shift since that 2018 period so let's now of course talk about the second half of 2022 which obviously for various reasons looks quite a bit different talk a little bit about how you believe the crypto bankruptcies have affected either developer interest or at the very least developer activity and I was just kind of curious if you think some of those declines that you noted were attributed directly to things like job layoffs or if it was really more a reflection of just sort of like natural um you know a natural decline rather than sort of a direct forcing I think there's kind of two things we can look at here one is um just all up developer numbers and then we can actually go into a Terra anecdote so for all up developer numbers we had a peak of all-time highs so this is a historical high for monthly active developers in crypto that happened June of 2022. that Peak had 26 323 developers since that Peak we have fallen 11 percent one of the core things we tried to understand is who left right when developers Fall by 11 what happened so the segmentation that we did was through the frequency of commits we want to understand you know not developers not all developers are contributing code at an equal rate some to contribute more code than others it turns out that what we Define as full-time developers so developers who are active for 10 or 10 or more days on a 28 day period they contribute 76 of the code so they're a really important metric to track for the for the actual health because they're the ones building the core protocols keeping the lights on moving things forward in a very fundamental way full-time developers only accounted for five percent of the churn which means that 95 percent of the developers who left were part-time and one time and I think that intuitively makes sense right who's a part-time developer they are the hackathon participants they're the ones hacking on something in a weekend playing around tinkering one-time Developers are the ones who maybe made a documentation change maybe they added their validator profile and those are the types of people that we are seeing leaving in in these types of market conditions but I think the most important sign of health is are those full-time developers staying and I think by looking at the fact that only five percent of the developers return were full-time that gives us a lot of confidence that the people who are writing 76 of the code is is continuing to write code all right so before we hop into the

the decline of developer activity in the second half of 2022 was the collapse of Terra Luna and you said you had some interesting data around that in terms of developers yeah absolutely we going into this year one of the things we definitely wanted to analyze was what happened to Tara and where did Terra developers go what happened after the collapse um and so from the time that Tara launched uh to um when their Network halted in May of 2022 um Tara got up to 175 total developers so actually not a huge not a huge ecosystem but that growth is very fast right I think these decentralized networks take a very long time to to come together and and to and to really like kind of hit a critical mass and so um Tara actually grew developers incredibly quickly and they had 175 very healthy monthly active developers at the time when their Network halted um after their Network halted they had seven days of kind of you know deliberations around what to do and then um after seven days uh Tara to um created its first commit so Tara two then emerged as the successor to Tara um since then we see that Tara has 67 monthly active developers they have seven full-time developers and so you know I think a lot of people think oh maybe Tara doesn't have developers anymore there's there actually are continue to be people building on Terra too but obviously that is a a tremendous decrease from where they were before uh their Network halted um so one of the things that we did look at is okay let's look at the developers who are there before Network Halt and then after Network halt where you know how do we account for this Delta so over the first half of 2022 323 developers committed code to open source Terra repositories and of those 56 percent seems to have stopped contributing code to open source crypto they could have left maybe they're working in closed Source at the very least we no longer can track them we don't know you know they're not contributing new code to open source crypto at all um the remainder went to other ecosystems and by far the most went into the cosmos ecosystem um a handful went to continue to work on Tara 2.0 and five developers went to Solana two developers went to near so it's really interesting to see that you know it's um a you know 56 percent seems to maybe have left or just stopped contributing to open source and the remainder continued to work and but are just now in in other ecosystems yeah I find it amazing that 56 just stopped contributing to crypto altogether that's pretty incredible so now let's obviously talk about kind of the biggest developer ecosystem ethereum has historically dominated when it comes to attracting developers but during this time period it also faced a lot of competition from other layer ones so how have you seen its ability to attract developers hold up I would say very well but you can see in the numbers that there are other trains emerging so there are first of all I think what we've noticed is this is our fourth annual report now and year after year ethereum is the biggest developer ecosystem by by a long shot so even today their developer ecosystem is 2.8 times larger than the next biggest ecosystem so they Dominate and they don't dominate just by a little bit they dominate by a lot and a lot of that has to do with um how easy it is to be a developer in ethereum you know I I think like solidity may not be the easiest working in blockchain may not be the easiest but there are amazing learning resources for anyone who wants to get started in solidity for anyone who wants to get started in evm compatible kind of ecosystems that resource is is probably the richest that we have in crypto and so we kind of see that 16 of all new developers that come into crypto start in these ethereum ecosystem so ethereum is kind of this like starter pool for anyone who's coming in and they're able to retain a lot of developers that way but one of the really interesting things we see where where you know hey it's possible that there's kind of this chipping away is actually when it comes to D5 developers during D5 summer ethereum had 70 of all D5 developers so 70 of all developers that was building anything in defy built it on ethereum and defy summer was summer of 2020. by December of 2022 ethereum no longer had the majority of defy developers they only have 50 percent and 50 are now working in other chains um including places like Cosmos BNB Solana polka dot polygon Avalanche and kusama these are the other biggest ecosystems for D5 developers and so that's where you become you begin to see kind of this multi-chain universe starting to emerge ethereum is by no means unseated but I think you see the emergence of other very healthy ecosystems by developer standards outside of of ethereum and out of curiosity how do you see ethereum's dominance playing out or the competition it faces playing out in evm compatible chains evm was a really interesting ecosystem for us to look at um I I almost think of it as kind of like a UVM Universe at this point it turns out that 37 of layer ones and twos that have more than 50 developers full-time developers revm compatible chain and so that's a pretty significant number and it speaks to the strategy that different ecosystems are taking to get developers right so there's there's tremendous benefit to being part of the evm ecosystem it means that you your ecosystem gets to access the really excellent developer resources that everyone has already created for evm and it also means that it's very easy for anyone to extend an existing application to your chain um so we the way that we measure this uh sort of like multi-chain behavior is through looking at multi-jain developers and what we call primary developers arbitrum is an excellent example where someone like GMX is counted as a primary anyone working on GMX would be a primary developer on arbitrum but uniswap also supports arbitrop there's a host of other types of applications that support arbitrone it's not exactly you know there's some work in involved to actually extend your application to that chain and so we count that as multi-chain developers versus primary Developers so if you segment developers in this way it's very clear across the biggest evm ecosystems that there is tremendous benefit that comes from being evm so polygon Avalanche B and B cello arbitram and optimism are the biggest developer ecosystems in evm and all of them across the board have more multi-chain developers than they do primary developers and their own primary developers and multi-chain developers kind of grow at different rates so if you if we go back to that arbitrum example arbitrum has uh grew 38 year-over-year which is very significant but let's remember that by absolute numbers they now this means they now have 215 monthly active developers so very healthy strong growth but but relatively you know still still kind of in that emerging state that being said they have four times more multi-chain developers so they have 839 monthly active multi-chain developers and that's a really kind of interesting dichotomy where you can look at the number of developers that's supporting Arbitron versus the number of developers that's building on arbitrum optimism very similar optimism has five times more multi-chain developers than they do primary developers and primary developers grew by 73 percent meaning that optimism now has 183 total developers while multi-chain developers fell by eight percent so we're starting to see kind of these these interesting these interesting diverse purchases come out of between multi-chain and primary developers yeah that seems like definitely an area to watch because yeah yeah their ethereum's dominance is definitely a storyline and yet the competition nipping at its heels is also a storyline so one other area that I definitely wanted to ask about was Bitcoin developers remained flat from December 2021 to December 2022. why do you think that was I would say it's because Bitcoin is a very mature ecosystem already and Bitcoin is an ecosystem that actually does not encourage a lot of change and that's by Design right they're very resilient it works it's not an ecosystem where where you're looking to shake things up or there's a very very high bar to make any sort of change and so correspondingly I think there's a difference in the types of trends that I'm looking for in Bitcoin I'm not looking for you know did Bitcoin grow by 50 I'm actually looking at did was Bitcoin able to hold on to its existing developers and and it did and I think what's really remarkable about Bitcoin is unlike almost any other ecosystem it has a very different chart if you look at the new developers that come into the space it's very resistant to Market Cycles it's almost flat at a hundred new developers every single month since November of 2017. so in a good cycle in a bad cycle it's a hundred monthly active you know it's a hundred new developers um they have over 900 monthly active and so I think that's that's what's really interesting is that it's the steadiness and the and the stability of Bitcoin which is what you would expect to see in a healthy kind of mature ecosystem like that so one I believe this is a new area of your report is you also talked about nfts and development in that what did you find there yeah we touched upon the development of nfts and and the reason we did that is because um we looked at uh the change in where we looked at what new wallets did on chain and it turns out that before 2021 new Wallets on chain did a lot of stuff on D5 right so they would swap want a decentralized exchange maybe that they would do something with stable coins they would use a lending protocol and then that completely flipped where now new wallets are actually doing more things in the nft universe than they are in the defy universe and so of course we're naturally curious about what's happening with developers there so developers grew 299 since January of 2021 year over year they are flat although year over year they're full-time developers grew 30 percent um and most of the the losses come from one time in part-time Developers said I think we actually ended on a note saying that you know we're not sure that looking at developers is the right lens for for nfts and gauging in Ft health because so much of nfts if you think about it are based on games or um ecosystems where the smart contract for creating the tokens is is a fairly minimal amount of code but the work is comes in for maintaining the community encouraging you know encouraging activity in the community having um having a very active membership and so for nfts specifically we continue to think that perhaps opens looking at open source code in nfts is not the right metric it's shown a lot of growth and so that trend line is really interesting but we think nfts unlike many other um sectors need other signals and so one of the things we've been doing internally and we want to push more publicly is what we call a community signal and so how what is the health of your Discord what is the health of people who's engaging with you on Twitter how many people are talking about you how many people are actively participating and actually doing something so we think for nft ecosystems that might actually be the right set of data to look at all right well this has been an amazing discussion and there's just so much in your report I did also want to ask if there's anything that we didn't get to touch on that you think people should know about the report yeah I would say the last part is this is the first year where we launched developerreport.com and so this is a site where you can not only explore the data from the report but also go very very deep we have actually time series on developer change across a hundred different ecosystems and projects and so that's that's a resource that we hope can be really useful for the community oh yeah I I enjoyed digging around that site um yeah that's that's where I saw some of these eye-popping charts all right Maria I have enjoyed this so much thank you for coming on Unchained thank you so much for having me don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap new FTX leadership is considering Reviving The Exchange according to the Wall Street Journal the new leader of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FDX John Ray III announced that he has established a task force to investigate possibly restarting the platform in an interview for Unchained premium two weeks ago Sunil kaveri and FTX creditor claimed most of the creditors were in favor the idea was also mentioned in an Unchained episode with Thomas Brazil and wassi lawyer Ray said everything is on the table as FTX explores the options for Reviving The Exchange this includes examining whether relaunching ftx's International Exchange could potentially provide greater recovery for customers than liquidating assets or selling the platform currently the market for bankruptcy claims on ftx's crypto deposits is not optimistic about their value data from X claim shows that FTX claims are selling for 15.5 percent of the face value of account balances however this week the FTX debtors group represented by law firm Sullivan and Cromwell revealed that it has identified 5.5 billion dollars worth of assets which includes 1.7 billion dollars of cash 3.5 billion dollars of crypto assets and 300 million dollars of Securities it is worth noting however that the firm is counting ftt ftx's exchange token as a liquid asset which is somewhat questionable moreover in order to repay creditors the company has been granted permission to sell some of its assets including its subsidiaries Ledger X embed Technologies FTX Japan and FTX Europe Sam benkman freed reiterates FTX us is solvent as SEC charges him with fraud former FTX CEO Sam bingman freed is disputing claims made by Sullivan and Cromwell that the exchange has a substantial shortfall in a post on his recently launched substack newsletter bigman freed asserted again that FTX U.S is solvent and that the numbers presented by Sullivan and Cromwell do not accurately reflect the exchange's financial status he provided an Excel spreadsheet that he created as evidence which he claims shows that customer balances Bank balances and net asset value have been understated by the litigation firm on Thursday morning the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against banquin freed for allegedly defrauding Equity investors in the platform the sec's complain alleges that SPF orchestrated a years-long fraud to conceal from ftx's investors the undisclosed diversion of customer funds to his privately held crypto hedge fund to Alameda research as well as the special treatment afforded to Alameda on FTX the complaint seeks injunctions against future Securities Law violations discouragement of vilgotten gains a civil penalty and an officer and director bar the sec's ongoing investigation is being conducted in conjunction with the U.S attorney's office and the commodity Futures Trading Commission in other FTX news a week after the new management of FTX requested all political donations to be returned quintesk reported that 196 members of the new Congress roughly one-third of the total took cash from the former FTX CEO and other senior Executives only 27 percent responded to queries about what they planned to do with the money in a Twitter thread former president of ftxus Brett Harrison claimed that bankman freed showed emotionally volatile behavior and avoided conflict ultimately leading Harrison to leave the company a coalition of major news athletes submitted a petition to the court handling the FTX case requesting the release of the identities of the individuals besides his parents who signed bankman Freed's 250 million dollar bail bond the media Outlets include the Associated Press Bloomberg the financial times CNBC Reuters Insider and the Washington Post publisher who argue that it is in the public interest to know who is financially backing bankman freed Genesis May soon file for bankruptcy major crypto lender Genesis Global Capital part of the digital currency group conglomerate is expected to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy as soon as this week according to Bloomberg source is familiar with the situation say that creditors of Genesis are currently in negotiations regarding a potential bankruptcy filing the negotiations involve a pre-packaged bankruptcy plan in which creditors agree to a forbearance period of one to two years in exchange for this agreement creditors would receive cash payments and equity in dcg Scott Johnson a finance lawyer said pre-packaged bankruptcy would almost certainly mean little to no Market impact and a very quick process about as good a resolution as one would hope for the company froze customer redemptions on November 16th following the downfall of FDX and this week it informed its shareholders that it will be suspending its quarterly dividend payments until further notice as the crisis has come to a head a lawsuit seeking class action status was filed against Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and their exchange Gemini for allegedly defrauding investors by falsely advertising unregistered securities this lawsuit comes after the SEC charged Gemini and Genesis with offering unregistered Securities last week meanwhile popping up as he is want to do in situations like this Tron CEO Justin Sun revealed in an interview with Reuters that he is open to investing up to one billion dollars in the acquisition of certain assets of dcg coindesk explores potential sale The Wall Street Journal reported that coindesk the media company owned by dcg Enlisted the help of Investment Bank lizard to explore potential options for the company including a full or partial sale in a statement CEO Kevin worth revealed that the company has received many inquiries and expressions of interest in recent months leading to the engagement with lizard and the exploration of a potential transaction silvergate reports significant losses silvergate the crypto-focused bank that has been under the spotlight for its involvement with FTX reported a net loss of one billion dollars in the fourth quarter of 2022. the dire earnings report shows the extent of the impact on the digital asset industry from the downfall of FTX which spurred silvergate customers to withdraw 8 billion dollars from the bank in Q4 the bank also said it would take an impairment charge of 196 million dollars in assets silvergate CEO Alan Lane stated that the bank was in the process of evaluating its product portfolio and customer relationships with a focus on profitability three AC Founders plan to build new exchange for crypto bankruptcy claims the former founders of the now defunct three arrows Capital Kyle Davies and suju are trying to make a comeback the duo is looking to raise 25 million dollars in seed funding for a new crypto bankruptcy claims exchange that they initially proposed be called GTX the name as per the leaked pitch deck was chosen because G comes after F though after the name was ridiculed they backtracked The Exchange aims to fill the power vacuum left by FTX and aims to dominate The Market within two to three months of going live the platform plans to offer a solution for trading claims for users who have funds stuck on FTX Celsius block fi and even Mount Cox the team estimates the claims Market size of 20 billion dollars based on FTX users caught in bankruptcy proceedings the fact that the founders of 3ac which also filed her bankruptcy are now looking to raise funds for a new venture has been met with mixed reactions with some in the crypto Community questioning the ethics of the move wintermute CEO of getting guyvoy warned that anyone investing in this new Venture would find it hard to work with his company in the future crypto markets recover post FTX losses the markets are experiencing a much needed relief rally Bitcoin is trading at around twenty one thousand dollars a price point even higher
