well I think this is an inflection point the last number of months especially in the wake of the collapse of FTX and Celsius and Genesis and riara's capital and block five and like that whole mess you know the attitude again the industry from my perspective was hey this is scary and Regulators are just cracking the enforcement whip because they don't know what else to do and you know there isn't necessarily a strong you know basis to what happens next legislation's not coming you know this industry is in trouble and today I think Mark's an inflection point where in my opinion that narrative changes and that you know the rule of law is triumphing and I think it's going to lead to legislation to actually clarify these things that were on certain
