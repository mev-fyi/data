not be a news recap however i'm happy to announce that today's guest is a really fun one marin altman astrologer and crypto trader welcome marin thank you thank you laura so marin for listeners who don't happen to know who you are already why don't you explain what it is that you do so i am an astrologer and i happen to pick up the study of the correlation between planetary alignments and earthly events at a young age and never really stopped studying that throughout my life going from studying personal astrology to preferring long-term world cycles and then finding finance when i was a philosophy student in college a few years ago and when i found finance about a year and a half ago yes i'm pretty new to this in the context of other other things but i found finance about a year and a half ago and immediately found crypto when it was the march 2020 crash i saw inefficiencies in the banking system i saw market manipulation and immediately the philosophy side of me coupled with the pattern recognition side of me that loved astrology kind of fell into crypto trading and investing so right now i am actively trading and investing in crypto markets i do use astrology as part of the fundamental analysis that i do along with technical analysis to execute trades and i share that online mostly on tick tock and why crypto as opposed to other asset classes for one it's more exciting i get bored of everything else so like if i just look at traditional stocks now it's it's i like i like percentage move like less than one percent like it's i don't know how to trade anything else to be honest i learned how to trade with crypto immediately upon trying to invest i found td ameritrade very difficulties i feel bad i mean i'm sure they're not the only one but they're the one i use in my store all the time because they're the only brokerage i've ever used so no shade to td ameritrade about you're doing your best but it was inefficient and simple google search trying to find other options found crypto it fit um it shows up in my own astrology as like a really volatile interest in finance that i did not know what that meant when i was looking as a kid at that in my chart but now i see that's how it played out so i can see myself in like no other market basically oh that's fascinating so you see in your own natal chart how crypto and finance are are kind of like an interest of yours basically yes i grew up as an actor doing like theater and film for the first 18 years of my life and i went to nyu tisch for acting then i transferred into philosophy but i always thought i'd be an actor i didn't know you could be a professional astrologer until i was like 14 15 and then it was in the back of my mind all that time is like maybe you do want to do that but i saw based on my astrology at a young age hyper focused on money and finance and especially in an area of the chart that deals with debt taxes investing like the transmission or exchange of money not just holding goods so that made no sense to me i mean i i did never think i would marry well or something along those lines like i don't know i just was very confused about how that would show up and then find crypto find bitcoin and immediately it's like oh this is why there's such an emphasis on this in your chart okay so that that you're talking about your eighth house i am i have an eighth house uh leo stellium all opposite uranus in the second house so yeah oh okay okay so listeners probably have heard me talk about how i used to be yoga instructor and yes when you are in that world you get very steeped in astrology very quickly so i i know probably a little bit more what marin is talking about maybe than the average listener so something that fascinates me is i have always wondered if there are long-term planetary transits that explain the general rise of crypto over the last 13 years and if so what are they and what do they say about the role that crypto will play in the history of civilization the major one that astrologers often point to and then i corroborate is uranus entering taurus uranus is in taurus from 2017 until about 2024 it's a seven year transit because uranus is a slow moving planet and compared to other things and uranus is a planet that was literally discovered by a guy being struck by lightning at the time so it emphasizes revolutions great innovation the breakdown or destabilization of structures in a genius or innovative way it's not like psychological crisis it's not really um it's it's more of like sudden genius and innovation is what uranus is it's rebellious and it's innovative and taurus is a fixed earth sign it corresponds to the time of year of literal spring middle of spring it is a very fertile natural resources grounded energy so when we think of the planet of revolution rebellion innovation in a tangible earth sign that deals with the sheer value of existence personally i think of agriculture in the food industry i think of property and real estate and i think the finance and currency and even before understanding crypto i knew that uranus and taurus would probably bring a lot of destabilization to supply chains and the way in which we like just transport goods and services i didn't have the words for it but that is essentially what crypto is is the decentralization of the transmission of values so that transit is until about 2024 and the high point like the really big climax of this is starting in january 2022 but the peak of the peak will be spring 2023 when the north node which is the eclipse point that represents an ambition and obsession and a lot of drive towards will be in the sign as well as will jupiter in 2023 which is a planet of growth and expansion and wisdom so frankly 2023 when uranus which is like revolution the north node which is exacerbating or ambition and jupiter which is wisdom and um adventure kind of a explorative energy when those three are all together in 2023 i see just a metaverse like maybe cyber pandemic internet of things like government i see all those things kind of this like what did we just wish for when it's like this budding asset class of tech that i see really really coming to a high point in 2023 of things that i'm i hate to say unpredictable because that is a cop-out what i do is predicting i just struggle to find the words for something that is by its nature unsubstantiated and never having happened before but something extremely extremely innovative with the supply of things in regards to like government structures and frankly with the world economic forum recent talking about cyber pandemics and how blockchain and cbdc's will likely be related to interconnectivity of crises i think that sounds a lot like what will come in 2023 along with the really awesome stuff in d5 and gaming and whatever so another thing i'm so curious about what you do is that in astrology for a person typically what uh we'll look at is what's called the natal chart which is based off of the birth tank time and place for that person right so you know the city they were born in and then the time of day on their birthday for a crypto asset how do you determine what the birth time and place is is it like when the white paper is published or is it when the person who uploaded uh the white paper where they were based in the world or like when is it when the network goes live or like how are you figuring that out yeah for bitcoin we have bitcoin to genesis block because that is the first initiation of bitcoin into the world and for any particular entity or asset it can differ depending on the way that it's launched and the nature of the project but it's the most the most initiatory or launch based event that literally allowed it to live in the world so for bitcoin that is its genesis block for some 2017 projects it's their ico date and for other things it can be as well when like literally if a company was founded and didn't have a token it's when the token was like literally created you know and i don't know how you create tokens like i said i trade these things i don't know anything about tech so generally if i'm unsure about it because it's not listed as like ico date and time here i do consult people who are developers who can go back on github and look at you know when that began but it's whatever the most initiatory event was which for bitcoin is the genesis block and for other things might be an ico can also be the white paper if that was literally the first thing out and there was going to be a token and this allowed people to start being aware of that that's what i look for and then what about because you know like i said for a person it's also where you were born on the planet do you not use location or do you use it if so how do you determine what that is if there is a location i'll use it there is a challenge of like bitcoin we don't know who exactly or where exactly they were in the world i have a utc time but that i mean the rising sign which is very relative to minutes will change drastically depending on if they're east coast west coast europe asia so we don't have a location for something like bitcoin which does play into the specificity of what we can say because there are some charts like solana's which i keep private and proprietary for now that i do have an exact date time and location because of where the developers and founders were in the world that i can be more specific um other projects like phantom for example had validators and nodes around the world go live at the same time so that also doesn't have a location so uh if we have it we use it if not you can make do just without some of the specificity okay so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about how you do what you do and then go into some projections but first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible did you know that exchanges take up to a 25 cut on your staking rewards but you

then just explain for readers what you're doing when you do give projections for what will happen to a crypto asset i like to say that t or astrology i like to say that astrology is ta for all of reality because we're looking at patterns certain alignments and certain sequences and seeing the correlation between those so instead of candlesticks we're looking at the angle between planets and in astrology generally there's different kinds of charts but as a western tropical astrologer i actually emphasize hellenistic greek astrology i don't really practice modern psychological i do a lot of like greek techniques but we're using a circle chart where all the planets are positioned around the earth and as you move the time forward or back the planets will all move at different speeds and the planets repeatedly go in and out of angles with one another sometimes a planet here will make a 90 degree angle of the planet here sometimes they'll be opposite making a 180 degree angle and you can have two natal charts where it multiplies that by two where you're looking at the angles of the moving planets with the stagnant chart on the inside and seeing how this might square this it's essentially looking at the angles between planets and how that changes as planets move relative to a stagnant chart so we're think looking at a whole lot of angles and it's very um it reminds me of logic class or logical equations where this in this relation to this equals this and over time when you multiply all of that um data up it gives us a really good indicator of what is to come this is fascinating all right so now let's talk about what is to come we'll go through projections i guess for the end of the year and then maybe into early 2022. let's start with bitcoin obviously the biggest and the original crypto asset yeah most of my work does center around bitcoin because even though other coins can have charts they will always fall under the context of bitcoin i like to say that you can look at the chart of a baby but uh to know if it's going to have a great life or not at that point you probably want to look at the parents charts and see if they're you know doing well so there's context and hierarchy there but for bitcoin i know that we recently just had a correction um around november 19th 20th and that was expected as there was a lunar eclipse and i have some really great traders that are having a lot of a bearish bias and think that we will get a complacency bounce and then go back down i myself do not think that we are done yet or i myself do not think that november into december is going to be bearish i do see us having a run up again into november 26 to 30th is a pretty bullish time so i do think that there's a possibility to get back into the high 60s to mid 70s k all-time high early december especially by december 4th around december 4th there is a solar eclipse which is a new moon and bitcoin tends to have pivots on the new moon where it goes from an uptrend to a local downtrend so i see a local downtrend starting on december 4th until the 18th likely um then an uptrend from the 18th to the 30th and on the 30th we have the exact same planetary alignment happening that we did in may that corresponded with the really severe crash and i do see the argument that we're probably going to have intermittent cycles of bitcoin rather than a blow off top that the it literally looks like an equity style curve and i think that capital is too all over the place to validate a blow off top at this point anymore so i'm not too concerned with these massive corrections leading to multi-year bear markets anymore it's possible and if so great i can accumulate like if it's volatility i'll trade it either way but i do see a major correction and i mean i practice stoicism like i'm i'm like okay we'll short this like great uh so i do see a pretty major correction end of year i'm cautious around the 24th there's something starting around them that look unfavorable really really cautious from the 30th into the new year i think that early 2022 um i don't doubt that bitcoin will reach 100k i just think it's gonna have a massive correction before that in the early part of next year oh okay yeah because i'm sure you're aware that plan b uh did have some projections that for november it was like minimum 98k and i think for december it was 135 but so you don't see us kind of getting there no and i follow him and like really respect his calls uh i don't even see his getting to 98k uh by end of year i think 75 80k is reasonable i've said 80 to 100k is where i think was possible and as we get closer it gets closer to about 80k just by time he i hope he proves me wrong like my my model stash would like it but i can't pretend that i see that happening based on what i what i see yeah okay and let's talk about ethereum which during this time frame that we're kind of discussing will be you know in the lead up to ethereum two so it's kind of gonna be an interesting time so what do you see there funny enough and i guess miss universe works in very obvious yet mysterious ways ethereum's chart is almost the exact inverse of bitcoins the placements are literally often 180 degrees across the sky which means that because of the way that 180 degree angles work if something is asked is an aspect to bitcoin it's in the same literal aspect flip to the other side with ethereum so i think that go like it's super easy to do astrology on one in the other i mean some days will be better for one or the other but if something is squaring something in bitcoin sharp it is squaring something in ethereum's this is more technical but if something is at 120 degree angle a favorable one to bitcoin it's in a 60 degree angle to ethereum which is also favorable so i see the exact same trend in fact i see the end of year the end of year difficulties uh will involve a venus retrograde as well conjunct pluto directly on top of ethereum's moon which is pretty pretty like whoa whoa whoa whoa so i do see naturally that ethereum would correct harder if we do have a matchup correction and it does look like that okay yeah and just to explain for people a square is kind of like a tension point or it's yes um yeah it's not it's not like it's a kind of a more negative energy so obviously those are the two biggest coins but are there any other coins that you would want to talk about i personally off the top of my head will not really ever be able to remember any other coins astrology because i do look at it before i enter trades but because i day trade so often similar to clients that i have ongoing it's kind of just like the the i'm not gonna be able to remember any other coins charts so if i pull it up like sometimes i do youtube live streams and i'll take a look at it there but um besides those two because they're so context dependent i don't feel the need to really um you know i have my huddle coins that i'm like you know this is over there and then for day trades if it's a project with enough confidence behind it i'll look at the chart uh but not off the top of my head anything i can say respectably if i try to recall i'll probably say the opposite side so yeah okay so what's your projection for how regulation will affect the development of crypto over the next year or so i think that in a way regulation is always bullish because it means more adoption and more eyes on the space i do think that cbdc's central bank digital currencies of countries is not only inevitable but like literally in progress i know people working on chains that are in talks not even in talks like working with governments and i know uh that protocols are literally being launched both in cbdc context and internet of things context uh and government regulation i mean i wouldn't say i'm anti-regulation but a lot of it is arbitrary and meant to just it's i'm not like a fan of generally the arbitrariness of it but i do see it likely happening especially in the united states i do see a a really significant financial upheaval from 2022 to 2023 starting in february of next year but really having hits in july and october that do look like they will incorporate crypto given the nature of the transformative quality of how i see the crisis happening that likely there is a great like there has to be a like the s p cannot go up forever like literally we need there will be a time when things the music stops and i see that crypto will probably have a role of prominence during that uh as more and more people wake up to like not wanting to be subject to like the i don't know fiat's instability um so i do see regulation as inevitable long term i like the sentiment behind any government comment on crypto in any attempt to do anything with it is a good sign in in the context of like wanting adoption and i think that likely we'll hear about cbdc's and i mean they're being built and we'll hear about i mean obviously more attempts at like taxation and trying to regulate that as best they can okay so out of curiosity do you feel that giving away your insights will change people's behavior and that's kind of like remove your alpha when it comes to your own traits i have a lot of people wondering this and asking this and astrology i like to describe as the clock on the wall that is telling you that it's 3pm but not making it 3pm so it's not really a causal force that we can ever work with or against and it's not really something that is like one factor of many it's more of a mirror that we can try to like dust off and see ourselves and what's happening best in and that's why i'm not really concerned at all about sharing these things because for example i could say there's a really unfavorable day for bitcoin coming up i think the price is really going to take a downturn i'm preparing for a short entry i could have a lot of people being like oh i'm going to counter trader and have a long entry then all of a sudden there's like china fud or some that is not related to like active traders that will represent this like bad news in the market so in more ways than one there's like not really a way to try to get around the fact that not every market condition can just be described by like retail bias and for one i don't even have a large enough audience even if it was a causal force to technically influence the market um i have some friends that work at like i don't know sig dev like platforms where they do sentiment analysis for influencers and see what they influence i've never been able to do that with bitcoin for some other coins i have seen it with like meme coins and that i like doge or whatever but with uh bitcoin i i don't like my even one really amazing trader with millions of followers probably doesn't have the the size or the accumulated size of an audience to change the market so i'm actually not too concerned uh people get worried about moon phases all the time because moon phases are the easiest swing trade ever every two weeks and uh i myself you know i've shared that a lot and the 85 hit rate that i've back tested is like okay so i'm not actually concerned all right well this has been so interesting and just last question out of curiosity do you offer special services to like crypto traders or whatever where you will do a reading for them on you know kind of their trades or i i don't know i i just feel like that could be its own business i used to i used to see so many clients and that's how i got the capital to start trading in the first place now i do keep up some like like i literally used to when i joined tech talk summer 2020 it was like three to five hour long clients a day for astrology consultations uh that was the only capital i really had because social media doesn't really make you like anything so um i did used to like work my ass off and see so many clients and now that capital got me into doing trades and i still do like ongoing advising and consultancy to if like companies or professionals want ongoing timing and work around when to do things i do do that but i no longer see one-off clients just given the um the delivery and like how to categorize my time okay all right well this has been so fascinating i love it that you were able to come on the show finally because i've been wanting to have you on for a while thank you so much for coming on unconfirmed thank you i appreciate your knowledge and astrology thanks for tuning in to learn more about marin be sure to check out
