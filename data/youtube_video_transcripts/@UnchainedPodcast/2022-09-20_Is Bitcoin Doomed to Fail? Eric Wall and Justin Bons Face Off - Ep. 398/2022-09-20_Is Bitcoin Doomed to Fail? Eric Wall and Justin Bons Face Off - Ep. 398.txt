eric wall crypto blogger and investor and justin bonds founder and chief investment officer of cyber capital welcome justin and eric thank you very much laura thank you laura the idea for this episode came about because of a tweet thread that justin wrote about bitcoin it began by calling bitcoin technically one of the worst cryptocurrencies so justin you actually started out as pro bitcoin so can you just describe what your initial feelings were about bitcoin and we can describe your current opinion later on sure i started off very early in the space um by 2014 i was working um full-time in cryptocurrency so back then i think there wasn't much more to support than btc i think that over time i think the competition has grown a lot stronger and i think in many ways i still i still believe in bitcoin i just don't think that takes the form of what we know as btc today i don't think at best is able to represent those values and i don't think that it's truly competitive in the market both as a store of value or as a form of money and bitcoin does not exist in a void and and that's why i've taken uh such a critical view of btc that's why you know the fund i manage hasn't held any btc in its fund since 2017 because we saw the writing on on the wall a long time ago and but so what were those values that initially attracted you what initially attracted me to bitcoin is the same things that attracts me to bitcoin today or attracts me to cryptocurrency today which is really decentralization uh the utility that a cryptocurrency is able to create without middlemen censorship resistance the greater distribution of power the separation of the monetary power from the state i mean i could go on but i think in conclusion it's very much the same thing i think a lot of bitcoiners believe in as well and i suspect me and eric will actually have that in common it's just the a different means to achieve that and a different view on the current state of things so eric you're also known as a bitcoiner but you definitely take a nuanced view and the reason i say that is that scrolling your twitter feed it definitely seems that you spend a lot of your time these days attacking bitcoin maximalists and yeah you know before we get into all that and talk about maximalism because that's going to be you know a segment of the show let's just talk again about your views on bitcoin like justin you know what were they initially and if they changed over time how did they change right so i don't necessarily believe that uh cryptocurrencies prime enemies are each other i believe that the greater enemy is the state the government monopoly on how to create money and i think that in order to fight the state we are going to have to use our full toolbox so bitcoin has different properties ethereum has different properties i believe that there are advantages and disadvantages to both of those tools depending on the environment in which we're going to fight the government so i try to focus on the positives of bitcoin and the positives of ethereum and highlight those properties as tools that we can use and we don't need to necessarily focus on so much so much on which part of bitcoin is isn't perfect in contrast to some other protocol we can just focus on the on the good parts and attack the state collectively the state monopoly on money collectively all right so now let's talk about this thread in which justin called bitcoin one of the worst currencies so justin elaborate here what were your what were your thoughts in this red i think i'll address the elephant in the room first and and i would agree with eric if btc wasn't as flawed as it is today and i think the elephant in the room is btc's long-term security model my position is is that it's likely going to fail within the next 10 to 15 years this is because bitcoin was initially envisioned as being a form of peer-to-peer electronic cash and as inflation reduces every four years and this is an exponential function fees have to come to replace you know the security of the network over time and and this is where i think uh bitcoin is facing this major dilemma because block size is restricted it has to gain extremely high individual transaction fees i don't believe that this is actually going to happen and therefore i believe that the security model of bitcoin is actually going to fail um and and i think that supporting btc is actually counter-productive to the goals uh you know of of as eric puts it to counter a lot of the uh monetary power of the state because if we focus and support such a fundamentally flawed network i think it does more harm than good for the space as a whole i think it's better if we pull off that band-aid sooner rather than later eric what do you think of that i i agree like when people ask me like what is the what is the primary challenge for bitcoin like one of the largest problems that bitcoin is going to have to face is this this idea that we're going to secure secure bitcoin the blockchain uh purely out of transaction fees as we know transaction fees are one of the most volatile mechanisms uh for securing a blockchain i mean just look at how uh how much fees fluctuate it becomes very strange to say that the way that we're going to get consistent security reliable security is by using one of the most fluctuating forms of security budget that you can that you can think of in in the blockchain space i mean just look at ethereum fees today they're they're like seven way and just a couple of months ago there were 300 400 500 600 so there's like two orders of magnitude that they tend to fluctuate between so are you are you okay with using a blockchain that one day has one percent of the security as it had six months ago i don't think that you know that's necessarily a great way to secure a blockchain and i think that there are other intellectual thinkers in the in the bitcoin space who are also critical of this like peter todd for example has gone out recently and been very critical of uh having no emission in bitcoin anymore he thinks that we should have tail emission so the inflation should never go to zero he assumes that you know because uh people lose bitcoin anyway we can have a small like one percent inflation and that makes the assumption that people lose one percent of the bitcoin or something like that anyway i don't know if that's necessarily true but i think it's interesting that you know even peter todd who considers himself to be a bitcoin maximalist is one of the all-time contributors to bitcoin belongs to bitcoin core and so on and so forth even he recognizes that this you know there's a potential risk here that the security budget and bitcoin uh is not going to be reliable to secure the blockchain now what i where i disagree with justin is that you can take you can look at bitcoin today and you can say the current community and their understanding of the risks to the protocol uh that current community is the way that bitcoin is always going to be it's going to be it's like that today and it's not going to be like that 20 years from now i think that first of all like the community has a lot of churn there's thought leaders to come there's thought leaders that go and ultimately the protocol's ability to face these challenges depends on what is the who are the thought leaders and what's the who are what ideas are prevalent and being spread within the bitcoin community and you said laura that you've seen that i'm attacking bitcoin maximalism on my twitter and like how does that mix with me being a bitcoiner how can i be a bitcoin if i'm attacking the so-called core stewards of the protocol well i do that because i think that as justin recognizes they are perhaps not the best they you have to be i mean greg maxwell had had a comment on twitter today which sorry on reddit is not on twitter he had and also greg maxwell is one of the core contributors to bitcoin one of the core thinkers who understands the protocol better than anyone he says that bitcoin is not just going to automatically succeed it's going to depend on what we as a collective contribute to bitcoin to which lengths do we go to defend bitcoin against potential attacks and one potential risk to bitcoin is the security budget so it depends on the it's up to the community to make sure that we run a protocol that is safe and that is secure but i suppose where me and justin disagree is that he thinks that this can never be like the the current community and their understanding and their unwillingness to change anything in bitcoin is what stands in the way for bitcoin to be able to meet this uh potential risk in the future that's where i disagree i think that as soon like i think that i think that you know most humans are pretty stupid and because that because of that they can't look like 20 years in the future and make the assessment that this protocol based on you know such and such parameters is going to fail they have to actually see it start to crack a little bit so i think that once we're past a few more halvings and you see the inherent security budget in bitcoin disappearing and you see that these these transaction fees that are supposed to take over that's not going to be like a step function that's going to be a more of a gradual thing so you can see problems arising and you can do analysis and you can run simulations where you'll see oh my god we're heading into a problem and look we don't know uh what the current set of stewards of the protocols will be at that point we don't know what the community is going to be like we don't know how the dialogue and the i mean we are we're like 30 year old guys right now we're going to be like 60 when this happens uh i don't think that the bitcoin community is going to be identical to what it is today so i think it's unfair to rule out all every chap like any chance of bitcoin ever surviving because of this one challenge that is big that is a huge thing but i think that we we can we can fight it if we if we make an effort to work for bitcoin now to change the the client the in the discussion climate if we make that effort then we might succeed and i think it's it's a it's a good thing if bitcoin does succeed because i think it undermines the overall um trust or belief in the cryptocurrency space if you always have like one cryptocurrency becomes the big one the major one the first one and then you have these other competitive protocols that keeps replacing the biggest one because this is supposed to be a store value and if the store value part is always depending on you being able to select whichever cryptocurrency is best at that time then the store value property disappears you need to be able to allocate your capital to a cryptocurrency that cryptocurrency needs to be able to preserve its value and i think the one way to make sure one way to help that of that happening is by trying to help these big protocols that we have improve them and fight for them and not just rule them out as never having any potential of ever addressing their problems so eric just one question because justin was saying he feels that the security issue is going to come up within the next 10 years and you were talking about how you know you think that there will be a different crop of bitcoin leaders in 30 years but the thing is you know the block size debate kind of started in 2015 which is seven years ago and you know the side that prevailed has sort of kind of been the prevailing side for the last five years so you know assuming that they last for another at least five years like i just don't really see how it's going to be you know that different of a group and if they really will make changes and justin you may have i don't know what your thoughts are but that was my first question now that's that's a good question if you could hold on to that eric's i have a few things to to respond to here from you so first of all i just want to say i'm not arguing that it won't survive because it just going away completely is a very extreme position right blockchains are incredibly resilient and they tend to just refuse to die as long as just a few people support it but my position is that it will dramatically lose its dominance and significance in the world so spending a lot of my energy on something that i think won't uh you know you know won't play a prominent role in the future and actually even stands in the way of that future from my perspective i don't think is particularly productive you know for this movement now now there's a few things to respond to here and and i am i am a bit puzzled actually eric you know because i i really i really respect you as a thinker because i think you're very consistent and and you know you you speak a lot of these hard truths and and bite the bullet on these issues and i think that's fantastic but i'm i'm puzzled how how you can still support btc you know you you talk about well in order for bc to survive and i'm glad we you could acknowledge this right it has to increase its inflation right so we're talking about a blockchain that will likely increase its inflation in the future or face you know a security dilemma we can go for the inflation scenario because i do think you need to choose either or here i don't think that those are necessarily the two only open options but go proceed i'm curious about the third option but but let's but let's maybe loop loop back to that later if it increases inflation through social consensus this entire sov narrative i think is very broken i think i think in the eyes of most people and i don't think that's what most people actually signed up for when they first signed up for btc when i first signed up for btc i signed up for extremely high capacity network that could form it that could be a type of medium of exchange right that changed so like bitcoin already changed its underlying use case and its underlying vision and economic model because of that i mean look you can support you know bitcoin all you want and and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna argue with that that is your choice that is your your freedom and your prerogative i'm just saying compared to the competition when the if merged just just passed us right ethereum will remain secure and far more scarce compared to bitcoin in comparison to me that's a much better and including a bunch of other cryptocurrencies here as well i don't want to make this an ethereum versus btc debate um but that that fundamental design and and i know you've advocated for fee burning as well i just want to give credit where credit is due there that that design is is far more competitive and i don't believe that bitcoin exists in a void it still has to compete with other cryptocurrencies i mean it's it's nice to think that no we don't have to compete but the reality is we do we compete for attention we compete for investment we compete for energy we we compete for all of these things and i think the the competition here is a very important part of the free market mechanism like that that free market is the crucible of evolution that will allow the best cryptocurrencies to rise and and i want to support that process and and i don't want to support something that i think will undermine the very you know the very principles it's based on and i think those those principles are what i care about right i don't care about that three-letter acronym i care about you know the the end result and that's why and also like after after you know it's inflation i i don't see how how that's going to change either and i think laura actually made a really good point as well about bitcoin culture i think what happened after the block size debates a lot of people left so a lot of the uh counter voices left bitcoin right and and that creates this homogeny in the culture and this happens for a lot of cryptocurrency we have a certain personality type that would be attracted to a certain type of cryptocurrency right and that then creates a self-selecting bias so so i don't see how that's going to change and it just changing as you say as the security is failing i i just don't see that as a positive outlook and i see that scenarios really bitcoin's no longer going to be number one in coin market cap and it's no longer going to be the number one in security well it actually isn't uh already and it's also not going to be number one in utility you know this this this puzzles me and and and i also i also respect that you're able to bite the bullet but it puzzles me how you can still support bitcoin and when when really the emperor's not wearing any clothes you know i mean you know what you're saying is very different what you'd hear from a lot of the maxis yeah you'll have to forgive me justin because i've during the last couple of years i've been debating a lot of people adversarially like richard hart and other people like that so i tend to go for the juggler when i see it and i hope you don't mind me doing giving you the same treatment please please go for it this is a debate okay all right i won't i won't hold it personally yeah i mean i think it's i think it's a bit silly to be honest to say that it's weird and puzzling that i support bitcoin because in in according to justin you have to support cryptocurrencies where you have a strong conviction in their likelihood of success otherwise you are counterproductive to your to your goals of being a cryptocurrency advocate if you are proponent of a cryptocurrency which might which has a uh probability of ending up failing which you see as high but then it becomes a bit puzzling to me justin because if i if i go through your twitter history which i've done a couple of times then you will see that justin has been a very very large advocate not only for ethereum but before it was ethereum his main cryptocurrency that he was a proponent for was bitcoin cash and while he was a proponent for bitcoin cash he was also proponent for dash for example so if you can be a proponent for dash and for bitcoin cash how is it in any way strange that someone would be an advocate for bitcoin to you i mean you how did how did dash turn up for you how did bitcoin cash turn out for you and then you look at me and you see me advocating for bitcoin bitcoin is still number one and i've been an advocate for bitcoin since 2012. have i been like if i've been if i've been advocating for those for bitcoin for 10 years and it's always been on top it's always been the biggest one and you have been advocating bitcoin cash which used to be number two and now it's number i don't know 20 25 i don't even i don't even know what's the relevance of bitcoin cash anymore like you obviously went wrong with dash and bitcoin cash and now you found ethereum and now you're like ethereum's the one but if you're always like trying to find this altcoin which going is going to be the competitor to bitcoin but whereas bitcoin just stays on top stays number one uh like how does that how how is it weird to you that you know i'm advocating for the the biggest cryptocurrency which has managed to stay on top all this time it has a problem in the future i'm trying to do what i can to change the cultures that so that we are able to uh meet that challenge in the future uh like is it is necessarily a better path to shill these other small coins with much greater challenges that bitcoin has and advocate for them like is that really necessary is that is that a better position uh like morally ethically logically no sure this is a great point and look first of all i'll say i don't feel like i went wrong with supporting bch when i did it's also important to note that i stopped supporting bch i think more than a year two two years ago i don't remember exactly around the time when the um ecash fork happened that's that's when i dropped my support of that project and very publicly as well and look i think i'm far more consistent in in standing for the principles that bitcoin stands for by wholeheartedly supporting bitcoin cash as opposed to bitcoin because bitcoin cash actually increased the block size limit as satoshi always intended to do so i fought for bitcoin for many years to have a change internally right as as as as a veteran of the block size debates right i i argued for years and i fought for years to have that changed and when after time and time again after delay after delay we were unable to affect that change we split the chain and we change we change the underlying rules or we we stick to that original vision and then i supported that for many years until you know it went wrong and and we learned lessons there why it went wrong i think where it went wrong was very much a failure of leadership not the fundamental design and and and i'm proud of having been part of that moment of history and i don't think it's inconsistent i think it's actually far more consistent because bitcoin cash stood for those principles and bitcoin cash was the actual attempt at changing bitcoin and it failed right the battle failed but the war wasn't lost yet that's why the market ended up routing around btc towards ethereum instead that's the twist right and as an investor i was i was just able to ride that wave and i don't i'm not ashamed of those decisions i don't regret those decisions we got in and we got out and we learned lessons i mean i'm i'm at a position now where i think you know proof of work is actually has systemic flaws of governance but that something we should maybe uh touch on later on and look i i did try to change the culture but i saw the writing on the wall right i saw the writing on the wall that that it wasn't was unable to change for for numerous amount of reasons that that we can get more deeper into and just because it stayed on top this whole time and obviously i'm managing a fund that as a contrarian fund has a thesis that btc will lose its top position right and so far you know btc dominance has been falling since i maintained that that thesis and i think that's still yet to happen i don't think that btc is at number one now and that you know you're saying it's going to continue staying at number one i don't think that that's a good argument against its fundamental flaws that's just an argument about the the the ignorance of the total market right and that the market takes many years to catch up to these ideas i i want to actually raise a question that's um i think really important to this discussion because we keep talking about the block size wars which you know that stretched on for a really long time but one of the things that always struck me about that time period was the censorship on the bitcoin subreddit and justin you mentioned this in one of your tweet threads and i remember you know because i'm a journalist so for me having all the facts is like a really important thing to kind of figure out uh you know what the truth is but also my ancestry is korean so i'm very sensitive to anything where it's like propaganda and like you know censorship of facts and stuff and so you know that to me always struck me as um a way of like steering sentiment in bitcoin one way or another and i was curious for your thoughts on you know how that affected the community and eric i'd like you to also weigh in because obviously now with all your criticism of maximalism you know i kind of wondered where you thought you know their views stem from so if you can kind of both address this the block size war was a long time ago now this was seven years ago since censorship started and i i don't want to make the mistake of remembering like details incorrectly but i think i think it's true that in 2015 there were threads on reddit where most of the people were positively inclined towards a hard fork block size increase uh because i've been going back to those threads as well and i've i've saw i've seen some things that now in retrospect seems bizarre that that was ever like allowed on on our uh bitcoin so i think that you know famous did definitely take the steering wheel over the bitcoin subreddit and what's the moderator yeah the moderator uh he he took charge of the trajectory of bitcoin in a very aggressive way and initially in 2015 2016 where these subreddits forked and there was in the very beginning there were two different ones so there was rbtc and our bitcoin and i remember like initially thinking wait so our bitcoin is censored so our btc is where is the uncensored one and they're the good guys and then i got more into the block size debate and my own perspective like i i suppose that i was compelled by the small blocker arguments more uh because i i it resonated with me personally more that preserving the decentralizations of the nodes and the ability to verify the blockchain was the the main important thing to defend for and also the segregated witness solution that i at that time believed was number one an instrumental change necessary to enable the lightning network and also it was also a block size increase so segwit was a compromise in the sense that it actually increased the block size that was where i saw the technical community sort of converging on one solution that would satisfy the asks of a big part of the ecosystem so i suppose those people that wanted big big blocks they got bigger blocks out of segregated witness than there were then there was one part of the of the bitcoin community that wasn't interested in using the lightning network to scale bitcoin and thought that the initial design was scalable on its own um so i mean i i definitely agree that some  went down with the block size debate and the censorship of that subreddit i i have been questioning like how was i just one of these maxi plebs uh like a small-minded maxi back then like was that who i was in 2017 was i someone who didn't listen to the arguments that was being put forth by big blockers you know i've i've had moments where i've started to question how i acted and how i treated the big blockers but i did spend an enormous amount of time trying to understand also the big blockers position so i had there was another the moderator of the btc form his name was tudu and he's a swedish guy so i would spend a lot of time just walking around stockholm with him and listening to the when you start to discuss the block size war and you debate and you and you get into these niche arguments where okay but what happens if if okay so let's say that's not everyone can run a full node on their computer but how are actually malicious forks or how our contentious forks actually fought in the protocol is it actually done at the node level or is it actually done in the marketplace and his opinion was that it actually happens in the in the marketplace it's if you have two forks the market will price one differently than the other and that's actually the primary way that these disputes are settled i think that t definitely had a good argument there like that's one argument like in favor of that you can increase the block size but you can't increase the block size because it's not ultimately doesn't come down to like individual users nodes as much as it comes down to the market deciding the value between two different forks although i wouldn't say like it's black and white i would say that it's perhaps you know it's both of those things having people running their notes and validating the consensus rules of the protocol is important but the market will ultimately be the arbitrator of two forks that's also true and i don't think that those are necessarily conflicting beliefs to have that both those things are true yeah one one quick question about that is i remember there was a controversy at that time where bitfinex had these two different tokens trading to see what people's thoughts were on the block size debate and there was yeah a storm basically about the ticker and how they gave the ticker for you know no hard fork to to or i don't remember exactly what it was like just in some way they named um it where people felt they were tipping the scales in favor of not doing the hard fork so i was just curious if you thought like you know for kind of a true sentiment it should be that the two tokens just have completely different names or something yeah so there were multiple instances of that bitfenix had a module called the chains the the chainsplit token like where you take your bitcoin you could put it into that module and you would get two tokens out and one would be sort of a future on small blocker bitcoin and the other one would be there was one that was called just bitcoin unlimited i think then it happened again when with with the segwit 2x when the set with 2x was going to activate so there was one token that was called bt1 for this for the incumbent version and bt2 which is which was the hard fork version of segwit2x which actually implemented the two megabyte block size increase along with segwit and i do remember that you know exchanges some exchanges were idealistic and said we're going to just call the small blocker version bitcoin like bit mix for example they didn't leave it up to a market cap or anything to decide uh but i think that bitfinex they did you know they didn't name the these two coins anything until after the fork happened and saw which one had the largest market cap on their futures market so i think you know bitfenix handled it relatively fairly the main interesting thing that came out of that was that everyone like people think that you know the reason that the small blockers won was because they ran their full notes and they just refused to accept any rule change from the segwit2x gang but what what i think really happened was that you we gave these two different versions of the future the the the segwit2x future and just the incumbent future with one megabyte blocks on segwit we gave those two tokens a chance on the market and uh segwit2x didn't even get 15 of the value of the incumbent bitcoin at that time and why who's going to mind that chain like who's going to mine a bitcoin if it's just has 15 of the rewards you have to mine for not two weeks you have to mine for a very long time just to get a difficulty adjustment to make that chain profitable again so i mean that could be one of the reasons why there wasn't really a push from the segwit2x camp to even try to fix this one uh off by one bug that jeff garcic fumbled with the segwit2x launch so i think it resolved itself in the market so um i'm currently writing a a history of the block size debates which has been quite an intense project for me so all of this is quite still fresh in my mind and i would like to point out that that segwit was not a compromise i think that's that's a very unfair framing of what happened there um because i think the compromise was known as sigwet2x which which almost all major parties agreed to including core which included segwit and a two megabyte block size increase i think that would have been a compromise and that would have been much better for btc the fact that this didn't happen i view as a major failure of btc governance and look there's there's a lot of factors at play here that that ended up in this predicament right if i'm being a bit frank honestly i think that one of the reasons the you know the the small block side let's say one is they were more one more dominant and connected and they were able to play far far more dirty um and and look and i think in the end that that whole market process is not over yet right in terms of btc's future and i think that that war is still playing out it's just playing out with other competitors i think that's something that we didn't maybe at least i didn't quite foresee as clearly was the idea that yes to split to split a chain is a critical governance mechanism right because then people can vote with their feet but another aspect of that is also the wider market and the alternatives that exist and people can vote with their feet in that way as well now the censorship i think also played a very large role in all of this you know that that that the major uh you know communication channels were all censored to the point that even if you you know voiced any opinion that was against you know bitcoin core at the time um especially in regards to this whole block size debate you would be pretty much immediately banned and i think this is also well documented and also continues to this day right you know that that is a major hindrance to actually bitcoin changing now i think this is a good time for me to get more into bitcoin governance theory specifically and and i believe that it actually there so i developed something known as the free stage theory on governance so we're a blockchain this is at least what i think is supposed to happen where where blockchain goes through multiple stages of decision making by different groups and party creating a type of balance of power and and and checks of power right so i think the first stage of that is the development team is the client implementations because someone actually needs to write the code right and in bitcoin case i think it was lesser debate about the block size in my view the block size debates it was more debate about governance and how bitcoin is actually governed because we were facing this this this this wedge issue this this watershed moment we're like oh are we going to increase the block size are we not going to increase the block size and the second question was how do we decide and everyone was arguing over how do we even decide this right so i've done my my best to try to understand what in an ideal case does bitcoin governance look like and i think the first stage of decision making does fall with the developers and falls with the client implementation someone needs to write the code the second state falls with the validators or miners because they actually have a what i call a proof of positive incentive on them to actually they have skin in the game they they want to do what's right for the system right so so so developers write code validators miners run that code and now if a lot of people disagree if there's a division among the miners or just simply just users disagree right the ability to run their own nodes means that the blockchain can split and then the ultimate arbiter of truth is the market then the market decides between the splits which is the most dominant and a lot of this you know there's a lot of old-school politics that that kind of enters the game at this point um in terms of censorship in terms of you know flawed narratives and and and all these type of things right and you know banning you know developers out of core and saying that um you know we have consensus here i mean that's that's one way to reach consensus right so you know in other words but what ended up happening i think in bitcoin is core ended up pushing out a lot of the other client implementations after the fork and and they really ended up dominating bitcoin governance in practice so in my view core uh the the dominant client's implementation of bitcoin in many ways ended up capturing you know the governance mechanism and if you put this in the context of my theory on governance if the first stage you only have one client's implementation if the first stage is only one party like a github is like a like a github dictatorship you literally have one person who has the final say over what goes in or out of the code right then then that acts as a bottleneck that that they can essentially act like guardians of what goes in or what goes out and i think there was a huge war fought in bitcoin where any any clients that say contradicted core was seen as an attack on bitcoin so it created this whole culture where it was like no no multiple implementations is dangerous we only have one and in my view that fundamentally you know really broke the governance process there's another element to this as well which is why i now believe that work is systemically flawed as a governance mechanism uh that's because i believe that miners incentives are actually too short-term and what i mean by that is when most miners you know do do mining right they usually have no more than a five-year time horizon because their equipment's only going to last so long they have electricity contracts for a limited time most miners are actually extremely mercenary in their mentality around bitcoin they they go in they have an investment horizon they go out right and and in my view what ended up happening is i think that the miners what should have happened ideally is the mind of should it act as a check against the uh power of the developers and that didn't end up happening and that led to the wrong choice being made because you know if just a two megabyte block size increase would not have centralized btc it would have kept it unified i think it was clearly the better decision instead of splitting the community the way that it did and a lot of people just moving on to different projects or leaving cryptocurrency entirely you know so much drama could have been avoided right i mean you know that compromise was never reached keep in mind it was the eight megabyte block size proposal first in 2014 then in i believe it was uh 16 it was eight megabytes and then it was two megabytes and then you know we went down and down and down and compromised many many years later and then we finally came to an agreement after four years of arguing okay the compromise is this and and even core developers signed on to this right two megabyte plus cigarette you get what you want we get what we want we move forward instead it was a bait and switch no block size increase and they got cigarette and that that led to the split that that was the betrayal that was really the first shot in so many ways yeah so i mean obviously this history has been gone over so many times i do uh you know think it's it's really good to sort of discuss it now with all the developments that have happened since but um we're going to talk about kind of bitcoin's present day especially in the context of a lot of the more recent developments you know including things around ethereum which you know really is i think the only other major currency to talk about when it comes to comes to um bitcoin but first we're gonna

spotify or wherever you get your podcasts back to my conversation with eric and justin so before we move on into you know some of the issues around bitcoin itself i wanted to you know ask eric more directly about this turn that you've taken against other bitcoiners and maximalists you know and it's not just you it's also been nick carter ud wertheimer uh eric voorhees actually i think was doing this even before any of you guys um so what you know is like happening here that has made you decide to come out against these people like what do you think is sort of wrong with bitcoin culture now yeah that's a great question i have my own like personal history how it happened for me but i think like more broadly it actually stems from the block size debate in the sense that the winners after this the small blockers when they won in 2017 what happened in my opinion was that the the winners of the war got so cocky and and they rested on their laurels and just became overconfident in their own theory of bitcoin and their own rhetorics uh around bitcoin uh that it essentially quenched the climate for intelligent conversation in bitcoin so bitcoin maximalism really got high on its own supply in a sense uh after the block size war and when i used to think like in 2017 you know could just be my perspective but i really don't think it is like if you just look at the who's who was the headline speaker at conferences in 2017 andreas antonopoulos a man who could design the lightning network uh he could write the code for it he could speak intelligently about every single aspect of it and then the bitcoin protocol in general and the geopolitics of bitcoin and and if you look at who's the headline speaker today michael saylor was the headline speaker of the huddle holder conference that was just in in riga just now michael saylor thinks that nfts should go on the lightning network michael sailor doesn't understand that nfts and the lightning network are like oil and water you can't have a channel based network that depends on you being able to create channels where you only have one-of-a-kind tokens those two things don't match and the only reason that michael saylor is able to pioneer these ideas in the bitcoin community is because he doesn't get enough pushback anymore because the intellectual climate died and the critical thinkers the people who did enjoy intelligent conversation got successfully more and more pushed out from the discussion they became more marginalized like i for example in 2019 i wanted just to draw the attention to what was happening uh with uh serial knowledge proofs and roll-ups on ethereum which i in 2019 found to be a very interesting way to to scale a blockchain and i try to get bitcoins just like just look at the structured architecture of this design it's kind of interesting could we do something like that in bitcoin could we do some variant of that in bitcoin before that i was called the altcoin slayer and i'd really um you know paid my dues to the bitcoin community over a number of years by demonstrating that i would be like this technical attack dog that would pull out the dirty laundry on any other cryptocurrency that wasn't bitcoin and show them how these uh altcoins were flawed so i thought that i had built up you know enough intellectual reputation intellectual capital in the community to just say okay all that being said though look at this thing with rollups that's actually kind of interesting and we don't have to you know have an opinion about ethereum whether it's good or not just look at this technical construction maybe that's something that could you know allow us to get to get greater scalability with better user experience and better privacy in bitcoin and i got called the bitcoiner it was called like peter todd called me dangerous because i read vitalik's blog and i found interesting technical ideas in there that could that the bitcoin protocol could learn from um and and now that i think about it like i i i used to view it as a failure my own failure like i wasn't i wasn't persuasive enough i wasn't i didn't build up my credibility within the community for a long time enough to get to to be able to say something that went against the status quo and still maintain the respect when i think about it now and i see that andreas antonopoulos like even if i dedicated 10 lifetimes to bitcoin i could probably not make as good of a contribution to bitcoin as andreas antonopoulos did with in the way that he galvanized people in the way that he explained the bitcoin protocol and he also contributed to the bitcoin protocol in so many ways that most people don't even understand even if i did all that where is andreas antonopoulos now he's not on twitter why is he not on twitter well because the bitcoin community became hostile towards andreas antonopoulos because he wrote a book on ethereum and he has some i uh ideas that are seen as you know more leftist than what the bitcoin community is more inclined with and it was advocating i suppose for flattening the curve during the vaccine during the copied vaccine which a lot of bitcoins really didn't like when i think about like okay so i wasn't able to get the roll-up idea into bitcoiner's minds and i was instead called bitcoiner well so was andreas antonopoulos so it's not really like my own failure i think it's just a systemic problem with bitcoin because the same thing happened with nick carter who's also i think has contributed way more to bitcoin than i have with his really intelligent uh advocating for proof of work and and you know making the case for bitcoin to the broader media and educating regulators uh and he as soon as he you know he what did he invest in what it was like an authentication tool on a website that used ethereum or or was multi-chain or something like that it didn't even like he didn't even you know advocate for a specific cryptocurrency it was just a tool built on like just just use the key pairs from a cryptocurrency to to log into websites and and he was immediately pretty much attacked by the bitcoin community so i think you know there's no way that i could have been successful at what i tried to do i think what what needs to happen first in the bitcoin culture is we have to change the culture actually i think that we cannot i think that i cannot change the culture in bitcoin i think the only thing that i can do and what i'm trying to do right now is to show other people who are in the periphery on the sidelines of this that there is a way to be a bitcoiner there is a way to be a strong advocate for bitcoin but you don't have to abide by the same uh rhetoric and the same ideas as these maximalists do you can still be an advocate for bitcoin there are still other people in this ecosystem that will listen to your ideas i think that the problem has been right now is that people think that okay if i don't if i'm not like the bitcoin maximalist i don't really have any room in bitcoin i will be attacked squeezed out i won't be able to go to any conferences and that's sort of a situation right now but i think that we the other side are and we are there's enough people of us right now that know enough about bitcoin that our intelligent advocate uh advocates for bitcoin that we can create a form of bitcoinism that isn't as uh dogmatic as the current version of bitcoinism is okay well i also want to ask you you've been so critical of this stock to flow model for projecting the price of bitcoin and in response you made up your own fictitious rainbow chart which is actually turned out to be more accurate um so i was curious to hear you know what happened there like why you became so critical of this talk to flow model yeah the stock to flow model was i mean i was already skeptical of what was happening to the bitcoin intellectual climate before the stock to flow model kicked off and the destructive flow model just became the ultimate proof for many of us in bitcoin who were critical of the intellectual rigor uh of bitcoin maximalism when we saw that our primary podcasters and like safety names who wrote the bitcoin standard katelyn long uh vijay who wrote the bullish case case for bitcoin uh pierre richard who was of the nakamoto institute like all of these really core figures in bitcoin and also raul powell and a number of other like key figures uh or being proponents of bitcoin at the time said like what they basically said with this with the stock to flow model was that you you can program the price of bitcoin like it's not it's not actually up to supply and demand it's a programmatic quality of the inflation schedule in bitcoin which is absolutely absurd but it demonstrated it demonstrated just how vacuous the intellectual uh climate in bitcoin had gotten that and and and i say now that i was a minority person who was speaking up against the the structure flow model and and other bitcoin is just thought you know why is eric being so this is good for bitcoin like why is he why is he advocating against this and now like when i when i try to look back on that debate now uh then you know i'm being gaslighted basically by the bitcoin community where they say you know francis poulou i don't know i pronounced his last last name he says like he asked me like when i when i when i criticized the stockton model he says can you find one other person than pierre richard that was a proponent of this model and laura i think you've you've been and this you you you've been a journalist covering the space you must have seen that there was one more person than pierre uh richard there was a proponent of the stock deflo model and i it's just you know it's ludicrous to me that the whole community can basically just decide that this part of history did not happen like we're just trying to eliminate that thing of ever happening and i'm being gaslighted for saying you know there is a collapse of the intellectual quality in bitcoin and the stock to flow model was the first pure demonstration of that and to be attacked like well i'm being attacked now because people are saying that i'm making this up about bitcoin history i'm making the stock to flow model up it was just a few people that really believed in it it's just like that i i can't really explain how that happens the only the only way that i could explain it is by uh thinking about okay what does a cult that says if if a cult says that world is going to end by a specific date and the world doesn't end by that date does the cult disappear uh science has shown that these cults kind of don't disappear they go in different directions and they make up excuses and they make up reasons for why the cult was still correct in some way and this behavior is sort of how the bitcoin community is acting right now and it's really like it's actually it's going to the point where it scares me to see people rejecting historical facts that we know happened and just outright denying that it was ever a problem in bitcoin jesus christ i mean yeah i can get so um right if you i can get like my blood starts to pump when i talk about that but i'm going to try to yeah honestly my what just flashed through my head was oh my god did eric just compare bitcoin to a cult i was like wow um but i totally take your point about you know people revising history uh which i mean it happens in a lot of a lot of spheres in life and you know from what you say it sounds like bitcoin is not immune to that okay so now let's you know address some of these kind of more core criticisms of bitcoin around sort of like either technical or monetary aspects of bitcoin and justin kind of was implying this before so you guys both probably heard a lot of people call bitcoin a dumb rock or they say like you can't do anything with it you just hold it they talk about how it's not programmable um so i was kind of curious for your thoughts like so justin you know maybe you actually just want to elaborate a little bit on what this criticism is because you know there are the people out there like arthur hayes was just on my show and he was like i view bitcoin and ether as different they have totally different purposes you know bitcoin just needs to be money and you know ethereum has this other utility it's more like oil etc um so i was curious to hear your thoughts on you know what you think the future of bitcoin is absolutely i would love to um touch on that so the whole bc is money i i would just like to address a few things that uh eric just said before first in terms of the current social climate in in bitcoin i mean that's the thing that i saw coming you know years in advance and i think it's it's rather tragic that it's really you know i mean i think eric you must like me remember some of the early days very fondly where there was a lot of intellectual capital and that was promoted and andreas was also a very early inspiration for me as well i remember he had a speech where uh he said the power of bitcoin is that this one dollar worth of bitcoin can be it can be sent a hundred times you could do 100 transactions with it right and that's that's something that really drew me to bitcoin as well so and that's speaking to the money aspect but i think i think the problem with bitcoin and you refer to bitcoin as a cult and i don't think that's unfair but i think this kind of cult like thinking occurs in all cryptocurrencies and many walks of life you know where people get very tunnel visioned in in how they see things and i think this is true for a lot of radical political movements the ones that go too far off the spectrum have a tendency to eat their own best people in the process you know from from the french revolution to to the russian revolution i think also very much bitcoin as well and i think that that's also where you know toxicity is is not necessarily um the problem it's it's a symptom toxicity is a symptom of of a lot of the problems that bitcoin has and the demographics of bitcoin are also a symptom because like is attracting like and people new people that come and now look at this and they go no way this this other thing over here looks much more interesting which is why my thesis is so you know heavily based on this idea that that that you know btc will lose its dominance um now to speak to this whole money issue right so i do view um bitcoin well at least when we look at ethereum and bitcoin and we look at many other cryptocurrencies i think saying that these are different and they fit different purposes is is a way of putting btc in its own special box into its own category so that it cannot be compared directly in my view actually ethereum and bitcoin should be attempting to achieve the same goals they are both base layer blockchains they both aim to be money and money should also be a good store of value right so if i were to define what good money is i would say good money if i take for instance the aristotle in the definition by aristotle he said money should be um you know fungible right which i think is heavily degraded in bitcoin it doesn't have a lot of privacy technologies and having a limit on the transaction amount also limits the anonymity set you know it should be portable i think btc is not very portable at all because it's it if a lot of people use it it'll end up being very expensive and unreliable right so and it's also not very divisible either because same same problems with fee markets that's that's not a reliable system and i think in that sense it's it's not very good money at all i mean it's easy saying bitcoin is the best money the world has ever seen but if you objectively look at it and you look at what the technology is capable of today we are able to have high capacity networks like ethereum alone is already 12 times the capacity of bitcoin right and and smart contracts that's that's that's the perfect example of a type of innovation that you know in the in the early bitcoin days it was an early dream of bitcoin to have decentralized exchanges where's that dream today that dream has been pushed out because no no that's that's what the evil ethereum people do that's that's what the bad altcoiners do so we don't want none of that here we want to stay pure and there's by the way when someone says pure run away because that's that's partially a cult like mentality and and i think that's where bitcoin really fails as money it's a it's a terrible medium of exchange it's it's it's a comparatively a bad store of value i mean especially if you acknowledge that you know bitcoin will have to increase inflation in the future so so like this whole argument really has no no objective grounds to be true it's it's kind of it's only true if you look at bitcoin in a vacuum if if you put if you put on rose tinted glasses or or you really get tunnel vision and you only look at bitcoin in isolation you ignore all of the other cryptocurrencies i will admit that bitcoin looks amazing and i would support that wholeheartedly i would because it's a lot better than what we have today but now if we compare bitcoin to the competitors competitors that at least theoretically and fundamentally are able to be far more scarce far more secure far more usable have far more utility you know how how can we even support bitcoin in that comparison bitcoin has failed and i do admire your hope in in wanting to see that change in the future and fighting for that change just like i did many years ago but i i decided to walk away from that fight because i i saw it as a losing battle and and that greater gains were to be made in just letting that market run its course and supporting the alternatives instead that did have a clear sight that weren't happened by their own governance and this is the thing about blockchains right blockchains are very difficult to change and sometimes as i mentioned earlier where i believe that miners were actually prioritizing short-term decision-making over long-term decision-making really really messing up that governance process in some cases and i think in this example in order to fix these problems it actually requires a clean slate because because these are changes that are very difficult at least to implement in bitcoin in time before the crisis actually happens as as you've also earlier acknowledged and and that to me really speaks to to to this failure of of bitcoin you know floor security reduced scarcity very little utility you know there is no smart contracts right and and i'm very happy you're also somewhat of a critic of lightning network as i am it's it's that's not going to save bitcoin and i think i think a lot of the numbers have also confirmed that over the years i think you know even if we assume like if if we assume that everything that you say about bitcoin is correct let me make that assumption say okay bitcoin is has these issues and it's you know not doing smart contracts and it should and so on and so forth then you know my alternative then becomes what to be an ethereum maximalist to to be hyper focused on ethereum i think when i look at ethereum if i just imagine that bitcoin doesn't exist and i look at an ethereum ethereum is not it also has a bunch of different uh attack surfaces i mean the um just the most obvious one which has been talked about again and again again if you have a platform that is designed for defy and you have all these external assets that are tokenized on the protocol it ultimately like ultimately those stable coin issuers and those real world asset issuers get immense control over forks in the protocol so it becomes very difficult to fork ethereum if you have stakeholders which control assets in d5 and all these d5 protocols are interlinked and collateralized by each other like that's a systemic issue for the ethereum protocol so i think that there should be an alternative to ethereum i just think that there should be something that is dependence if if ethereum has tons of external dependencies there should exist one cryptocurrency which is dependency free which tries to minimize the amount of dependencies as it has and i think that you know proof of stake is interesting and amazing in many many ways but i also think that proof of work is interesting and has a very powerful attributes by being the most robust most tested one uh that has been securing bitcoin since since day one and is generally not not it was all nearly as complex as proof of stake is in many of the ways that it operates i think that there should excess one cryptocurrency like that which runs on the tried and tested proof of work that doesn't have dependencies which is also has the strongest brand name in bitcoin that uh just i basically compared like let's let's say that the the ultimate enemy is captain ahab how do you kill captain ahab you have you have an octopus or you have a revolver with one gun in it which which weapon is best to attack ahab well it depends like is ahab submerged underwater is is ahab underwater well then the gun probably isn't going to work and to put this into consequence okay so underwater could basically be what if the us government bans proof of work well then it becomes difficult for bitcoin which in my example here is the gun it becomes difficult for bitcoin to fight captain ahab if it's under water but the octopus could be extremely good at fighting ahab underwater because the octopus is esg friendly the octopus uh has a a medium of exchange use case in the sense that it's becoming the primary asset in which of which nfts are being traded at uh ethereum has uh mev so it has a a a way to design a security budget that isn't necessarily predicated on net inflation in the same way as bitcoin as so ethereum has this all of these different arms that is coming for ahab under the water but if if if captain ahab uh goes out of the water and it's a different kind of fight then you know the revolver might be this dependency free like clear-cut game in which it wins so i think that you know we probably want the octopus under the water we want the gun above the water so depends where ahab is like he's a moving target he can fight in different ways so that's why i think you know you should how can you not view these different paths as mutualistic instead of parasitic when they are so different from each other now especially since the merge sure no let me let me speak to that so there's a few things here first of all i'm not i'm not saying become an f maxie i think that's that's a bit of a straw man i don't advocate for being a maxi of anything i've been a cryptocurrency pluralist this this entire time since since 2013 so i'm definitely not advocating for that and i find it a bit strange your your arguments saying um you know that that it has these dependencies right because it has d5 now i view defy as actually being you know utility as being something that's useful also i would even go further in saying that good decentralized money requires decentralized finance to support it turns out that's actually part of the equation here in order to be successful in this market right so i i feel like you're somewhat i mean there's merit in what you're saying but at the same time you're somewhat twisting the the argument because it's almost like you're saying that oh well that it has no utility that we can't build decentralized exchanges is actually a good thing and and i would really just argue completely against it i mean also because you're saying oh well that that's because it makes it harder to change right well i i mean as a bitcoiner i think out of all people you should appreciate that as being a positive right that ethereum is harder to change is actually a good thing that actually makes it more resilient makes it more secure that it has this huge economy backing it up i think growing cryptocurrency has always been the plan in terms of let's grow it so large that no single entity can attack it and that's exactly what what d5 is achieving i think it's a very easy way to just to just disregard that by saying no no bc doesn't have these dependencies upon d5 no that's an incredibly positive thing but like one thing that i do want to ask you is when you keep saying that d5 doesn't have these dependencies i mean uh this whole issue with maker dao being so dependent on ustc i think kind of highlights that eric's point about you know the fact that these centralized entities can sort of dictate the direction of at least d5 if not like ethereum i i think that is the reason why roon christensen was like oh my gosh maybe we should d-peg away from the us dollar because you know i think he's realizing oh you know essentially usd is the king maker of of dai and a lot of uh d fight depends uh on usdc it's not just maker a lot of defy does so i think eric has a point there no he does have a point and that's why i said his argument does have some merit and and and to speak you know maker specifically that's that's a very complicated case but it also comes down to what my view of decentralization is right i think the ultimate form of decentralization is if you envision all of the major geopolitical powers in the world or competing with each other on the same neutral platform that's that's the ultimate form of uh decentralization but say say china and the usa and europe and the saudis all competing over validation spots i think that's how you create the ultimate form of decentralization if it's always this niche thing like oh i'm i'm a cypherpunk and i run a node out of my basement well guess what that's that's that's easy to actually attack and that's that's far easier to actually overcome i think the ultimate goal of decentralization is to have all these i wouldn't call them dependencies but ties into the financial world and and and that it starts to represent the real capital and and and the real gdp of the world overall and i think that's how you get the ultimate form of decentralization and i don't think that that's that's a negative i think that defy over ethereum represents a huge amount of utility and a huge amount of value and that it makes it harder to change and that major parties are part of this game is actually what creates the positive balance of power that we're actually looking for in such a system i mean i will agree that maybe ethereum will need to make some change in the future and it won't be able to and then we might have another debate in a few years from now about why ethereum will be overtaken right i'm not a maximalist clearly clearly not now just to speak to your um captain ahab analogy which i thought was a very uh very interesting one the the reason why i maintain my position is i i don't really see a a single thing that that btc is truly better at i mean there's maybe a few very minor cases like maybe a better distribution in the case of proof-of-work and a greater cycling of participants but to me that doesn't that doesn't overweigh the cons so i'm i'll ask you eric because you say it's good having different types of blockchains because they're good at different types of thing what is btc better at doing than ethereum is for example um yeah so i don't know if you have been paying attention to this risk of um now that ethereum is moving to proof of stake there's this risk of because there's so much stakes concentrated around regulated entities like coinbase and kraken and binance and so on so forth and also improve stake you only need like one third of the validators to censor in order for a censorship attack to be possible in ethereum so i've been advocating for this like the community needs to take this seriously and and and create a deterrent for validating entities to even think about censoring the protocol and complying with ofac and things like that because we are going to slash those validators that does that and so the censorship resistance of ethereum in my opinion sort of currently rests on the vigilance like the villa the vigilant qualities of the community to deter actors that may go overboard and just you know censor transactions just to stay compliant we gotta make them understand that that is not an option we're going to fight tooth and nail to make sure that the protocol stays neutral and in that challenge that i've been having in trying to galvanize the community around this one thing that has been making that whole thing more complicated uh has been the fact that if there is a fork and there is one of compliant fork and there is one rebel fork it's a big question which one of these forks are these stable coin issuers that are also regulated entities going to support and what is going to happen to the defy coins on the rebel chain if usdz ustc goes to zero all these d5 protocols sort of collapse in as domino as domino bricks because they're so dependent on each other so that's like having that defy on this chain definitely makes it harder to fight censorship it makes it a bigger challenge i don't think it's unfeasible i still think that i don't think that every stablecoin issue or every d5 protocol is sort of dependent on what usdc does necessarily there's definitely nuances where usdt might take one direction and usdc might take one direction and there's going to be some time before this fork happens so you can sort of unwind your positions in these d5 protocols before the split happens but it is i mean d5 is a huge dependency there's no way around it this whole chain uh there's like there's tons of ether collateral that might get dumped to if if usdc goes to zero for example just for just because of the way that uh collateral is tied up in these protocols so i mean d5 is great i love d5 been a proponent for d5 and since ever since the end of 2018 i think but i also recognize that this system is difficult to maintain and it requires external oracles and stablecoin issuers to support that ecosystem which makes a har a fork in the protocol much more difficult to navigate around that's one of the that's one of the drawbacks of ethereum i'm still going to fight for ethereum as much as i can but i when i am when i am in that fight i'm sort of soothed and calmed by the fact that i still have the revolver with the one gun in on on the table that's still there i haven't rejected it that's bitcoin the dependency free in my opinion clean approach of bitcoin so so so that i don't put all my eggs in the basket of the octopus to fight ahab okay so first of all regarding the opec and the validators i asked you the question namely one thing that btc is better at right that's the question i ask and your response is well opec regulations is is something that ethereum is vulnerable to but i would argue at least fundamentally speaking i think if it is more vulnerable now it's only due to scale right not not fundamental reasons because i would argue actually that proof of work is far more vulnerable to such censorship than actually ethereum is itself right and this is because of the nature of proof of stake as well right so in the case of proof of work because these miners require you know huge spaces and massive electricity consumption and you can probably see a lot of mining operations from space is that these are incredibly you know visible entities and it's also highly concentrated in a relatively small number of hands and did you know that actually opec compliant blocks have already been created over btc there's actually several mining pools that are today opec compliant and do not uh you know include such uh sanctioned transactions right so so so what you're worried about happening in ethereum is is literally already happening in bitcoin it happened for a short period with a marathon mining pool and then they stopped doing that okay i wasn't i wasn't aware of the update but but my point still stands right that that bitcoin is actually far more vulnerable to this problem because if it doesn't have define it has less value and we talked about the security model being flawed as the value being paid to miners goes down bitcoin becomes more and more vulnerable to attack that also makes it more and more vulnerable to censorship right there's fundamentally no reason why this can't occur over proof of work as well so saying that that well ethereum is far more vulnerable to this no it's just because more attention is being paid to it well i actually i i think the technical reason for that is just the utxo model is kind of easier to implement ofac and not have sanctions affect many different actors whereas like because ethereum has the account model just if your address is blocked or even just like identifying like like like when you have sanctions it can either be that you're blocking an entity or you're you're blocking specific property and because um with the utxo model under bitcoin like it's easier to block that specific property but under ethereum uh because you know just like i said just account balances get changed it's not as easy so actually i do think at least at least you know i'm not a technical person i'm just kind of you know repeating what i've heard so in that regard i actually do think that's one way in which ethereum is less censorship resistant okay well i think in general if you if you say that proof of work is bad at fighting censorship and proof of stake is better i think that you're sort of failing in my opinion to recognize that there are so many different nuances to these different systems that in in one situation one might be good like proof of work might be good if uh in one situation where proof of stake is better and it might be another way in another situation i just think that you know why don't we go full head to head with the state monopoly on money with both these tools in our arsenal why do we have to say that one is better than the other when there's like if you if you spend any amount of time analyzing these two different protocols you will see that the debate is very nuanced there are uh they behave differently in different environments proof of stake for example has the ability where it can slash a specific validator that engages in censorship which you cannot do in proof of work that's a strength for proof of stake but proof of stake also has the problem where you only need like coinbase and and and and kraken to decide to start to censor tomorrow in order for that to be a huge problem for ethereum whereas in bitcoin these miners are sort of not necessarily tied to a regulatory jurisdiction in that same sense because they are they just need an energy source and it can be in kazakhstan it can be in afghanistan as long as there's some type of resource to mind there they don't have to be in a specific jurisdiction which these exchanges and custodians really do tend to be i don't think that's really fear i mean you can run a validator out of kazakhstan a lot easier than you can a massive mining operation yeah but coinbase and finance and kraken that are like the largest single validators tend to be exchanges and custodians that's just an inherent aspect and five pools control bitcoin right now as well right and it has for years yeah but you can you can repoint your hash rate to whichever pool doesn't censor and in proof of stake you have this uh in proof of stake you can do the same yeah but it improves stake it takes time to unstake from one pool to and go to another pool there's uh because of the uh weak subjectivity problem in long long range attacks you need to have your stake locked up for a minimum period in order for the protocol to be safe i'm just saying like we can get into the specifics endlessly there are definitely ways in which work is better and there's definitely ways that proof of stake is better depends on the situation it depends on the exact attack and pressure that the government puts these systems under and i'm just saying it's a very easy answer no it's not easy they both they have pros and cons you can't say one is better than the other no i think people do need to decide which one is better because they have to they have to allocate capital they have to you know put it i allocate capital to both i allocate capital to both what if i go into a fight why am i not going fully armed with multiple weapons depending on how the fight turns because they're going to drag you down i would just take the best weapons now if i were to just explain why i think proof of stake is fundamentally so much more secure and so much more sin ship resistance just as an example right because it's difficult looking at it now because bitcoin is still a lot bigger in terms of value and value also determines security but as an as an example let's say we take a hundred billion euro proof of stake network and we also take a hundred billion euro proof-of-work network in this example right and if i use historical numbers from btc i think it's fair to say that there's about 2 billion worth of value on that proof of work network right that's securing it so to attack it would cost about a billion at least for an initial attack right in the case of proof of stake how much would it cost to attack that proof of stake network at the very least 33 billion right that's a much larger number that means the cost to attack proof of stake against proof of work is far far higher and it gets better than that as well because the response bitcoin would have to such an attack uh which is a very radical situation but it's it's a good way to highlight the the underlying issues is the way bitcoin would deal with that attack is changing its underlying algorithm okay and when you do that then a second attack say if if attacker is extremely sophisticated a second attack could come along where it's attacked using gpus and cpus and after that point you know bitcoin is pretty much dead in the water can't recover from that right so that's how bitcoin and how much it would cost to attack bitcoin under those parameters whereas in proof of stake because of slashing that process can just be continued indefinitely until the attacker runs out of funds and i don't think that proof of work it doesn't have some sort of special status in terms of security right it it doesn't because from a suffice from the perspective of a sophisticated attacker right um whether i spend 50 million in a staking firm or i spent 50 million in a mining firm it makes no difference in terms of which equity i get if if my intent is to attack the network so this is also why i say that proof of stake is fundamentally more secure and if it's more secure and it's more decentralized it's also more censorship resistant and and and we saw this in bitcoin as well in the early days where certain pools were reaching were going over 50 and then new pools were created and then it was distributed more right and we're seeing that exact same process happen over ethereum today and over time you know the incentives work and the game theory works and coinbase has been has been fighting a lot of these the these opec regulations and of course my deal is that a few pools don't control the majority of stake that is terrible it's just as terrible when that happens in proof of work as well but at least in proof of stake we can see that the fundamentals actually do trend more towards decentralization and censorship resistance in comparison to btc i still disagree if proof-of-stake is not fundamentally more secure it is different it is different it has different advantages and disadvantages and it depends on the enemy that we're fighting i'm not gonna just let that slide and say that proof of stake has an ultimate advice it has some advantages and let's be proud of those adventures and let's talk about those advantages and let's when someone comes and says like proof of when the bitcoin maxis come and say that proof of stake is absolute absolute garbage we address those arguments intelligently by highlighting the ways in which it is different and the qualities that it has by and trying to get people to understand that both these projects has important positives to them i don't see any reason at all to just throw out one and just favor the other when we can use both these tools i'm sorry yeah i have a feeling um maybe justin's point on that is he wrote the cryptocurrency market has to now overthrow the incumbent meaning bitcoin before it can truly thrive again so why don't you guys just sort of both address this like it seems like justin feels like in order for crypto to to really kind of um flourish then uh apparently bitcoin has to be overthrown can you talk a little bit about that and eric you respond and then so the reason why i think that is because i think i think it gives cryptocurrency a bad name i think that that a lot of people think that cryptocurrency is just this purely speculative thing and in my view i think that's what bitcoin is it's a purely speculative asset that's not what i signed up for i signed up for an asset that actually you know is useful that actually has utility and it's the underlying utility that gives it value and also gives it more security in the long run and that's why i support um the alternatives to bitcoin and not bitcoin itself anymore because i think that's what helps move the moves the world forward more and and i'm not advocating for attacking bitcoin i'm not i'm not advocating i'm not saying well you know i i don't want bitcoin to improve of course i wanted to improve if it turned around and fixed all of these problems i would be overjoyed i really would be because i i love bitcoin and i love the whole mythology and anything about it but what it has become today just doesn't represent you know the the original vision and the dream that i first signed up for and i think it's admirable eric that you're still fighting for that dream within bitcoin and i'm not saying we need to destroy bitcoin and i'm not saying you know it it it should be shot down or anything like that but i think the market is going to do its thing and and and if we have better technologies that are just better at what btc does in every single way then i think in the market they are going to overcome bitcoin and i think that will be a positive thing because in people's perspective of what cryptocurrency is as a whole will change because i think that the alternatives actually represent that that true perspective what cryptocurrency should become far better than i believe btc ever could thank you for that uh i i still can't shake this notion that it it feels like you have some emotional history with bitcoin and you you're very disappointed with the things with the trajectory that bitcoin chose and it feels like i mean you've been advocating for a number of different cryptocurrencies like dash bitcoin cash and now it's ethereum and like i i don't think that bitcoin cash is a better solution than bitcoin i don't think that it ever was and i also saw flaws with the bitcoin cash leadership as you did and i didn't ever think it was a legitimate or a good contender to bitcoin so what what we're really left with today i think is bitcoin and ethereum like those are the two big ones that we can bet on and i think that those two cryptocurrencies are just so fundamentally different that it's obvious to me that one is going to be better in one situation and the other is going to be better in the other situation so you're not going to get me to abandon bitcoin in favor of ethereum because ethereum is so different it's so different that i still think that there's a use case for this pet rock that just tried to do one thing very simply i i would i could agree with you if if you said like bitcoin is bad and bad and this and this and this other ways and here's a perfect alternative which solves all those problems and i think that your solution is ethereum but your solution previously was bitcoin cash and it was maybe dash and then ethereum i'm wondering like where will you will you be five years from now will it be something else will you have identified some fundamental flaw with ethereum's proof of stake system that didn't satisfy your needs also i just think like let's be a little bit humble and not necessarily rule out the chance that we might need both of these systems to combat the state in the future the one thing i would say about that argument is like it's not quite an ad hominem attack but it's like almost close to it crypto world changes and um ethereum i'm not sure you know what time uh at what time he supported dash but i think there was a period where dash exists where ethereum didn't exist um so who know who knows where things will go but um you guys this oh justin did you wanna i i just i just want to address this because i've i've supported ethereum as well from day one and there's over 30 different cryptocurrencies in the portfolio we manage so i've always been a pluralist and i'm and i'm not going to say that ethereum is perfect i'm not going to say here's the perfect solution right because it doesn't exist but i don't think it's going to be one of those if you can support 30 different cryptocurrencies you could also support bitcoin i mean bitcoin is not so much worse than all those other 30 that you support well i think it is because it lacks a long-term security model it lacks utility it lacks all cryptocurrencies have fl all of them have issues all of them do all cryptocurrencies have flaws and and there's many other cryptocurrencies that that also wouldn't make it into into their cyber capital portfolio right but but in the case of bitcoin if something does not have utility it does not have a viable long-term security model it has a toxic culture it has a dysfunctional governance yeah that's where i'm going to draw the line and say no i'm not going to support this because we can do so much better than that today and it's not just ethereum it's also you know tons of other cryptocurrencies near auron avax i mean there's tons of them and none of them are perfect right but they're all still technically and fundamentally so much better than bitcoin and and i just don't i just don't want to stand here and say the emperor's wearing clothes when he clearly isn't um okay okay we're gonna leave it on that note that uh you guys this has been an incredible discussion i just loved the points that you made on both sides and i think i'd be interested to hear what
