huge news day for coinbase yesterday they put out a report with their Q4 earnings which exceeded analyst expectations although in this day and age for crypto companies to beat expectations it's enough to just publish a report not a sub stack not a tweet thread a report only lost 2.46 dollars per share and they were expected to lose a lot more crypto where you exceed Expectations by losing less than people think you will put that on a bumper sticker that's not the end of coinbase's news today they announced that they're launching base a layer 2 Network to attract new crypto users to build daps on the blockchain for those who don't know dapps are decentralized apps like when everyone at the table orders their own appetizer I think it's appropriate that bass drives its name from coinbase minus the coin like in today's day and age no honest crypto company actually wants to promise that there will be coins involved I just hope it turns out better than coinbase's nft platform which has seen so little activity that it makes even the borders of board apes look very very busy
