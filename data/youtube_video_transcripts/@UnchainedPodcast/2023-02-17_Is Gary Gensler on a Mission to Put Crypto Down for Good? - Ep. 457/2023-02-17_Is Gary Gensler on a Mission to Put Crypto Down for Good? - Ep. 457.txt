code Laura Link in the description today's guest is Mike selig council at Wilkie far welcome Mike good to be here there's been a lot of activity from the SEC in the crypto sector in the last week we've seen a ton of enforcement actions but before we get into all the details around all of these events what would you say is sort of the top headline meaning like what's the takeaway from all these different actions yeah and just a quick disclaimer to all the anons out there I am not your lawyer I am a lawyer but nothing I say today will be legal advice um so the the general Vibe I think right now is that there's some coordination amongst Regulators both in the treasury Department the Prudential banking regulators and at the market regulator level with the SEC and cfdc and there there appears to be some backlash really from the FTX events where we had uh you know a number of incidents within the the FTX organization fraud uh mismanagement of customer funds all of these things that Regulators at the market level and at the banking level are concerned about and so they want to Institute measures to protect that but there's also been this concern that the the opportunity is being used by Regulators to really cut off access to the crypto markets and uh we had the custody rule proposal yesterday we've had a number of significant enforcement actions brought by the SEC regarding um staking and defy and there there's rumors of actions potentially down the pike for stable coins and the cfdc similarly has brought some actions involving Dows and other types of defy uh you know related uh products in in the mango action recently as well and at the banking level we've seen statements by Prudential Regulators that have been put into the Federal Register really discouraging Banks from entering this space and that's concerning to many in the industry so it's for seems like what you're saying is that FTX has now caused the government to try to clamp down on crypto at many different levels and so then would the takeaway be that it's not that they're seeing the FTX issue as an FTX problem but more as a problem related to crypto itself that's the concern and certainly there are many on the hill and in the industry saying look this was fraud this had nothing to do with its underlying technology or the institutions that are trying to comply with laws and it's been very difficult frankly for many of the institutions in this space to comply with the you know the Gary Gensler view that many of these crypto assets or Securities which kind of got snuck into the custody rule yesterday where there's a statement saying that you know most if not all of these uh crypto assets or either funds or CR or crypto asset Securities um and Hester purse and her descent uh disagrees with that view but even if we assume their Securities there's really not a market structure that works and I think this latest custody rule proposal is really an attempt to push a new market structure on crypto that that really is uh the the existing Securities Market structure by trying to disaggregate some of the the custody function from exchanges by making it very difficult to trade on a an exchange if you're a register investment advisor because the exchange may not be a qualified custodian I'm really just starting to to restrict and clamp down on these different types of crypto uh intermediaries that don't fit within the the current Securities Market structure and then similarly at the banking level we're seeing really a discouragement of any sort of holding of crypto assets as principles saying that that might not be safe and sound banking practices and a discouragement of the banks themselves from actually banking crypto companies yeah so now we'll just go into some of the details so people can see exactly what's happening but we'll start with this week on Monday day which is when the New York Department of Financial Services ordered paxos to stop issuing busd which is finance's stablecoin and apparently the SEC also issued a Wells notice to paxos which indicates an intention to bring an enforcement action so what was the core issue with busd it's really hard to say specifically what the SEC is looking at with respect to bosd or stable coins um you know many are speculating here the definition of a security is much broader than an investment contract which is an investment of money and a common Enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from some other here it could also be that they're looking at other prongs of the security definitions such as evidence of indebtedness or certificate of deposit so it's very unclear what the SEC might be investigating here the wells notice is really potentially just the beginning of a further enforcement action that could occur or it might not there's an opportunity to respond uh the New York Department of Financial Services appears to be potentially concerned with the partnership between this stablecoin operator and you know a third party exchange as opposed to necessarily just what the third party they're sorry as opposed to what dress um the stablecoin operator is doing and so uh by exercising this authority over a New York limited purpose Trust Company so paxos is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services as a Trust Company the department is able to essentially say we no longer want you to offer this product and so we're able to kind of force you to turn that off and so by cutting off the ability to submit new tokens and force everyone to would only be able to withdraw and redeem um that that's essentially closing down this this program um and it impacts The Exchange really The Exchange more than impacts us necessarily but that's a big source of Revenue potentially yeah so it sounds like what you're saying is that the New York DFS action was really more aimed at Finance but it's because that paxos fell under its regulatory purview that that's what that action was was intended to do it was like that was an actor that they could access is that what you're saying there potentially it's really hard to say and speculate here but paxos is actually regulated by the DFS binance is not and so you know that that's really the only throat they had to choke in this action and then as for the sec's um Wells notice about the USD uh two pack says it sounds like what you're saying is maybe it has to do things with other law that relates to the definition of a security Beyond just the Howie test which is what the crypto Community has been focused on for a long time so maybe now we're going to learn about what other areas of law could apply that yeah that may be the case yeah it's interesting because uh back in uh September of 2020 um the uh SEC actually put out a release related to stable coins um it's the fin Hub you know the Innovation Hub within the SEC and they said that stable coins very way may well be offered as non-securities and it depends on the facts and circumstances and Gary Gensler in a speech kind of alluded to this same line of reasoning that they may be offered as money market funds uh which would have Investment Company implications they may be uh sold in connection with an investment contract because they have an interest component or other features that are investment-like it really depends on the facts and circumstances and so each individual stable coin must be evaluated separately so this should not be viewed by the the industry in the market as an assault on all stable coins but there's definitely this concern that this coordination amongst Regulators just sort of Choke off access to banking products is coming into play year because stable coins are really the access point to a lot of D5 applications you don't have dollars you can load into any sort of D5 protocol you have to use a stable coin and so by draining out the ability to access stable coins that might indirectly uh choke off access to D5 in the United States okay so so it sounds like there is like two implications which are number one other stable coins could potentially be targeted this way but it would depend on how they're structured and then that would mean that then there it would be another category of stable coins that potentially are totally safe and how they're structured meaning safe from regulatory action and then the other thing is that potentially the reason there are these actions against stable coins is that the true Target of regulators is to prevent people from accessing Defy is that kind of where you were going there that seems to be potentially what they're doing here it's really hard to say and it's all speculative but if we're thinking about this coordinated effort to really undermine crypto markets or bring crypto markets within the regulatory perimeter by selectively targeting some stable coins um and and of course there's going to be legal challenges here because the arguments we don't know what arguments they're making um but there's very good arguments potentially that these products are more like uh money transmitter issued products like a stored value instrument or a gift card and these are things that uh money transmitters that are licensed at the state level and have a registration with fincen or even a trust company that doesn't need the registration with thinset um are able to offer so these are you know look you can load dollars into your PayPal or venmo account and send those dollars to someone else and that's all regulated as money transmission as opposed to the offering or issuance of Securities and so the the lines are starting to really blur here when we get into the world of stable coins because they really do look like uh gift cards on a blockchain that are transferable open loop gift cards all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the implications for stable coins as well as go into some of the other regulatory actions but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 50 million people using crypto.com one of the easiest places to buy earn and spend

consequence of these regulatory actions is that I saw Tom Wan a research analyst at 21 Co tweeted that the market share of stable coins that bosd held obviously went down which makes sense um but so did the market share of usdc and then that kind of uh you know short-term effect that we saw after this enforcement action was that the marketer of tether actually went up um which seems very counter-intuitive I don't know um you know when you talked about how there are certain stable coins that based on the way they're structured they might be safe would tether fall in that category it's really hard to speculate and there's been a lot of fun thrown on Tether as well it it really will just come down to the facts and circumstances and and what the SEC is really looking at here so it's under a typical investment contract analysis where you're thinking about how we you know a stable coin has a stable value I was actually part of the team that went into the SEC a few years ago and got a no action letter for what's called V coin which was issued by mview and the SEC through a no action letter said if you're going to sell this token at a fixed price and redeem it at that same fixed price there really is no expectation of profits and therefore uh you know given all of the conditions and other facts and circumstances in the latter we're not going to to deem that to be a security and recommend an enforcement action and so there's certainly a path for some of these stable coins to be offered it's just a question of whether the SEC is looking at some other prong within the the definition of a security and and that's almost a bit of a rug pull under the industry because many of these coins have been offered potentially following the imbue no action relief or under you know a separate reasoning under that the Howie analysis and under the finhub framework the guidance that they've put out around investment contracts which many rely on because that's the only true guidance that the industry has gotten on what is and what is not a security everybody's thinking about investment contracts and of course Reeves which is the the analysis for whether an instrument's a note another type of security that's something that the SEC started to pursue and think about in the context of in particular uh interest bearing products but generally under our Reeves analysis you're looking at something that looks like a promissory note and none of these stable coins really look like that unless they're paying out some fixed rate of interest or even a floating interest and so that that's the problem that I think the industry is in where we don't have enough guidance to say hey we can offer these products saying they're not investment contracts but then if the if the regulator is going to say no they're a different type of security uh it's really hard to navigate without any clear rules last question on this paxos plans to litigate against this decision and so I don't know if you agree you know that the USD could be an unregistered security or whatever but um I was curious what do you think is paxos's best argument that the USD is not an unregistered security I think the SEC has put out uh significant um guidance on this point through their you know the prior interpretive releases it was all under the Clayton Administration but as I said there is the the imbue no action letter there's been this you know SEC fin Hub statement there is the uh SEC finhub guidance framework document that they've put out all of this leads one to believe that these should be analyzed under an investment contract framework and under an investment contract framework there's really no expectation of profits uh when you have something that has a stable value and really the the efforts of the uh custodian in this case really are ministerial and just making sure that the funds are are maintained one for one and so a lot of the arguments that that these stable coin operators are likely to make is just there's no real expectation of profits and unless this is going to be characterized as some sort of money market fund which the SEC has never really put out that view or said hey these operators need to go register as investment companies that seems kind of like as I said like a rug pool it's just not fair to the market to not really put them on notice that this is the way that they're supposed to comply and so there's going to be these Fair notice arguments that a lot of these stable coin operators are going to make as well yeah I there's just so much we could discuss here but let's and now move on to some of the other um enforcement actions so last week that SEC did reach a settlement with Kraken which disclosure was previously a sponsor of Unchained and it was over its staking program so I did see some of the crypto lawyers tweeting that the way Kraken marketed the product probably is uh you know one of the reasons that um it may have fit the definition of a security according to the four prongs of the Howie test but I wondered you know more broadly what risks do you see this settlement posing to either staking itself like meaning you know to ethereum um or to other exchanges that offer staking as a service or even three any of the more decentralized options like Lido or rocket Pole most importantly this is a settlement and it is not precedence or law or any sort of concession on kraken's behalf that this is a security it was It was decided by both parties to settle and and so there's no kind of admission or denial of any of the facts that are alleged um but what the SEC really focused on in this case was comparing direct staking where for example if I'm on ethereum I gather my 32 each together I put them into the deposit contract and receive native rewards from the ethereum blockchain uh putting those assets instead with a custodial provider and the provider pulls them together puts them into the staking deposit contract for me or holds back a portion of those which is what was alleged to have happened in the Kraken case where the where Kraken was depositing certain of the assets pulled from customers within the the stake and contract holding back others in reserve so that it could offer instant liquidity which is not the way that you would be be able to stake directly because you would be on the case of ethereum there's an unbonding period and the withdrawal contract is not enabled yet so you wouldn't be able to withdraw your assets um so these are additional features that make it potentially more appealing um and then of course by pooling a larger amount of assets as opposed to just directly staking the customer's assets you have more consistent rewards you're proposing blocks more often and the rewards aren't necessarily higher but they're more consistent and that allows Kraken in this case allegedly to offer a fixed rate of return uh to customers because it's constantly receiving those rewards and the rewards aren't necessarily timed out the way they would be timed out if you were just earning them from the the relevant Network those features are what the SEC focus on the marketing of course was important as well to the SEC but it was just this bundling of features that made the SEC uh concerned about this uh program and it's not necessarily the case that all staking programs would fit with within that definition because all of these custodial exchanges and platforms that are offering staking are generally registered with incent as a Money Services business or and or at the state level as money transmitters which gives them the authority to take funds and move those funds to another person or location and so if all that's happening here is an exchange is taking crypto assets and putting them in the deposit contract for a customer that looks a lot like what PayPal or venmo or Western Union does when they move funds for remittances or whatever purpose and so that that arguably shouldn't fit within the the scope of the Securities laws and then of course these liquid staking protocols were really the efforts are not the efforts of uh the staking provider the custodial provider or any sort of liquid staking uh provider these are the efforts of the users of that that smart contract protocol and so the users are collectively putting their assets into a smart contract and the smart contract in a non-custodial way routes those into if we're talking ethereum into the deposit contract on ethereum and so these are the types of arguments that would be made in the case of any sort of uh non-custodial decentralized program and you don't have the marketing issues necessarily that you have with with a fixed rate of return because the the rewards are coming from the network and they're passed right on to the the holder if it's a receipt token with a liquid staking protocol the receipt token receives that amount of rewards that are generated by the network and not by any sort of provider and so the essential managerial efforts are not those of any sort of development company or Dao or any other identifiable person okay so so maybe yeah the further implications for staking are at least at the moment somewhat limited or it's too hard to kind of read beyond that one settlement um so now let's talk about something that you mentioned earlier which is the proposed rule by the SEC from Wednesday that would effectively keep registered investment advisors from using crypto companies for storing digital assets so what would you say is kind of the purpose of this Rule and what expect what effect would you expect it would have if it does get passed yeah so registered investment advisors are required to custody assets with a qualified custodian and assets are currently defined as Securities and funds the new safeguarding uh customer assets rule that the SEC has proposed yesterday would expand that definition to also cover other types of positions and that definition of other types of positions the rural States is really supposed to be Evergreen but it's meant to capture all crypto assets as well as other sorts of Commodities and different products um the the current definition per the the preamble to the rule uh with just funds and securities says that you know all crypto assets should fall within this because they're either crypto asset Securities or funds which Hester purse and her descent is has poked fun at but the uh this really appears to be a a shift in Market structure where you're going to have all these registered investment advisors that have to custody their assets whether their Securities or not um clearly I mean many many today are custodying with a custom in their crypto assets with the qualified custodian out of precaution because it's not clear what's the security what's not and frankly these qualified custodians have a number of measures that other exchangers might not have in place or other custodians might not have in place that protect those funds um but it's not clear for example uh whether an nft would fit within funds or Securities today um and it would certainly fit within the definition of other sorts of positions um they even reference artwork as a physical asset that is supposed to now be custody potentially with a a QC and so the rule really expands the scope of the sec's regulatory authority over uh assets that aren't necessarily even Securities but of course the SEC has this view that that many of them are securities or funds um and then the idea that the qualified custodians themselves are not regulated directly by the SEC but will now be indirectly regulated to a greater extent under this Rule and so the rule also requires uh registered investment advisors to enter into a written contract with their qualified custodian which many do today but there's specific requirements here for things that need to be within that contract and then there's also a requirement that there'd be reasonable safeguards and reasonable assurances uh that the QC provides to the Ria and these assurances include indemnification limitations on liability segregation requirements all sorts of requirements that really sort of seem like indirect regulation of the the custodian um and then the the biggest issue in my view is that many of these exchanges today are not qualified custodians um the custodian branch of the The Exchange operation might be for example if you have a trust company that custodies institutional assets and then an execution entity that's like your retail exchange where you might still execute transactions or or some other sort of uh Prime brokerage arm or you're executing transactions that arm might not be a qualified custodian and so it seems to be the case and and commissioner yeda pointed this out that there might be this fragmentation of liquidity because now uh all of these rias are going to have to use exchanges that are qualified custodians and that that's a limited market today you know there's a handful of exchanges that have gone out and got a trust Charter but most of the the market participants have segregated their trust from their exchange and I think it's interesting that there might be this shift in Market structure because it it's no secret that chair Gensler wants a national Securities Exchange and a national Securities Exchange is non-custodial it looks a lot different from the typical Exchange in the crypto markets today you have to go through a broken broker dealer that's a member of that exchange and so you have this segregation of custody from uh execution that the custody rule seems to be driving at to a degree and it's just not it's not clear that this would be practicable certainly for defy uh but even for the current market structure for custodial crypto assets there's only one entity so far that would crypto entertainment that would meet the proposed role which would be Anchorage so in that regard like it would definitely would change the landscape you know we kind of referenced this earlier in the show but you know we were talking about how it looks like banks are also cutting off some access to crypto and so when you I don't know if you could just talk a little bit about what you think is happening there and then how that could affect some of the different crypto entities yeah there's definitely some sort of effort at the Prudential level to discourage access and and participation in crypto markets at the banking level so you have all of these State chartered entities we're talking about um State trust companies we also have uh the Wyoming spdis the special purpose depository institutions like custodia these entities potentially are also regulated by federal regulators and that they might have access to the FDIC insurance and in the case of extodia custodia is applied for fed access and been denied for a master account and and member status at the Federal Reserve and so there's there's this uh dual regulatory structure where you might get a chart at the state level or you might be like Anchorage where you have a National Trust Charter um they converted their uh their state trust into a National Trust And so these Federal Regulators have a way of indirectly regulating the state trusts and and also these State banking entities like a speedy and so what's happening here is that the fed and the OCC and FDIC have put out a statement that has now been entered into the Federal Register essentially listing a bunch of different activities including participating in crypto markets as principle it's not entirely clear how they view custody I think after this uh SEC rule proposal it might be the case that they're backing off a little bit on custody but but all these sorts of crypto activities they're saying may not be safe in some Banking and if the the National Banks aren't allowed to engage in these activities they're saying that State Banks shouldn't just be able to to engage in these and then go out and get a Fed account or access to the fed or FDIC insurance and many State Banks do need FDIC Insurance in order to operate and so it really discourages many State Banks from from getting involved in crypto so it so it's really just more of a a discouragement in my view it's not necessarily any final rules saying these are the steps to access crypto or offer crypto and it's going to be very difficult or challenging to do so um but but it's a policy discouragement and there's also uh this issue of many of these State Banks not being able to offer the products they want to offer for example if you know stablecoin operator that needs access to the FED it's going to be more difficult to be able to access the sorts of investment products that they would need to back the stablecoin so in a previous conversation that we had in my premium offering you did talk about a difference between Gary gensler's SEC versus Jay Clayton's SEC and I was wondering if you could elaborate on that how are they different and what do you think that means for the crypto space yeah so the Clayton era was really the Ico public token sale era when crypto was first coming into its own and we had Bitcoin which really was The Fountainhead of all these other sorts of tokens everybody wanted to offer a different type of token ethereum really unlocked that with its white paper and with the idea that you could have these uh meta tokens on top of the ethereum network um and we've seen that now with nfts but but really during the the 2017-18 years there were so many of these icos and the Clayton Administration looked at a lot of these and said you know denta coin and some of these you know Ron Paul Coin and different coins out there you know many of these are being sold to Securities they're being sold as part of an investment contract and investment contract as we discussed is analyzed under the Howie test but it really isn't you know a scheme a transaction or a contract uh that has uh potentially a token attached to it uh because there's this investment of money on a common Enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits and and the tokens just representative of that and so the Clayton Administration did did not necessarily say all these tokens are securities they said many of them would be being sold in offerings that look a lot like an IPO and that's why they're labeled icos and so that the Clayton Administration went after Telegram and kick and a lot of these Ico issuers and that really reigned in this era of icos and in 2019 2020 it had largely died down and we got many of these D5 protocols and other types of Innovations on top of the ethereum network and other blockchain networks and rather than just sell a token many of them gave tokens away to the community there may have been Venture funding and whatnot where tokens were promised but largely these tokens were being given away or earned in various ways we talked about some of the the new action letters of the Clayton Administration grants had related to different applications there were gaming applications there were stable coin-like products Clayton Administration was really willing to engage and sort of limit this idea of selling tokens to earn profits but but open to the idea that you could have tokens that have utility so there was certainly this utility took a model but real utility um and I think um Clayton had a handle of statements really alluding to the idea that you could have tokens that aren't sold for speculative profit they might have a fixed value but but they're sold to be used in a game or an application the Gensler era SEC really doesn't uh want to entertain this idea that tokens have all these broader use cases I think the focus has been on decentralization in the case of all of these uh protocols in terms of their strategy and that that really started up before the the Gensler era because a lot of these protocols wanted to give away you know control and governance of the protocol to the community but that's really on steroids right now where we're seeing many of the D5 protocols and and operations issuing tokens uh moving to Dow structures where they they set up a decentralized autonomous organization uh to really decentralize governance and control over the uh the token Network or protocol or what have View and the the Gensler Administration is very skeptical of these I think they view a lot of these um Dows as Alter Egos and so it really is forcing this battle of Regulation versus decentralization where there's this real drive to decentralize every aspect there are a number of protocols that that have very limited governance and are very much decentralized because there's very few features to change right they've just deployed their protocols and and the gensar Administration has now turned its sites as well to the intermediaries to the exchanges to the custodians to the platforms the marketplaces all of that and so we're seeing a shift away from uh you know these these issuers to focusing on governance and protocols where there's no uh you know meaningful decentralization or governance as well as these intermediaries uh where there's a lot of risk because the assets are being held or custody by some intermediary and there might not be the protections to prevent something like FTX happening again so some of this is is well placed in in light of FTX but there's not a an urge under this Administration to go issue rules it was really refreshing to see the custody role proposal that's the first real media rule proposal we've had um there are many reasons to criticize it it's got a 60-day comment period it's being rushed through pretty quickly with a an 18-month window for compliance but um but we're at least seeing some rule making so I think I have to give you know a little check mark to the SEC on doing this through a rule um but by and large it's through enforcement and by and large they're focused on the intermediaries the custodians and the centralized points of failure in the crypto ecosystem yeah which I mean it does seem almost like you know it's um what's that saying you know criticism only makes you stronger or whatever um that if it's forcing the industry to decentralize which is idealistically what the industry proclaims it wants to do then in that sense like perhaps it will all be um it will all be for uh the good of crypto anyway we'll have to see what happens but this has been so Illuminating I so appreciate that you came on the show thanks for coming on Unchained thanks for having me don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap Sam Pinkman friends bail may be revoked co-signers are revealed at a hearing for the criminal case

co-founder do Quan for fraud selling unregistered Securities and other charges the SEC claimed that terraform and Quan misled investors and that Luna and anchor protocol were quote crypto asset Securities the suit alleges quote terraform and Quan also misled investors about one of the most important aspects of terraform's offering the stability of UST the algorithmic stablecoin purportedly pegged to the US dollar earlier Thursday when Bloomberg reported that sec's intention to sue terraform issued a statement saying terraform Labs has not been contacted about such a proceeding by the SEC and thus cannot comment Congress is divided on crypto the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing titled crypto crash which indicated that post FTX collapse crypto may be emerging as a partisan

Vanderbilt law defended crypto's potential for Consumer empowerment and Financial inclusivity Republican Senators blamed the SEC and its chair Gary Gensler for the cryptocurrency crash meanwhile the Democrats seemed to think Gensler should be in charge of regulating the crypto industry although there is growing interest in crypto law proposals will likely face hurdles as the new Congress is split between parties also this week U.S lawmakers asked the SEC to release its Communications with FTX and its founder related to his arrest raising questions about the timing of the arrest and the sec's
