Mary's University School of Law who focuses on blockchain technology and a research fellow at University College London Centre for blockchain technologies welcome Preston and Angela thanks so much Laura Patti thanks so before we get into your criticism of the space how about each of you tell us a little bit about your histories Preston let's start with you what were you doing before and how did you learn about crypto and come to work in a space and what do you do now in it so before I was lawyer a lonely junior associate at at a London law firm doing securitization and you know at the time I started looking into things that I thought were interesting new technologies you know areas that I could distinguish my practice from that of my contemporaries and I stumbled assembled upon Bitcoin in 2013 and really the penny dropped for me when a friend of mine was working at a think tank water I said what if we took something like Bitcoin and turned it into an accounting system for for developing countries for example so you could reduce the incidence of fraud in in a developing economy simply by controlling the endpoints very tightly and using this as an alternative system for value transfer as so that plus actually dogecoin was when the penny really dropped because I realized you could make more than one version of these things and you could make as many as you like and that's how I got started back in 2013-14 and when you say the penny dropped for you what do you mean like you just got interested because since you are an own kind of skeptic and critic I want to know what you know what your feelings were like a lot of people who are not skeptics talk about falling falling down the rabbit hole and just getting obsessed but is that also what happened to you so there's a difference between being skeptical about what people say about the technology and being skeptical about technology . i'm certainly not skeptical about emerging technologies cryptography or distributed systems i think those are all very interesting very interesting technologies which are going to change the way we do business what i'm deeply skeptical about is the proposition that if this coin or that one we have to invest in it now and throw all of your money on it and millennials you should be putting 10% of your portfolio in it that kind of talk i find extremely irresponsible and and really not you know these are this is a database technology it's not a penny stock and so i'm quite optimistic that this is going to be a useful database a networking tool but i'm not so optimistic that it's going to be an investment proposition like investing in Google or Amazon in 1994 okay all right so let's turn to Angela what about you what was your prior background how did you learn about crypto and come to work in the space and what do you do now sure so like Preston I did practice law for a while kind of in the business transactional side and in 2012 I moved into academia as a law professor and my research interest at the time and still remains that was about money and how money works how many can break who should control money all those kinds of questions around it and those stemmed a lot from you know my experiences during the financial crisis I lived in London the time so was feeling very strongly wow differences in exchange rates and what causes that and got me very interested in how money works and as I was working on my research Bitcoin was being talked about as potentially a new form of money so I felt like I needed to look at that and once I started my research I became really really interested in it and I was interested in a lot of the statements that I was hearing about you know how is this just very automatic system and the software just runs and I couldn't get my head around that because it would seem to be that software is still coming from people and there's still people being involved in it and that that inconsistency I think got me much more interested in it and as I've watched the discussion happen about it and the great excitement forming I've seen that there is a real need for critical thinking clarity of thinking critical analysis in the space and there may well be some very interesting things happening and a lot of potential but I don't feel like we can know that unless we're critically thinking being honest about capabilities and what's really happening so that's that's the role that I see myself trying to fill in the space is asking common-sense questions so this is the perfect segue to talk about the overview of your criticisms of the space so for both of you if you were to take your criticisms and boil them down into one overarching theme or philosophy what would that be and person why don't we start with you all hat no cattle really would how I summarized so I'll just give an example right so let's talk about the Dow which was this you know this thing that was supposed to be a decentralized venture fund that was set up by some of the original aetherium guys they said well it's going to be this centralized venture fund it's gonna be great and everyone's gonna be able to invest and they're gonna get returns and won't be wonderful so of course the Dow failed first because it was hacked so you know that wasn't necessarily inevitable but but you know it did wind up failing for that reason but if that hadn't happened and you looked at how the thing actually worked there was actually no means where you could take an investment turn it into another token and then legally get the value of the token that you'd created with your investment to capitalize back into the downturn so this big bottomless hole that you just threw money into and there's no way to get anything back out and if you had looked at that as a lawyer and you'd said okay well let's structure this correctly you would have been able to identify that that the marketing wasn't able to match up with the the claims would you have a lot of software guys coming at it and there from the first time and kind of saying well we don't need to rely on legacy institutions we don't need to rely on legacy thinking we're just gonna reinvent the wheel and as a consequence they wind up creating things that don't work for the use cases that they're advertising wait person I actually don't know if I understood what your criticism was at the Dow are you saying that like there was no way for people to essentially like sell their doubt oaken's for like US dollars or I didn't fully understand what you were saying there so so with the Dow the set with the Dow the way the transaction worked was as follows you gave money to the dow smart contract the dow or you get ether to the dow smart contract in exchange for which the dow gave you down token so let's say it was one to one you give it one ether it gives you one down soakin the doubt token then gave you rights to vote on which projects the dow would go fund so it which never it never wound up funding any but let's say it did so you could vote and say I want to go fund you know ABC corporation over here because they're going to make marmot coin and I think that Marmot coin is going to be a great investment for the world so you give the Dow instructions you say go disburse the ether that we've just given to you and go give it to this company they will go create marmot coin and then they will go sell marmot coins and I will get the return from what's you know from the issuance of those marmot coins at that stage that last final piece of the transaction no one actually thought it through but there was no way you could get the tokens that were being issued the marmot coins at the end of that transaction and put them into the hands of the people who had invest in the Dow so they were putting money in and there was in the money was going to create you know reward tokens and various other things but there was no mechanism to go and take those tokens and whatever value was generated at that stage of the transaction and then pass it back to the Dow tokens in in the form of some kind of income flow or anything else it was just a pure speculation play and they were saying well the right to vote on which projects get the money we'll of course capitalized into the value of the tokens but that's not how it works that's that's a voting right but it's not an economic right so what they were doing is selling something and saying this is a voting right and you will get your doubt tokens will become more valuable but there was no mechanism by which anything that we would recognize as having economic value could pass backwards up the chain to the doubt token holders so to summarize your criticism it's sort of like saying people get really pie in the sky but then they don't look at the details and realize that actually none of these great sounding ideas can actually be manifested in reality yeah well they can be if you want to go and hire some lawyers and Sons and documents and you know get get a venture capitalist who knows how to manage money and have him run some money for you this technology can be useful in that setting where it's not going to be useful is if you try to sort of shortcut and get around all of those things I mean this stuff is this stuff is hard there's a reason you have to go to law school for three years in practice for five until they you know start letting you talk to clients and so a lot of what crypto 1.0 was doing because it had this crypto anarchist ethos about it was just to sort of throw the baby out with the bathwater and say we aren't going to follow any of the rules and as a consequence as I think we'll talk about in a bit people are starting to realize that that was a pretty major mistake what later on we'll come back to this idea about how you feel like what you really needed to do those kinds of things was actually a lawyer first let's find out it's from Angela you know if you were to boil down your criticisms into one overarching theme or philosophy what would that be okay so Preston had a great image they're all hat no cattle I guess my image would be running forward blindfolded carrying scissors people are rushing forward without real concepts of what they're doing they are assuming that the foundations of the technology are settled they are acting as if you know we know that anything that we call blockchain is immutable secure reflects truth it's trustless well those are all very much debated points amongst technologists in the space and yet people run forward anyway and I get very worried about that because people are talking about using the technology for our most critical social systems including in you know government settings for money itself financial systems all of those things and yet we're not critically thinking about what it would mean to move to this technology we're not being honest about its actual capability so that gets me very very nervous and so what do you worry could happen as a result of these risks that you see like what do you picture are some of the worst-case scenarios okay so some of the worst-case scenarios I see would be using these systems like big public blockchain systems as infrastructure which is you know the way that they're discussed in in many ways building things on top of them and if we you know put systems like property records or financial records or identity records or voting records on those and the tech is not nearly as resilient as as we expect then you know it all falls apart in a critical moment so suddenly there's a you know very contentious election and no one has any idea who who won it yet we relied on this and believed that it was going to be the savior here or the image that is most visceral to me and most accessible after the financial crisis is another financial crisis right and building financial records building money on top of these systems which I think are from my perspective quite rickety at the bottom particularly with governance issues and so you know you come to a critical moment the core developers and the mining community can't make a decision you know which way the software should go and again it all falls apart and because we have widely integrated these crypto currencies into our financial system for instance perhaps through all these financial products based on them that we're wanting to build then you have some sort of a systemic financial crisis so I like thinking about you know worst-case scenarios basically and Preston what about you I don't disagree with any of that to be honest with you I think that I think that the systemic risk is real we're starting to see that that play out with the major banks cutting off credit card access to something like coin based because they don't want to exposure to this stuff on their balance sheet so so yeah I don't really have too much to add to what Angela said on that point because I agree with it completely so for both of you whose behavior would you most like to change in the space and by that I mean not like any specific individual or come on ization is getting a group of actors whether it's like regulators or ico teams or developers or you know some other group how do you feel like they're acting that you would like to change several parties I would say regulators i and policy makers I would put on my list pretty high up and I would put them there because they are tasked with protecting society in many ways so it's their job to look at things critically and make sure that they're making good decisions on behalf of society and I'm pretty concerned with what I see in that respect in in that many reports that come out from you know prominent policymaking groups or regulators themselves seem to me to be restating things that are inaccurate about the technology and that makes me worry about their understanding and then what decisions they may ultimately make so I want regulators to be super skeptical I want policy makers to be super skeptical and I am I want them be cognizant of who they have advising them there are a lot of lobbying organizations for lack of a better word but I think it's fair that have grown up in the space industry funded organizations to push the cryptocurrency space forward to push the blockchain technology space forward and in many cases those are the organizations that are advising policymakers and regulators so I want those groups of policymakers the powerful people regulators to take what their hang with a grain of salt and seek out diverse opinions on this and don't just take the pie-in-the-sky version at face value that's one group I would say and so obviously I I'm the one who said not to name names but I couldn't help but immediately think of course of coin Center and the chamber of digital commerce is that who you're thinking of because as far as I know definitely coin Center is certainly industry funded I'm not sure about the chamber of digital commerce I'm not sure who else would be funding them to be honest I mean they're a Chamber of Commerce right so the business is in the industry but I really have to go back and double-check their their website but the people who are on their board are primarily you know industry players and and that's fine I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with the industry advocating for itself and seeking to explain what it sees as good about the technology to policy makers to regulators that's absolutely fair what I am saying is that regulators need to be aware of potential conflicts embedded in that and seek diverse perspectives and not only a single perspective and what about you Preston if there's any group or or organization whose behavior you would like to change in the space who would that be I don't think you really can't change anybody's behavior in the space you can only really align incentives in a certain way and at the moment the incentives are lined up or at least for the for the recent recent past last couple of years the incentives have been lined up in favor of frankly flagrant criminality so where we are now is we've seen recent recent comments from the SEC from the CFTC from the Treasury basically telling us that ico promoters in particular people who are selling coins to the public as an investment product are you no surprise surprise bound by regulation yep the activity still continues and I get to this day despite the fact that all of those announcements have come out and I think the reason is because the market hasn't understood priced in or quite you know quite wrapped its head around the idea of how serious the situation is for them and they just don't know what that there are any consequences to their actions so in software they have a concept called technical debt which is when you kind of leave features that you that you need to fix or you know code that's a little less slightly garbage you leave it in because you don't have time to fix it and so you then call that technical debt it's something you need to go address later because you haven't fixed it today we might think of what's going on now is kind of legal technical debt in the sense that we have companies that have said you know and think about it let's say you're a small start-up and one of your competitors icos and raises thirty million dollars overnight in Bitcoin and you're sitting there going to be seized and having to go through you know three to six-month diligence procedures and investment committees and it's hard to raise and at the end of the day you're only getting eight hundred thousand to two million for a seed stage product you know you look at that and you say well I can't win if I'm up against the company that's raising 30 million not at least today so all of a sudden you know just because one company does it then three others say well there's a really compelling reason for us to go do it as well so I think for you know backing up Angela's point the only thing that can stop this is regulatory intervention right in the US I think they're fairly skeptical although there are some some regulators which are routing a little fairly loudly for for the people they're supposed to be regulating which which is disconcerting in the EU from from where I hail I you know the European Parliament I think has been profoundly poorly advised by their advisers and some of the policy documents they put out look like they've been written by particular companies to say nothing of particular lobbying organizations that represent an entire industry so I think that's a huge problem and it's just going to take time for the regulators to get up to speed and they need to understand the incentives now everyone they're talking to has a financial incentive to make them get on board with their vision nobody or virtually no one out there has any financial incentive to tell people to hold their horses and slow up a bit so there are very few of as a consequence we're doing so yes that's a good point I'm very poor a person in the space it's hard to be a critic here because there are many incentives right I could I could do a lot better by advising I SEOs and there are plenty of other places that I could be making money but I'm you know this scrubbing it whatever academic here just criticizing everybody yes but then you would pay in your reputation which is much yes sir yeah so so I think you've chosen the right path but actually I wanted to you know both of you have kind of talked about regulators but I want to get kind of like your overall bead on how the regulator's have been doing like if you were to kind of give them a grade what grade would you give them in my home jurisdiction of the United Kingdom they get an F they didn't F - they haven't even they haven't even shown up and taken the exam we have denied them the permission to resit like I mean they they really have done nothing and despite the fact that there's a lot of really sketchy activity happening within their borders I think part of that's down - brexit and they don't want to be seen to be scaring people away Finn MA over in Switzerland I gave a D because they finally came out with some regulations but they have you know they have numerous projects going on within their borders which which are amenable to regulation and they haven't regulated in the US so part gets a c-minus so you know they get to they get to advance the second grade and because they at least at least they're doing something and we can see what's coming and I would to be fair it does take a lot of time to put this stuff together even when you had the flagrant penny stock frauds of the 1980s the DOJ didn't get involved for ten years so because you have to go build cases the SEC didn't get involved for several years so it takes time to do this it's reassuring to see the American regulators moving it but in Europe everybody's asleep at the wheel yeah so just focusing on what we're seeing with the regulators in the US like that SEC and the CFTC I'm encouraged that they are going after things like blatant fraud and I was encouraged after the Senate Banking Committee hearing by the things that you know the head of the SEC was saying but I do think it's really for them not to think that going after these blatant frauds is their only job here they're making important decisions about how cryptocurrencies in particular will be integrated or not into the financial system and so it's it's not as simple as enforcement actions it's what kind of products are ok are we thinking about systemic risks not just risk to individual consumers and again I mean I would reiterate what I was saying about regulators really need to be careful about who all they are getting advice from and these meetings like that I think the CFTC has a technology Advisory Committee or something that they they just recently met and I believe created new working groups for DLT and cryptocurrencies critics should be on those critics should absolutely be part of the conversation you don't just want people who are supporters I mean to me that's one of the things that is a lesson I guess from our behaviors that led us into the financial crisis in that supporters of mortgage-backed securities that subprime mortgages these very complex derivative structures there's a lot of cheerleading that led us into widely adopting these practices and I'm really concerned that all the cheer about all the cheerleading happening here and so both of you have mentioned the systemic risk that you think crypto poses to our financial system how do you see that playing out first Preston you wrote about one scenario didn't you yeah so so it depends on how big they let they let everything get right so Bitcoin right now it's market cap on very very thin trading is sort of a one large cap company and depending on how you look at it it could or could not be a systemic risk it depends on who's exposed to it and how much they're exposed to so if we want to say let's say 200 billion we'll take a round number like that and we ask ourselves is it 200 million 200 billion dollars of notional value somewhere it doesn't represent a systemic risk that depends on what people have done in relation to it have they have they lent it have days given it a security for obligations are they spending it and investing it in a particular type of asset for example startups or something else so that so that the price of that particular commodity is getting out of whack so there are whole bunch of different questions you can ask you know what happens to the retail consumer so let's say we allow the bubble to continue unabated and you have every American man woman and child or you know 25% of the population is in in the market for 10 to 15 grand I think Bitcoin in a Bitcoin fans would love that but what happens if suddenly you know the system gets wiped out under those circumstances there I think you would have a very big problem because you would you would just see a lot of notional wealth wiped out overnight and that would have broader consequences for the economy and also people are spending their going into debt to go purchase Bitcoin and get exposure to this market which is of course your classic you know classic source of systemic risk is debt so there are a range of areas where it could come from and I think the way that you really ensure that it doesn't spread is you take very proactive measures to ensure that banks keep this stuff off of their balance sheets because it really doesn't belong there at the moment we've heard complaints you know - and by the CFTC about the nature of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets they are very clearly to any observer that there's it's very clear to any observer that there's a huge amount of market manipulation which occurs some of the price movements and some of the altcoins where they go up 300% in a week that's very clearly not organic and it's driven from from someone somewhere and that's illegal so so the question is how much exposure do we want the mainstream financial system to have - with an asset which is so easy to manipulate and and thereby is so dangerous yeah so I would add to that right the it's the complexity of our financial system that makes it difficult to say it explicitly like how it would actually go but the more more bridges you build essentially between the crypto economy and the mainstream financial system the more it becomes integrated into banks balance sheets with this trend of you know oh it's a crypto asset now so I'm gonna make money off of this and you know the opportunity to to make big bucks offer cryptocurrencies I think is blinding the financial system of it to the big risks that are here so I I could see things rapidly rushing for it I mean I think the the Bitcoin futures were a that was kind of a tipping point I would say and while the SEC is currently holding the line against these ETFs I think wisely I don't know when that dam is going to break and then when once that does I think you've crossed the line between could be becoming a systemic risk to probably is a systemic risk right so there's a question about when when something becomes a systemic risk and when you should act in relation to it right if you see something potentially becoming a systemic risk if you take certain actions to get there do you choose now not to take those actions or you just you know lalala keeps strolling down the path until you're there and it's too late and I'd rather we anticipate those then reach them and then are you know shocked well we'll be discussing more specific criticisms of blockchain technology and the regulation around them plus icos and the sash but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsors appreciate and start engine now a word from our sponsor appreciate founded by ed Stevens preciate is building the most valuable relationships on earth each episode preciate recognizes an individual or group for their achievements in the crypto space this week we are recognizing the efforts of Ryan selcas McComas amaura and Michael Gollum their work on the ICO Governance Foundation has proven to be timely and important Ryan Miko and Michael are visionaries who knew the ICO market needed better disclosure and transparency and they are doing something about it we appreciate it listeners if you know someone in crypto who should be recognized on a future episode of Unchained take action and go to appreciate org slash recognize that's appreciate org slash recognized the growing crypto ecosystem is being challenged by uncertainties and regulations and start engine is here to help the SEC CFTC and state administrators have been issuing subpoenas by the dozens how is this going to affect icos and exchanges this is why start engine is launching its second edition of the ICO 2.0 summit co-sponsored by t0 on April 20th in Santa Monica this year's theme is the path to liquidity many influencers in the crypto world will be coming together to discuss how to move forward with regulated icos and regulated exchanges come in here crypto innovators such as brock pierce investor in over 30 blockchain companies patrick byrne t-zero CEO which is the next-generation crypto alternative trading system and many more leaders to register now and receive a 20% discount digit start engine comm and enter the code unchained 20 I'm speaking with Preston Byrne an independent consultant and English lawyer and Angela Walsh an associate professor at st. Mary's University School of Law who focuses on blockchain technology one question I had for you and this kind of goes back to something that Preston said earlier is I was wondering if you're both skeptics because you're lawyers meaning like are you skeptical because blockchain technology can remove middlemen and and some people are saying that it can serve as a sort of law right this is this our conflict of interest we want to keep our jobs so I do think it's interesting that there are some lawyers in the space who are have been the most vocal with their critiques it's not just lawyers though there are other people technologists people who aren't FinTech I'm thinking of people like Dave birch Steve Wilson Isabella Kaminski those those types are also skeptics and critics but I I don't think it's a coincidence that some of us are lawyers because law teaches you to be a critical thinker and to be absolutely skeptical of what your clients are telling you and to make them go through the Nitty Gritty of thinking through all the practicalities and what do you actually mean what how would you actually structure this metric are you kidding me so lawyers jobs are to think about the what-ifs so it's not necessarily surprising me that we both come from a legal background Preston I wanted to ask you about something that you've written about and spoken about elsewhere which is you've called Bitcoin not a Ponzi scheme but in Nakamoto scheme what do you how do you describe that so so when you again applying the legal training when you look at something like Bitcoin you ask yourself well what is the thing and what are people actually buying is their right to something you know chances are probably not it's it's basically just a right relative to the person who previously held held the coin just by way of example is it right to an income flow is it a security no well it's just kind of an internet fun buck which you can't really use you can accept trading for other internet fun bucks so so when you look at it from that perspective there are other schemes in history which have functioned in the same way generally speaking we call those pyramid schemes or Ponzi schemes where the right to participate in the scheme is the thing which is being sold or the ability to have some return from marketing you know getting others into this game is the thing that that's being sold the difference between what Bitcoin does and how it works it could very well be a system prepared of your cash and I think if we were talking about it in 2009 when people were buying pizzas with it then that was you know a use case then maybe we could have justified that that characterization but what we're seeing now we ask ourself what it is doing in form and substance it's something where people are investing it they're not spending it merchants aren't accepting it it's not serving any useful you know it's not really gotten a huge amount of adoption for anything except speculation and so when you ask yourself legally what that looks like it looks like one of those pyramid or Ponzi schemes the only difference is that nobody's guilty and everybody's guilty there's no the thing runs itself it's completely automatic it relies on the interests of all of its users in order to continue in operation and succeeding so we have to ask ourselves whether you know because there's nothing underlying it yeah sure maybe there's nothing that makes it illegal today but you know is there a legally culpable conduct around marketing or promoting it and certainly then when we look to the icos and the other schemes which are very naked lis investment schemes that are promoted by particular actors how should we regulate those so even though they're ostensibly fully automatic I think the view from the laterz point of view is that they should be regulated as investments because that's how they function that's the part of the function they perform in society but so a large part of that criticism relied on the fact that Bitcoin isn't widely used yet as payments but if it were then does that criticism hold up I think if Bitcoin were being issued by a single company and so with you know let's call it Bitcoin Inc right it had to see you know the infamous you know mythological CEO of Bitcoin and they were selling bitcoins to people and they said you know maybe other people will buy the bitcoins and they'll go up in value and they'll go down in value and it was the exact same technology the only difference was that it was run by a company you know based in in an office in New Jersey somewhere if that were what how Bitcoin worked it would almost unquestionably be illegal you know in the UK and it would very likely you know in my and my none you know I'm not a u.s. lawyer obviously but from what I understand of US law it would be very likely that it'd be illegal in the United States as well unless you went through registration requirements and registered as a security etc etc etc so so the point is that Bitcoin does something which should be illegal but it does it in a way where there's nobody who's culpable for the activity because the thing runs itself and that's something the law hasn't really seen before and it's just a way of looking at it and saying well if we were to take a really extreme pessimist view of how this stuff works what would we say the thing is and it would be lazy to say it's a pyramid scheme or a Ponzi scheme because it is neither of those things because there's no person managing cash flows which gives rise to legal liability in the hands of that person the person has been removed it's then you know automated that person's functions and you know that it raises some interesting questions from how we think the technology will be used in the long term by automating roles of say transactional counterparties but when it's done is its automated away that middleman and it said you can send money back and forth to each other and we built this whole ecosystem around it for people to invest but the important thing is that the middleman has disappeared but what if we were talking about Yap stones instead like do you know what I'm saying to my mind there is a way in which you're describing this where it almost is like you're saying oh because it's not a government-issued money that's why it's illegal but what if it were something that society decided as money what if it were like seashells or or yob stones like I mentioned is that still something that you would view as a Nakamoto scheme we use things as substitutes for money all the time securities in particular are frequently used triple-a rated securities are effectively as good as money they're IO use which people trade at very close toop our Treasuries are also just as good as money they're they're quite similarly you know similarly used as a safe storage for money that you can trade and you know they won't have their value go anywhere well we have to look at in context what bitcoin if Bitcoin were money and we said well it's just going to be used 1 for 1 and people are using it for goods and services and it emerged to fill that role for some reason but yeah I don't think there's any reason why we couldn't say well this is the new money and you know for some reason it's it's vastly superior to what came before for a reasons ABCDE I don't think that's going to happen because Bitcoin doesn't scale very well to start and secondly if we look at the context in which Bitcoin operates we already have money in every society which you know in which people people live there's you know it slightly deflate or slightly inflationary money supply that devalues over time and so we have to ask and what people are doing is they're saying we're creating these coins and why are we creating the coins so we can get a hold of other people's money it's not like it's so we're being really honest with ourselves this is not a new money that we're dealing with it's a new way to obtain money from other people who think that buying the thing with their money is going to result in their making money so some people said well yeah could be used as an alternative to money but the fact is that's not how it's being used as being used as an investment an Angela I wanted to ask you about a criticism that you've written about you've said that blockchain developers are fiduciaries and the core developers and miners are actually in control of lock chains and so it's a romantic idea that these block chains are decentralized and that we don't have to trust anyone why do you say those things and do you think it is possible for any blockchain to be truly decentralized yeah so the first one of the first things I said today you know kind of how I came into the space was noticing what seemed to me to be a real inconsistency right that these systems were just they're decentralized so there's not really any humans doing anything and Preston was talking about that a little bit in his in his discussion just now that we've managed to automate a lot of these things and once I started you know following all that different message boards and trying to get a sense of what was happening within like the Bitcoin ecosystem particularly you start noticing that there are people who have large followings developers who have large followings who seem to be very influential in what they say how people take what they say they make decisions and it struck me that well we actually have governance still happening here we're just not acting as if we do we're acting as if this the decentralization or the nominal decentralization of the the nodes in the network has meant that we suddenly somehow escaped governance and I see there as being probably a few ways that governance happens in Bitcoin for example one of one of the ways that governance happens is through the software development process and you know with open-source software at least this grassroots what I call grassroots open-source software development you know everyone essentially has the ability to make changes to the code at-least proposed changes to the code but a small group of people actually helps to make the decisions about what actually ends up in the code and actually has commit access meaning the ability to actually make changes to the code and that's the core developers and we've seen power struggles in Bitcoin you know some core developers have fallen from power like Gavin Andresen after the whole Craig Wright fiasco and just like these vicious kind of turf wars right and to me that demonstrates that people are fighting for power and we people who are participating in the system whether it's by buying Bitcoin or building businesses on top of Bitcoin are putting a great deal of trust in the in the competence of the core developers to actually think and understand the technology well enough to make good decisions about what should be in the code and we're also putting a great deal of trust in the fact that they are not conflicted in a particular way right and this relates to how they're paid there's been a lot in Bitcoin particularly there's been a lot of flux about how the core developers should be and our page should they be paid by companies within the ecosystem in which case are they going to make decisions for the good of the company who pays their salary or for the good of the public system should they just be paid by making investments in the particular coin and have to you know support themselves off of that so there's a lot of questions here and I so for the core developers I definitely see them as a power center I see big miners a different type of governance happening in the the transaction processing Network and and that manifests through the choice about which version of software to run and we've seen like the two different power centers have meetings the core developers and the big you know mining pools get together and have meetings about what should be the direction of the network so and you know related to this is all the research has come out about how concentrated mining actually is in the Bitcoin ecosystem in and others in aetherium as well so I think we are by pretending that things are you know fully decentralized and no one has power we are committing the error of failing to acknowledge power which means the power that is there is unchecked and undefined and what do you think of these block chains that propose was on chain governance for instance tezo's will you know for any particular proposal that makes it past a certain level of support they will pose that as a vote to all the token holders and then any change that again makes it past a certain threshold and the votes will be automatically incorporated into the blockchain and therefore it isn't really these you know I guess what you could say is like whoever's proposing is going to be limited to developers but of course they have no control over whether or not their changes get adopted and then in terms of like who is paying the developers I know systems like T's O's propose that any changes that do get adopted that those developers who proposed them will then receive a certain amount of new tokens that have been minted for the blockchain which will inflate the supply but if people vote for that change then it means that they believe that the change will likely result in an increase in the value of their tokens that makes it worth it to inflate the supply by that small amount so what do you for both of you Preston and Angela what do you think of Unchained governance you feel like that answers these criticisms about some of these machines not truly being decentralized I think it's pretty dumb to be honest with you I mean I come up with these one-word answers I guess when you when you're critic for a long time right you sit you've seen this I've seen this happen before right we've seen this story and what the story is is let's again go back to the Dow the Dow had a quorum of 10% an hour no 20% of the token holders and of that 20% you needed to bear majorities so you needed 50% plus one and they couldn't ever get a quorum of users to actually go and vote on which proposals they were they were going to they were going to advance and so with so you it's really hard to get your users sufficiently invested to vote at all we know that from from the experience of the Dow first second the users in most cases will not be as competent as a consensus among developers to decide which way these protocols are going to go if we're talking about let's say you know the adoption of this or that proof of stake protocol for any particular blockchain you know there there may be 15 people 20 people alive who are who are competent to make those kinds of decisions and have intelligent comments about whether whether these systems work or not so so when when you then say well no we're going to turn it over to the users and they're going to decide whether we go with Kasper or whether we go with scooby-doo or whether we go with this other protocol you know we just came to the stupid name for you're really you're really saying it doesn't make a lot of sense it's these are these users have an economic interest in the protocol when they're when they're buying their tokens that doesn't necessarily mean you should start listening to them to make development decisions but you should you know you should should is a strong word but but yeah yeah I don't really think users have much business and telling developers what to do the developers have their own incentives for for making sure that their feature sets mash user demand but I think it's one of those things again like and lon you know the client chooses the objectives the lawyer chooses the means the users they're there their objectives are simple have a system that works the developers then choose the means by which they can accomplish that and so when you're saying well we're gonna automatically push code onto the blockchain it strikes me that that's the users also have a choice they can vote with they can vote very easily by choosing to either run the client they were running before or if it's hard fork they can go migrate over to the new client or they can do what Bitcoin cash or not Bitcoin cash excuse me a theorem classic did and they can say we're not running the new client we're running the old client because we don't like changes you make so I don't really see why you need to put that on a blockchain because it's just it's really a human thing and if the change is approved and it's good and it works your users will use it Angela do you have an opinion on that as far as like this current dawn cheese Barrowman with Unchained governance I'm still thinking through that what I what I would say is that it I think it's a step forward to acknowledge that governance is actually occurring and necessary in these systems so I do think that is kind of an evolution from the initial Bitcoin type system I'm not sure whether they're you know they're still experiments I would say and I think Kristen makes a good point about whether any generic user actually has the knowledge to to cast a responsible vote one way or the other about how the system should work I know that I certainly wouldn't be able to I'd be essentially again going based on recommendations from developers who are trusted parties in these systems and I mean I I think that my argument about developers functioning as fiduciaries in these systems is is probably true even in the on chain governance setting because they would be essentially giving recommendations and crafting the the code that actually has to work so they're still exercising power and being influential and people are relying on their judgment and lack of conflicts I think even in those settings so Preston I wanted to ask you about your contention that private blockchains will be more consequential than public ones I wanted to ask you about this because and this is I know a common refrain but I do think it's true history shows that open beats closed whether you're talking about the internet or nation-states so why do you believe it will be different this time I mean I think when people say private blockchains or permission blockchains are closed they're deliberately adopting their sort of mischaracterizing how the software is used how it's going to be used and and how it actually functions so when I say open and I talked about blockchains being an open technology block chains are open source database types right and databases have conquered the world you know in the last 30 35 years but they have done so not in the sense that we we take all of our data and expose it so that everybody can see it some things we share and expose to the world you know over website and other things we don't and we store them you know on servers somewhere seblak chains if we look at them as kind of an understanding between a database and some network infrastructure in that it's designed to hold some data and some rules about how a transaction or some other procedure is supposed to be executed and it's supposed to be run between a bunch of different parties there is scope for things which are more open where for example Facebook is designed to be pretty much open Twitter is also designed to be very very open but if you talk to you know confluence that is designed to be closed each of those applications uses databases at some point but that doesn't necessarily mean that every single use of it you know by every single user has to be open to the public you know you use different data structures or different permissions for different types of applications so with block chains it will be no different we will have I think many many millions of them but it depends on now let's say you want to do bonds right you want to go automate bonds do you want to show do you want to put all the bonds in the world on one blockchain where everybody can see what everybody else is doing no why because notice there are some transactions that people don't have any business knowing you know what's going on with with a particular transaction there are others where you know it's going to be more public so let's say for example we're looking at repos with a central bank that might be something which is a little more public so you might want more transparency there but then again there will be private placements where you could benefit quite substantially from having an automated solution between the various bondholders and transaction parties but where you wouldn't want Joe Bloggs on the street to even know that the thing existed because because you know you don't want to publicly offer our market securities right so there are a whole range of different applications that you can use this for each one of them is going to have a different set of assumptions attached with it and the default option is not going to always be everything public all the time particularly for enterprise applications particularly after the EU GDP are comes into force so so so that that's I think the long and short answer it just doesn't this completely totally open model is doesn't reflect commercial reality yeah and the GDP are that's the right to be forgotten where you can have your data room is that what that is so they have a right to erasure in it so that that's a right to have your data removed but also you have to preserve and protect user you know personally identifiable information and user information which is within your possession as a data controller so so for example it's not going to be sufficient just to drop a hash in of your personal information and say well no we've got the hash and it's a one-way function you know you're not gonna be able to reverse-engineer it it's sha-256 it's fine the EU appears to be taking a very dim view of that and saying look if the data is exposed and if it's conceivable or possible that it could be decrypted however unlikely then we have to assume that that is an unacceptable exposure of personal data which you are meant to keep private as a data controller so those issues are going to be pretty significant in the EU understanding how we obscure user data that eventually finds its way onto the blockchain as or a blockchain as a proof of some kind that's an interesting point that you make I mean certainly there are needs for privacy in the kinds of spaces that block chains are working in like obviously in finance but at the same time there obviously are technological solutions to those issues which is why we see things like JPMorgan Chase getting interested in things like ZK snarks so we'll see how that plays out it I mean definitely there there will be a place I think for closed systems as we have seen even with the internet obviously it's not like Internet's just went away but who knows over time I do my personal opinion is that the open systems will likely become much bigger than any of the closed ones but let's actually revert back to what we started talking about in the beginning which was the regulatory issues so obviously we do have this news that the SEC recently or not even so recently but in recent months issued subpoenas to at least 80 ICO issuers what do you think of the SE C's actions so far and where do you think they're going with this and how do you think the regulatory actions they're taking will shakeout ultimately so I am NOT super active on the Securities side of this so Preston if you wanted to take that one feel free yeah sure so I think I mean subject to the proviso again I'm not a US qualified lawyer but I do talk to them all the time in the space what's happening now has been long overdue whenever I speak to a practitioner you know the reasonably eminent global law firms what I've heard for the last six seven months is everybody kind of sitting there dumbfounded saying when is when is this going to happen because these kind of concerns about registering securities or rather not you know marketing unregistered securities to the public those are paramount in securities practice in England you know not selling securities into the United States was a very important consideration for anybody selling securities in the United Kingdom because you do not want to annoy the SEC or in the US federal government so so I think as Stephen Paley from Andersen kill put it this way he said none of this is a surprise and and I agree with him in that respect it's just that the market is really full of a lot of neophytes to do to the world of securities regulation and public markets and so as a consequence they just weren't aware or they weren't taking advice or I don't know what so so what I think is it's the beginning of a really long enforcement journey you know there's the sending out of subpoenas that a week ago from from the date of recording this podcast you know when the SEC set those out that's a fact-finding exercise that's not enforcement action and so the enforcement action will come in the form of settlements in in you know in some cases and other cases you know maybe these companies will stand and fight I don't think a lot of them really are going to have the guts to do that because it's fairly clear-cut in a lot of cases I think what they were doing so it's the beginning of a long journey we're gonna see a lot of lawsuits we're gonna see a lot of enforcement actions eventually at some point we're going to see the Department of Justice get involved and eventually at some point we're going to see the Europeans do some regulatory activity but as far as the u.s. is concerned I think you know the train has left the station and everyone's just kind of bracing and waiting to see what happens next and do you think that there's any particular type of ico that would be legal beyond just registering them all as securities I mean I think that's I think that's out of my wheelhouse saying what what is and is legal in the United States what I would say is that there are projects which are proceeding on the assumption that that whatever you're offering on a blockchain if it's being sold to the public as an investment it's going to be regulated as a security so in particular you have templum based in New York City that's run by Chris pelota it's a raptor group and that's an interesting project and they are looking to do compliance icos of a sort or we might even call it you know automated securities issuance rather than AI cos similarly a recently announced project by David David Sachs of PayPal Fame called Harbor that also is is another project which is proceeding on the basis that ICO coins where ever you know wherever we may find them are likely to behave as securities and therefore should be regulated like securities and I think that's really interesting because then you're saying we recognize that we have this new form of tidal transfer you know instrument or title transfer technology which is extremely efficient and gives us a really really perfect record of title so if you wanted to go and see whether a security was encumbered it would be really trivial to put all of that information about that security and have a have a blockchain manage all of that data and all of those parties saying well here's an instrument you know it's blocked you know the blood the account is blocked because we pledged it to this guy and so he's taken control by asserting asserting his security interest over it by sending this transaction to that smart contract right that's all doable on a blockchain and it's doable in a really automatic and transparent way as opposed to sending letters and making phone calls so you could probably automate a lot of manual labor way doing it so these companies recognize that and I think if you nail that do you then look at what the ICO space has done today I think what it shows us is that there's a huge amount of demand for non-traditional or higher risk investment propositions because people aren't getting any money from leaving it in the banks and so they say well how can we allocate some of our portfolio to something that's higher risk so if you can combine the desire for high risk investment with and actually legally compliance that issuance and trading platform that is more effective and efficient than the current solutions for that I think you have something very potent which could actually be much bigger in terms of the amounts involved then we have seen in this boom so by under by an order of magnitude I mean what it does those I think moving towards those compliance ICS as Preston is describing you know that is very inconsistent though with the whole messaging that there's been around that you know the democratization of investment opportunities and stuff like essentially you're still in the same world of who can access access these investments and so I guess I would put that in it on the list of things that may not be may have been over statements about the revolutionary potential of the technology right yeah it's making it more efficient perhaps but not necessarily transforming the world about who gets to invest right which is something I was actually on a podcast myself recently and found myself arguing in one direction and then being like and I could argue it the other way and then pivoting and saying yeah they should be treated like securities so I can see it both ways last question for you guys what is it like being a critic in Atlanta believers lonely it's sometimes tough to keep going I guess but I feel like it's important that some people come out and do it if nobody's doing it I just I worry about where we'll end up so I do feel actually pressure and I've got probably about a hundred papers that I feel like I should be writing you know immediately to try to balance out the discussion that I see going on in the space and it's just impossible to do to do it fast enough but I would say that there are plenty of critical thinkers out there who are not necessarily known as critics I think there are a lot of the you know the very well educated technologists in the space who I mean they follow me on Twitter for some reason and some of them have said they follow me because I offer a you know a counter perspective to the hype and I think that there's a lot that you know you were asking earlier about the who's behavior I would change in the space and in addition to you know asking regulators to and policymakers to step up and be very critical thinkers I would ask thought leaders really to do the same because I think there's a lot of damage done potentially by non-critical thought leaders proselytizing about the technology all over the place and giving an unbalanced view of it so that's what I would say Preston what about you I kind of kind of like being among my favorite my favorite animal as as some of your listeners may know or may not know as a marmot and and of marmots my particular favorite is Momo Timon acts the the solitary critter a groundhog that lives on the American East Coast and they just wander around hanging up by themselves eat plants I mean that that's those are some of their favorite pastimes and this kind of that's kind of how I like to live my life I think it's it's you know I break from the Mars in that regard but where where was i before I went off on that yeah it's it's a lonely world being a critic but I think it is slightly selfish because I you know you look at the historical patterns of how financial manias emerged and you look at the behavior of everybody and then particularly you look at the marketing which is selling this stuff and then you line it up against the capabilities of the technology and you see that there's such a huge gulf between the enthusiasm and what that enthusiasm will eventually deliver that you know it's inevitable at some points the party's going to end when people are realizing that they've the technology has been oversold and they will Ratchet back their expectations and so I'm kind of waiting for that day to come and you know I think it'll come from two things firstly a you know the technology being oversold eventually people are going to realize that that they happen in many cases sold a bill of goods and also the regulators are going to prevent a lot of this marketing from taking place because they're going to come down and say look guys you're not supposed to do this you're not allowed to do this if you're going to be selling investments you need to have a prospectus it needs to have a you can be dense auditors you need to have some lawyers go through it and all of those rules will be restored and you know the rule of law will be restored and everything will go back to normal but we will have all of this really interesting infrastructure to do the compliant things which when when that's all done so being lonely you know in the space I you know I've made some very good friends among the critics people I really like and respect so you know there aren't many of us and I think we all know each other so and so that's been a real positive and then of course when when it all falls apart we have the satisfaction of not maybe getting rich but certainly of being right you can smile the castle was burning in the barbarians sitting there smoking a cigarette [Laughter] okay well have you both back on at that time and we'll bring a marmot mascot as well onto the episode all right well it's been great having you both as guests where can people get in touch with you or see your work so I'm on Twitter I'm Angela underscore Walsh wal CH and they also have a website that catalogs my work at
