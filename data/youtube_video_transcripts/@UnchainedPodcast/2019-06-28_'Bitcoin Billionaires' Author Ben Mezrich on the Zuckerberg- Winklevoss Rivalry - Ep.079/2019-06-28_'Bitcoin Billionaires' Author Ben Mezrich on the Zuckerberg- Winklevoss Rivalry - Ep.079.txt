check out my interview with CEO Jeremy Welch thank you to Casa for donating cipher trace cutting-edge cryptocurrency intelligence powers anti-money laundering blockchain analytics and threat Intel leading exchanges virtual currency businesses banks and regulators themselves use cipher trace to comply with regulation and to monitor compliance today's guest is Ben Mezrich author of the book Bitcoin billionaires welcome Ben hey thanks so much for having me tell us what your book is about and how you came to write it sure Bitcoin billionaires is the true story of the Winklevoss twins and their rise in Bitcoin it begins with the settlement they received from Mark Zuckerberg so it starts where the social network ended and then it goes all the way to Bitcoin 10,000 or the first time Bitcoin reached 10,000 so it's really the story of their journey through this new revolution having already been part of one other revolution and when you reference the social network you are also the author of the book that that movie was based on so what how did you if you you know since you previously wrote that book how do you then decide to sort of do this quasi sequel right well you know when I wrote accidental billionaires which became the movie The Social Network the Winklevoss twins were the bad guys in that story you know they were the alpha males they were the jocks they were the cool kids on campus who claimed that Mark Zuckerberg had stolen the idea from Facebook from them and when I wrote that book you know they were kind of OneNote characters I didn't really you know get to know them that deeply and about a year and a half ago I read in the New York Times that the Winklevoss twins were the first real Bitcoin billionaires and this kind of blew my mind I didn't really know what Bitcoin was people had been pitching me stories about Bitcoin for years but I had kind of avoided it and just seeing that the twins were suddenly back in this news story it really intrigued me because you don't usually see second acts like that and and I got to know them again and realized I had gotten them wrong in the first telling and so I think the social network was unfair to them and I think I'm kind of regretting that with Bitcoin billionaires and what exactly did you get wrong well you know those guys when they walk into a room you know there's like something out of Greek mythology you meet them for the first time and they remind you of every 80s movie you've ever seen they're the guys I hid from in high school I was in a locker hiding from guys who looked like Tyler and Cameron and I judged them you know and when I wrote accent of billionaires there there was something really respectable about them you know they were men of Honor they believed in right and wrong they believed that Mark Zuckerberg was screwing them over and that was such drove them so all of that I think was correct but I also painted them I think as just you know one sided so I think that's where I got them wrong the reality is I mean these guys are very smart they speak multiple languages they're Latin scholars and how they dove into Bitcoin and sort of the new economy of cryptocurrency it sheds an entirely new light on on who they are and then you go back to look at them in Zuckerberg and you start to wonder well what what was really going on there I mean were they really these guys that didn't know what they were doing in Zuckerberg then built Facebook or did they have some entry ideas that mark ended up taking from them and there was some information I believe that you didn't have access to when you wrote accidental billionaires which came out later can you talk about that a little bit and how that also changed your view yeah absolutely so these instant messages that were on Mark Zuckerberg computer at college they didn't come out till after the Winklevoss twins ended up getting their settlement and pretty much after we did the social network and these instant messages are are pretty damning you know they're Mark Zuckerberg strategizing about how to screw over the Winklevoss twins there's some quotes in there that are about how you know he calls all of us dumb F I don't know what you could say right yeah on this no yes right right but he basically you know talks about how people are foolish to give them all their information how he feels like it's okay to be unethical as long as you don't do something illegal all of these quotes make him look really bad but they also frame his battle with the Winklevoss twins differently because he admits in these instant messages to stringing them along with their idea and then launching Facebook at the last minute so they can't do anything about it and so this shows this strategy to destroy them so I think this is very new information he also it turns out had hacked into their web site they had created something called the harvardconnection com which was later renamed connect you and he made a fake profile of Cameron Winklevoss you know with all of this kind of racist sexist horrible stuff in it and put it online now if you were to do that today in the environment of today I mean Zuckerberg would never have recovered from that so this was something that didn't come out when we did the social networking and I think it colors him very badly so let's pan out a little bit because obviously to write the two books you had to research both social media or Internet 2.0 and then obviously now for the new book Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies pretty extensively so what's your assessment of the two types of technology and which are you more excited by well I will say they are both revolutionary I think when Facebook first happened it was this revolution in the social order it changed how we all live it made the whole world go online in a way that we hadn't before and it changed everything and now I feel like Bitcoin is the same thing I only choose stories where I think there's going to be some massive world change because of it and bitcoin is one of these things and you know I came to this as someone who didn't know anything about it who my parents generation called it a scam and I believed it was a bubble or a scam but as I looked into it and as I sort of dove into this story I came to believe that this is really a revolution in money but it's also a way of freeing ourselves from from all of these sort of you know shackles of an old world banking system of borders you know it's something if done correctly can really be peer-to-peer really doesn't need someone in between it and I thought that was a really cool sort of concept and so I do see in Bitcoin some of the same things I saw in Facebook and which I'm more excited by now is definitely Bitcoin because Facebook has taken a real turn it's become this monster which I believe it was already always intended to be I think Zuckerberg plan was always to dominate the world you know he says so himself in his instant messages I think he always wanted us all to live on Facebook without power over our own data because he thinks a world where we can share our data completely as a better world so I think Facebook is actually on going the other way where people are starting to see it as this bad dangerous thing while digital money is just getting started and do you feel that there's a reason for why we're seeing this interest in Bitcoin and in decentralization broadly like do you think that's part of this backlash that we're seeing against Facebook or are they not really related no I think they're definitely related I think we're seeing a revolution going on and people really you know feeling the the weight of companies like Facebook and not just Facebook let's be fair at Google all of these major companies are they feel like you know they're taking advantage of us in a way that they've created something out of the Internet that it wasn't intended to be I mean the internet was supposed to be free and open and it change of ideas without anybody sort of harnessing all of that and siloing it and what Facebook and these major companies did was found a way to make money off of our data by controlling it and by capturing it and I do think there's this trend well you have to admit Bitcoin started as this libertarian almost an artistic thing it was a form of philosophy in a way it was a way of being free not having you know anything in between not you know secret as it could be and I think these still feed into it even as it becomes more regulated and part of the system so I do think what's going on in money is a response to things like Facebook but also you know overarching government as a whole or the feeling that you know more and more we're being controlled by other people I do think Bitcoin is is sort of a freeing mechanism so we're gonna discuss the swing in the opposite direction and what I mean by that is Facebook's Libra in a moment but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government backed stable coins become the new Fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and

your thoughts on the future direction of Unchained and enter the giveaway back to my conversation with Ben Mezrich author of Bitcoin billionaires so as you mentioned initially you know Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg maybe had the intention to have a centralized platform that the world would be on and you talked about how Bitcoin or decentralisation might be a response to that but now Facebook is trying to kind of get on that train as well what's your take on Facebook's Libra I mean how incredibly insane is it that you know the Winklevoss twins rise up in Bitcoin and create Gemini and launch a Gemini dollar and all of a sudden Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg respond launching Libra I ended Bitcoin billionaires on the last chapter with Zuckerberg contemplating a cryptocurrency and I wrote this you know a year ago and for me I believe it was all personal you know I think Zuckerberg sees the Winklevoss twins rising in this new form of money that Silicon Valley missed entirely you know Facebook all of these companies are so late in the game in digital but it makes perfect sense that he would launch one because Facebook's goal you know is to dominate everything and I think this is another mechanism for that an even bigger one so it is fascinating that they're launching Libra I think Lieber is both exciting and terror buying you know it's exciting and that everyone and their mom is gonna suddenly have an electronic wallet everyone is going to get comfortable with youjung digital money with peer-to-peer but not really peer-to-peer because Lieber isn't really that way but the idea of crypto this is a big on-ramp but at the same time this is still Facebook and not just Facebook now eBay and uber and all of these people who signed up to be the center of this decentralized thing so what you're seeing is Facebook finding a way to create a crypto that keeps them in the middle so it is terrifying I mean suddenly Facebook is gonna have access to an enormous amount of data and information is going to be taking your money holding it earning money on it but it's also allowing you to get used to electronic currency so you kind of I mean you said that basically you think this is personal which is kind of interesting and so and that light if Libra is basically going to roll cryptocurrency or digital currency out to a larger user base than any previous company has so far to a user base that's larger than any country even on earth do you think that Tyler and Cameron could be a sort of a clips on their own turf yeah I mean it's crazy you know and people when I say this is all personal you know I get pushed back obviously people are like no it's just a coincidence I really don't think this is a coincidence how does he call it Libra he's fully aware of the twins in Gemini he also have to remember that Zuckerberg was was a hacker you know he started off as a computer hacker he launched Facebook after hacking all of the computers at Harvard and making a website where you could compare girls and choose who was the hottest girl at Harvard this is a guy who has a strange sense of humor who definitely you know was the epitome of an internet troll I mean he hacked the website of Cameron and Tyler and made a web page making fun of Cameron so I do not put it past him to do this on purpose and yes it could Eclipse Gemini it could Eclipse the twins on the other hand they made this huge investment in Bitcoin you know they own one percent of all Bitcoin which they bought between seven and ten dollars a coin so when you send at that time at that time right so they've made billions on this or at least close to 2 billion at this point more if you believe that they've bought more on the dips nobody knows for sure I don't think how much they have but if this bolsters the entire thing and I think it will because you have to remember Libra it's not a store of value like gold Libra is tied to fiat right so Libra isn't something that you invest in it's something that you use while Bitcoin is trending more and more to something you invest in rather than something that you use so if Libra succeeds you could foresee bitcoins succeeding similarly like gold you know like rising and rising and rising as more and more people use Libra so as somebody who has been following the Facebook story what do you think mark or Facebook can do or should do with Libra given what the public perceives is a poor track record around privacy I mean that's a great question and and I would say listen Facebook has a lot of problems and I think one of them is they're built around harvesting data and using it to make money and that's a horrible look you know it's very hard to get past that it makes them all look very bad they're offering themselves up to regulation they keep saying you know regulate us we want to be regulated which is really their way of saying let us regulate ourselves or let's find a way to look better in front of everybody I think they need to find a way to to change their business model i I think that Libra has to be perceived as something that is really not giving them data that they're not taking and using that data for any other reason that it's merely a mechanism for paying for something which they enable but they take nothing else from it I'm not certain what the actual steps are you could take to do that and you might know better than me I just think that they have a real perception problem because of the way their business is built you know you really should be able to use Facebook and not have your data used to target things at you Mark Zuckerberg likes to say you know it enhances our experience nobody's experience is enhanced by advertising advertising is never enhancing your experience it's just part of the process to pay for something so I think that that's not true so I think they need to find a way to get past that use of data and Libra is something that shouldn't be used for data gathering yeah well Facebook is launching or has launched this subsidiary Calibra which will be the wallet and supposedly there will be a wall between Calibra and Facebook but I think the issue still is that calibra simply by virtue of being embedded in what's happened messenger will just mass amounts vast amounts of data financial data on people so you know then then calibra is the one to worry about so one other thing I wanted to ask about the kind of rivalry that you discussed between mark and the twins in my understanding of things that sort of seems like mark kind of screwed the twins over so in that regard like he won right so then what would motivate him to keep up this this kind of personal rivalry or animus I mean right I think I could understand it from their side they felt that way but then I don't understand why from his side he would well you go back to the story and you know this is recounted in Bitcoin billionaires but he won in a way he settled with them for 65 million dollars which they then took in stock which ended up being worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the IPO but they didn't stop there they really believed that they deserved more and that he had screwed them over and as these IMS came out later they attempted to reopen the case multiple times it was shot down by it by judges who had their own issues and and so they didn't give up at that point you know I framed the whole book like The Count of Monte Cristo where they disappeared to a cave and come back riding into town with their billions of dollars in Bitcoin but the reality is they maintain this hole of animosity essentially because they felt that they had been wronged and wronged again and it hadn't recovered it was definitely true that when they went out to Silicon Valley after the settlement and tried to become investors no would take their money because everyone's endgame was to sell to Facebook and everyone knew Zuckerberg Harvard this animosity towards them so his animosity didn't go away then you have the movie right the social network and all of the resulting publicity which continued this this personal psycho drama in the public eye for many many years afterwards and I don't think Zuckerberg ever really went away from that you know he's the kind of guy who is difficult to get along with you seem person after person leave the company and then say bad things about it or if they have a nondisclosure not say anything at all because of the way he treats people who are partners of his I don't believe that he walks away from this and just forgets about them so you know that's listen it's if someone needs to ask him and no one does about what he thinks of the Winklevoss twins now and I'd be curious to hear the answer but I don't believe he's completely forgotten about them sorry well my last question for you is more about your writing and reporting process because as I was reading the book I could not help but notice that there were a lot of details where I just thought how does Ben know that for instance there you know maybe was a detail where you said like Oh Charlies rolling suitcase snagged on the floor as he walked in the airport or these were you know the person in front of Cameron and the airport security line was wearing argyle socks or you know there were just numerous details like that so how did you find those details and also how did you recreate so much dialogue yeah so I spend the way I do my process is I spend a lot of time with the characters so the Winklevoss twins with Charlie you know spoke to Roger ver as much as I could to Eric for he's I talked to all of these people I get all of the court documents that I can Charlie's arrest scene is a really fascinating scene and and I built that scene off of talking to him for a very long time and you know he's read the book and and said that that seemed felt absolutely real like it was yesterday and so my goal in creating those scenes essentially recreating those scenes is to take all of the information I've been given by the people who were there and then paint the picture as much as I can so details like his suitcase snagging on the ground well he describes to me going through the airport the arrest process what's going through his head and the fumbling along in that scene is recreated from that so I'm painting the picture now I write differently than some journalists do if I were writing for the New York Times you wouldn't get that level of detail because you know the color of his suitcase would be something that you couldn't definitely know right but the way I write narrative nonfiction and I'm very open about this is I'm recreating the scene based on the memories of the people who were there and the information that I can gather about that scene and then I draw the scene so it is like watching a movie about that scene it would be very hard to film a movie scene showing Charlie getting rest in the airport without describing the airport right so you look at the airport and you describe it you can't possibly know what the color of the wall was ten years ago but you know there was a color on that wall and so for me painting a non-fiction picture is really similar to what a movie does which is you you frame the shot this is what that shot would look like this is how Charlie remembers that shot dialogue is similar you know you ain't you interview the people who were there they tell you what was spoken about you don't get the exact words and then again if you were writing for the New York Times you might need the exact words but if you're painting the picture for a movie or a form of narrative nonfiction it's not the exact words that matter as much as what was said so that's a choice I make and and you know I understand that they're going to be journalists out there who don't like that form of nonfiction but at the same time I think it's a very valid form of nonfiction and a good way to tell a story to a to a mass audience and you keep talking about how you try to frame it like a movie and as far as I understand is this also being optioned for a film this hasn't already bought film this is a movie we haven't announced who or where or what yet Columbia is planning to distribute it they're the ones who did the social network but you know we're already looking into writing directing and actors and I would love to see army hammer come back as the twins I think he is the perfect the Winklevoss twins we've we've joked around on the internet about who should play Charlie someone you know but uh but there's lots of lots of great possibilities but yeah this will definitely be a movie and soon we will we will announce details about that great wait well that's something that we can all look forward to thanks for coming on unconfirmed now I really appreciate it and you know I've learned an awful lot about the crypto world and I'm still learning but you know people like you who have
