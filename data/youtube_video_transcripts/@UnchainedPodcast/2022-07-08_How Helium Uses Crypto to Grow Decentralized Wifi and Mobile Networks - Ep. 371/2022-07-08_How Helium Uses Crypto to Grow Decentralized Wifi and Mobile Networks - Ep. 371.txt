[Music] hi all today i'm sharing an interview i conducted at the helium conference with amir haleem ceo of noble labs and founder of helium we cover helium's fascinating story of struggling to create a decentralized iot network until helium introduced a token in 2017 plus we go over its plans to introduce new networks such as for cellular and 5g which includes having separate tokens for each new network it was a great discussion hope you enjoy it harness the full power of the avalanche network with core your new web3 command center built by ava labs core is more than just a wallet it's a

you can buy earn and spend crypto in one place download and get 25 with the code laura link in the description hi everyone thanks for coming to our session i figured that we would start with kind of a basic question around what problem it is that you were trying to solve when you set out to build helium and how you felt helium would resolve that yeah in the initial uh version of helium or the the version that i think we have now was really aimed at trying to build a ubiquitous iot network like how would you build like a network that was literally everywhere for iot devices which are you know things like sensors and tracking devices and um it's difficult it's a difficult problem to solve in a traditional way right like we've seen big telcos really struggle with deploying iot networks because the cost is just quite frankly too high to build the network which means that the cost to use the network for the for the users is too high so we wanted to figure out like how to how to deploy a network in a slightly different way right where the there was there weren't billions of dollars of cost like absorbed by a single entity because the downside there is as i mentioned like you have to pass that cost on to users right and so companies that are building like precision agriculture applications or logistics applications you know tracking packages it can't cost 20 a month right like it in a lot of cases customers want to spend like a dollar a year or something right so you need a very different way of building the network and you know building this crypto economic model was to me like a really interesting way of like distributing ownership of the network right in the same way that i i think of airbnb as having distributed hospitality to people and uber having distributed transportation to people helium is the first time i think that the general public can participate in the telecom industry right but actually let's back up because before you introduced the crypto token you struggled a little bit and then that sort of solved a problem for you so can you talk about that moment yeah i mean we certainly struggled for years we launched in 2013 actually july 4th it was and we didn't really know how to solve the problem like we had a lot of ideas on how we might do this differently a lot of them were actually similar to what we ended up doing but we didn't have the right economic structure right like we wanted we didn't want to build the network we knew it was going to be too expensive and we would just be like a low budget version of at t or something right and so we didn't really want to do it that way and so we we struggled with all sorts of different approaches like we tried to make it sort of developer first and sort of hope that developers would build the network we hoped that customers would you know partially build the network it wasn't really until probably 2017 that we started paying attention to crypto in any meaningful way which is sort of embarrassing it took us that long to to figure out that crypto was a thing still early yeah yeah well it's still very early right but it didn't feel like it at the time but yeah even back in like 2013 or 14 i think mark phillips who who runs business development for us who's here somewhere we were joking that we should put asic you know miners inside hotspots right to mine bitcoin we didn't really know what that meant at the time we were like i don't know if that's even a thing but but then we sort of forgot about it for two or three years and i for me when i read the file coin white paper actually was the first time that i had seen someone trying to build a crypto network that was specific to a like an application right it wasn't just about moving money or it wasn't esoteric in the way that ethereum or something was and it was like okay would they want to build a file storage network and this is how they're going to do it and then it was like a little bit of a light bulb for us it's like well what if we could do the same approximate thing but for network coverage and that's kind of how it was born was probably sort of towards the end of 2017 and so once you introduce the token kind of what what what how did the network behave or how did participants on the network behave before and then how did they behave after so it was really a big reboot when we started this version of helium in 2019 and as i mentioned a little bit ago we launched actually here in austin in 2019 and i think there's three types of like participant in in helium at least this is the way i've come to think of it there are like crypto enthusiasts right who are familiar with mining maybe they mine other you know crypto protocols there are iot enthusiasts so people who are already involved in iot that you know were working with laura wan or or knew knew about it or were building sensors or building applications and then there's a group that i don't know how to describe them any better than to just call them like telco anarchists who like you like hate telcos right right like and it's it's an easy one to hate right like i don't think anyone is is particularly like thrilled with the telco industry so those are kind of the three constituents and they they all behave kind of differently right like the iot enthusiasts are focused on the developer applications and like how to build you know stuff that uses the network the crypto miners are like purely focused on like mining and roi and rewards and the telco anarchists are just you know doing their doing do their thing i don't know but that's you know those are i think kind of the constituents and they're all motivated in slightly different ways uh but ultimately everyone gets to participate in like the economics of this and i think that's really fascinating yeah i actually feel like those groups apply to pretty much all the crypto networks you've got like the speculators the actual users and then the people who are kind of like ideological about it and so now at this point you've grown to one billion devices how did you do that and kind of give us a picture of like where they are and where you still have kind of uh dead spots i guess i'm not sure how to call them yeah so there are it's closing in on about a million devices globally now sorry hot hot spots i misheard you the other day billion sounds better but um not quite there definitely a difference getting there um soon um i still can't believe that this is accurate but someone said that ten percent of of the earth's population is close to helium coverage now which i don't know if that's true or not don't hold me to it but it sounds good and 75 of us zip codes are you know have have some amount of helium coverage and so some of that is is a function of the technology that we use so so the the protocol that we use is called lorawan it is extremely long range right so a single hotspot can create in some cases miles and miles of network coverage but really it's just i think it's this excitement around getting to participate in this industry for the first time right it's like you can't get into the telecom industry there are so many modes right there's spectrum and there's the cost of infrastructure and there's the complexity of like actually deploying it and using it and so i think part of what helium did really really well was make the user experience of building a network quite simple right like you got a device that wasn't ugly right it wasn't like an asic miner which is kind of like a shoe box of wires right right it was kind of decent looking and you set it up with a phone app in the same way that you would a consumer electronic device and i think making it easy to use is a critical like innovation there right like because it opens it to it opens it to a much broader audience and i think crypto in general still has a lot of work to do in terms of like closing that that gap it's still wildly complicated and confusing for the most part so i think helium did that well and it's a big part of of why the network has been able to like grow and expand and reach so many different people and so it sounds like there's quite a concentration in the u.s i actually don't know the numbers of the top of my head but it's they're about 65 000 cities and 170 countries i think is that is the approximate number so i actually don't know the percentages but it's it's definitely we started in the us like we were you were us centric for a while but we now have like all sorts of different vendors that are manufacturing hotspots in different regions of the world and so it's very global now but i actually don't know the distribution percentages and so you started with the internet of things can you talk a little bit about who it is that began using helium for that purpose and kind of what that usage looks like yeah so i think one of the the challenging things with the iot space is it's it's it's different from something like cellular right like with cellular like there is a use case right which is phones for the most part right and with iot it is not like that like the use cases are just literally everything right like anything you could think of right and so the breadth of applications are both impressive but also a challenge right because it's difficult to focus on any one particular thing and say like okay that's where we should be spending all of our you know business development energy or something right it's it doesn't really work that way and so it's everything from precision agriculture which is the whole industry of you know how do we make farming more efficient basically right using using data and sensors to logistics like how do i track packages and you know know where everything is all the time and to god there's a drone delivery company that i just mentioned which is one of my favorite where they're actually delivering packages using drones you know so it's very very broad i think salesforce is using it to track employee badges so it's all over the place like you can even look at a single use case and say like that's the one right like you like you can in cellular for example uh which is both a strength and a challenge at the same time i have to say the salesforce thing sounds a little creepy yeah i mean all of it's a little creepy you know you've got like sensors everywhere right and it's like one of those like tags on you you know that you put on an animal or i don't know um but anyway hopefully they're i won't speak to salesforce's uh hr policies i don't know so now let's talk about some new initiatives that you have you're going to be adding new networks talk about what those networks are and why you decided to add them and something interesting to me is that you're going to have tokens for each of them so i'm curious about why you decided to go that route as well it was really um demand driven is the way i i like to think of it right we were very focused on iot we've spent so long in that industry that we i don't want to say expert like i never feel comfortable saying we're experts in something but we know a lot about iot and so we there's still a lot of work to do there right like we aren't finished by by any means it was really the the freedom fight team so freedom fi is a company uh based in the bay area also uh that was building open source cellular networks right like they their vision is is effectively to be sort of the linux or red hat of cellular networking today like that industry is dominated really by three players like nokia ericsson and huawei are the companies that build base station infrastructure for all the telcos and the vision there was like okay maybe just like you did in the enterprise server market where it used to be dominated by like sun and hp and microsoft and eventually kind of got blown up by open source linux maybe the same thing could happen in the telco industry for cellular right which is that the infrastructure could get much cheaper and much and much simpler and be much more broadly available uh globally and so they discovered helium at some point in their journey right like and realized that helium was an interesting way of accelerating that vision and so that was really how we got introduced to it we had always toyed with the idea uh even in our original white paper back in 2018 like you know there's a section there where we talked about like we would like to figure out if we could do the same thing in 5g or cellular or wi-fi or bluetooth or any other type of network so it wasn't a new idea i just don't think we knew exactly how to to do it right we were still so focused on iot and the freedom fight team had done so much work already on on how to do that so it sort of became a natural thing it's like okay well how would we fit cellular into the network right because you've got like this token supply and so much of it has already gone to the iot network how would you incentivize the creation of the 5g network the same way right and that's how this idea of like multiple tokens was born sort of thinking about helium as like an l1 and an l2 in the same way that like ethereum has eth and l2 tokens are you know on top that was kind of the idea and that was sort of the vision behind it oh does that mean that with existing helium devices you can just add like us to add 5g to your existing device or do you need a separate device or it's it will probably be possible to do some of that right so i know i'm not even sure if i'm supposed to talk about it but one of the vendors is is thinking about doing that making an add-on device for their existing hotspots that makes it possible to turn their existing iot device into a cellular ready device but for the most part you you'll be buying new hardware that that does a different thing and how do you encourage people kind of in those dead areas to open up devices because i imagine like cities probably have much more coverage simply because there's more people there yeah so i don't think we've done this perfectly by any means but we we came up with this idea called proof of coverage which you know tries to tries to verify whether coverage exists in a place right it's like one of the most prom most difficult blockchain problems is this sort of like oracle problem as they describe it right like how do you get data from the outside world into the blockchain and know that it's true and the simplest example was always the weather for example right like how would you how would you know that it's like 72 degrees in san francisco like and be able to verify that and prove that it's true or 100 degrees in austin with 80 humidity whatever it is so part of the proof of coverage idea and this was this was a community proposal like several years ago was to try and increase the rewards for areas that were less dense basically right so basically trying to use economics to motivate people to do the right thing it works reasonably well but you still have this situation where there are like 4 000 hot spots in like manhattan or something right and it's you know so it isn't people live where they live to some degree right and so some some of the some of the journey is just reaching more people right like is is reaching people that are in those rural areas i think with 5g and with cellular it's going to be quite different from iot because the user can also consume their own network right in iot like a lot of the applications are still b2b type applications right they're industrial or they're they're commercial in some way there are still very few consumer focused iot applications so i think the people building the iot network don't necessarily get to use it right like it's for someone else and with 5g it's going to be very different to that right like the people building the network may also use the network right and so people in rural areas in dead spots who don't have good coverage from an existing telco might be you know inspired to try this because it's a way to like build networks in their community or for themselves and so i think the dynamics there with 5g versus iot are going to be quite different and so when you kind of project your vision out or when this network kind of has you know a decent amount of coverage and there really is a 5g network i guess or a cellular network that you can mostly rely on you know what what does that look like like you were saying maybe it would bring costs down because i i personally don't really know what it means to have an open source cellular network does it mean that i won't pay att every month or kind of what does that look like yeah no i think it's exactly what we we would like to end up happening right is that we know of at least one entity uh building a carrier on top of of the helium 5g and i think that's super exciting and so you might subscribe directly to them right and rather than use att or t-mobile or verizon or whatever you you may be a customer of a of a carrier that lives on the network right and i expect there to be a bunch of different benefits for doing that one is definitely cost right like you can probably bring the cost of using the network down to fractions of what it costs today just because just like in iot the cost of deploying the infrastructure is so much cheaper than the traditional way of doing it i think there are going to be other benefits depending on what it is that people care about right like it's going to be much more private in nature there will be a there won't be an entity selling your data to someone else right like and that they'll be harder to like do sim swap attacks and like you know so it sort of depends on it i think it will depend on the segment like for some people price is going to be the main driver for other people private like for me privacy would be the main driver for other people's security would be the main driver you know there's lots of i think lots of different ways of looking at it but ultimately like this is infrastructure that anyone can use including including the carriers right so like we constantly been in talks with all of the the major carriers i think freedom fi announced that two of the three big us carriers are already testing on the helium 5g network to use it as a offload network for themselves and that so there's a lot of there's gonna be lots of different ways that the network gets consumed whether you know it or not and and what does that mean offload network is that like when there's peak demand or something they have this kind of backup resource or something like it it sort of depends on the situation and i always use the example of airports as being a good one right like if you go into an airport particularly in the united states the cell carriers don't actually own those networks right so if i'm an att customer and i go into sfo airport it's still going to say at t in the corner and it's going to look like i have five bars but i'm actually using someone else's network like it might be run by boingo it might be run by someone else and boengo has a relationship with att that is sort of passing data back and forth and increasingly wireless networks are built this way right like it often they are owned by multiple parties and a t is sort of the subscriber face or t-mobile is a subscriber face but in the back end it's actually a network of networks and in for one of a better word and so you could imagine helium 5g being like that it would be one of the players in that ecosystem and at t or t-mobile or verizon may choose to use the helium network for a bunch of different reasons there may be coverage in areas where they don't have coverage it may be cheaper than what they're paying someone like boingo to to use the network you know like so it may be congestion right like their main macro network may be too busy or too crowded and you can think of it especially for events like if you go to the conference center to go try and go to consensus like the cell phone service there is atrocious right because you've got five bars but nothing works because there's just so much traffic on the network and so there are going to be lots and lots of different situations i think where it it is interesting to the carriers to like use a network like helium uh to like offload basically that's that's the sort of industry term for that something that was interesting to me was earlier when you were describing uh the open source cellular networks you were saying basically that people would still interface with companies on the network that it wasn't something you know truly decentralized where maybe people might pay with tokens directly or something but you know why is it that there would still be companies centralized companies that they would interface with i think you could do it either way like you could do it that way right where you where you interface directly with the network and we have that on the iot network today there are sort of like centralized entities that make it easier for for companies to to get to use the network and and some of the reason for that is you know like some of these big corporations don't want to hold tokens like sometimes they can't hold tokens for like legal reasons so sometimes it is necessary for there to be an interface somehow right and i i think what's important is the is making it possible for like multiple entities to be the interface right like we don't have to be the interface on the iot network for example like there are several providers that make it possible if you didn't want to do it directly on chain and you did want to like you didn't want to hold tokens and you would rather use a credit card for example like there are entities that will help you do that and so to me it's important that it it isn't just us like sometimes customers are added to the network we have no idea who they are we don't even know they exist and that's great right like it's perfect to do it that way so i think there will always be multiple paths that you can choose and if you are a miner for example and you have a bunch of tokens you know there's going to be a way for you to just use the tokens to consume the network directly it's going to be more sort of you know prosumer focused that way right like only a certain group of people are going to do that others are going to be just like i want to you know just give you my credit card basically and like treat it as if it was a t or t mobile or verizon so as long as i think there's options i think it's okay that there are centralized entities that sit there you know arguably in the same way that you have crypto on your fiat on and off ramps in crypto in general right like you you need a coin base or you need an ftx or you need someone to like be the interface to get to get in and out of the ecosystem and so it's similar to that but i think a little bit more open and actually we didn't we you know kind of touched on this question of why you would have a separate token for each of these new networks that you're building but like why is that why is that necessary i think a few different reasons i mean one of them is is to think about governance right like the the way the networks work is going to be very very different from each other right and as an example like the cost of using the cellular network should be completely different from the cost of using the iot network right and as an example i think using the iot network is about 400 a gigabyte right in cellular land that's absurd right like you would never like you could never pay that right and so in in the 5g network it's 50 cents a gigabyte right and so there are going to be these very different considerations and the way you know the proof of coverage protocol works is going to be completely different from network to network so so one of them is to try and encourage governance of each protocol to like be in the hands of the people actually like building those networks right so if you are building the iot network and you are a holder of the iot token like you were the one with governance rights for that token right not hnt holders like iot holders right and the same for 5g and that will be called the mobile token and so part of it is that part of it is this this sort of notion of like unit bias right so there was a there was an improvement proposal maybe about a year ago that suggested redenominating hnt right so instead so that one hnt would become 1000 hnt and part of that is miners don't like earning 0.05 hnt a day or whatever the average is right they would rather have 50 or 500 and we aren't the only network to have like struggled with this like polkadot did this you know a while ago they redenominated and they added you know like four zeros to the end of their you know to their token and so some of it is that right like having this sort of redenomination and some of it is just to allow the economies to exist on their own like people might you know speculators or investors in those networks i think want to speculate in different ways depending on what the network is or they might have different desires or different visions for how this is going to go so having separate tokens allows allows for all of that activity but still accrues value back to hnt and sort of like hnt is sort of the reserve currency kind of like gold in in a in the sort of us dollar analogy but like back in the 70s so in terms of the cellular network i just imagine there's going to be a lot more challenges and growing that simply because as we mentioned there's so much more demand for cellular packets i'm not sure what the terminology is so how do you imagine overcoming that because i do think probably the internet of things network is just a lot easier to build because there's not as much demand so it's easier in a bunch of different ways right i mean that the range of the iot network devices is much larger right and so there's in in radio frequency technology you're like always trading range for bandwidth basically right so you can you can make the bandwidth extremely small right so that you can only send you know tiny bits of data and you get longer range out of that in the cellular applications it's the opposite of that right the bandwidth is very wide but the range is relatively tiny so you're going to have a different type of challenge right like you're going to need many more devices devices being hotspots in order to create like reasonably useful coverage networks the flip side of that is there's so much more demand right so there's arguably there's more economic incentive to set up more devices because there's going to be a lot of phones using those networks right and so it's it's different from the iot network which is i think still searching for applications right like there's you know five or ten year like lead time basically for iot to get big as as far as i'm concerned and you know there's one example of a of a company using this network called nano things that has built this tracking device that's like a sticker and they started before we did right and they're only now you know like getting their product to market in like a meaningful way and so that's how long it takes to like go from an idea to like an actual product so everyone kind of has to be aware of that right like iot is on a long long timeline and that's okay but cellular is going to be very different you're going to require many more devices as you're saying like the demand is so much higher for for bandwidth the range is so much worse for on the on the device side but at the same time the economic incentive is very different right like you're they're going to be like real data consumption on the network and that's ultimately where i think helium and hnt as a token needs to be which is ideally like decoupled from the very speculative nature of the crypto markets right like it shouldn't be that when bitcoin goes down three percent agent t goes down 10 or something right like they that we want to like try and get rid of that coupling so that demand for hnt is primarily driven by usage rather than speculation all right well what future kind of milestones or challenges are you looking forward to as you move forward with helium yeah so as i mentioned a little bit earlier like the mobile token launches in a few weeks and so that's kind of the first major milestone which is that anyone that is that owns a 5g hotspot will start to earn mobile tokens so definitely a good time to start getting involved with that and then you know there's a lot of like implementation steps required in order to like get to the sort of fullness of of a network of networks kind of ideas so i think it will realistically probably take us until the end of the year until until all of that is finished and so that but that's exciting work and then i'm excited to to see what people do with the network like as it grows right like and we already know about some of the things that are coming and it will be exciting to announce some of those partnerships and some of those deals this work that we're doing as as nova labs as a company which we'll also be announcing which i think is also really exciting so we have our hands full for the foreseeable future but it's it's all to me like incredibly exciting and an amazing journey and what have i not asked you that you would want this audience to know i kind of i'm chilling again but people should people should buy hot spots while they're here because they are heavily discounted while everyone's here uh so go do that upstairs and downstairs yeah and i like i said i just i couldn't be more excited about where helium is and and where helium is going and so and i'm continue to be thankful for the community that has joined us on this journey and is really responsible for for all of the growth great yeah i have to say for those of you who read a lot of crypto coverage in the mainstream media the new york times generally i mean i wouldn't say that everything they write is negative but they're they're a newspaper so they're going to cover problems and one of the few positive articles i read on crypto in the new york times was about helium so there you have it i think that says something but yeah i really enjoyed this discussion so thanks so much thanks laura [Applause] join over 10 million people using crypto.com the

digital file for chapter 11 bankruptcy by applying for this type of bankruptcy voyager will be able to stay in business while it restructures its obligations and reorganizes its assets and liabilities the company has 1.3 billion dollars in crypto assets and 350 million dollars in cash held at metropolitan commercial bank according to the statement released by the firm last week voyager halted all activities from its platform including withdrawals it also issued a notice of default to crypto fund three arrows capital as the latter failed to repay a loan worth 650 million dollars voyager's financials were extremely debilitated by its exposure to 3ac stephen ehrlich ceo of voyager digital pointed to three arrows capital as the trigger for its bankruptcy we strongly believe in the future of the industry but the prolonged volatility in the crypto markets and the default of three arrows capital require us to take this decisive action erelike said if the restructuring plan gets passed by the court customers with assets in the platform will receive a combination of crypto in their accounts proceeds from the 3ac recovery common shares and voyager or vyg tokens matt levine from bloomberg estimated that if the vyg token has no value and 3ac doesn't recover at all users could expect 72 cents on the dollar customers have been hit hard and are blaming voyager for deceitful marketing i interviewed jess archer a voyager customer who has seventy thousand dollars locked in the platform she said on june 20th they reached out to a bunch of partners and entered into these ndas to try to bail him out and six days before that they sent an email out to us meaning the customers reassuring us that they didn't have any exposure to celsius they never engaged in defy lending in fact the wall street journal reports that the federal deposit insurance corporation is investigating voyager's claims that the dollars in its customer accounts were protected up to 250 thousand dollars by fdic insurance by the way late wednesday tps capital which long dubbed itself the over-the-counter trading arm of three arrows tweeted a statement that it was independent and had separate management tps is an independent legal entity and its operations are separate and distinct from those of 3ac it said ftx bails out blockfy ftx sam bankman freed's crypto trading platform has closed a deal to lend struggling crypto lender blockfy 400 million dollars in revolving credit the deal includes an option to buy blockfly at a variable price up to 240 million dollars max zac prince block fight ceo explained what he believes led to this deal crypto market volatility particularly market events related to celsius and 3ac had a negative impact on blockfy the celsius news on june 12th started an uptick in client withdrawals from block 5's platform despite us having no exposure to them he said last friday it was rumored that ftx was going to buy block 5 for just 25 million dollars a mighty fall from july 2021 when blockfi was valued at 4.75 billion dollars so if it is sold for 240 million dollars that would mean a 4.5 billion loss from its peak valuation this is not the first credit line that blockfi has secured with ftx since the start of this bear market two weeks ago ftx provided blockfly a 250 million dollar credit line to help blockfi navigate the market from a position of strength according to bankman freed blockfly is just one of many crypto lenders that have been struggling in the past few days and weeks coin loan announced on monday it would be reducing the
