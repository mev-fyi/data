laura the link is in the description today's guest is ria myers artist hacker and writer and senior smart contract developer at dapper labs welcome ria so listeners of the episode with peoplepleaser will remember that it originally featured two guests but one guest's audio and video files were lost in the ether and that person was ria and i'm so glad to have her back now because ria is a true og crypto artist who was making blockchain-based art even before nfts really existed which is um kind of hard to do as far as i can tell uh so anyway so bria why don't you get started by telling us what it is that you used to do before crypto how you got into it and how you got into crypto art and nfts and also a little bit about what you do now sure so i went to art school um a very long time ago and i did digital art and i just sort of i decided that sort of rather than have a struggling career as an artist with um most of my time spent making the money to support my art i would have a struggling career in software development and take the money from that and use it to make up so i sort of worked in industry i i kept making art not least because making art is how i learn about things it's how i understand the world and i sort of just kept making sort of different kinds of art using computers there's a famous essay about techno utopianism called the californian ideology by richard brabruck and andy cameron and i joke that i sort of took that as a manifesto it's not it's a critique but i've sort of accidentally ended up tracking each development in technology and and what goes with it and making art out of it so i have sort of generative art bots on tumblr that are still cranking out several drawings a day i did some experiments with air like everyone else a couple of years ago and decided that it probably wasn't going to be a major direction for me which is a shame because i've been looking forward to doing something like that since i was a kid and then um when i sort of moved to canada eight years ago because i met a nice canadian and she married me and imported me um i was unable to work for a few months because we were sorting out my permanent residency and i was just staying here as a guest and i was walking around vancouver a lot i'm looking at the sort of changing city skyline and going to all the crypto meetups because that was a new thing nobody really knew each other there so as a new arrival i was just sort of you know one of the many new people at this thing and i got to see sort of you know the fire in people's eyes as they talked about this world changing technology and i got to see something else in sort of some people around the edge of the room's eyes as they sort of saw this way to make exciting new businesses and maybe extract some money from the other people and i was struck by this because i'd seen this before i'd seen this in the internet scene in the net art scene in the uk in the 90s and so i sort of dug into it and i learned about the technology and as i say the way i learn and understand things is through making art so i started making art about it i crafted some bitcoin transactions as art that's something you can do if you're an artist you just get to do something and declare it art which is very useful to be able to do because it goes wrong you get to say hey it's part of the artwork this is great which is just as well because i i forgot about change transactions during my first bitcoin transaction and sent all of the money that i didn't send too much to the transaction i made to a minor so some minor somewhere got a load of bitcoin for me so that was a good learning experience and a good art experience i started out with bitcoin transactions moved on to doge party which is the long forgotten fork of the counterparty system which works on top of dogecoin rather than bitcoin and then when ethereum was starting to be proposed as a thing i was just i was just ready for it i sort of done some work in other systems i'd really dug into the ideas around it um i was enjoying playing with the limitations of the systems and i saw ethereum there's like my original pitch to myself was it's bitcoin with loops you can do all the cody stuff you can do a bitcoin but you can sort of add more logic to it and then sort of do interesting things with that so yeah i 2014 i was making dodge party tokens counterparty tokens sending bitcoin transactions starting to look at how ethereum could be used for art making for and not just for artworks but for sort of commissioning art for critiquing art for exhibiting art and um around that time or possibly just slightly before my coin artist from blockade games sort of pop popped up like you know the character in a secret agent movie who comes along and says hey i've got a mission for you would you would you like to do this and then sort of she was doing this amazing um what's at the time called alternate reality games although they're now crypto puzzle trails and i'd seen the first one she'd done and not really understood it but then realized there was something there and worked very hard and understanding it and yeah i helped marguerite out on some of the the sort of the actual cryptographic element of some of the puzzle trails she'd say you know i want to do this can we do this i know these algorithms is there anything slightly different and that sort of culminated in the painting she made called torched hearts which is the one of the doves and the flames and the chessboard and all the flames around the edge and um yeah we came up with what we thought was a slightly more difficult puzzle for that than the ones that we had been doing previously because people had cracked those very quickly because the community had sprung up around them and so we thought let's give them a bit more of a challenge we came up with i think it was a six bit encoding for the flames i handed marguerite this this written little you know code generated list to sort of tall flame orange red outline curved lift and that kind of thing and she painted 106 euthletes with perfect accuracy at the feet that i'm still in all of and we released it the community descended upon it and then nothing really moves forward for about two years so the two thousand dollars worth of bitcoin that marguerite had put in the uh bitcoin wallet that the flames represented the private key of went up in value during this time to i think uh about 40 000 us dollars by the time someone solved it which which left me being very nervous about having the private key on my laptop when i was getting in touch so i had that was sort of where things really really took hold on my imagination and i just sort of kept working through the i guess the project the program i came up with when i first looked at ethereum and as a result of that i've been working on ethereum since before the initial release that i've been working on since the testnet and so when marguerite was doing a games company i eventually said yes to joining up and working on the smart contracts all that and that was blockade games and that was brilliant and then after doing that after the first round of smart contract development was done i moved to dapper labs in vancouver it's my first time working for a canadian company in canada and they're lovely they make these little things although i should be very clear so i'm not here to represent the company i'm here in the personal capacity and when i'm there i work on the cadence programming language which is a really awesome smart program that's my contract programming language and it's sort of like flow's version of solidity um yeah it's sort of it it is to flow as solidity as to ethereum it's a very very different kind of programming language very deliberately so um i i certainly first encountered that collapse as the people who broke the ethereum blockchain by um causing so many transactions by people um buying and breeding cryptokitties that the ethereum network just couldn't cope with with the strain so sort of dapper took their experience from that and and sort of created flow to be more scalable in for that kind of scenario and to make it more scalable and more robust took everything that they'd learned from using solidity and yet made cadence with that i was quite sad to be stopping working on solidity full-time because i felt that it was just about getting to the point where um it was nicely robust for the things i wanted to do and i wasn't having to sort of check what had changed or which bugs had been fixed on each version um and yes now here i'm working working on cadence but yeah it's it's a really really good programming language in my personal opinion and in my professional opinion it's it's perfect for flows so yeah cadence one thing i will say is that um i had some of my real life friends who are not in a crypto read my book and hilariously one of them um even though a cryptokitties is not like a major plot point it's definitely mentioned obviously because you know it's a huge um event in ethereum's history um but even though it doesn't go super in depth into that when i asked her her thoughts in the book like one of the things she just had to say was like oh my god that cryptokitties thing like i think that's so crazy like why were people and she just like didn't get it even now she she still doesn't understand empties but anyway um so i actually want to go back to some of the bitcoin art like so what did you have to do like what were those art pieces i'm so curious so um there are various different traditions of art in what i will shorthand as western or international art art historians can sort of take me out and rough me up later for phrasing it in these terms i'm just shorthanding this so one of the art movements that really interests me is from the 1960s and 70s in america europe and elsewhere and that's conceptual arts and conceptual art was a reaction to a very specific set of historical circumstances in the art world at that time you had the first generation of artists who had been professionally trained in anything resembling a sort of art degree type art school setting um you had the sort of absolutely iron grip of greenbergian modernist art criticism for those of you who don't know there's this sort of one art critic who who had amazing power over the imagination of um what people thought art could do even if you didn't have the sort of actual power to make and break artists so much at that point i think his first name was was it saul greenberg oh no sorry it's clement greenberg clement that's right yes yes yeah yeah um it's an interesting name you know there's this entrenched system of art exhibition of our review of our promotion which if you're an upcoming young artist firstly didn't have access to and secondly it just looked sort of really boring and sort of not very much to do the art so various different artists decided they weren't going to have anything to do with that and they they just sort of they didn't know what to do instead of it so they just carried on and over time sort of the conversations became the art or different mathematical propositions became the art or um you know proposing to do things that they couldn't actually afford to do because they weren't part of the gallery system became the art and this this was sort of very interesting because whilst artists always sort of proposed artworks or sketched out artworks or something there's always been this sort of final stage of a patreon or the market saying okay i will give you the cash to do this and conceptual art just short circuited that it took that out of the loop artist could sort of do their thing and and the art world couldn't say no you can't do that and you can give you money for it now um the art world and capitalism in general likes nothing so much as something that it can't buy so very quickly conceptual art became recuperated by the art world and you will now find very very very stylish enormous great big text installations in galleries and sort of very carefully preserved little bits of computer printout from 1967 which are now worth tens of thousands of dollars whereas at the time the artist making it basically parodying um you know what people were doing with art at the time but for me the the interesting thing was this encounter between art and commerce this encounter between art and network technology at that time people were sort of you know using cheap jets travels get around they were using long distance phone calls they were using video systems teletypes the old um the text printing network and the way artists made use both of the possibilities and limitations there just struck me as a very useful precedent for how i thought blockchain art could go so [Music] this was useful for me because i could say to to the art world imagined audience that is addressing it's okay you know this it isn't a weird new technology that you should immediately hate and be scared of it's fertile territory for making conceptual art it's good resources for including in conceptual art type works and and the other the other precedent which i mentioned earlier was the net art of the 90s and 2000s which in a very similar scenario conceptual art you had artists who were either embedded in universities which had internet access to a higher degree than the rest of society particularly in europe or you had people who are working as web designers or on e-commerce projects and who had access not just to the technology but too um amazing though it may seem to anyone doing web design now the capital and free time to sort of be a web designer half the month in an artist the other half of the month and net artists were very much um sort of going into or onto network spaces and sort of critiquing them not not in the uh this is terrible sort of way but in a let's look around let's see what's going on let's think about this let's reflect on it and see what's going on here rather than just simply being swept along by it and sort of calling this art rather than political intervention or anything else as i said it allows you to get away with things that you can't otherwise it's sort of people will take you less seriously which allows you to do things which they will then think about more seriously it's it's sort of a really useful effect so with the bitcoin transactions i was learning how to construct bitcoin transactions i was bringing in this this history of conceptual art and of um of net art and i was just sort of trying to demonstrate to myself and to others that there was there was something here for art and so i started out with a self-portrait because if it's sort of if you take people um around gallery who are not sort of totally totally brainwashed by the art world then they're generally very interested in recognizable imagery like like portraits and and that's perfectly cool and so yeah i put a portrait of myself in the blockchain which is actually um the the cryptographic hash of my 23andme genome so i can absolutely prove that someone with the same genetics as me has existed since sometime in early 2014 so it's a sort of proof of existence kind of thing and and if you're familiar with the idea of proof of existence from that time you can see we're already playing with the concepts and probably getting away with it sorry yeah and by the way um so when i was doing research for this show i just kept texting my assistant and like laughing because like this this one by the way for people um who don't know this piece of art is called my soul um and so i was just like laughing and it's on dogecoin or or or well you put on dogecoin and bitcoin or something or counterparty or i forget what the so my soul is actually a later one so this is like a pure bitcoin transaction with the hash margin that my soul it was it was um in in philosophical terms it's a bear assertion so that there were um some of my favorite um should i say legacy artist petra dollar art world once my favorite fiat art world artists were a couple of soviet expats called komar and melamid i can't remember their first names sorry guys who were working in the us in the 80s and 90s and they were very into um sort of parodying democratic pretension so that they would commission like phone survey companies at the time who would call people up say what's you know what do you like in arts and they'd get 100 people to say that then paint that invite the people to the show and they'd be horrified that they've got nothing that they actually wanted so another thing that they did was they would buy artists souls so they'd give the artists like 100 bucks get them to sign the things signing over their soul to them i think they managed to get andy warhol's soul at one point so um i thought well i can do better than that i can cryptographically secure this and i can fractionalize it and this will be worth much more so i originally issued he had a hundred tokens of it on the doge party um system which is um a fork of the counterparty system on bitcoin but on dogecoin um that sort of didn't really go anywhere as a platform so you know so much for the blockchain as a permanent record the data is there but until someone resurrects that system hopefully as an art project it's not gonna be very easily accessible so i moved that to counterparty and um sort of you know people looked at it with with benign amusement and confusion and it wasn't until a couple of years later you'll notice a trend here things sort of go out into the world and it takes a few years for people to really really really get through them yeah a couple of years later people started saying hey can i buy part of your soul and i i said sure let me just look into it and i was talking to my wife about this and she was not unreasonably terribly offended by the idea of anyone other than herself owning my soul so i'm actually not allowed to i'm not allowed to sell these tokens so that they're just sitting there and sort of people have said you know can you make a proxy token for this we'll buy that instead no it's still you know too much of my soul for the love of my life to be comfortable with me giving away and i think you can understand that and everyone does understand that when i say it's so that's good that's i find that hilarious because it is true that um i i think i texted him like oh i'd love to buy one of these um so good to know in advance that um you know off limits all right well why don't we talk about one other um one other one of your pieces which is the one that you auctioned off at sotheby's earlier this year tell us about that artwork and i love the title uh it's called secret artwork and then in parentheses content and um so tell us about that artwork and then also what it was like to have your work auctioned off at sotheby's yes yeah you can tell it's very serious modern art if it has something in parentheses in it if you if you put untitled in the parentheses that that you know that's it let's still go home anyway um so yeah i mentioned earlier conceptual art one of my favorite conceptual arts um not artists but groups of artists there's a very grumpy marxist outfit called art and language who were formed in london not london sorry in in england and america in the 60s and sort of whittled down to sort of a couple of core members who are still going and one of their early pieces was engaging with the certificates of authenticity that people people make to say no you know this small crumpled piece of paper with some gravy stains on it is actually an artwork by me um so these kinds of certificates were were very big at the time um guarantees on artworks you know that sort of i guarantee this is actually an artwork by me we're very closely related and so art language sort of took this ran with it and made a perfectly black painting with a little certificate by it saying that the content of this artwork is secret known only to the artist and um you know sort of this this is great fun it's a fun concept it's novel and it sort of pokes gentle fun at um the structures that had grown up to make this often deliberately unownable art very very very ownable and syllable and exhibitable so the reason i dug into this particular part of my toolbox was a uh a nice curator and other kind of activity person called sam hart was curating a show in the san francisco san francisco mint um and it was on and they had a co-curator who i will go to hell for forgetting the name of sorry about that um but anyways sam was my contact so sorry about that and um that they were they were curating a show and they said would you like to see it's on the theme of secrets would you like to do something so i thought oh yeah i'm looking at said k snarks at the moment we could do something with that that'd be that'd be fun i looked at the code libraries and the explains from zko snarks at the time and my my reaction was i'm an art student i can't understand any of this i i don't know what's going on here this is less spooky moon math and more math from another dimension where things just work differently um and the sort of the toolkits were there but very rough and ready at the time so i had to go back to sam and say oh yeah i'm not going to be able to do this like that let's just do what we always do and do a cryptographic hash and do something with that so rather than a a nice blank canvas with a certificate next to it i sort of came up with something that would be interesting to go in an artwork um created the cryptographic hash with the text of that saved the original text somewhere in a bank vault or a cave in the top of a mountain or somewhere that people will not be able to access having learned the lesson about not keeping things on my laptop i personally genuinely cannot remember what it was now but like i can access it if i'm ever taken to court to prove that i i i did have an idea so yeah we took the cryptographic hash of that that's secure until someone breaks shah 256 and then that's sort of placed on the blockchain with the token um as some data associated with it and then there's a nice web front and a front end so like it's a dap the front end tells you absolutely everything it can about the token it just scrolls up the screen like watching a block explorer showing new transactions coming in so it tells you when the contract was created the address of the contract it tells you the transaction that created the token the number of the token the cryptograph cash contained in the token the transaction that creates the token the block that created the token the time of it it tells you all of these irrelevant details it tells you them in written text it tells them numbers and shapes and colors in musical notes is one of my favorites and you need to make sure emoji yes you have to make sure that you've got a good solid unicode font installed on your on your device that's showing it so it tells you absolutely everything in every way it can as this grand distraction from the one thing you want to know which is the thing promised in its title which is the actual content of this notional artwork and for me this this this is a nice i'm going to use the word allegory in an artistic context which will get me taken to art jail but it's nice parallel i guess it's nice parallel to the experience of public key cryptography you have these two guarantees with public key cryptography you have one of absolute secrecy you know no one will be able to guess what has been encrypted with your public key and you have this other guarantee of absolute identity nobody else can forge a signature that you have made with your private key so you have this interplay of knowing absolutely everything about someone um via their their cryptographic um key by that by their public key cryptography system and yes at the same time there's just something hiding behind it and sort of as i went on with this this project you know that really became um for me very much what it was about because i i make art when it doesn't leave me alone so the idea comes to me and i can't get rid of it and after a while ago okay i'm going to make you i'm not going to think about you too much i'll work out what you are about afterwards uh and to be clear i'm just sat there with a lightning bolt hitting me i'll be sort of reading lots and lots of crypto theory and looking at lots and lots of art and my subconscious will be churning away in the background and yeah so yeah this one came to be very much about the sort of dialectic between absolute identity and absolute secrecy and public key cryptography and sort of you know it's as with much of the art that i've made about kryptos and it's a nice way into thinking about those ideas um if you're unfamiliar with public key cryptography and we're certainly not born naturally knowing how rsa or ecc works this experience of being able to provably see everything about something but not quite knowing what's behind it is a useful way to start thinking about those ideas and it looks fun when you project it or show it on the screen in the gallery um it's got some movement in it which is always good for drawing the eye so i made this for the show it was exhibited in the show it was projected on the lovely solid metal walls of the vault of the old san francisco mint which was absolutely delightful for a crypto artwork and as is a common thread in these stories i then forgot about it for a couple of years until the sotheby's auction was being organized and we were talking about you know what i had which was sort of both very early on and could be easily sold because a lot of my work i very very deliberately made unsalable um due to sort of art world hangovers about money being bad and also to to sort of critique the currency basis for blockchain and sort of obviously cryptocurrency so sort of we went back and sort of tried to work out whether we could resurrect any of the doge party pieces other than myself and whether we'd have to try and sort of cross chain transfer them to ethereum or something because um you know ethereum was very much all they wanted the work to be i couldn't transfer it to flow for various reasons and so um the [Music] works that sort of came up as the one which was sort of the intersection of early and sale put on the ethereum blockchain was was secret artwork and the experience of sailing was absolutely amazing so without wishing to sound like someone's an awards show the money was nice i'm not gonna lie um i i i sort of you know i had a tax bill to pay from last year and then the money will help with that but um the the thing that was absolutely amazing was talking to people who had read um artists rethinking the blockchain the book that furtherfield did that i had some essays in who had you know looked art and sort of got you know they they'd sort of got what some of the early crypto artists blockchain artists were doing and sort of having the the fiat art world institutional power of something like sotheby's going oh yes there is something of interest to this work let us write it up in a way which is understandable by the going art world public was absolutely amazing um like it you know it's sort of very sad to be yet another art world rebel who was gone hey you can't buy my work it's it's on this blockchain thing that you don't understand or used to over the validation from this hundreds of years old institutions absolutely wonderful oh wow like you know i totally know that i i am sort of i guess selling out there but i'm deeply relaxed with selling out so that's fine but um yeah so you know the the institutional tension the the um the art historical attention they gave to it was was amazing and then the sale went up and sort of everyone else's work went up to millions and millions of dollars and mine was hovering around i think about six thousand dollars um the night before the sale finished and i was really happy because i'd set up a little display which is refreshing and showing the price of my my work to sort of make sure that number go up and it was it was a like six it was a five thousand six thousand something that was great this is more than i've ever sold my artwork for before i'm so happy i woke up and looked at the screen and i thought oh no it's gone down because i hadn't realized there was an extra zero at the end so we've gone up from like it got up tenfold overnight and like that that was just amazing i was really you know sort of going from not just being the hypocrite about hey i i don't need um artworks validation to um to oh i'm so grateful for this validation too i'm making this resolutely non-commercial work i don't need your money to hey you've sold this for lots of money that's amazing so um yeah it was it was just the thing that uh to get back to my awards show speech the the critical attention that it got that that got me was amazing because having been not quite shouting into the void um for how long was it since 2014 like artists rethinking the blockchain was published in 2017. i thought oh this is great you know it's a book about blockchain r there'll be dozens of these in two years time and this will be a fun historical time capsule there's still to my knowledge no other um [Music] phrasing this delicately sort of art world ebooks on on blockchain art there are plenty of guides to making your own nfts and then i'm not talking about those but sort of actual factual sitting artwork people down and saying hey what's this blockchain thing or sitting now crypto artists down saying hey what's this artwork thing doesn't seem to have taken off in the way that you know i was hoping it would so sort of people seeing sotheby's auction and looking at you know the write-up and then looking at my work and sort of talking to people has been amazing because i i wanted to create this dialogue between the the crypto world and the art world because they're they're sort of they're very mutually suspicious the sort of anarcho-capitalist um massive on the crypto side and the um the sort of socialist seats on on the art world side have fairly different world views to put it mildly but i do feel that um you know that there's useful knowledge and and work and value that can be bought from each side and that's what i was trying to do from the start and seeing sort of very very serious curators and um our theorists sort of know you know notice that there is something here and start getting engaged with it um as soon as we explain to them that it's not all about 70 million dollar image sales that there's you know things slightly further down the long tail that they should probably pay attention to that that's been amazing to start having those conversations yeah so um i want to discuss a little bit more about uh kind of you know what that nft art world looks like um and and your perception

digital asset research is available through refinitive or directly at digitalassetresearch.com back to my conversation with ria so you kind of said before this before the ad break something um i forget the exact phrasing but just something about how um you felt like the the nft art world i think was maybe going in a different direction from what you originally expected or i i can't remember how you phrased it but so what did you mean by that and what do you make of what we've seen so far so i i absolutely love nfts i think they're great um i i think that artists being paid for art is a very good thing and i i have very little time for the frankly moral panic that we've seen from people who are determined not to think about nfts sort of the the energy usage gotcha that came up earlier in the year just sort of based on terrible math terrible attribution of terrible math and terrible thinking through of who benefits and who loses in this debate um the party political broadcast ends here sorry about that um so the thing that's interested me about the way the art world on train has gone compared to what i was sketching out in 2014 i i sort of viewed contracts as the obvious unit of production for our because i was thinking of net art i was thinking of generative art which has taken off recently and they're on chain is great and i was thinking this is brilliant we can write these little programs that are smart contracts we can make it so that they can manage their own exhibition and get exhibition fees for that and um you know this would be great and it didn't turn out like that and i've thought a lot about sort of not so much where i went wrong but where i went different and it was that sort of inherited art world disdain for sort of artists directly having anything to do with money which is very interesting social and moral phenomenon that we don't need to dig into here but whenever you encounter people getting upset that artists are making money do just pause for a moment and think hang on who else are you upset gets paid for their work what's that all about but anyway um so yeah i i thought hey this is great people will make smart contracts and they'll be like self-exhibiting and then self agreeing to be included in books and they'll manage their own reproduction rights and that kind of thing and if this was very much because i was trying to avoid um um commodification of things as money i'm trying to avoid financialization for art world's ideological reasons and this meant that sort of when i was um doing a book launch for artists rethinking the blockchain at the hackerspace d control here in vancouver the people on before me were from this little startup called axioms then talking about their cryptokitties project jeff was very interested in but that i only knew had sort of you know congested the blockchain so i was totally on a different path at the time where nfts were becoming a form of my last formalized thing it took me ages to get my head around the punks it took me ages to get my head around counterparty originally and um cynthia gayton and skriller the old heart and the blockchain podcast were instrumental in me casting my head around that so yeah i i was looking in the wrong direction for ideological reasons um nfts came in people started making really interesting things from out of the gate um i i'd love um evolutionary art i'm a big um william latham fan who's who's this artist who did sort of swirly nautilus shapes and computer graphics that revolve artificially evolved forms at the time when you needed like a room full of equipment to do that and the kitties having little genomes on chain i absolutely loved um i didn't love everyone leaving after the kitty's team talk when i was meant to be talking about my book but some of the teams stayed and that they were great so um yeah i was looking the wrong way people did interesting things with nfts um i did start using nfts where it made sense for a project and then over time you know i just noticed the prices going up at the start of the year we had the people sale and everyone suddenly didn't know what nifties were didn't know what blockchain was but they knew they didn't like it and for me the the difficult thing about this was that i'd noticed that lots of young sort of marginalized people who i followed on twitter were suddenly getting their first start sales and they were getting money which they wouldn't otherwise have which was going on education on rent on food on medical expenses on medication so there was there was a good here there was good being done here and you we can view this as like a tiny fraction of the 70 million nft purchases but there was still you know a wider new entirely nft art world native community here which was benefiting financially from the fruits of their labour in a way which they otherwise wouldn't and in ways which were genuinely making their lives better and sort of for those of you listening who aren't really into making people's lives better they're also helping the economy move so you know whichever angle you're coming from this was a good thing and if i tried to mention this it's like oh you know they're human shields if i tried to mention that um the energy usage of bitcoin is interesting but not a lot to do with ethereum and certainly nothing to do with proof of stake based chains people just genuinely didn't want to hear it it was it was like telling them that they're they're in their fairies at the bottom of the garden it's just like total mental shutdown just out of curiosity when you say because ethereum does use proof of work are you saying that because they use gpus rather than asics or so oh yeah sorry so um i live on on the planet earth i'm a big fan of planets earth ironic provocations i post to twitter notwithstanding i think the earth continuing and my kids being able to live on it is probably on balance a good thing bitcoin's energy usage is massive a lot of it comes from waste energy from centrally planned energy production which would otherwise you know be creative but not use something comes from renewables some of it comes from sort of waste hydrocarbons so even within bitcoin mining the picture is more complex um the argument that's energy that could go to other things is kind of refuted by the fact it doesn't and the idea of its wasted energy is refuted by the fact that it's being used to secure bitcoin um which is a use but also um that you know this is not energy that has been created ex night hello to do bitcoin and if we sort of bombed the capital of bitcoin it would stop using all this energy that's just not how it works however it does use a lot of energy and it being more efficient would be and will be a good thing uh ethereum uses a lot less energy to do the same thing nfts by artists use a tiny fraction of that energy and if they stopped doing that it would still run they're sort of obviously a sort of an echo of the wider environmental crisis here in that if i stop driving my gas guzzling car then you know so what everyone would need to and that's a distraction from you know shipping container ships and the us military anyway but yeah you know i i'm aware that it's possible to make this kind of excuse for for needed systemic change but then um ethereum is going to proof at stake anyway and there are existing proof stake systems flow which you may have heard of is an excellent proof of stake system and some of the other popular chains that artists are now on are proof of stake systems and i've encountered people who simply refuse to believe that proof of stake uses less energy it becomes an article of faith so yeah to to unpack that sort of i i look at this and i see a a sort of yes alarming but decreasing over time and to decrease more in the future use of energy and so i'm sort of less worried about that and more worried about paying artists and developers and sort of everyone else who is doing interesting things in this area in the meantime um but yeah sort of watching the nft art world emerge watching the platforms emerge watching artists sort of explore different aesthetics in there watching different um controversies emerge has been absolutely amazing it's sort of i was late to the net art scene i didn't really i wasn't really in that because i was busy with a young family and everything but um you know getting to watch this sort of new art world blossom from first principles has been absolutely amazing and i absolutely love nft art and sort of as someone who has written very thorough sort of critical art theory around the idea of using blockchain to make art around the idea of tokenization um there is something here there is something art historically are critically here it's very interesting to look at and yeah i just sort of not uncritically obviously but quite separate from any other concerns i'm just loving seeing what people are doing and getting paid for for the first time and getting critical interest for the first time and the communities that you're emerging so i think it's great yeah i was gonna ask you because um i don't know if you saw the museum director basically um kind of said he didn't really see anything that was worth um the met doing with nfts so that's that's weird because he should probably look in their collection in that case but um so i think that's standard that like no no disrespect to to the met um i don't know that particular person so this is a general comment rather than any kind of this but um yeah that will get column inches that will get headlines that's a perfectly reasonable thing for someone from a long running art world institution to say it's completely wrong it's completely completely wrong we see some very interesting things happening in nft land tell me how it is that you think nfts are changing art i'd be so interested to hear that totally totally sorry yes yes so um nfcs are reinvigorating existing genres um portraiture which i mentioned earlier there's some very interesting portrait work going on in nfts i know that they are portraits and by that you're talking about like profile pics like pangus and royals yeah so pfps are interesting um coldies 3d things are really interesting um uh coin artists early paint just paintings which are tokenized of italic and people and artists like um josie who are doing sort of different you know pictures of people and it's sort of the fact that you can get um attention and revenue from doing this and that you can play with it sort of technically and aesthetically means that there's this genre which you know if you say to the average art critic hey there's a show of portraiture they will roll you up their eyes at you and just regard it's the most outdated thing possible we're seeing here the start of experimentation with you know the genre as outdated as portraiture in a new and interesting way um we are seeing imagery and kinds of art that otherwise are pretty much by definition unsaleable i mentioned generative art earlier which is sort of created by little computer programs you can download the source code for most generative art programs from github now the artists can you know create things with that and then sort of get paid for that and that gives them more time to work on it and more critical attention for it yeah just sort of people talking about different experiences in in art um i've seen sort of african artists tokenize their art get revenue for that get critical attention transgender artists um many many different kinds of experience you know it are blossoming in in this new nft art world and even if we accept for a moment that there is nothing of interest there today for the for our world institutions which i find absolutely incredible and would sort of raise both eyebrows out the the sort of the momentum that this technology has given to people means that there is work being done that wouldn't be otherwise and it's going in directions they wouldn't otherwise and there it there you know there will be something here it's like so the impressionists jumped on steam trains and and the results are still hanging in museums 750 years later so i yeah i think they are giving new audiences um with new capital new access to new art and within that it's enabling experimentation i remember like back in the 1980s reading one of william gibson the cyberpunk author's early books and one of the characters in it um works in the gallery in europe selling art that is too expensive for anyone to own all of the whole of so that they're just spending their day buying and shelling says shares of art to deal so this is fractionalized art and yes this is something that you can do with existing financial systems but um blockchain technology just makes art fractionalization incredibly easy it makes um collaboration to sort of collect and curate and sell work again people can already do this but it makes it fantastically easy to set up a dow start buying crypto artwork start sort of exhibiting it on different virtual and real platforms and to create a new context for the arts and it's sort of it meshes nicely with new currents in art which are technologically based like ai art like digital illustration art like sort of dimension generative art and it gives them it gives them sort of a reaction a re-anchor a reality anchor in people's minds it's like you know why should i pay you for this um thing that you spent your life learning how to make when i can just press a button and twenty come out it's like well i can establish the provenance of this one that i the person who spent my life learning how to make this have attached to this nft you can't press a button and make 20 of those so yeah it's sort of um yeah it's it's it's so it's a world of possibility it's and and people are making good on that possibility um eve even sort of beyond the platforms that are making sure that people get paid for their art or make up fractionalizable or you know so you can set your artwork today or night and make it configurable in interesting ways and let's also talk about dows because i think those are intersecting with nfts in an interesting way there's been some curation as we obviously when we did the people-pleaser conversation she talked about the pleaser dab which is sprang up spontaneously so what are what's your take on what's happening with dao's and how do you feel like that's changing art curation or how will it change our curation so i i think those are great i i've followed them since the people's republic of doug on the ethereum testnet which is a very early attempt to adapt back when that yeah back when they were still called decentralized autonomous corporations um i i haven't read the books that everyone else has read that have sort of proto-taos in them so i had to come to them um fresh and sort of like everyone i watched the the dow hack on the ethereum chain with with horrified fascination it was like a very slow motion very low tech version of the hack at the end of neuromancer whilst i'm mentioning william gibson novels i knew it would take down some years to recover from that and it has taken down some years to recover from that we've had some very good good experiments in the meantime um not to single out any projects because i shouldn't but there have been various sort of art commissioning ones which have been great and um the toolkits have built up and i mentioned earlier that sort of you know you can get away with more with art and sort of art isn't you know food supplies to part of a country it isn't national security it isn't people's medication um so if you get it wrong with something dealing in art you will lose people money you will harm people's reputations people will be sad but um it's not as life or death with apology to all of my artist friends as other systems that you can see blockchain technology being applied to so yeah our art dales were an obvious an obvious way of doing things i like artist groups i mentioned art and language earlier and i was desperate to see people use the blockchain for stuff other than immediate production of art so yeah the the emergence of um collection curation dales like please adele like uh fingerprints dale that bought some of my work which is an interesting experience um i you know i'm obviously implicated in some of this so you know take anything i say about it with a pinch of salt but i'm yeah i'm excited by this this is precisely what blockchain technology should do it takes sort of human organization human coordination and sort of makes it as easy to organize and allocate capital to projects as like some of the metaphor i think i used before was if you imagine it's the difference between having to set up like a movable type press from the renaissance and sort of you know put every letter that you're going to print into a thing and then squeeze something down it's sort of that compared to the apache web server where you can spin up a linux instance on a cloud server somewhere spin up a web server write some code configure it and you've got something published in you know 10 minutes with global reach with the ability to add um all sorts of things to it and yeah sort of um dao's do this for for corporations for charitable trusts for partnerships for llcs for all kinds of organization you can think of and i've been watching the legal side of this very very closely um primavera to felipe and the co-author did a good book called blockchain and the law which talks about this a bit and the koala project which i know she's a big player in has just published their dao model law which i am not a lawyer and this is a purely personal capacity but i think that's great i recognized a lot of the problems they were trying to tackle and i thought they did it in the massively creative way so i do think that sort of even if it's not enshrined in law and every jurisdiction that every jurisdiction around the world i think it's worth dale's looking at that to ever think through sort of how um fiat law may come knocking for them if they are not careful but yeah so the ability of individuals sort of get together pull their resources um sort of move democratically towards a shared common goal i think that's that's brilliant um i was very interested in like blockchain co-ops early on and i think you know whilst obviously getting venture capital into curation um dallas isn't exactly like a cult that the affordances there can be used for that kind of thing yeah um it's funny you bring up primavera dave philippe she actually ran some workshops that i attended i think it was in the first year that i started covering this so like all the way back in 2015 if i remember correctly um so i'll have to check out book out um so just out of curios and this is the last question but where do you think the nft space will go um you know in the next year so and by that i mean even you know we can talk about dows or what you were talking about this you know with the law or even because i feel like we've talked a lot about visual arts so even if you have thoughts on other types of um you know creators that would also be interesting to hear so um i'm my deep dive has been in visual arts um i i sort of i love the holly plus dao because i'm a big fan of um sort of vocaloid style music i like hatsune miku and i'm a big fan so i don't know the style hollywood i'm sorry so yeah the um she's sort of created a sort of you know an ai version of the her voice and licenses through the dao and i think that's really interesting um way of getting ahead of the use of that kind of technology to quote steal people's voice um but beyond that i yeah i've i've got my nose to the two-dimensional plane of art and i can't really go much further than that um i'm i'm very excited to see sort of um uh with apologies to all my free culture friends i'm very excited to see sort of major ips really leaping on to the blockchain um obviously sort of working at tapa um sort of we've got top shot and we've got other ones that are publicly known to be coming up and some of those are ones i personally love and it's sort of just you know the ability to get that connection to a brand because i'm i'm not a big no logo fan unfortunately i think i think brands can be fun that's good um at the other that's completely the other extreme um as i said seeing more and more people bringing in viewpoints that are simply excluded by by mass media and finding an audience in the place for that using nfts i'm you know i want to see that take off and continue and so the people to be surprised by the art they like and what it means and who's whose lunch they are paying for and then um i i think sort of there are now so many nfts out there um people are going to find more things to do even with ones that aren't game tokens um like there have been various attempts at getting people sort of bring their tokens together and um use them for some game type things um we did one of those when i was at blockade and that was great fun but i think you know sort of people using punks and other portrait style images as their pfps is the first step towards sort of people getting more functionality more value more use from nfts in ways that probably weren't originally intended for them and we're going to see um you know systems and projects and companies springing up to say hey you know you should do more with your nfts here are some fun things you can do and um as as someone who is hashtag not a lawyer but sort of great greatly enjoys reading law with the knowledge that there is no worse interpreter of legal text than the software developer um i've been very interested to see the nft art world slowly rediscover copyright and how this works in art and how artists think of this versus how the mass media thinks of this because artistic technological and legal ideas of originality and copying are very different and nfts combine all three of these which means there are very interesting tensions emerging and we had the the art theft panic a couple of years ago sort of the various punks clones with people trying interesting legal theories to to justify and um so the whole question of you know what what do you get when you buy an nft it's certainly not the copyright which i know surprises many people who buy them but what is it and i'll be interested to see hopefully not case law because i don't want anyone getting sued over this but more clarity coming through over yeah you know what does it mean to buy and sell an nft what rights do you get how does this interface with genuine fair use and and sort of um appropriation and remix art in the way that we don't recreate the the losses that um what i personally view as cultural freedom has experienced over the last few decades as you've needed more and more and more permission uh to get around more and more and more legal and technological impediments to sort of just depict the visual environment that you find yourself in so yeah sort of i want the nft art world to continue growing to continue to bring up so bring new people and new voices into it to sort of realize some of the surplus value all of these nfts have and to if not get its legal house in order and to be clear i'm perfectly happy with the terms of service i've signed on the different platforms i'm on and that kind of thing but um you know to sort of get some clarity for everyone so that we avoid any kind of big lawsuits over nft art and we can just all get on sort of producing arts selling our buying art and creatively transforming art to within the the limits of this shared consensus hallucination of sort of legal and artistic reality yeah and if people are interested in the legal issues i did do an episode with tanya evans stewart levy and um ulta and dhoni on on all of this and it was super super super fascinating so i will put that in the show notes for people um because yeah lots of misconceptions around that um all right ria this was so fun and exciting and interesting i just love learning about your work um so where can people learn more about you and your art yep i have a website at ria dot arts that's r h e a dot a r t and if you go to rio dot art slash newsletter i'm starting up a good old-fashioned email newsletter so that people don't miss out on things that are happening with my art because to my surprise delight there are lots of things happening with it at the moment and i'm on twitter as reapplex r-h-e-a-p-l-e-x and they do respond to questions as long as they're nice yes a good policy all right well thank you so much for coming on unchained yeah thank you it's been brilliant thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about ria check out the show notes for this episode unchained is produced by me laura shin with help from anthony yoon daniel ness and mark wardock thanks for listening [Music] you
