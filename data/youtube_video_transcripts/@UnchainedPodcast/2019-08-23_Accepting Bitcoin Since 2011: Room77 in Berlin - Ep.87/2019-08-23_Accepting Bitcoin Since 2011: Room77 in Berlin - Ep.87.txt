hey guys before we start I have a funny anecdote to tell you some of you may have seen this on Twitter but I'm sharing in case you didn't in the uber on my way to this interview in Berlin my driver was talking to someone via speakerphone in a foreign language and I suddenly realized they kept saying Bitcoin my driver spoke limited English but when he got off the phone I somehow figured out that he sells Bitcoin and he kept asking me if I wanted to buy I tried to explain that I'm a journalist or reporter but he just seemed to be parroting the words back to me so I wasn't quite sure if he actually got it but regardless I just thought it was a hilariously fitting incident on my ride to one of the oldest establishments to accept Bitcoin I hope you enjoy this great interview hi everyone

BPH xrp and more install the crypto comm app now today's guest is your pleasure crypto anarchist and owner of room 77 a bar in Berlin which accepts Bitcoin welcome to York hey Laura and thank you for coming over to the room you began accepting Bitcoin at this bar eight years ago which is practically prehistoric times in crypto how did you come to accept Bitcoin at that time the reason is that I was interested in digital currency electronic cash already two decades before the inception of Bitcoin there was a small but vibrant global digital cash scene that had staged around 200 projects trying to create what we had understood back in the nineties late 80s namely to use cryptography to create a decentralized digital money and all these projects failed either due to technical technological reasons or due to government shutting them down and when Bitcoin turned up it was didn't take long before many of us and many of us understood that a this works and B this cannot be shut down so naturally we were like wow it's finally happening here it is it's happening in our lifetime so of course my first thing was like I'm gonna accept this as payment it's a it's a it's a great idea best money I've seen before of course I want to have it what best idea is to sell burgers and beer for it and so at that time though because it was 2011 how did you accept a Bitcoin I mean we didn't have all the tools that we have now indeed the first payments here were made by people who brought their laptops typed in thirty four digits manually or asked me to send them a payment address via email or something like that next step in efficiency was a was a Bitcoin address shortener so you would only have to type in a short URL into your web browser to get our payment address until andreas yield back who was one of the very first people here joining the the first Bitcoin meetup wrote the first mobile wallet for Bitcoin the Bitcoin wallet for Android because he didn't want to bring have to bring his laptop here anymore well he and the rest is history well and when was that that he created that that must have been 2011 yeah yeah that's definitely a long time ago especially for all this development so do you convert the Bitcoin immediately to euros or do you keep it in Bitcoin of course we keep it in Bitcoin as long as we can of course we also have to pay taxes so we have to sell Bitcoin now and then to do so and how many Bitcoin purchases do you typically get a night I would guess around five to ten percent on a normal night whereas when we have Bitcoin events here or for example we run the longest-running Bitcoin meetup on the planet then you it's it's rather sixty seventy eighty percent on a night like that and does people's willingness to spend their Bitcoin correlate with the markets in any way not their willingness to spend it but the interest in Bitcoin clearly correlates with them with the market price of Bitcoin whereas I knew the higher the price the more people who are actually not enthusiastic about a free decentralized money for the world but more interested in making some capital gains yeah and they like come here and they ask questions about it of course the higher the price the fuller or the the more crowded the Bitcoin meet up which is quite annoying to many of the old bitcoiners who gather here to actually talk about technology and don't want to have a camera put in their face by the journalists asking them how rich they are or some kind of coin promoters and next to them telling them about what the next Bitcoin will be or something like that so actually bitcoiners enjoy the Bitcoin meetups hear a lot more when the price is low I I totally relate to that so then what are the demographics of the people that typically come here to spend it in Oran also how they change over time there is no typical or prototype Bitcoin user literally what has changed over time is but that's visible everywhere in conferences and and anywhere else and in the Bitcoin space is that you have people with suits and with ties who talk about regulatory compliance and the importance of being okay with the SEC and so on and so on those people weren't and Bitcoin in the early days okay and so is that why I saw the sign you discouraged payments from coinbase circle and bitpay not particularly the reason for that is that well Bitcoin has been built as the first digital bearer asset the world has seen I find it quite absurd to put that into a bank coin base is a bank they hold your money they initiate transactions for you they receive transactions for you that's one point the other point is that when people pay me from their coinbase wallet they actually don't pay me what they actually do is you know they show me the screen I tell them I cannot see your payment on the blockchain or or in the mempool they heard but i but i sent you the money they show me their little coin based green cell send an attorney no you did not send me money you ask your banker to maybe send me money and your banker has not sent that money yet but it's still not the reason the actual reason is a coin especially coin based but also the other the other compliant Bitcoin banks as I would call them they actually survey their customers not only as much as banks too but even more than banks too due to the nature of the blockchain because they can let me explain if you take 10 euros out of the bank ATM and go somewhere and spend it on Mariana or on on gambling or whatever the banker doesn't know in the in the Bitcoin space the banker does know coinbase can see what you do with your money after you took it after you withdrew it from your online account into your private wallet they will follow the money over several hops and they will enforce United States laws everywhere else on the planet example here is it is it is legal in Germany to make a bet on a soccer game it is illegal in the United States so if you pay me with your coinbase wallet and I next day feel like spending some of that money which is now my money on something that is legal in Germany but illegal in the United States then coinbase very likely will shut down your account so we actually did that for fun a couple of times and yeah and that's why we have to design it's just there is literally no point of leaving your Bitcoin in any custodial system and give up give up your voting rights give up your your evaluation power and so on and we just want to discourage that and did you figure that out because like customers weren't happy after they realized that their they made a payment to you and their oh no you just have to go you just have to go online you find thousands of stories of people who had their their account shut down and try to my and realized oh my god I did this or that or whatever so you basically kind of knew and that's why you put the sign up yeah and it's also due to my reputation I offered a no Riley about Bitcoin five years ago in Germany and due to my reputation yeah I do get invited by government officials for panel discussions and stuff like that also by law enforce law enforcement people invited me and so on and I do know as a matter of fact that coinbase and other online Bitcoin custodians do actually offer the regulators and Brussels to survey their customers they they actually say we can we can follow the money much better even than banks and that's what we of course going to do and so on all right which is the comes to your philosophy absolutely all right so we're gonna discuss some other exciting things such as his lightning Network point-of-sale device but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto comm is the place you can buy crypto at true cost you can buy over 40 coins at the lowest possible prices with no fees and no markups at crypto comm we grow your crypto for you too you can earn up to 8% per year on BTC eth XRP and more when you deposit in any of the 1 month 3 month or flexible terms download the crypto comm app on iOS or Android now will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins will government-backed stable coins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan the answer is maybe virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy but that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations cipher trace is working on this vision of the future sign up to stay up to date on the privacy enhanced compliance initiative and receive authoritative crypto AML reports quarterly WWC fruit-trees comm slash keep crypto clean back to my conversation with your plot sir of room 77 have you gotten other businesses in this area interested in accepting Bitcoin oh we did in the early days this used to be called the Bitcoin keeps because we actually went out that was in the early enthusiastic times 2012-2013 we did actually walk out and try to convince other bar owners shop owners here on the street to accept Bitcoin we had we had an enabler team that we sent there to check their infrastructure could these people accept Bitcoin are we gonna set it up for them trains for them and so on and it was like two dozens maybe three dozens of shops in this area accepting Bitcoin they are mostly not here anymore this whole area is undergoing a very heavy gentrification process so it's not that people gave up accepting Bitcoin is literally a business has changed and we stopped doing it after a certain time as well because it was quite a lot of work on one hand and on the other hand we realized that most of these businesses didn't get any significant Bitcoin payments they none of them had the success as the room had kind of naturally because all of that history the Bitcoin history that has been written at room 77 makes Bitcoin enthusiasts want to come here and pay in Bitcoin and other shops don't have that advantage so it was in 2012-13 that was not very successful even though there is one or another bar owner who did get enough Bitcoin business back then that they actually thanked me today they kept let me put it this way yeah oh well it was it was not enough potential cash it out it was just much like why should I care why should I do this for these 25 euros just leave it in the wallet and years pass by I love that that's great that's funny so I know you know you just mentioned the meetups have there been other businesses that have come out of the community I guess that has been fostered here out of the community or just yeah of course I mean there's that there's many Berliner startups that came out of this community that doesn't mean they came out of the room but the room was always kind of the central the central place for this comp age you like the meetups like just people meeting here or of course you have the once a month meeting of Bitcoin enthusiasts and years later you have a lot of startups where many of these enthusiasts are cooperating and are being partners now yeah I guess the hangouts at room 77 did their part for it you also mentioned local bitcoins cut well I mentioned that because of jeremiah congas was also one of the very first visitors to the bitcoin meet up to the early bitcoin Meetup is he a co-founder of local bitcoins he is the founder of local bit he's local bitcoins and he was hanging out in those what we called crypto summer of 2012 and 13 and he was hanging out here yeah and inventing local bitcoins come on table number two here and you also mentioned that Alec deuteron came here where the saying goes you know um before etherium Vitalik was actually trying to convince the rest of the Bitcoin community and especially the Bitcoin core developers that smart contracting capabilities should be implemented in Bitcoin but nobody else wanted that so apparently at a meeting here at the room he decided to make his own coin that's what I have heard from the Syrian people and I do know that they all did hang out here back in the days okay I can ask him you actually end up there's one summer we called the Bitcoin group therapy because Bitcoin people from all over the world kind of were in Berlin and we went for example to the temple Hoover field and sat down in the Sun in a in a big circle and everybody introduced m7 hi I'm working wonders on that project higher and until somebody got up and was like hi I think this looks like a group therapy which I think was there too okay and so now I think the new thing that you're working on is this Lightning Network point-of-sale device can you talk about that well I'm not particularly working on it but the people working in it are inspired by room 77 so we did have the first routed Lightning payment in a shop on test net we had the first routed Lightning payment on maintenance when was that that must have been a year ago or something oh well that's just you're in summer there was a there was a lightning hackathon here in Berlin and the guys actually on Friday evening came together and said we want to be able to pay at room 77 on Sunday evening through a POS system and Sunday evening it was done but that was still a custodial system and what Christian Haute saw and his friend Ben have now built it's this little device lying here on the table that I showed you before it's literally the first non-custodial lightning payment POS system that does not hold its own keys that mean it can break here it can be stolen or whatever nobody has access to our lightning channel but we can still accept lightning payments here through that thing oh wow that's so cool that easy that is a huge step and Christian and Ben did a great job creating the thing it took them quite a while so all the credit goes to them the only credit that goes to me is sitting there and whining about Verna can I have my lightning POS system you promised me what so yeah so how many transactions have you done we are lightning or via lightning I can't I can't tell you on this thing less than a dozen or something because it's like literally printing you it only it had his first kind of real world deployment on the last Bitcoin meetup here two weeks ago okay and right now we are having a summer break so we only open for the Bitcoin meetups oh oh and that's why yeah I see all right so but when when people want to use it did they tell you specifically I want to pay you via lightning yeah okay we actually when somebody says but I want to pay in Bitcoin we actually as on train or lightning oh okay I think it's incredible how fast lightning mobile lightning wallets are spreading because I'm really surprised how many people already pay in lightning if our lightning because you know it was still kind of bumpy and sometimes not working not talking about this device but the the iterations before people actually complained that they cannot pay in lightning or like what the hell is going on I'm on room 77 and their lightning servers down on the rubber so yeah it's funny well they're on the very cutting edge so are there any downsides downsides to accepting Bitcoin as a merchant I will not see any if you're not the first downside to room 77 is that whenever a person from that from from the financial authorities at X auditor looks at our place Bitcoin jumps into their face and triggers all kinds of associations with black money and and money laundering and whatever so I believe we are the most audited bar at least in Germany we get every extra audit you know and the auditors look at me alone you they asked really not very competent question about Bitcoin and so on and you know I I once told an auditor lady who kind of tried to imply that we probably cheating taxes with Bitcoin I told her that I take this as a personal offence that she thinks that I'm stupid enough to cheat Texas with the 5% of payments that we taken in Bitcoin and not with a 95% in euro cash money right I literally think it's an insult for me to think I'm so stupid but here doesn't help but no normally there's there's no there should not be any downside anymore the the old days are over Bitcoin has arrived in society in financial regulators more and more except it's a except its existence they may like it or not but they have to accept its existence they have to accept that the people using Bitcoin are not criminals and so I wouldn't think that there's any downside for any merchant nowadays to accept Bitcoin and nowadays the way that you accept it is preferably like a non chain transaction and is it just like you use QR codes to send it or okay I don't care if it's an on train or a lightning transaction oh right right but you know as we mentioned there there been just a few lightning transactions so brilliant obviously has also been one of the main hubs for aetherium development do you have any plans to accept aetherium no no why not because aetherium does not seem to have the monetary qualities that i would expect from the better money from a sound money that's the simple reason but you do accept I think I saw Manero I we do except on arrow that's the only alt coin we accept that has to do with the fact that I do believe that anonymity privacy and fungibility are actually the most important next steps that Bitcoin needs to achieve or needs to be optimized in Mineiro is an interim solution for that and I also really like the Monaro community it's a kind of a fun place so yeah for that mainly for the reason of anonymity and functionality we accept Manero whereas I have to say in Manero I also don't quite see the monetary qualities that Bitcoin offers the monetary soundness it's actually for yet for the anonymity all right well blisters on my show who ever visit Berlin you definitely need to come to this bar it I mean it's close right now but it still looks pretty awesome to me so York thank
