editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the august 16 2022 episode of unchained with the crypto.com app you can buy earn and spend crypto in

just a wallet it's a non-custodial browser extension engineered for users to seamlessly and securely experience web3 like never before explore avalanche dapps nfts bridges subnets and more today today's guest is surojit chatterjee chief product officer at coinbase welcome surrogate thank you for having me here laura tell us the story of how it is that you got into crypto and came to work at coinbase it's a i had to go back a few years actually my first introduction with crypto of course i did the read the paper uh bitcoin white paper and so on but i was not really into crypto till 2016. and the story is i was working in a company in india so i worked at google then moved to india for a couple of years and i was had a product at a company called flipkart it's an e-commerce company now what's what was unique about the company and unique about e-commerce at that time in india was most of the payments were you know on delivery so you go deliver your products and people give you cash so most of indian economy wasn't was cash enabled and still is what happened in 2016 was one fine day government just surprised everyone and announced this thing called demonetization which meant all the existing currencies were kind of useless and basically you had a little bit of time within a couple of weeks you had to go and deposit your currencies in a bank and then you had to wait for government to print new currencies and get those currencies and of course as you can imagine that immediately tanked our business because our business was about collecting cash and people were just you know depositing their cash to banks and it's not just our business like i saw you know most of india is unbanked was unbanked it's still unbanned uh government of course is doing a lot of work so there's a lot of it was a huge pain for ordinary citizens to you know go open a bank account deposit their currencies and then wait for many days sometimes to get money in in small amounts and that's when i bought my first bit uh cryptocurrency my first bitcoin my ethereum and i i thought okay there must be a better way than uh you know public common issued currencies there must be a better way to run this whole monetary system and that got me into crypto but i was uh you know i was not really playing with crypto in a big way until i joined coinbase and that was late 2019 early 2020. yeah i love this story because so often i'm asked by particularly like u.s reporters things like what's the use for cryptocurrencies when we have credit cards and whatever and i always say to them oh you should talk to people in other countries because and people in countries that don't have as good functioning financial services they grab on to the use case for this much more quickly so you're the chief product officer at coinbase and that is a company that actually really started more like a fintech company one of its greatest early achievements was creating a credible and solid connection to the existing thinking system and also making the user experience of buying crypto simple and user-friendly but at this point the company has over 100 million users and the crypto space has grown you know exponentially in a number of directions on top of that a whole host of other companies also offer that great user experience so at this point what do you think sets coinbase apart what products would prompt customers to stay on coinbase after they've purchased their coins yup absolutely look i i think of um coinbase as a gateway to a three right we started as you said we started with as a financial company uh we allowed people to buy sell crypto and that was really the first step if you want to do anything in crypto you need tokens but you you know how the the industry is emerging we're seeing real utility real applications being built on top of this blockchain so my vision on product side is how do we bring a billion plus users you know billion first and then multiple billions to crypto and web3 and how do we enable them to use all the applications all the h3 services with ease and peace of mind i mean i think if we do that not just as client business industry we're going to bring a major portion of the gdp to come on chain and i think that just helps create more economic freedom for everyone that kind of tries way that really ties with a company's mission to create more economic freedom so how do we do that how do we realize that vision you know my mental image is of a bridge if if you allow me so it's a bridge between the fiat world and the crypto world and increasingly the way three world with two foundational pillars on that under that bridge one is trust and other is ease of use and you know how they build this bridge so i think of you know two ways first we build an integrated product suite to give our users access both in retail and institutional users access to what i call all the assets all the webs all the apps and all the chains by all the assets i mean you know both assets on centralized exchanges like ourselves but also indexes things like nfts things like ens you know by verbs i mean things like you know you can stake your ass that you can pay and receive and and you can borrow and lend and so on all the apps means all the gaps in with three services and so on and then the second part of this is how do we help accelerate the ecosystem by giving developers the tools they need and that's what we are doing with on this cloud for example we are building tools the developers can build quickly easily and securely the amazing with three services so that's kind of the overarching vision we have today so for that first pillar of the bridge where you talked about giving access to these different services that to me sounds like a custodial model like a centralized model would you say that that is the vision going forward for coinbase no i didn't use the word custodial actually giving access both in a custodial fashion and self-custodial fashion and let me give a couple of examples in a coinbase wallet is our flagship self-custodial product it's getting a lot of love on twitter these days because we have invested in that product we have made it really the best multi-chain i believe the best multichain wallet out there and of course we have a lot of work to do still continue to improve uh the other part of this is how we are in integrating d5 and web3 into our coinbase main application as well main app and we are doing this through a unique innovation uh you know we've worked on mpc based mpc technology for a long time i'm sorry mpc what's that multi-party compute computation so let me explain so basically we integrated this wallet called dap wallet into our main app the way it works is we keep a short of your key you keep a shot of the key on your device so you still you can actually use that wallet to access any defy app anyway app right from within coinbase main application if you lose your device we can actually restore your key because we have a shard with us so you can call our customer service and we can help you so it basically allows mainstream users like we have hundred million users to the verified users to access wave 3 and d5 without worrying about managing their their keys or you know losing devices that often happens like using their device losing their seed phrase and so on so that's how we are building the bridge to f3 through all our applications so it's not just the self custodial in this wallet but through this what is called semi custodial wallet in our main app as well and even on the on institutional side actually we are working on ways to give institutions access to d5 because i think that's going to be the future the innovation that that will be unleashed we have already seen it during the defy summer and you know nft summer and so on uh we are already seeing on the innovation and we want to make sure our users can access that innovation through every product we have so it's not just custodial in fact one of the mantras we have internally is you know build d5 first so we are always thinking okay how can we give users access to not just first party services that we are building but also third party services so today in coinbase main app you can buy tokens through our exchange directly you can also buy tokens on it on a dex because we have done a native dex integration we have worked worked with dex aggregators so you can buy very large number of tokens directly through texas again powered by this dap wallet that i just described and so since crypto has constantly evolving and as you just described you're building out this whole suite of products that you know service different communities within crypto you know those who would prefer a custodial experience those who would prefer self-custodial and uh and yet not not be fully dependent on themselves for their own security you know in like maybe two or three years what products do you think will become a bigger part of the coinbase experience compared to right now you always need your tokens to participate in the crypto economy so our brokerage our custody and exchange i think they will continue to be important because that's the gateway every time we have some section of users who are doing more advanced stuff there is like next 10 million 100 million users who are just getting introduced so it's like a spectrum right there are more users coming in who are doing basic kind of just getting introduced to crypto buying their first bitcoin and maybe they will do that on a centralized exchange they don't know what is it x and so on but a segment of users will start using d5 apps a segment of users will be even more advanced will use you know things like decentralized social applications we'll use gi 3 gaming will use nfts and so on so if you ask me we'll see increasingly and that's the hope for the whole i would say the industry right increasingly crypto become a utility beyond just a speculative asset or or just just an investment asset so you know you you buy sell crypto but when it becomes a utility it means can you use crypto every day you know one of the things i talk about sometimes is a toothbrush test which is like you know you use a toothbrush in the morning and in the evening so twice a day so can you find those toothbrush use cases for crypto right and our crypto enabled applications right that will be bigger and bigger for the whole industry and i think that's good for the industry because for this industry to really succeed really go mainstream we have to figure out those use cases i think nft was a good example we have seen it brought in a new set of users to crypto who are not really in like traders in a traditional sense they are collectors right we'll see other different types of communities different types of users come to crypto as we as the whole industry uh in the community invents new types of applications and services yeah i don't know if i would 100 agree with that because i think a lot of them are speculators too flipping their jpegs always starts with that i don't think there is anything bad with with that it's it it starts with that but i think you know over time we'll find we are already seeing you know there are real applications there are communities for example getting created who are in a token gated community so you get special access brands are doing that social access to events or special social kind of gatherings and so on based on the tokens you hold now that's not really speculation that that's like a human behavior of forming kind of tribes and communities and social interaction so at this point you are trying to service kind of a range of clients where do you prioritize you know when it comes to institutional versus retail how do you kind of think about these different segments so we started with a with a retail focused offering right when it's still the strongest part or biggest part of our business at this point because we started early uh we are of course seeing a huge momentum on our in our institutional business you know we just announced the blackrock deal it's a landmark deal not just for coinbase but for the whole industry and i would say it's not just the retail users and institutions it's also the developers that's the third segment that we cater to i talked a little bit about coinbase cloud we want to help grow this ecosystem that's the other part you know again when we grow the ecosystem we also grow so building tools to help developers build their applications faster more secure way you know in a scalable way we are building a gif allowing them to access like blockchain nodes run their own nodes around their own validators earned rewards you know those taking uh plug in a fiat rail with coinbase pay and so on so it's the three customer segments that we think about and i would say it's a it's a flywheel it's not one versus others for example with our institutional customers and retail customers we are creating more liquidity when both of these flows come together in our exchange right institutions would love to trade against retail flow sometimes and you know more liquidity means it's better for everyone better pricing better execution for everyone so that's one example when you work with developers and help make the dapps better for example we can we actually help the users who are coming through coinbase wallet or our main app where accessing these dapps have better experience so it's a it's a flywheel and that's how i think about it it's not like one versus other we have to kind of do all of these three things to make sure the fly will keep spinning and one other group is sort of the more crypto native people who are kind of their own special segment within retail i would bet many of them are pretty unlikely or unwilling to use a centralized exchange so how do you think about attracting them as a customer or do you feel that's just a different segment yeah so what is interesting about that segment is by the way we love that segment we listen to them all the time they're vocal on twitter i get a lot of product feedback from them and i think it's super helpful i always think when you are building a product you've got to think about the power user because eventually what will happen is your regular users will kind of it's a graduation they'll graduate to become more and more sophisticated you don't want to lose that user you want to make your product in such a way that the power users can also use it it's it's not exactly this segment but one example here is how we are you know combining retail advanced trading within our main app you know you know in the previously or even now we have a separate app called coinbase pro where advanced traders go and we thought okay you know a lot of our regular users actually become advanced traders and how do we bring that functionality in the main app now for the crypto native crypto forward folks you know some of the things that they will tell us is hey can you make it easy for me to on ramp uh uh create a fiat on-ramp from uh you know from your bank or whatever to directly to an l2 directly to an uh to another chain like savannah and so on and because they you know how do they get their crypto and play into this these new blockchains they have to come to some centralized exchange and first move their move their fiat money into crypto so we did that we actually integrated an l2 direct on-ramp to l2 into our main app also into coinbase wallet for this segment in particular in a coinbase wallet they they are already using coinbase wallet they're loving coinbase wallet it's the most sophisticated wallet out there a multi-chain wallet we we actually support more than seven uh l2s and uh blockchains today it's also a wallet that allows you if you use client-based wallet you can give get visibility into all your tokens across all chains you can get visibility into all your investments in any defy app out there right on the home page of our coinbase wallet and you know you don't need to switch wallets to play into another another chain we are making it super easy for you to move assets between chains without needing a third-party bridge so they are loving it we are getting a lot of good feedback so the idea is yes we want to build products for the crypto forward crypto native folks and i think we have made a lot of progress in last year and a half in that direction and and it shows in our products i'm sure you have seen the press coverage of this and there you know unfortunately is one area that um i think coinbase has seemed to have failed when it comes to products for crypto natives after initially getting 8.4 million emails waiting for the nft product the day of coinbase's launch had only 150 transactions and since then trading volume has stayed relatively low this week the marketplace has been doing below ten thousand dollars in volume per day versus millions of dollars worth of transactions on openc and looks rare so what went wrong there let me first take a step back and uh kind of say what happened and and describe kind of our perspective a little bit so first there was probably a very high expectation set on a product that is very early you know nft is still in beta it's been just a few weeks and you know we are we are seeing engagement customer engagement in the the service i think it's been like five months right uh it just came out of beta very recently laura it's it's still very early it's not out of beta actually still beta i think for five months we have made a lot of noise early on but actually it was in front of the user a couple of months back you know i always think about technology products you know often take a longer time and iterations right we don't expect we try a lot of new products we don't expect them to succeed on day one i'll tell you one example i was at google and google came up with android and the flip phone when iphone was already there and very popular and it it was uh it was like a throwback from the 80s or 90s right nobody wanted to use it it everybody said it was terrible and we all know what happened like where android is today because google kept investing in it and was committed in in it for the long term that's what we are going to do we think of nft actually is an area that we want to commit to for the longer term and not just by coinbase through coinbase marketplace so let me kind of take give a little bit more perspective on our overall nft strategy and that might be helpful look you know as i said before we think nft will be a huge driver for the industry as a whole right it represents not just art video music but it's also you know objects in gaming or metaverse membership access to in token-enabled social networks and many other use cases so it's it's it's going to be huge and it's it's going to bring in a lot of users to that effect what we are focused on is helping creators and bringing more users to creators whether that that creator or that creation is on coinbase nft or on openc or wearable or anywhere else and that's what we are doing so you know if you look at coinbase wallet today i will claim its prop it's the best nft wallet out there users can now view nft bids on multiple uh marketplaces including you know openc and everywhere else directly from within wallet they can access both first party and third-party marketplaces through the browser that we have web3 browser that we have embedded within wallet they can store their nfts again we have done we have written our own indexer so it's very simple when you go and buy nft through coinbase wallet you're going to see it within seconds rather than you know half an hour or longer for other wallets and we have done the same for our main coin based apps we have integrated a web3 browser and mpc-based app wallet so you can access all the nft marketplaces in a unique way through our main app as well so the idea is how do you bring all our users 100 million plus users into nft not just into our nft marketplace but into any marketplace out there then on the creator side by the way one more thing i want to mention it's also not just on coinbase on some third party so we just announced this partnership with meta so we we are enabling all instagram customers to store their nfts using coinbase wallet i mean that's this is a huge deal because you know hundreds of millions of you users will get the taste of nft for the first time and we're happy with that now that's on the user side on the creator side we want to help the creators to bring the their collection to markets easily and enable them to interact with the community and that's a feature we actually added from day one on nft marketplace they can and we are seeing that creators are interacting directly with the users on our interface rather than on discord or somewhere else and recently we did this experiment i would not say experiment a new feature actually introduced this concept of called drops on nft marketplace so drops are like primary sales of exclusive nft collection and we have partnered with like top media houses brands prominent creators you know names like bill murray chive media group project pink man people pleaser and this is what happened laura so this was a new thing we said okay let's try it let's see what happens we every drop so far has sold out within minutes and that just shows the latent demand that is there on on our platform and we are working on how to unleash that demand how to bring the best collection how to enable the creators to bring their best collection to to our platform so that's kind of our overarching strategy we're going to continue to invest in nft as a category and continue to grow the ecosystem through our tools and not it's not just nfd marketplace through all our tools and that's kind of important to realize where it's not a single bit in nft for us so essentially it sounds like the marketplace is not really the main focus in your nft strategy but i'm sure you probably saw that uh nick tomano an early coinbase employee tweeted that he felt this kind of social strategy for your nft marketplace was not the right one and that really it should just be a simple fiat to nft on-ramp so why is it that you're not focused on something as simple as that especially since it would play to coinbase's strength these two are not mutually exclusive to each other right we are we have added uh since we launched for example we integrated coinbase bay with coinbase nft now coinbase pay actually externalizes all our gear to crypto on-ramps so if you're a coinbase user coinbase customer you can just log in and you can pull your crypto very easily or you can directly pull from fiat to crypto on a third-party app or including in this nft so we have done that uh we are making it easy easier and easier to bring coinbase users to find this nft but as i explained that's not the only thing we're going to bring users to nft period and you know coinbase nft is one of the marketplaces on the issue of social i think it's still very early days we are seeing very interesting engagement we are learning a lot for example we are learning that you know sometimes the comments on individual nfts is probably not the most useful thing but comments on like a collection is very useful so users are commenting on overall collection we are seeing there is interaction between the creator and the user so users are giving feedback to the creator or having a conversation with the creator we're also seeing interaction between create multiple creators creators themselves are are commenting on each other's collections but these are all new kind of behavior that is that is forming it's a brand new concept right so it will like anything else in technology you know people will always say oh that didn't work you know after a few years it becomes the biggest thing i'll say even to look at something like podcast that 10 12 years back people were confused is this going to be a really a kind of a media or is it just one-off thing that will die down and today you can see you know we are talking in this podcast laura it's a it's a real force in in the composition of our media today in fact i consume almost all my news from podcasts rather than from mainstream channels or mainstream media so we'll see behaviors emerge we are we are not afraid to experiment that's another thing i'll say look nfts came out of a concept called project 10 where we have we actually found bottom-up ideas innovation from our employees and we fund them very small funding it's like seed funding two or three engineers um maybe one designer one product manager and we see if there are green shoots and then after a while we you know we either pause the project or a fund again it's very kind of venture kind of model internally and that's how nfts came up so uh we and they had a unique concept a new concept the team and we said great let's take some risk let's try a few things out so we're not afraid of trying things out and that's how innovation happens i always think if i try out like 10 things and all 10 are successful maybe i'm not taking enough risk right that's almost impossible so yeah although i i do think it was surprising to find out that only uh 30 people were working on the nft project considering what a large staff you had at that time it was not even 30 people till uh december we had like six or seven people right which given your head count was a little surprising uh because nfts obviously had been huge for quite a while one other area that i wanted to ask about which was also perceived as a miss by coinbase was the d-gen trilogy when you released part one of it people were responding things like the sec should be investigating this for illegally inducing cringe and you know nick tomino also mentioned this in his tweet there's a perception that coinbase has lost its touch with the crypto native part of the community or frankly doesn't even really have people like that on its staff anymore whereas obviously in its earlier years it was more kind of on the cutting edge so how do you get that back or you know if even if you're going to say to me you haven't lost it then how do you change that perception again i'll say we try lots of different things so this is something our marketing team tried some things are more successful than others you know when we tried our super bowl ad for example i i think djs loved it uh crypto forward folks really loved it and it was a unique concept this was probably didn't hit the mark quite for many some people uh we understand that we take the feedback and we'll go and try other things but i think it's it's not true that we don't have crypto forward folks in the uh on coinbase today i think if you look at the innovation we are churning out it would not be possible without crypto forward folks you know we are the first company i just talked about building this very unique mpc based wallet right a semi-custodial wallet you probably i don't know if you follow pete kim or others uh you know he has talked about it he is one of the engineers i respect a lot there are many other people like that you know we are building um this you know interoperability bridges between multiple blockchains that would not be possible without people on knowing crypto very deeply and being embedded into the ecosystem so i don't think that is right of course many people will have many opinions we respect that we take that feedback when some everything will not hit 100 because we try a lot of different things we are more diversified company now not just building one product and that's a very deliberate choice we're a multi-product company i talked about you know how we are creating this flywheel between you know multiple customer segments how we are building products for each one of them but overall i and i think we are doing red pretty well we are seeing our customers love us and even a lot of dj's love us uh but today i'm convinced what some of the feedback on coinbase wallet is great feedback on coinbase pay has been great you know a lot of some of the top wallets like metamask and phantom actually has integrated coinbase pay and people who have used it have said it's great a feedback on our l2 on-ramps has been great um so i can keep giving more examples but you know it's it's it's it will always be true that when you are a slightly larger company and you have a diversified portfolio there are things that we will try that may not succeed but overall you know will try many things and many will succeed as well all right so in a moment we're going to talk about some products that people are eagerly anticipating but first a quick word from

that coinbase recently signed with blackrock is something that had a lot of people discussing blackrock is the largest asset manager in the world with 10 trillion dollars in assets under management it's also the parent company for ishares which is the largest etf provider globally what is the vision for the types of products and services that you think will result from this partnership absolutely let me probably first give a little bit of context on the partnership itself first i think for this partnership to come together during the you know darkest kind of time of trip to winter is a testament of how far we have come as an industry uh and as a company so you know institutions are really thinking of crypto as an as a new asset class and they are looking at coinbase as the gold standard in the industry so you know how what does this entail as you know blackrock is world's largest acid manager they have over eight eight and a half trillion dollars in under you know management and they have this platform called aladdin which is their portfolio management software it provides their investment professionals a way to view and manage their investments on a daily basis now aladdin also has over 300 other large asset managers that use algorithm so they are bringing in another 22 trillion dollars in uh in in management so that's the access we create now what will what's going to happen is coinbase prime is going to be integrated directly within aladdin so this asset managers now will pro would be will have access to crypto trading custody prime brokerage all the reporting that prime provides right inside their regular workflow that they use day to day to manage all their other assets so this is a an incredible opportunity i think for for the industry as a whole because this unlocks and enables this this trillions of dollars of assets to eventually enter crypto and web 3. so that's what is exciting about this partnership and you know we are we've started working with blackrock by first half of 2023 we are going to start roll out the first phase of this partnership so we'll start giving access to a lot of this functionality within our then and then you know we've kept adding more and more functionality we are going to start with bitcoin first but then also move to uh make all this functionality available for other assets and what's your sense of how much demand is fueling this because last year blackrock ceo larry fink said he didn't see much institutional demand for crypto and we've seen in the past there have been times when there were these seemingly big partnerships that were announced with for instance retailers accepting crypto as payment and eventually they didn't amount to anything meaningful so you know what's your sense of just how much actual demand from institutions is driving this and will actually result in real money coming in absolutely i mean blackrock will tell us and a lot of our institute other institutional customers will tell us that their customers are asking them about crypto that's why they're interested in talking to us so we are seeing this demand right as crypto as an asset class uh keep growing in in amongst institutional investors so and this deal has fueled even more i would say interest so we are getting a lot of calls from other institutions who are interested who are curious and they want to understand more so i think this is a great time for crypto to invite and welcome more institutional investors so i'm i'm very bullish on our institutional business very bullish on what we can do to help these institutions get into crypto and not just buying you know i talked about this a little bit earlier not just buying bitcoin a lot that's how many of them will start but then you know get into lots of different types of coins all coins and so on but also get into d5 and with three and participate we'll see that also happen in the future and i'll mention one more thing here a few months back we announced this with uh some of our actually industry partners you know others taking providers a new protocol called alluvial finance so this basically alluvial finance provides liquid staking for enterprise grade liquid staking as meant for institutions so i think we'll see more and more of those infrastructure will get built by us by other other players in the industry as well like a version of stake to eat but for institutional clients right exactly okay so speaking of staking you recently announced that coinbase would be adding ethereum to its list of staking options for u.s clients u.s institutional clients and obviously at the moment the market is expressing a lot of interest in trading ether due to the upcoming merge however after the merge if a majority of institutions decide to stake with coinbase prime how do you prevent coinbase from having the keys to the largest percentage of staked eath and sort of centralizing it that way yeah we are careful about that we you know we we work with of course we have uh with our bison trails acquisition with coinbase cloud we have our interest on validation validated infrastructure that coinbase cloud maintains but we always make sure we are diversifying with with other partners as well that's been we have been very thoughtful about the risks customers have in taking the risks that we carry for them and that's kind of what has been a principle in how we offered this product you know you will see some of our competitors offer very high for example very high api and staking and so on we deliberately don't do that because we want to make sure we can stick to our commitments when the asset prices swing like widely right same thing so we are going to just be very diligent and make sure it's sufficiently decentralized and um you know it's it's always thinking about with the customer lens how much risk we are we are taking so for the customer okay yeah i mean it just almost goes against your own self-interest it's like like you're you know i mean if you're following what's happening with the other liquid uh staking derivative providers then there is sort of a tendency towards centralization i wanted to ask you a little bit more about coinbase wallet because you've you know talked about a lot and i was running are you monetizing that already and you know whether or not you are if a lot of trading volume were to move from the exchange to coinbase wallet then how would that change your revenue and by how much yeah uh so let me kind of talk about coinbase how we are monetizing coinbase wallet it since that's the essence of the question so we are we charge a fee for dex trading today through coinbase wallet we we have connected with x aggregators similar to actually metamask and other wallets as well they also charge a fee we charge a fee so that's why how we are we are monetizing coinbase wallet today so it's basically an access fee and what would happen to your revenue if all the trading volume were to move from the centralized exchange over to coinbase wallet yeah i'll not speculate on eventualities and kind of specific numbers so let me kind of explain the user flow right a little bit so today you if you go to coinbase main app for many tokens if you click on them you will already see that we are telling the user hey this this token is not available for trade on our main app because it's not listed in our centralized exchange or we can't list it for other reasons but you can trade it in coinbase wallet so we already have a connection from the main app to coinbase wallet so we see some users they will come to the main app then jump to the coinbase wallet and do trading they also like the convenience of trading in the main app so i don't think it's one or the other again many users find the convenience of like a custodial you know experience and also a loafy experience in some ways see the when you go to a dex scenario it's not just the access fee there's gas fees involved and so on on coinbase you know you don't you're not paying those expensive gas fees because you are it's a centralized exchange and we are in aggregate uh putting the uh writing the transactions into on chain and so on so there are use cases for both and i think what will what we are going to see is some users will choose so some users like the convenience of a custodial experience like the usability some users prefer the privacy or the the freedom to to manage their own keys manage their own assets the the security that it gives in their mind they you know so they were they're going to go to self-custodial wallet or coinbase wallets we are building choices for our users that's how i think about it you know and we'll see how the you know how user behavior changes over time the last several months coinbase has been losing market share in may ftx surpassed coinbase to become the second highest volume exchange worldwide how does coinbase compete with the likes of ftx which is younger nimbler and perhaps perceived to be hipper so first thing on marketshare we are still the biggest u.s exchange right now and we have majority market share in the us there are really three three reasons for the market share one you know a lot of our retail traders in a declining market they actually are hurtlers they don't trade as much i think second we have seen a lot of activity in offshore exchanges uh mostly on coins or tokens that we don't support again for various reasons we don't support many tokens because we don't think they are safe or they they can they pass our kind of scrutiny on which tokens we should list number three is we haven't had the exposure to a lot of liquidity events that has happened in the industry that other exchanges had exposure to you know three ac celsius voyager luna terra luna episode and all that so in some interesting way that showed up as as more trading volume in other places now to your question on how we think about competition and how do we think well why do we think we we will still win first i i think competition is good i talked about this you know it's i think the the space for more competitor uh it just makes the industry better it's healthy more innovation and so on i think in terms of why we think we are in a good place i think the you know first our focus on trust that we want to be the most trusted option for customers period and that comes from our investment in security preventing hacks you know compliance and this is this is ex this is a lot of investment for many years you know some of our competitors may not focus on it it's also robust risk management good customer support basically like not being sketchy that's how i put it the the second point here is look we are really obsessed with how to make things simple for the customer and we want to eventually have a billion users accessing this new economy through our products and that means actually investing deep in technology it's not just about ui flow i talked a little bit about mpc wallet how it makes things simple it's a long sustained investment in technology deep technology you know when we built the on-ramp direct online to l2 it may seem simple but it's very complicated right and it takes a lot of effort so to the user it seems super simple oh i can just move directly to polygon right i don't need to go through bridges and so on so that's how we are thinking how do we create how do we invest in technology to make things super simple and the last thing i'll say and this we again we talked about it a little bit earlier our integrated product suite so if you're a coinbase customer you fail a coinbase account we try to make it simple and easy for you to access all our products and services so it's not just buying and selling crypto but you know if you want to stake your crypto if you want to send your crypto receive crypto if you want to use a uh debit card to pay someone if you want to buy an nft if you want to participate in your e3 game or any other interesting application all of them you can do without leaving a platform with a single account and we think providing customers this this one-stop shop is is is going to be a powerful differentiator and do you feel that because we're sort of in this crypto winter that who knows how long it will last do you feel that you're having to focus on certain areas or do you still feel that you can kind of pursue all these directions at once it's very important for us for the industry as of all i think to keep investing during trip to winter if we just focus on let's say exchange or let's say crypto like buying and selling i think we'll miss the mark of the next phase of innovation in this market so we are focused on building the tools building through this winter and be ready for the next upcycle next price cycle in crypto where new use cases will come new builders will come and so on so i think our strategy is sound of course our core business you know trading we have invested heavily into in you know making our exchange the best execution venue a prime broker you know the best prime brokerage out there our retail trading the the simplest and most trusted trading venue and we are adding more and more features to our core but we are we also think we need to have one foot forward into the future and build for the future as well and that's why we're investing in things like coinbase wallet right self custodial wallet that will be the gateway to f3 in the future we are investing in coinbase cloud that will help build the web 3 economy build the web3 ecosystem and help power you know fix it's like the traditional probably picks and shovel strategy right you want to build the picks and travels to help developers build their next billion dollar applications and i think that is it's a sound strategy going through the crypto inter because this is the time to build okay so a former coinbase product manager was recently charged with insider trading of assets on coinbase before they were listed and ceo brian armstrong took credit for the investigation that led to identifying the suspects but jordan fish who's most widely known as kobe on crypto twitter tweeted that actually he had been tweeting about the front running of coins about to be listed on coinbase for months and as he put it i doubt brian's claim that coinbase actively monitors with any degree of competence the front running lasted for over a year surely coinbase should have found this before randoms on twitter did what's your response to that we we want to of course thank our uh you know thank our friends on twitter who are always monitoring and so on but i i think you know we cannot priority disclose what you know any investigation we have been doing like we we have we take this kind of behavior very seriously any type of illicit activity very seriously so we have lots of monitoring and in fact we investigated this individual and we handed uh we cooperated with doj in fact davoj actually thanked us for all the information that we kept get them so you know this is speculation that uh i would say and at its best but we are we have take this seriously we are focused on we are monitoring we have we have safeguards we are monitoring our internal you know any internal threats always we are continuously improving our processes so but we cannot for example disclose uh our priority any um investigation that we may be doing right because you know that that's damaging for an individual or sometimes it may compromise the investigation itself that's all i have to say here but i i want to assure everyone look your your assets are safe we do not allow front running and we are going to take serious action if we find any hint of it anywhere and in the same case the sec charged this product manager and has two accomplices with insider trading but in the charges the sec mentioned that nine of the assets on coinbase were securities but it didn't really give the reasoning for that and since the case is against this former employee and his brother and his friend is there any way for coinbase to get involved or is there some other way that coinbase can basically get the sec to provide its reasoning as to why those coins are securities yeah it's a great question laura in fact we think the current regulation you know the howie rule that everybody uses the how we test to understand whether something is utility or security is outdated it was not written at a time when there was any any semblance of blockchain technology or in computers almost 100 years old now so um we would love to get more clarification and we i we think this is good for the industry as a whole so we are working with ssc trying to get more clarity on on on any asset on our side every asset we list goes through a very rigorous process a digital asset listing framework where in our legal team compliance team security team they evaluate the asset they apply the highway test and we reject a lot of assets by the way we it's not like we we list every asset that comes our way we may not we do not publish the assets we rejected because you know for other confidentiality reasons but we reject many many assets and we are confident that the assets we have listed passes that test in fact uh the digital asset review framework that we have was actually reviewed by acc we reviewed that with acc as well so we would love to get this clarification for the whole industry and we'll work with sec or any other regulator for that matter to get more clarity so after this incident chief legal officer paul gruel published a blog post titled coinbase does not list securities end of story i feel like that headline implies that coinbase has the final say on whether any particular token is a security obviously it doesn't so why why was this uh written in this way again we maintain that to our knowledge when we apply the the laws as we understand them the uh the regulation as we understand them uh we do not list any securities right we all our tokens are utility tokens and that's the spirit in which this blog was written but i you know i don't want to speculate specific wording in a blog and why the rewarding was there but this captures our feelings for our message that look we we follow a process a process that was reviewed by acc to determine whether it a token is security or utility and we do not list securities so if there are there are clarifications and and clear our regulations will of course welcome it we have always welcomed clarity and regulation so if this kind of helps pave the way to get more clarity i think that will be great great for the whole industry you'll probably agree yeah well coinbase has obviously been doing a lot of work in this direction hasn't yielded much result not to blame you but um uh after this case why is it that coinbase did not de-list the nine coins named in the insider trading case considering that coinbase did de-list ripple's token after the sec sued ripple for xrp being an unregistered security yeah i it's it's the you know we i kind of stated before we believe these are not securities and that's why we did not see any reason to delete them at this time if there are security tokens and we don't believe there are any security tokens on our platforms we delete tokens time to time from you know on our platform when we see uh safety issues for our customer for example and other challenges so there are you know this decisions are taken very thoughtfully we have this digital asset listing group that convenes and and looks at all aspects of a token to figure out whether to list or delist so i can't comment on specific decisions because it's it's also been a while back but for the nine tokens we don't believe they are security tokens that's why we have listed them so to go back to some of the questions i was asking about competition with other exchanges here we are talking about regulation one of your other major competitors is binance which at least in the short term appears to be playing some kind of regulatory arbitrage game and coinbase obviously has a very different image but in that situation how does coinbase compete with the likes of binance when it may be playing faster and looser with the rules look everyone has their kind of own principles or own strategy right we believe our strategy is sound we lean into regulation we want to be the most trusted crypto platform in the world and we are seeing it's paying off for example if you talk to institutional customers they will tell us they will not even talk to many of our competitors they want to only work with us and that's because of our commitment to trust uh compliance uh security over the years and how we lean into regulation right so there are i would say there are advantages and disadvantages we have chosen this path and we strongly believe that for the longer term this is the right thing to do for the users and our users also expect coinbase to act in in a trusted manner they have a different user base as you can imagine right and this is why we have been able to attract a lot of mainstream users we have over 100 million users and in fact our verified users actually tripled in the last two years and we think we can onboard even more users uh to crypto and web3 because of our uh stance on trust and security and compliance so on another front coinbase also faces competition from decentralized exchanges such as uniswap i've noticed that since the beginning of the year trading volume on uniswap has only been slightly below the volume on coinbase how do you compete against a site where developers can list tokens themselves and there's bound to be this longer tale of assets available yeah we actually a great question uh we love decentralized exchanges we love the innovation that's happening in the d5 world i talked about this a little bit the way we think about it is how we give our users more choice and this is manifesting in the product right it's not just lip service so if you go to our coinbase main app you can buy all our listed tokens on our exchange that goes through our process you can also find tokens that you can buy through coinbase wallet or you can buy through a decks directly with the new dap wallet that we integrated into a main app so as you can see we think of this as a not a zero sum game we think this this just helps grow the entire pie brings more users gives them more choice so you can encode this wallet we have integrated with texas so we have very good relationship with all the dexes out there and we think it's good for our users to have more access and more choice so that's how we think about it the uh where we play is how we make it simple and easy for our users to access all this innovation that's happening and that's where the focus has been so your earnings report just came out and coinbase's average transaction revenue per user is down it's projected to be in the low 20 range this year down from 64. per user last year what are your plans for boosting this number yeah so as i said before look in a crypto winter typically retail users they reduce their trading activity they become more hodlers but they participate in other activities so they are participating in for example staking and a lot of other features in fact two-thirds of our users are doing something other than trading today right and staking being the big part of that one idea or or a strategic direction that we have been following for some time is how do we keep growing our subscription what we call subscription and services revenue or non-trading revenue if you look at last two years it has grown from being four percent of our total revenue to 18 almost today right and it continues to grow that's so that's one continue to grow this other sources of revenue beyond trading we are also experimenting with a a new product called coinbase one we talked about that in our shareholder later uh if you have been watching us so this is a product that says subscription product monthly flat fee it allows you to get unlimited trading without a fee the spread is still charged it uh we we give you 24 7 customer service so you know someone will pick up the phone when you call if you are a subscriber immediately like it gives you many other additional benefits across our platform right and we keep adding more sources of value we are seeing a lot of traction for coinbase one again very early days this is we have not made a lot of hype about the product we have not done any marketing or any pr but organically the product has grown and spring showing a lot of growth strong growth and we are seeing incrementality from the products so as users come in as they move into coinbase one we are saying they're more engaged with our platform not just with trading but all the other features that that we have embedded in our platform we talked about the integrated products with strategy so that's another way we are seeing how we grow our revenue irrespective kind of decouple it from the volatility in the market in the long run all right final question what do you worry about at night what do i worry about um there are a lot of things to worry about i think uh i think high level look at for the industry i think regulatory clarity would be great so that's that's the first worry the uber like macro area i have and i think that you know the today we don't even know who had who is the right authority with oversight is it sec the cftc so there's some confusion of course cftc regulates a lot of what we do but sec has has questions and and so on so that will be good for the industry i think it's also you know harmonization of uh regulation internationally would be useful in a lot of countries are thinking about you know how to do a kyc for send receive how to do qic for self-hosted wallets and it's a lot of ideas are coming up from regulators some of those ideas are probably not even actionable in in some ways so getting some clarity and some harmony globally will be useful i think stable coins is another one i think i know not all stable coins are made same so regulators need to probably understand kind of the the how the mechanics of which stable coin is is made how actually i do have a question for you about that there is this lawsuit against coinbase for failing to educate customers on the differences of tara versus other stable coins in the lawsuit they allege that coinbase did not disclose that it was this algorithmic stablecoin that it was not backed by reserves so can you talk a little bit about what happened there i unfortunately laura i cannot comment on an ongoing lawsuit okay okay yeah i just wanted to ask because you know but i i cannot offer a comment on uh you know those are high level kind of just the regulatory clarity and would be useful i think the other to be going back to your question what i worry about i think the you know bankruptcies and security hacks that we have been seeing in the industry it just does not uh bode well for the reputation of the industry as a whole right we have never been hacked we really focus on security and we invest in it but i worry about like overall the industry kind of went a little fast and loose a lot of people tried a lot of different things and probably not enough time was spent in thinking about security and that's gives a bad reputation to the whole industry i'm hopeful that we will get through this and there are no other bad incidents out there but every morning i am like i almost like scared okay i hope there's no bad news about the industry no new nomad or no new celsius or right those are a couple of big worries yes somebody tweeted that my newsletter had the word hack or something in it like hundreds of times so you know it was definitely something other people have noticed not just you where can people learn more about you and your work maybe twitter i tweet out a little bit i i put out every like i do a monthly product launch tweet storm so if you follow me you'll see every month like first of every month i should kind of tweet out all the highlights from what we launched handle is uh search or surgeon will work surgery that we do what else learning about me i i think you know if you learn about my products that's probably good you can people can reach out to me and i talk to a lot of folks in the community i'm actually learning from others all the time so you know this was a great conversation uh i think there's so much more to learn in in this in crypto industry and we're still very very early and we have a lot of stuff to build right uh let's let us all work together not kind of sometimes i see a little bit fighting with each other and pulling each other down that's or a lot some some right but you know we are still a small community so i think the community can need to come together and need to make crypto a safer place for all users we have a i think we have a responsibility to in innovate the next big use cases that's kind of my dream you didn't ask me that but i honestly my dream is how can i uh create a utility use cases for crypto like where people come on a daily basis i talked about the good breast test uh and use something that is powered by crypto but i think that's when we will basically arrive as an industry all right well we'll see how that plays out over the next few years thanks so much for coming on unchained thank you so much laura really enjoyed the conversation thanks so much for joining us today
