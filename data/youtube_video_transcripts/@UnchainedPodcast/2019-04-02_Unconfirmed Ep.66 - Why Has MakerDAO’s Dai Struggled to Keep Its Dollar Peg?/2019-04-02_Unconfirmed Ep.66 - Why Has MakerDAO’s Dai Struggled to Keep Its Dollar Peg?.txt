hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the podcast that reveals how the marquee names in crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon I'm your host Laura Shin last week I did a live podcast recording in front of an audience with Vitaly booter in the crater of aetherium for the first Unchained live sponsored by Kwon Sang we had a technical mishap that prevented the live stream from appearing for 25 minutes however earlier this week we released the full video on YouTube and Facebook and the full audio and unchained if you missed them I highly recommend you check them out since in my opinion the first 25 minutes was the best part are you ready for global cryptocurrency money laundering regulations Seifer trade secures the crypto economy with powerful AML tools for exchanges crypto businesses and regulators today's guests are Ryan Todd and Matteo Leibovitz research analysts at the block welcome Ryan and Matteo thank you thanks for having us let's start with Matteo dye the stable coin of the maker down system recently lost its dollar peg what value had the staple coin been trading at and why sure so since about January of this year dye has been trading below its targeted dollar peg really this is a factor of an imbalance between supply and demand in the system there are the predominant reason that there are actually two predominant reasons for this imbalance the first is being that sorry the first is that as of January the interest rate that the maker system was charging for these dye loans was incredibly low it was set at 0.5% APR so anybody who wished to open the CDP could do so at a very low cost the second factor is that there was a change in sentiment in the crypto markets so the 8th market bottomed out in early December and is since up 5060 percent so there's a lot of demand to leave a long either and so you had a lot of people opening these CDP's drawing dye and then selling down the market in order to purchase eath and unfortunately there wasn't enough natural demand to satisfy this glut in supply and so what is the mechanism by which the price of dye rises or Falls again it's really just a factor of supply and demand so you need there to be enough demand in the market enough natural demand in the market to counterbalance this this you know increasing supply that is continuing to come into the market so one way that the maker system can try and adjust these supply and demand dynamics is through the stability fee and so essentially the stability fee is what people have to pay when they sort of like return the dye so it's like if you're taking out a loan and you pay interest on that that's kind of the cost of the time value of that money is that sort of how that works exactly this de Botev is really just stays and then for an interest rate so in this case it was very very low and then what happened sure so the reason it was so low actually is because throughout 2018 as the price of eath was falling there wasn't sufficient demand there wasn't sufficient demand to open these CDP is naturally increase the total outstanding supply of dye so makers stake holders lowered the stability fee to the 0.5% and that led to an increase in demand for for CDP's and an increase in outstanding high supply so once dye started trading below this dollar peg make maker stakeholders decided to increase the stability fee so in February ninth they increased it from 0.5 percent to 1 percent on the 23rd of February from 1% to 1.5% and then in March so far there have been two further stability fee hikes so the initial one was from 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent and then just last week the stability fee was increased another 4% to 7.5% and Ryan can you explain who decides what the stability fee is sure so it's actually pretty interesting process but it's it involves people essentially getting on a phone call and walking through data that's not very robust yet since the system hasn't been around too long but talking over which factors would necessitate it need to bump the rates up stability fee being the interest rate that you pay on these loans so currently the the governance process has I don't know roughly 20 to 50 people on these calls at any given time and these people can participate however they see fit and that's that's currently how it's been set yeah sorry I was just gonna add to that so really you can that there are almost four distinct steps to the governance process so as Ryan mentioned you have this governance school which takes place every Thursday so the next one will be at noon use some time today so that on these government schools you have these various participants the call is actually led by the maker foundation's risk management team then you know there's discussion and debate as to what the latest is supply and demand dynamics are and suggestions as to how the stability fee monetary policy monetary policy should be adjusted then the conversation moves on to social media forums like Reddit after that if there is a decision kind of a rough consensus to adjust the stability fee the process moves to polling whereby MKR holders signal their intent as to whether stability fees should be adjusted or capped at the state of square and then if that proposal passes through the polling process which is just a simple majority it then moves to the executive vote which is a continuous voting process and the final vote in the system well that is that is pretty complex or at least you know it feels kind of like cautious and inclusive and yet I don't think that the process is very decentralized or or you tell me how decentralize do you think the voting process is so far that's very interesting so if you if you look at the voter turnout in the in the last couple votes it might seem that you know it's it's not particularly decentralized you don't have too many participants involved so for the March 9th executive vote I think there were just 37 addresses out of over 9600 mkay are holding addresses have participated in the executive vote and another factor to consider is that just one single address contributed 57% of stake in favor of the hike and then in the latest executive though there were just 58 addresses that participated which comes to about 0.5 8% of total MK are holding addresses so clearly you know voter turnout is is pretty low and you would think that that the higher the voter turnout the better in some way these kind of critiques a fairly misguided so you should actually think of the voting process it's more of a technical process and a decision-making process the decision-making actually takes place on these government schools in these social media forums and then voting is essentially just an Oracle for this soft governance so the most important governance mechanism within the mecha down system is actually this emergency shutdown mechanism so the problem with voting is that you don't necessarily know whether you know people have voted have voted correctly or have voted in a way that benefits the system so you can have very very high turnout but it could be that these voters are voting in a way that actually is to the detriment of the system stability so if you have this emergency shutdown and you have a relatively low requirement to trigger this much you shut down all you really need is for that to be enough kind of honest actors available to trigger emergency shutdown and then the the system should ultimately be okay we're gonna keep talking about the governance of maker Dow but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors ready or not the Financial Action Task Force anti-money laundering recommendations soon go into effect globally if you handle cryptocurrencies no matter where you do business these new AML laws will apply to you Seifer trace helps exchanges icos funds brokerages and regulators understand and manage crypto asset and compliance risks learn how to reduce your exposure and prepare now for tough new regulations cipher trace is securing the crypto economy learn more at Cypress comm slash unconformity inand mateo of the block so mateo just i want to understand something you said that you feel like even though participation is below 1% that is still decentralized because of the emergency shutdown functions so what why is that so important and why is that you seem to imply that you think that that's the key to did centralization sure so just to clarify i don't think you know having this emergency shutdown mechanism necessarily means that voting to date has taken place in a decentralized fashion I just think that emphasis should be kind of taken off the voting process itself just because as I mentioned already voting is more of a technical process and a decision-making process itself so it's it's not actually a hugely significant event within within the the make it out system so yeah so the idea of the emergency shutdown is that emergency shutdown can be triggered and anyone holding die can be made whole as long as the system is over collateralized at the time so there's more collateral than there is outstanding debt anybody holding die can be will be given at least $1 worth of ether at this moment how much weight do they make our foundation in a 16z have so I think the maker foundation has roughly 20% of MQL mkr tokens I might be incorrect right I think that's roughly correct a 16z has about 15% but should definitely note that they haven't kind of set up the technical sport that would allow them to participate in governance just yeah so they haven't participated in in the voting process obviously if you if you look at a voter turnout today with their 15 percent of supply they should be able to carry any vote in in the direction that they would like but they are yet to come online as it were and Ryan what do you think is the importance of maker in the overall aetherium ecosystem as we know there's I think 2 percent of all ether is locked up in in maker CDP's and and it seems to be central to the defy movement so where how do you see its significance in the overall system absolutely you know maker I wrote a piece on this actually recently but maker is systematically important to defy it's it's proven white device capable of you know defy doesn't take off without maker that's what they made great squares defy pulses and Omega not that we really like but maker has roughly 300 million dollars worth of collateral posted within protocol and you know that's that's roughly 90% of the USD value currently locked within defy and that's across taxes plenty proud platforms and other use cases so yeah it is systemically important to defy and if the dollar are sorry if the peg is not staying at a dollar then how does that affect the whole system that's not you're saying when you think about it yes it hasn't stayed exactly a dollar but when you look at the standard deviation or the variability to the dollar it's actually pretty tight the last by lost count that we ran I think standard deviation was roughly maybe a penny etting a quarter over the past year and obviously that outperforms any other crypto asset even even other stable coins centralized or not.let 11 g7 currencies and FX rates so while the peg has broken down I mean it's done its job it's it's it's held relatively steady and during that time either was falling in price so in that respect he would expect that actually there would be kind of more pressure on the system and and that would be a true test of of its performance and so how do you feel it has performed during that time well the result speak for themselves that begs how relatively again steady I mean but but just to be clear there were there was a time at least when it did drop as low as 94 cents which you know it's not it it's not like huge but but also it doesn't negate that you know it's not it's not always staying very close to a dollar either right that's fair actually I think the more interesting question is what's going to happen if Heath was to run back up to 1200 currently there's a smaller demand to lever along eath in an environment that's more bearish and it's already seen upwards of 90 million dollars worth of outstanding origination so obviously that's come in now that they've bumped rates up to seven and a half which is another interesting trend to follow yeah I was just gonna add to that so if anything I think it was easier for four died to maintain its peg during the the bad market and you know the market of 2018 just because there was always this looming threat of CDP liquidation and so you you had a lot of natural by demand from CD B holders for die so that they could either wipe their debt or close their CD PS entirely as Ron said now we're starting to see the eath market recovers slightly and you can actually do kind of a simple sensitivity analysis for CDP holders and kind of work out what kind of stability fee would be necessary considering future eath USD price appreciation expected price appreciation and the numbers are actually kind of staggering so you know if you expect eath to appreciate ten percent within a week and even if you're sounding diet at a 5% discount you would actually need you know a hundred over a hundred percent annual stability fee to make opening a CD p unprofitable so it's gonna be it's gonna be very very difficult to to stem demand for CDP's in the next bull market it's gonna be really fascinating to see how the system holds up interesting well the one thing is as I was grilling Vitalik about when I interviewed him aetherium faces some headwinds and so it's not clear how well ether will do in price going forward but one other thing that's happening kind of in the maker dow environment is that multi collateral die is on the horizon so how could that affect makers cost to keep the value of Diet a dollar that's very interesting really it just increases complexity the the complexity of the system by an order of magnitude it means that you have to set risk parameters on a per collateral basis so that is you know the collateralization ratio that's necessary for for using these assets as collateral you have to determine what the liquidation penalty should be what the debt ceiling should be for that particular kind of collateral as well so you're gonna need a lot more eyes on the maker system from a risk management perspective and in all likelihood we're probably going to see these stability few adjustments increase in frequency so most likely to a weekly basis and and today I think you know since make a launch we've only actually seen six adjustments in this turbo TV so that that will make a huge difference yeah one other thing I wanted to ask about was there's kind of a lag between when the stability fee goes into effect and when they might see an effect on the price so even if you start increasing the frequency then it's does it kind of muddy your ability to understand that the results well actually real quick is you can't forget the interplay between other protocols and even custodial unders that are offering rates on these assets you know some of these can change rates offer rates dynamically in real time there's definitely there's a wrinkle in the process of setting rates every week through or on a bi-weekly basis through the governance process all right well I guess we will see how this all plays out um well it's been great having you both on the show thanks for
