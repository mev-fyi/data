co-founder and CEO of arwen and computer science professor at Boston University welcome Sharon hi thanks for having me so let's talk about our win your new project what problem are you trying to solve with our one right so our one is a new way to trade at centralized exchanges the idea is that you could trade on the centralized crypto exchanges order book without trusting the exchange to custody your coins and our notion of trust lessness is really strong we guarantee that even if the exchange is hacked in the middle of the trade your coin should not be at risk so what are one does is it it's a cryptographic protocol that allows you to transact with the exchange and settle your transactions without ever having to put your coins in the custody of the exchange and how did you come up with the idea for this protocol yeah so that's kind of like a long story and I can I can sort of start at the beginning which is my background and how I sort of got into this space I have a PhD in computer science focused on cryptography and networking and so really my my most fundamental background and how I got into my whole career is through cryptography which I started in 2006 so when you when you were to sort of basically trained as a cryptographer the the kind of problems that you want to solve are you have two parties like a and B that wish to transact but they don't trust each other so it's usually Alice and Bob and they want to do something but Alice doesn't trust Bob and Bob doesn't trust Alice and so what cryptographers do is they build protocols to allow these two parties to communicate with each other without trusting each other so that's kind of like the fundamental problem that I've been trained to solve for the last you know 1314 years and so we came into the blockchain space about let's say what four or five years ago where we started looking at the security of Bitcoin security V cerium and and and then getting into designing also protocols that build on top of blockchain and so for me with the background that I have the very first question that I that I always ask is like who do you need to trust in order to accomplish this particular goal so when you look at the market right now of centralized exchanges you regularly see unfortunately you see compromises of centralized exchanges where people's deposits on those exchanges are getting stolen you know starting with the mount Cox hack which is you know famous from a long time ago we're still seeing them recently saw a finance get hacked and basically what happens is that the coins that traders are depositing at the exchange are being stolen by hackers so essentially what's happening here is you have the trader being required to trust the exchange in order to trade and so as a cryptographer the first question you ask is how can you allow the trader to trade on the exchange without having to trust the exchange with their coins and that's really how we came up with Arwen like the idea of transacting on a centralized exchange without needing to trust the exchange and I want to go back to another piece of your bio that I thought was interesting which is I believe that you actually started in electrical engineering and so how did you make the switch to cryptography okay yeah so when I started it was like 1999 when I started school so at the time like I wasn't really computer science wasn't so much on the map so I studied Electrical Engineering I went through this program called engineering science where you could choose what stream of engineering you wanted to do and they were like civil engineering and nanotechnology biotechnology so I ended up choosing Electrical Engineering and what I liked about Electrical Engineering was the precision you know you can use formulas to characterize you know activities in the physical world or building systems and things like that what happened was I discovered kind of like as I got further up in my in my education so when I started my PhD I was working on optics I'm like the communication using light I found that this was all very imprecise and very analog and there were a lot of sort of fudge factors that were preventing you from like really characterizing the systems you were building using math and so when I took cryptography for the first time in 2005 I was just super excited about the ability to like represent the physical world and relationships and Trust using math that was you know fully capturing everything that was going on in the situation and for me that was like the big driver to sort of drop everything that I was doing and and stopped really being an electrical engineer and start becoming the computer scientist and studying cryptography and all of that so it's really the precision and the ability to characterize trust relationships in a mathematical way that really drew me into the field at the beginning and then when you were also describing how you came to found Arwen you kept saying we got into the space four or five years ago so what did you who were you referring to and what happened at that time yeah so um what happened is that so I'm a computer science professor at Boston University I've been there for I think this is nine years now in 2013 I had a new PhD student whose name was Ethan Heilmann and he joined my lab and I was working on Internet routing security and cryptography at that time and I was really excited about that stuff and so I was you know at that point like five or six years into this long research program on on internet routing security and basically all these protocols that form the guts of the internet communication network and so even showed up and he was obsessed with Bitcoin and at the time there was only Bitcoin there was really nothing else he just would not stop talking about Bitcoin and basically we figured out the only way to get like productive research out of this person was to do Bitcoin research and so we did and it ended up being amazing and my most cited research paper is actually with with Ethan that we wrote in 2015 which is the first paper that we we did on in the blockchain space and what we did there was we were basically the first to consider how Bitcoin nodes actually communicate and find each other because prior to our work everyone sort of assumed that like any node that's participating in a blockchain knows what the blockchain is so has the same data about what the blockchain is and that was sort of an underlying assumption in all of the analysis of blockchain up to that point and we had realized that like there's a communication layer here there's a network here what is this network how can you attack it and we did one of the first attacks on the actual communication layer of Bitcoin that resulted in changes in the in the Bitcoin protocol in 2015 so that was me and Ethan and Ethan really pulled me into this space over the last you know like six years that I've been working with him sort of culminating in us founding Arwen in 2017 and basically working on it together for the last couple of years and so you started to describe kind of briefly how Arwen works but let's go into it in a more detailed fashion why don't you just walk me through what it looks like when someone trades using Arwen right so with our when the idea is that you wouldn't deposit your coins into exchange custody you would use your own custodian to custody your coins while you trade so the way that this plays out is we use this concept called escrows so if you're very deep into the blockchain space you're probably familiar with layer 2 protocols like the Lightning Network and there's various other layer 2 projects out there like plasma and others that are built on aetherium so with our one what we do is we have these escrows where if you're going to trade let's say Bitcoin into Bitcoin cash you're going to have escrows on the Bitcoin blockchain and escrow is on the Bitcoin cash blockchain the idea is that every coins blockchain acts as the agent of escrow for trading that point so if I'm trading Bitcoin Bitcoin blockchain will be the agent of escrow and so what you do is instead of taking your coins and depositing them in the exchanges wallet what you do is you deposit them into an escrow on the blockchain so bitcoins go into a Bitcoin escrow on the Bitcoin blockchain and then that escrow backs your trades with the exchange so trades themselves are happening instantly in the sense the same way that you would place a trade today you know for instance through the API of an exchange you just place a trade through the API that's exactly what Arwen does you're placing trades through the API of the exchange but what we have in front of that API is basically the Arwen protocol that translates your trades into a cryptographic atomic swap messages but they happen instantly so at the end of the day what are one looks like is you take your coins you put them in escrows you do trades backed by those escrows and then when you're finished trading you would close your escrow sand your coins would return to your wallet so it's sort of functionally similar to trading today where you would deposit coins straight on the exchange and withdraw coins but the difference is that instead of depositing into the exchange you're depositing into these escrows and Arwen guarantees that even if the exchange gets hacked or goes offline you'll still be able to close your escrows and claim all the coins that you've traded so there's something that I don't know if I fully understand here so I put my coins that I want to trade into an escrow and then ask that smart contract the the escrow what talks to the exchange so then at what point does the atomic swap happen because as far as I understand that can just happen directly between two blockchain so now I don't understand where the exchange comes in yeah so the extras are not the atomic swap so the escrow is are a smart contract on whatever blockchain it is that you're using so for instance Bitcoin versus eg reham you might have two escrows one on Bitcoin blockchain one on aetherium blockchain and then you're doing atomic swaps that are backed by those two escrows so there will be a message that adjusts the balance in your Bitcoin escrow and also about a message that adjusts the balance in your etherium escrow and the adjustment would be exactly the value you traded so for instance if you're selling one Bitcoin your Bitcoin escrow would be - one and if you're buying you know two e's then your aetherium escrow would be plus two and those those messages essentially are sent back and forth between you and the exchange and they adjust the balance in your escrow so now when you have those messages you have the ability to close your escrow at any time and claim the actual coins that you've traded this is the idea of a layer 2 protocol where you don't have to actually go to the blockchain every time you do something you just create transactions but if you took them to the blockchain they would do something for you right so what we're doing is we do a trade we create these messages that could close the Esper's for us with the balance after our trade but we decide not to close the escrow we decide to do another trade and then we get these new transactions that could close the escrow with the new balance of our trades and we keep doing that until we actually decide to really close the escrow and take those messages and post them to the blockchain so anything all I'm getting confused is for when you say if I want to trade BTC for eath I'm not creating both escrows am i it's like I'm joining one and maybe if way I am ok so so I have to put ether up in - yeah I have to put Bitcoin into one escrow and then I put ether up into the other escrow yeah ok let me let me rewind a little bit that that part so here's what would happen if you were to trade with Arwen let's say we're trading from Bitcoin to e cerium so the first step that you would do is you would take your Bitcoin and you would put them in an escrow where the agent of escrow is the Bitcoin blockchain all right so that will collateralize your trades of Bitcoin the second thing you need to do is you need to get an escrow of aetherium that will actually collateralize the purchase of aetherium that you're about to do so the first step of our one is setting up the escrow that you fund it and then which is the Bitcoin escrow and setting up this additional escrow which we call an exchange escrow but it's going to be funded by the exchange so in this particular example when we're doing Bitcoin to aetherium trading you would fund a Bitcoin escrow and the exchange would fund any cerium escrow now once you have those two escrow set up you can do atomic swaps that are backed by those two escrows oh no I get it so what's happening is that the exchanges is putting in a cerium to collateralize your trades to collateralize your purchase of ease and you are putting in Bitcoin to collateralize your sale of Bitcoin and then doing a swap across those two escrows and across those two block jeans oh wow that's super fascinating so something then that I want to understand here is is there any central point of failure in this process so each party is sort of protecting itself so in the sense that the guarantee is that as long as the user's machine is not compromised or their custodian is not compromised they are guaranteed that they can close their escrow with the correct balance regardless of what's going on on the exchange side right so let's make the exchange goes down stop talking you won't be able to do any more trades with that exchange right because it's just not there it's not accepting any trades but you will have a particular balance in your escrow so for instance you know you sold one Bitcoin and you bought two E's so let's say the exchange just disappears or loose access to its wallet or doesn't exit scam or something you would be able to close your Bitcoin escrow and your aetherium escrow with a correct balance after you trade that's what our guarantees so in terms of a single point of failure there is a point of failure in the sense that if the exchange goes down you can't trade there anymore but it's not going to cause you to lose your coins and then there was another aspect of how this works that you described to me before where you talked about the so that our win protocol is what enables this to happen but as far as I understand there's also something that Arwen runs which is the Arwen hub so what role does that play right so I just want to emphasize that Arwen provides the sort of the same similar value proposition to a decentralized exchange in a decentralized exchange a lot of the goal is to have self custody of your coins not to trust a third party with custody of your coins that's the same with Arwen the difference about Arwen from most decentralized exchanges is that Arwen does not have its own separate order book in its own separate eco system like you might have for instance in 0x protocol or in ether delta Arwen is going to be plugging into you the order books of the exchange so that's the big difference and because we plug into the order books of the exchange the trades have to have to happen necessarily as quickly as trades would happen in a normal you know regular exchange that was custodial so our trades are fast because they're actually just regular trades on the order book so that's the big difference you asked me about the Arwen hub so what the Arwen is is it's basically a cloud system that speaks Arwen on behalf of the exchange so it translates Arwen messages into messages that can be placed on the exchanges order book so rather than having the exchange like implement an entire Arwen protocol themselves which is not very realistic you know my company writes the rights to Arwen hub which will take Arwen protocol messages from traders and translate them just into regular API messages that will go into the order book of the exchange and is there any chance that those messages could be hacked along the way if they were then that would affect only the exchange but not the users themselves another guarantee of the guarantee of arwen is that each party takes care of themselves the traders are going to be secure even if the exchange is hacked and the exchange is going to be secure even if the traders are hacked Oh interesting ok and then is our win limited in the types of exchanges that it works with or I guess is it only centralized exchanges that you work with yeah it's currently focused on centralized exchanges we haven't looked at integration with decentralized exchanges yet the reason for that is because we're focused on getting into the places where there's the highest amount of liquidity which is currently the centralized exchanges all right and then we started to draw the contrast with trading on EDX but can you flesh that out even further like the trading on our twin forces trading on EDX yeah yeah so there's one key difference which is the this sort of the fact that we're plugging into the liquidity of a centralized exchange if you're trading on Arwen you could be the only Arwen user on that exchange and that's fine you don't need to have your counterparty be another Arwen user it can it's just basically trades that's going on the order book and being filled a normal way that a trade would be sold on the order book so that's really the key differentiator is that we don't we're not as dependent as a Dex is on the growth of the like the network effects of that specific Dex because we just go into the exchange and use that the pricing from the end the liquidity from the exchange itself so that's the key difference there are other sort of other important differences which are the speed is so Arwen trades are not actually executed on the blockchain and so that means a couple of things it means that we're not subject to slow blockchain con for me chimes any sort of confirmations that have to hit the blockchain are for opening escrows and closing escrows but not for trading so the trades can happen fast that's the first thing the second thing is that when you do a trade with Arwen that trade is not visible to anyone except you and the exchange that you're placing the trade on and so that saves you from a lot of issues that are affecting Dex's right now which have to do with front-running so in the dex typical Dex is you execute your trade on the actual blockchain so your trade will go to like an experience Mart contract and the serum smarter contract will be the one to actually execute the trade so that means for your trades to actually happen it needs to go through an a cerium miner and so that creates front-running risks because if the etherion miner doesn't like your trade or wants to front run your trade they have the power to do that before the trade has actually executed and so we see a lot of interesting front running tricks that are happening today like even now on on a lot of Dex's we sort of sidestep all of this because there's no on blockchain execution of individual trades so know what miners are really involved in the execution of the trade so you lose all of these risks so to sum up really it's the liquidity of the exchanges order book it's the speed because we don't go to the blockchain and it's the lack of front-running because we don't have to involve miners and actually executing trades yeah I was going to bring up that paper that Phil Diane at cornell wrote recently with some other academics about how arbitrage arbitrage BOTS indexes are doing certain things like paying high transaction fees and taking advantage of Network latency to front run the ordinary trade the ordinary user trades on Dex's so it sounds like with our win yeah that's exactly what I was getting into there yeah and is there any situation in the future where it would ever make sense to try to implement something like art went on a decks or no is it only really for centralized exchanges so our went on a decks is tricky because the the model that we've taken with Arwen is well I have to be careful about that actually let me answer their like level one answer and then I'll do the level to answer the the level one answer is that our went on a decks is a little tricky because when slops the movement of coins is from the users wallet to the exchanges wallet or to some sort of collateral party wallet it's not you know if alice is trading with counterparty bob where alice's an darwin user and bob is not an r1 user Bob is just a regular custodial user of the exchange there's really no direct movement of funds from Alice's wallet to bob's wallet it's more like there's a movement of funds from Alice's wallet to the exchanges wallet and even though that sounds strange that's exactly what happens today like if you trade at you know pick your favorite exchange the first thing you're going to do is you're going to move your coins into that exchanges wallet and then you'll do some trades and then you'll pull your coins out of that exchanges wallet so it's really trader to exchange wallet coin movement and that's what we have in r1 right and so that looks kind of different from what you have in a Dex where a Dex is the movement of coins is peer-to-peer so if Alice is trading with counterparty Bob the actual swap will be from else as well it's a Bob's wallet the reason we took the Arwen approach was because we we really wanted to inter integrate directly into centralized exchanges and not have to build kind of our own ecosystem because we didn't think that was going to take off as quickly and you can see that now with the liquidity indexes we think that that's you know coming from the the fact that you really need like the growth inside the Dex and there's all these speed and front-running issues so so that's that's kind of why the fact that it's from the users wallet to the exchange as well it makes it really tricky to have it like fit directly into the Dex model that's level one answer level two answer is that there's a lot of interesting things that are coming out now I'm like Finance Dex and will be Dex these and these are like you know very different from what someone has as a Dex when you look at something like ether Delta and the difference is that these Dex's are really block chains separate block chains that are supposed to allow you to trade like a large number of assets so for instance the the finest chain you can trade Bitcoin on the finance chain right and and that's kind of weird because bitcoin is not issued by the finance chain bitcoin is issued by the finance the Bitcoin blockchain right so how do you actually trade Bitcoin on the by Nance chain and the way you do that is through a peg so finance chain currently this thing called beat ECB which is basically Bitcoin dot be pegged to real Bitcoin it's very similar to where the tether is pegged to u.s. dollars and so you know when you trade whether you're not trading US dollars but you're trading an asset that's pegged to US dollars BTC B is similarly an asset that's pegged to Bitcoin so to make a long story short that idea of like going from the asset that's pegged BTC B to the actual real Bitcoin or going you know from real Bitcoin into an asset that's issued on the finance blockchain that's kind of a place where r1 can can come in and facilitate some of that swapping and some of that security the idea is that r1 is designed to swap points from their native blockchain and so rather than having to kind of you know deposit your Bitcoin at a custodian and withdraw BTC B you could use Arwen to swap directly from the Bitcoin into whatever the asset that's natively issued on the financed blockchain would be so that's kind of one way that we could we could fit into a decks but it's not really kind of plugging into either Delta the way you would you would think about it sort of at first glance Oh super interesting yeah so I guess it could be used in that fashion that is actually really fascinating and then one other thing I want to ask you about was when you kind of talked about you know why it is that you're more focused now on centralized exchanges and how you get a certain level of speed does that mean that high-frequency traders could also use our one so we are paddling in that direction right now so if you have high frequency traders use our when we need basically bi-directional escrows that can you can sell and buy on the same escrow so if I put in Bitcoin in escrow right now you can sell the Bitcoin out of that escrow but you can't buy it back with the current like a product that we've launched as of today but you know if you read our white paper and on our roadmap is to support both buy and sell and so one could use that to very quickly you know like fire Bitcoin sell your bitcoins buy bitcoin sell your Bitcoin which is what I think high-frequency traders are really looking for we're still doing a bunch of research on like what the high-frequency trading market would look like in the crypto world what I'm hearing is that they're starting to be interest in building hft you know data centers and using these strategies but I'm not hearing that the demand is that high for like HfG at this at this specific moment so we're sort of that's a little bit further on our roadmap but we have the capability of doing that and if you look at our white paper like with the protocols for doing that are all laid out already in there and earlier when you were talking about why it is that you why are one works with centralized exchanges I think something that's interesting is that you went in that direction while at the same time in the industry it sort of feels like everybody's working on two centralized exchanges so do you feel that somehow our ones going against zip-tied in the industry and you know why do you think that is and how do you kind of plan to navigate that I think we definitely want to get the tide and we did it very you know it inadvertently because you know in 2017 we started thinking about what kind of company we wanted to build we were never of this opinion that decentralization is the key value proposition of blockchains we were of the opinion that trust and Trust lessness and managing trust was the key value proposition of blockchains so let me explain what that means one thing that has been sort of this constant current through my career as a security researcher and engineer is that everywhere in the internet you have these things called trusted third parties for instance if you want to use HTTPS to securely access the website at the end of the day the security of that entire ecosystem comes down to a few centralized parties which are called certificate authorities and these guys are you know they get hacked and bad things happen and there's all sorts of attacks that you can do because of this like you know trusted centralized authority and it's sort of like at the root of a lot of internet systems like you know web decryption or DNS the domain name system you find this stuff everywhere and so for us like blockchain was this amazing thing that is an entity that you can trust but it's not single entity it's not a single trusted third party the blockchain itself provides a route of trust that you can do cryptography with but it's not a single party that can get hacked so it's very hard to sort of roll back block chains that's the whole point but there's not just like a single place that you can go and attack and like kind of skew the whole dog blockchain and that's that's really fascinating so when we that's my that's always been my understanding of what block chains are and what they're for and so when we started this we said okay look there's a whole bunch of things called centralized exchanges they're getting attacked they're getting hacked money's getting stolen how can we continue to trade on these things but not have to trust them and then we said okay let's continue trading on them but just use the blockchain as a route of trust and that's where r1 came from the idea is you want to trade on centralized exchanges everybody wants to trade on centralized exchanges look at all this volume right 2017 look at all this volume how do we trade on them without having to trust them and that's where the whole thing started so when the when the when the whole decks you know movement took off we were just going in a completely different direction saying like everybody wants to use centralized exchanges why don't we just figure out a way for them to use them without having to trust them and from the exchanges perspective how does working with our win benefit them and you know what what do you have to do to convince them to work with you like I don't know how much work it takes to integrate Arwen so working with an exchange isn't like your general Enterprise SAS you know sales cycle so you have to convince the basically the executive at the exchange that this is a good idea so that's you know that takes some time in terms of why they would do it I think that there are a couple of reasons there are a lot of actual leadership that exchanges that really believes in the promise of blockchain and the idea that blockchain provides sort of trust lists all this ability to do things trusts lessly that things are decentralized and we have found actual leadership at a number of exchanges that this is like something that they truly believe and so they're bothered by the fact that they're like therefore acting as this custodian basically acting like a traditional banks for everyone's crypto like they just feel like that's against the ethos of the space so that's like one thing that you sometimes find and that helps us get to a deal faster the other thing is that you know providing these types of features put some basically in a leadership position in the market so we launched on COO coin four months four weeks ago and there was a bunch of press about you know these are this is a leading this is like a bold move that they're leading this space and they're kind of doing things that that other exchanges haven't thought of doing so at the moment what our win is is really translator to draw traders to an exchange that would allow them to transact on an exchange in a way that they can't really do in many other exchanges and so that's really the main value proposition that we're offering on these exchanges like being able to provide the service to their users and and and and kind of lead the industry in that direction the other piece that I think is really important is that if you look at what's been going on in the crypto space in 2018 you know we can sit here and just start naming number of startups that are trying to solve the custody problem so let me just start you know castle edger treasurer bit go Anchorage like let's just keep going zap oh there's tons of them right and they're all super interesting different coin tight everyone's doing something different and they're all really interesting but at the end of the day like you have your coins in this custodian as soon as you go to trade they're not in your custodian anymore and so you know what is driving me personally is to kind of like push this into the market is that there are going to be users they're going to be using these custodians they're going to be invested in their custodian and they're gonna say this is my secure custodian I don't want to take my coins off my custodian but I still want to do things with them and protocols like r1 allowed them to do that and so I think that as the custodians gained market traction there's going to be more market traction for protocols like ours and and not having to like really change what they already do because people are used to trading on a centralized exchanges but they just want to get to those exchanges in a way that keeps their coins protected by their custodians great and actually just that last piece about what it takes to integrate with r1 is it just kind of writing some code to integrate to interact with these smart contracts with it escameca sure no no no so we take care of all of that so really the the integration has to do with us coming into the exchange looking at their API endpoints for trading and terminating against those API endpoints so we need certain endpoints so for instance some exchanges have the ability to programmatically withdraw coins from the exchange right there's like a withdraw endpoint in the API so if that's present we can use that to do an r1 integration if that's not present then we may need that to be exposed so that's sometimes where the latency comes in like if you look at the big exchanges like Finance and I think Polonia acts bitstamp they all support this type of programatic withdrawal from the from the from accounts we need that but some of the smaller ones may not have that so we have to wait for that to be added so that's kind of the integration it's they don't have to do anything are when specific it's just that we need certain like basic functionalities from the API that some of them have and some of them don't have all right so we're gonna talk more about the custody you stuff that you mentioned and also more about smart contracts after the break but first a quick word from our fabulous sponsors on May 27th I will be hosting a conversation about the future of Finance and human rights at the Oslo Freedom Forum in

compliance monitoring tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy to learn more visit cipher trace comm slash Unchained back to my conversation with sharon goldberg of arwen so when you were mentioning custody earlier do you have to sign on specific custody solutions or can people use their custody solutions with Arwen yeah so currently you can use Arwen with any custody solution that you have and again this is a two-part answer to your question so right now what we do with Arwen is that there's a piece of code called the Arwen daemon that speaks Arwen on the traders behalf and what the Arwen daemon really has inside it is keys that are associated with the Arwen escrows so when you take your coins and you put them in an Arwen escrow there are keys associated with that escrow that allow you to move coins around and do trades so the ideal integration from a security perspective for us would be to have the keys associated with the escrow actually housed inside your custodian right so for instance if you're trading with a ledger then those keys would be inside the ledger and so that type of integration requires you know a bunch of work on our side and on the custodian side to actually execute upon and that you know we're interested in doing some of that with with like a variety of custodians but at the moment we have sort of a different way of doing it which is that the keys associated with a particular escrow would live on the user's local machine and so those coins are actually never going into the custody of any third party they're being can sorry the coins in the escrows are actually being moved around by the Arwen daemon which is an executable that the user would locally with locally download so that means that you can basically use any custodian you want to transfer coins into the Arwen escrows the daemon will move the coins around in the escrows and then when you close your Arwen escrow those will go back into your custodian directly so at the moment we can support any any custodian but as we go into sort of like higher levels of security we'd have more deep integrations with specific custodians and that's kind of what we're working on right now and when you say any kind of custodian do you also include things like SAP oh and yeah clean because today stuff like that okay yeah yeah yeah because today what what what you need to do and actually to move a coin into an Arwen escrow is that the Arwen daemon will tell you an address so for Bitcoin you'll be given an address that is the hash of the Arwen escrow smart contract so you have the Arwen escrow smart contract and you hash it that gives you an address and that's an address like any other address and so what you would do is you fund that address and that locks your coins in escrow the result is the hash of a smart contract and that smart contract is associated with escrow keys that allow you to adjust the balance in the escrow and so then if our when were widely adopted as a general vision would sort of be like people could if they want to outsource their custody and also transact with a centralized exchange which would enable them to number one not to have to worry about their about managing their own private keys necessarily and then also to not worry about their funds on any exchange being hacked is that right that's right yeah that's right and so how does our would make money um so we work with the centralized exchanges and we share part of the revenue with them that comes through the traits that come on are one like from each transaction that depends on the particular exchange but it could be done per transaction it can be done sort of as a fee at the start of the year there's different there's different arrangements that we've considered with different players but it has to do with basically with you know the traffic that comes in through through the Arwen through the our own platform to the exchange and what coins do you support and how do you decide which ones to support yeah so currently we have three coins because we are we're still in beta and we're moving towards like the full set of features that we plan to support by the end of the year but right now we have Bitcoin Bitcoin cash and litecoin so we're probably the only protocol right now that can support swaps from Bitcoin into Bitcoin cash actually and so those are the three that we have right now and the team is currently working on aetherium and ERC 20 and so when we have that part we're going to have the ability to basically swap from all the ERC 20 tokens plus the stable coins into Bitcoin Bitcoin cash and litecoin so that's where we're starting from we started there because we we were looking for the highest volume coins at the moment and that was always Bitcoin so we started there first the other reason to start with Bitcoin is because bitcoin is actually harder to write protocols for and so we started with basically the most difficult part of the problem first and when we have solved that problem we can basically migrate that on to other coins that are easier to write smart contracts and protocols for and that's cerium and so that's why we did a cerium ii I mean if you if you can actually nail down all the protocol and specificities in Bitcoin it's a lot easier to support that over to a cerium which is completely different and a lot easier to program than Bitcoin and when you we're talking and then earlier I asked you so how do you decide which coins to support yeah so we looked at the high volume coins which were no but I feel like going forward how will you Oh going forward yeah sorry um going forward I think we're you know I'm very interested in a lot of these different new coins that are coming out like we have cosmos and we have finance chain and we have Z caches are just a huge number of super interesting new block chains that are out there I think right now we have our hands full with the cerium and ER C 20 leg and I think that like at the end of 2019 we're gonna have an interesting view on like what are the next set of really key block chains and I think at that point we're going to look at you know what are those block chains what type of scripting functionality do they have and and pick on the basis of both you know like the popularity of the importance and the success of the coin and also like that what what we can actually do with it in terms of scripting and protocol design okay but generally you sort of envision that eventually are when we'll support as many coins as possible that's right yeah yeah I mean we just have to pick and choose in terms of the size of our team and what we can execute on but yeah our goal is really to have coins that are not designed to interoperate with each other to allow those students who operate so we're looking at the type of coins that aren't supposed to really be able to do cross blockchain protocols and focusing on actually executing the cross boxing protocols for coins that aren't supposed to be able to communicate so like the classic right now example of that is you know Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash when they fork you know protocols that are designed for Bitcoin typically cannot work with Bitcoin cash but we on purpose took the point of view that we need to be able to support something like Bitcoin cash even though they're not really designed to support each other because people are actually trading you know these pairs in practice and that's you know that that's where the the difficult problem is and that's the one we're solving so just a minute ago you said that aetherium it is easier to program on but I know from our pre-interview that you personally actually find at the other way around that bitcoins easier to program on so can you talk a little bit about what it's like working with smart contracts in Bitcoin versus aetherium and you know what the differences are and and you know why maybe your point of view is a little bit different from others yeah so the definition of the word easier like easier is can be interpreted in so many different ways so it has to be like precise about the meaning of easier so the way I was using easier two minutes ago was this you know e cerium smart contracts can support a massive amount of functionality they are tor incomplete it was just something that everyone says but you know something that's like more meaningful apart from those turing completeness of these hearing smart contracts is like you can write all sorts of code any cerium you're not you're not super restricted in to what actual you know functions you can execute in etherium with Bitcoin you can like basically do three things you can assign the transactions not messages you can't find whatever message you want you can only find transactions and you can compute hashes and check that the hash matches like the preimage of the hash matches the hash value so those are the two things you can basically do in Bitcoin so given that you can only do two things in Bitcoin it's it's not that easy to come up with protocols that are having a rich functionality given that you can really only do two things in this in the scripting language and so that's why I say it's you know harder to write protocols in in Bitcoin than it is to write protocols in you Syrian because any cerium you can put a lot of the complexity of the protocol into the actual smart contract because the scripting language supports doing all sorts of things that are not possible to do on Bitcoin so that's one definition of easier okay so now let's go to the next definition which is when you're actually building a smart contract right so now you've figured out your protocol what is the protocol protocol is what your smart contract is plus what messages you send back and forth that's the definition of a protocol so in Bitcoin your smart contract is really simple right because you can barely do anything with the scripting language but the messages you send back and forth may be more complicated right any cerium your smart contract is much more complicated but the messages you send back and forth may be simpler so what's easier is like when you're writing Bitcoin smart contract it's really easy because it's just a little dumb thing that can do very few things and actually program that and making sure it doesn't have any bugs is not that hard right because it just doesn't really do much so there's very few places where you can go wrong for instance the Arwen escrow smart contract has 16 opcodes in it bitcoin script is like assembly language and we only have 16 op codes in our escrow smart contract if you try to take the exact same a smart contract in from Bitcoin and try to port it into a cerium you end up with this complex you know much more complex contract that has many more lines of code many more function calls many more you know things that are that are being done just to execute the exact same functionality and that comes because the etherium scripting language is more rich than the Bitcoin one so when I say it's easier to write Bitcoin smart contracts it is because they're so simple once you figure out like this smart contracts lets you actually do something then writing it is easy the hard part with Bitcoin is figuring out like how you can actually do anything with this very crippled scripting language that's available to you in Bitcoin so that's a very long answer to my to the question and the reason that I find like you cerium more difficult is because actually writing the smart contract itself once you've decided what it needs to do is trickier because there's more instructions and there's all sorts of strange things that can happen in a cerium because of the way the cerium virtual machine works that is very different from like just writing regular like Java code or c-sharp code that programmers are used to and so I actually don't know what an opcode is so when you said there were only 16 of those in Bitcoin is that like lines of code it's actually an instruction so we might say it might be like if something like an if could be an opcode or sign something could be an opcode or check the hash could be an opcode check the time could be an opcode those are those are examples of opcode so there's just a very small number of instructions that you can do it's not a function call but it's like an instruction almost like a machine instruction I don't know if that if that clarifies it's a very engineer answer but it's just that there's a few like commands you can use in Bitcoin and each opcode is like one of those commands and then in aetherium for the same functionality how many lines is that you said it was a lot more yeah it's a lot more we're actually I don't want to tell you the number because we're still working on and be exact the details of the smart right now but the difference is that you don't have specific instructions but you have you know like function calls you have like a rich you know programming language you're not writing code in in like machine code like assembly language like you are in Bitcoin that's the real difference it's like if you think about normal programming languages when you're programming your your CPU and your computer you're using a language called assembly language this is very simple like move something here you know multiply something hash something that's what you would do when you're programming like a CPU and then when you're like a normal developer would be writing like JavaScript code that's many many layers above what you would be doing when you're programming a CPU with assembly language so the difference is when you're programming Bitcoin you're really doing like assembly language programming like one layer above the CPU essentially and when you're doing I mean fear in programming you're using a much richer programming language that has a lot more functionality but also a lot more complexity all right super interesting so let's move on to some thought experiments you did mention before mal Cox and Finance and just in general you know obviously there's this whole history of exchange visiting hacked in crypto and here it is that you are working on a project that you know could potentially I think prevent situations like that so what do you think would have happened if users have been using Arwen in the mount cox situation so if an exchange is hacked basically what happens is the exchange would be disabling the ability to deposit and withdraw coins from that exchange and so in our way and what that looks like is that the exchange would refuse to cooperate in closing any escrow that you have with that exchange so remember in r1 what you do is you take your coins deposit them in an escrow do a bunch of trades and when you're finished you close the escrow and the coins return back to your wallet and can be used for other purposes so if something bad happens to the exchange when you go to close your escrow the exchange will basically not respond in the way that you expect or just refuse to respond at all so you'd see that something's wrong but that this escrow is not closing because the exchange is not cooperating with you to close this escrow at this point what r1 would do is go into a coin recovery procedure and what that is is that the Arwen daemon that the piece of software that speaks are went on your behalf will detect that the exchange is not properly responding to your request to close in escrow and so what it'll do it it'll say to you you know this escrow is frozen the exchange is not responding you'll be able to recover your coins and get the coins out of this escrow on your own without the assistance of the exchange after a particular time and so Arwen escrows are associated with an expiry time so when you set up an escrow you might say you know this escrows for three days what that expiry time does is that when it's over it allows you to unilaterally close the escrow without the exchanges participation so even if they're hacked or they're behaving badly or something else has gone wrong on the exchange you can still on your own basically withdraw the coins from the escrow and use them from something else even if the exchange is not there so the bottom line is if the exchange is hacked you just be having your coins frozen in escrow for some period of time at which point you'll be able to recover them according to the balance of the trades that you've done up to that point so that sounds like it would apply really to any of kind of these high-profile situations on exchanges like mount cox quadriga finance what is that true that it would apply to all those that's right yeah so essentially what happens is if something goes wrong on the exchange and they stopped processing withdrawals which is essentially what you see in all these cases right for instance quadriga you know the founder disappeared and you know they lost access to their wallets so if they don't have access to their wallets they can't process withdrawals right another example would be like it's an exchanges hacked they can't process withdrawals because there's no longer coins in their wallet to support the withdrawals so it all comes down to just basically withdrawals not happening so um so what are one looks like in all those cases you know the exchange is not participating in closing this escrow so we're gonna close it on our own yeah and just to clarify the quadriga owner died apparently but yes there there is some suspicion about whether or not that was true but then i actually also wanted to ask so i know we don't have all the details about finance just yet and for listeners we're actually recording very shortly after the buy Nets hack was announced so potentially between the time we've recorded this and the time we're releasing it there could be more details are revealed but Sharon for you knowing what we know so far is there any because like as far as I understand from finances announcement it looks like individual user accounts were compromised so I don't know if you if if in exchange we're using Arwen and it's like you know I don't know how that would affect the ability to do something like that right so with the finance pack right what we know and we're only like a couple days from the hug so I'm sure more details will emerge in the coming days what we know about this was that according to the information that's out there is that several user accounts were compromised and it sounds like those accounts were sort of compromised at whatever rate they were compromised so slowly accumulating compromised accounts and then at one point the attacker sort of took all those accounts and it sounds like it told them all to withdraw at the same time and to withdraw coins to a particular place which is controlled by the attacker and or places that are controlled by the attacker and so all those accounts kind of just in one transaction withdraws all those accounts requested or withdrawal kind of at the same time and that withdrawal was processed at the same transaction all in one shot and then we had 7,000 bitcoins from the finance hot wallet just be moved into the attackers control so that's what it sounds like so individual accounts probably were compromised at some very slow rate and then the attacker like waited until the moment where he actually did though authorities he or she did the the withdrawal and and process at the same time so that's you know that's a pretty aggressive and precise attack and that's what we know right now but you know I'm sure more details will emerge in the future so the effectiveness was at essentially the hot wallet was empty and there were no more coin in the hot wallet so consider another user that wasn't compromised that's just coming in and wants to withdraw their Bitcoin from Finance well there's no more Bitcoin in the hot wallet anymore so you can't really do withdrawals unless they take them out of the cold wallet which of course they weren't at the moment that they discovered that something went wrong right so they exchanged all kind of like you know feel like okay now let's pull out our cold wallet and expose that and we're sad be hacked so at that point you know with Charles are frozen because that's the only like natural thing to do at that point so there's nothing you know strange about that and and at the end of the day you know you know Alice who'd have nothing to do with any of this can't withdraw her Bitcoin even though they're her Bitcoin right so the difference with our one would be we'd be back into this case where like the user wants to to close an escrow she never actually gave her Bitcoin to the custody of finance so even in finance is hot while it was empty she still has whatever her eskers are those are still locked on the blockchain even in finance it's like I'm going offline I'm not going to talk to anyone for a week while I figure out what happened here she could unilaterally closed those escrows without the participation of the exchange so really the whole technical contribution and all that all the innovation and Arwen is really just dealing with the case where the other side of the escrow you know so I'm not screwing with finance just disappears and doesn't want to participate anymore and so I have to be able to recover on my own without the exchanges participation right but actually I sue my question was ever so slightly different which is that it sounds to me like an attacker wouldn't be able to perpetrate this type of hack because I'm sorry if you know all let's say all the users were using Arwen because essentially what would just happen is that then individual users might lose their coins but the exchange I mean granted then it gets a little weird because then we're sort of pursuing anyway I think you see where I'm going because then it's sort of like the exchange it's not happening coins but essentially it would so if an individual user gets compromised it kind of like localizes the damage to the individual user rather than the exchange suffering is that right sort of right okay yeah so I mean there's - there's two answers one is that the user really doesn't care what happens at the exchange so even if the exchange is like out to get her the entire time she's trading on that exchange she doesn't care because the exchanges job is to put up escrows properly you know and and when you're setting up the escrows like if the exchange is not doing that properly you won't set up escrows and so those coins never go anywhere and you're never interacting with this exchange you set up the escrow even if the exchange is attacking you it doesn't matter because you always know you're going to get the coin do you expect so that's really the first piece right the second piece is that when you have self custody you kind of make it harder to to attack because the coins are housed you know in a distributed way and so that's really like the value proposition of a lot of these self custody solutions is that you have to really go after the custodian in order to attack the user and that's harder to do because it's like more places that you have to attack all right so let's talk about kind of where you're going so you guys only recently launched in beta and as far as I understand there's like pretty restrictive limits on the trading so you know I probably because you are in beta can't first of all can you actually state what those limits aren't right now yeah it's about a hundred dollars right now for the next little while but we're going to be raising it and so then going on in the future it sounds like right now you're working on adding etherium and ERC 20 tokens but what are some other futures futures features you'd like to add on our win in the future I kind of wondered if something like margin trading would work on our twin mm-hmm yeah you know I I can say this right now but I don't want to like commit to anything I'm saying because we're still evaluating specifically what's next there's a lot of different things that we like know how to do and and are interested in doing so one of them is a high frequency trading support that you mentioned which we think is really exciting but you know what we're looking at what exactly the demand is for that particular feature right now there's also you know the notion of options so you know talking to traders there's a lot of interest in having options that are not fully collateralized so finding a way to do that could be really interesting it's not something that we've started but started building but something that we've talked about thought about other pieces are you know providing you know fast movement of coins between exchanges so you know you're on one exchange and now you can really quickly move your coins to different exchanges in order to exploit whatever price opportunity you have at different exchanges so you know all of this I'm just kind of throwing out in the air because we haven't committed - exactly which one of these steps is next potentially integrating with with like banks and providing Fiat support as well from through atomic swaps is another thing we're interested so there's a lot of different opportunities that we're looking at right now and you know we'll have like more details on exactly what that is in like the coming months but right now our real focus is just like providing this support free Syria and basically reducing some of the friction in using Ireland and sorry just so I understand what you meant when you said that you would be interested in integrating with banks for doing atomic slots of Fiat do you mean with like stable coins that are pegged to Fiat or something like that no so stable coins are gonna come through easy reham so that that's not that that's already on the roadmap right so when we have the ERC 20 we will have stable coins and then that's that's done basically no there's also a question of like real Fiats through real banks and how can you work with a bank to actually have them support you know if there's movement of yet in the bank how can you actually reflect that movement of fiat on the blockchain you know so if you move let's say $100 in the in the bank then maybe you move like part of the Bitcoin on the blockchain at the same time so some of those ideas or things that we're thinking about - okay okay I said I feel like I'm a little bit confused so it's it's like for a bank to use our win for their internal ledger no no so so let me back up so people are very interested in crypto - fiat trading right so they want to trade dollars for bitcoins that's perhaps the most popular market you have in Korea you have dollars Bitcoin for for one and things like that so these these are very popular markets and this concept of atomic slots which is something that's very particular to crypto currency can be extended so when you do an atomic flop you typically have you know two crypto currencies and you're swapping from one to the other so again an atomic swap means Alice has item a bob has item B so either Alice gets B and Bob gets a or Alice keeps a and Bob keeps B so it can't be the case that Bob gets both a and B or Alice gets both a and B that cannot happen that's what an atomic clock is and you can do that on the blockchain without trusting anyone because that's the whole point of having a blockchain it's a way of you know having mutually untrusted parties agree on some form of truth and so you can use that to build these protocols so that's like an atomic swap when people in the blockchain space say that that's what they mean but you can also extend that concept right so if you're actually moving Fiat like real money you know paper money or money inside a bank you know there's no blockchain there so it's it's hard to kind of use the blockchain as a root of trust but when people move yet around they use banks right when you're moving Fiat back and forth you might be using a bank to facilitate this transfer so if you're transferring you know Fiat in the bank world maybe you can reflect the movement of Fiat in the bank world actually for the movement of coin on the blockchain right so you don't really have to trust anyone to move the coin although you may have to trust the bank to move the Fiat and so stress tying those two pieces together is something that we think is pretty interesting hmm something about this it sort of reminds me of like colored coins or something but anyway okay well it sounds very interesting and I guess you know we'll sort of see if that's direction you go in all right well it's been so great having you on Unchained where can people learn more about you and Arwen um so we have our website Arwen geo if you want to try Arwen right now you can go to KU coin comm which is the first exchange that we launched with which is one of the top exchanges in Asia and just click on trade from your wallet and you'll be able to use our one to trade directly on a coin okay actually there was one piece though that I think I saw which is this is restricted to non-us residents that's true okay if you want to talk a little bit about the whole rank you actually yeah yeah can you let's let's do that yeah okay so you know we've been in this business for a year and a half and we've been talking to a whole bunch of exchanges and we discovered a bunch of things so the first thing we discovered is that in Asia crypto decrypt our trading is a really big thing it's so much bigger thing than it is here in the US so that's really interesting second is that in Asia sort of the regulatory situation looks very different than it does here so take the example of Japan for instance in Japan you have the financial service agency of Japan the FSA that regulates all crypto trading and transactions and payments and so on so there's this one body called USA they regulate everything they're a very strong regulator and they're very tough and they're very involved but there's just one of them and you know who they are and so if you have to say license you you're done and so you know that's sort of like the picture in Asia either the regulators are very friendly and they're just like you know try what you're doing and we'll regulate you later after we figure out what it is that you're doing here or it'll be you know we're the FSA we're very tough but you know you just know that it's us and you can work with us and that's the end of it so that's kind of a picture in Asia and so what happened for us is because what we're doing is so new it's hard for the regulator's to really know what we're doing because it's new and so that makes it a little bit harder to kind of like launch with a US exchange or with US users because we have to kind of make an argument based on laws that are very old that involve multiple regulators like you have the SEC the CFTC you have the states you have the FinCEN you have just a large number of different regulations that apply to cryptocurrency you have to figure out how your new protocol fits into all of these different rules and what that means for taking us users so that's really tricky when you're start-up and so what we've done is essentially like just worked outside of the US because the regulatory landscape here people say that it's unclear I think a more correct term is that it's complex and that there's a lot of regulations that you have to comply with and not complying with them results in very bad things so kind of sidestepping all of that is what we've chosen to do at this point because we're really you know kind of breaking new ground from a technology perspective and understanding how that fits in with the regulations you know is something that we're working on but it takes time so at that at this point right we've launched with an exchange that is abroad and doesn't really take users that rky seats from the US and so as a result you know Arwen is is not available to u.s. users right now I think broadly speaking I personally would like to see less of this happening because I'm sure that you've encountered a lot of new projects they're coming from teams here that are actually launching outside of the US and it really comes from when you're doing some of the really innovative things that are coming out of this country understanding how the regulations apply to those things is really hard and expensive and involves lots of lawyers and it's not just one set of rules but it's like n of them and that's what you see you see you know you see launches outside of the US that said you know we are working towards getting launches in the US but it's like a longer and slower process that's involved you know figuring out exactly how we fit into many more regulatory frameworks that are old and not really designed for this space yeah I'm so glad that this came up at the end in a very roundabout way because I did ask SEC Commissioner has her purse about this when I interviewed her and I think she seemed to say that she you know was kind of sympathetic or or did understand that this was something Ord that actually that she was just concerned about what you said that kind of innovation was happening here but people were bringing their innovation elsewhere for that very reason and she did say she listens to the show so perhaps she'll hear this or I think other people that's easy listen to the show as well so maybe they'll hear but yeah I I do find it is not it's a pretty widespread sentiment actually amongst a lot of donors in this space at least in the u.s. so you're definitely not the only one yeah and I just want to say that like if I can move a conversation just a little bit through this podcast is that like you always hear like there's no regulatory clarity there's no regulatory clarity like that's not the point right like so we don't know if each is a security or not a security like that's an important question a huge question right but there's so much more going on and there's so much more innovation happening so for instance what's a what's a to of to multi-sig and what does that imply when you have a - of some multi-sig who's controlling the asset who's transmitted the asset how does that fit into you know money transmitter laws and how does that transmit it into like the state money transmitter laws and how does that affect the CFTC's view of the object right like you've just got to think about so many different regimes and so many different rules and you know this country has a very well-developed regulations for financial services which makes sense right given like the history of all sorts of things happening when there aren't regulation but you know what this is is like a new way to transact and what we're doing is we're having to fit this into these old rules and you know what that would even be fine if it was just one set of old rules like you haven't in the Japan the Japan FSA approach but here you just have lots of them so like you really don't know you really don't know how many of these rules can affect you right you have money services businesses in each state you have money transmission like the fencin regulations you have so you have to see you have FEC so it's not just that sort of like lack of clarity but it's the fact that there are a lot of rules you have to do some really creative lawyering which I personally actually really like like I enjoy thinking about like all these old laws and how how exactly like our escrows effect these specific laws and how they fit in I find that like intellectually fascinating like I am a professor at the end of the day so I like love this stuff but it's applicated and if you make a mistake like the the penalties are high right and and and so it really sort of prevents you from even taking the risk right because you know like I think this is the interpretation but like who knows what the regulator is going to think because you know no one's really done this before and so how much risk am I willing to take to actually deploy this technology in the US when I don't know exactly how the regulator might apply this or maybe there's like an attorney general in some state that doesn't like the way I did this and comes after me so like it's it's just so complicated and the penalties are so high that it really is stifling our ability to launch products in the country okay well that's a grim place to end this but hopefully that's an important statement that some regulators will hear well it has been so great having on the show this was just yeah this was an amazing episode so thanks again for coming on Unchained thank you I'm sorry to end it on the facade note but a happier note which is that I do think that there's just like a massive number of technological innovations happening right now in this space you know people kind of trying to do things that that don't really make sense in the physical world or in the traditional world but do you make sense and are possible when we use blockchains and so like I'm really excited about you know pushing this type of field forward and like I I just I'm looking for kind of places where we can we can get this out there and get people using it and and I do think that things will kind of fall in line and this innovation will be accepted but you know we're really we're really like at a place where we're experimenting and I'm sort of looking forward to seeing all of the new all of the new things at different people in the space are working on yeah me too all right great well thanks for coming on the show thank you thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Sharon and our wind check out the show notes
