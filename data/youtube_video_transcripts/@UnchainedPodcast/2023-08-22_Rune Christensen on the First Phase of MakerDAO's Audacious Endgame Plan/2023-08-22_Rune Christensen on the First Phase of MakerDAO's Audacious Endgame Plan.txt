yeah to me it sounds like what you're trying to create is something like the original or I mean like Bitcoin where um you have this coin and incentivizes Mining which is needed for the network to have security but you want to do it for kind of like other things in maker Dow so describe kind of the whole end game plan and I know there's like four phases a Rebrand sub-dial farming voter rewards governance AI tools so why don't you just walk us through each of these phases well and first of all I mean it's exactly the Bitcoin thing that's exactly what we would like to go for in the sense that that's what we we can't be exactly like Bitcoin but we often call it like a Bitcoin like end game the name endgame is chosen because we want to reach this like Bitcoin like state of a higher level of ossification and certainty and reliability of like the future state of the system right and yeah so so the way we Implement all these I mean all this stuff I was talking about is basically through these like four major different aspects of the alignment engineering so the first one is just like the The Branding and the design of the system and this I guess is maybe like I mean on one hand is this gonna matter a lot for growth and of course growth is like a really I mean it's essential I mean the whole point of this is we want to make this system super robust so that we can grow it really large and it will not fall apart so I mean it would be pointless to do it all without also making sure we focus on growth and um the reason why we believe there's a big opportunity for a new brain is because basically the original brains were just they were kind of made up without too much thought being put into it right and the big problem is there's two of them there's like two separate Brands and they're actually great for like I mean they're great for like sort of classic crypto and also very important to know that they will they will stick around right so nothing will actually happen to mkr or die uh but there will be like this new sort of third umbrella brand that will include a new stable coin and a new governance token um and they will then have kind of the same brand you know so it's not too completely separate sort of uh things that that you don't naturally associate with each other but rather it's like is like the brand and then like the Dao for the brand basically I mean one of the reasons one of the things we noticed was that we would go to events and people would be like yeah I'll use dye I love that oh it's great and then they'd be like what the hell is maker I have no idea I've never heard of it I have no idea what that is right like there's so many people like that and actually also the like is then the other way around because mkholders are like I mean NPR right now is like a very unique token in in crypto in that we have this like super low Supply and just like a kind of a very uh sort of a culture that has always been very focused on like fresh like being very rational and sort of this like Risk Management Focus and that's just also resulted in that that a lot of the holders of MCAT aren't necessarily die useless or even like that much of like regular crypto uses um but there's like this very sort of unique and specific type of uh mkr um ecosystem participant and we really hope to change that because that is also I mean getting more overlap between the users and those who govern the system that is by itself also I mean a key step of alignment engineering right because now you naturally get an alignment where I mean the people who could run the system they're much more likely to use it so they're much more likely to like think about what do you do you just want and how do we keep them safe and that's going to inform their decisions so basically what you mean is like comp compound unit swap you need is that what you're getting at that like literally just the names need to be more similar yeah but I mean you could think of I mean but it could be something right I mean there's like a compound and comp and then there'd also need to be something like compusd right that's sort of the in our case we we have both a stable coin and uh a governance token that have to be very similar and I mean the big challenge right now is like if you're trying to describe the whole ecosystem there's actually not really a word for that right like I mean the closest would be maker down but the most important part of the ecosystem is die and that's not even contained in the name maker right and then I mean I would go on about I've got all these likes of them I mean all the kind of obvious issues that came up many years later when I really realized this name is actually really sticky and and you know it pops up everywhere and it's used a lot of different contexts and ultimately it was not designed with that much foresight so I wanna I mean I basically think that NPR and die are great brands for like so crypto insiders because they have this history and they're sort of Classic Brands right so they're very valuable and need to be you know maintained and nurtured and serve their Niche basically but for this major push towards growth to what's actually spreading I mean breaking the stagnation of defined crypto that we're in now getting new users involving me get people to stop losing hope in crypto and stop seeing it as just a chance game but instead see some kind of opportunity something exciting to get into that's basically it's it's the right moment to then come out with like a much more well thought through brand that can serve this role of like being the vehicle of all these new features I mean all the later stages of endgame basically and then also just be like simpler I mean and this is kind of Simplicity is sort of it can be hard to see how that's even possible right because I mean maker is famously complex right but what our I mean our approach is we want to be friendly but complex I guess you can say right so and I always keep comparing it to like gamification like a video game right if you start playing a new video game uh it could be massively complex there could be so many things but when you're playing it it's fun and you're not overwhelmed because it keeps you on like the right you know keeps you on the right track right slowly lets you delve deeper into the world if you want that or just you can just stay in the very beginning and just never get into any of the complex stuff and not feel like you're doing something wrong which I think is kind of the problem with maker often today is that it's like either you just die and you don't even know what maker is or like you try to understand what maker is and you feel like you know like you feel like you're not even welcome but one thing is like you're calling it a Rebrand but you're keeping the original Brands and then just launching two new tokens right which is a different sort of thing like why why not just rename mkr and and die well I mean so I would say it's a Rebrand in the sense that the website will change for instance right so all it'll it's more like so that so the overarching brand of what it is will change I mean you actually cannot really you can't really uh rename tokens uh I mean it's very difficult to try to do so uh because they have a you know they've got like this sort of identifier on chain that the term that determines the name that's one thing the other thing is I mean there's going to be a lot of people who will just like freak up who you know who will generally uh get a heart attack right thinking that their money is lost or something so you'd never I mean we actually I mean we consider that but in practice it's just the risks the unknowns of trying to do that are are very severe uh I think and then finally on top of that I mean there's a lot of I mean there's five billion die in circulation right there's a lot of users that I'd like that and they that's what they're familiar with that's what they like to use um there's no reason why they should be disturbed right and for MPR I think I mean some people they think it's super cool that it's just like super low Supply token um and and it's just like it's sort of an OG token right and similarly I don't think that there's any reason to kind of mess with that what we can do is because we're offering so many new features and all of these new features are growth focused in particular the the subdial framework you'll talk about in just a second right we but basically we can we can be like look you can stay with the whole system and not know what's going to mess with you and everything will be safe and nothing's gonna happen to your money and if you want to try to upgrade to basically what is just a new brand uh same security you know same governance same guarantees as the system has always offered you then there's all these new features that you can access but it's entirely optional and you can go you can go back again right so you can switch from die to this uh new stable coin and if you don't like it you can just switch right back and it's so it's completely risk-free right so this I think is actually is crucial in in making sure that there's nobody who get conf you know who gets more confused or you know like overwhelmed by It's gotta be it's gotta be fun right it's Gotta feel and it should never feel like you're getting stressed out and and you rather just do something else in this overwhelming complicated crypto stuff right all right so
