exchange commission rejected microstrategy's bitcoin accounting method found in an earnings report the sec's letter dated december 3rd went as follows and refers to a standard known as generally accepted accounting principles we object to your adjustment for bitcoin impairment charges in your non-gaap measures please revise to remove this adjustment in future filings this came in response to microstrategy reporting non-gaap numbers for its bitcoin holdings in its previous filings as currently constituted companies are required to adjust the value of bitcoin on their balance sheets when the price falls in accounting language this is called impairment however when the price of bitcoin rises the company cannot readjust the price of bitcoin on its balance sheet this quirk in gaap accounting essentially forces companies with bitcoin on their balance sheets to record their bitcoin holdings at the price it paid for or lower while this is only a paper quirk as one could look up the amount of a company's bitcoin holdings and the current value of bitcoin recording bitcoin as an impairment affects the net worth of a company and therefore its value to investors this is most likely why microstrategy reported non-gaap numbers in its earlier filings it wanted to make its bitcoin holdings look better however microstrategy has agreed to stop its non-gaap reporting microstrategy reported holding 124 391 bitcoin or 4.5 billion dollars worth on december 30th 2021. solana's spotty performance irks high profile traders while the crypto markets underwent a heavy dip
