today's guest is Brendan Eich CEO and president of brave welcome Brendan thanks for having me you're famous for creating JavaScript and co-founding Mozilla tell us about your history prior to founding brave let's see I used to work on operating systems and network software a low-level software for Silicon Graphics back in its heyday in 85 to 92 and then I I went to a company it was like second grad school that you never heard of called micro unity where I did a bunch of similar low-level hardware on amazed software on amazing hardware and then I went to Netscape a year after they invited me which was my mistake but I went there in 1995 created JavaScript in ten days because everybody was in a big hurry to do a deal of Sun to embed Java in Netscape and kill Windows to quote Marc Andreessen and that got Microsoft's attention it got Microsoft's attention in such a bad way that they crushed Netscape and Microsoft ended up in an antitrust case they lost and Netscape ejected Mozilla as sort of an escape pod with just a couple of us on board a small handful of people and we persevered and did Firefox restarted the browser market and over the course of time I realized that the monopoly position had changed who was playing the monopolist but it was still a risk in the Internet whenever you have networks you could have people cluster around a service or a distribution channel like the PCs operating system it becomes a monopoly control point and you end up with Microsoft in the 90s or now I own say Google first among many Facebook also has a lot of power taking over large parts of markets and then using that power to conquer adjacent markets so while I was doing Mozilla I also realized mosula was really dependent on Google for its revenue and I thought couldn't we do something that put the user in in the first position for controlling the revenue getting the revenue sending it to their favorite sites and that's why I created brave and also I just want a cycle back a little bit there was a period where you did become CEO of Mozilla it was pretty short controversy caused you to step down what happened there I can't talk about that for a lot of reasons but when I was at Mozilla I was ultimately running engineering over 430 people I think and stepped up to the opportunity when they couldn't find a CEO candidate otherwise but there were difficulties again I can't comment on and it was important to be able to do the things that we're doing at brave without the constraints that I think Mozilla faced at the time so I did that ok well just for the listeners so they're not confused I guess shortly after you began people became aware partly through a campaign by OkCupid that you had donated to Proposition 8 which was to ban gay marriage in California and that caused enough of a controversy that eventually had to step down so tell me a little bit more about how you came to found brave and what your motivation was as I said it was a watching Mozilla be a junior search partner with Google which was the main source of revenue for Mozilla and still is and realizing Google was not just going to stay an excellent search engine which is how the partnership started in 2004 after we did the deal in 2004 and started making a lot of money Google bought YouTube they bought double-click which is you know the basis for the Ad Exchange and how they do ads and publisher pages and then they they bought other companies and they unified the Ad Exchange across all their media across search across the publisher pages across the Google Play Store for Android and across YouTube and then they you know they they made it so that all your data belonged to them even to the point people didn't realize this at first ProPublica reported on it in 2016 that chrome is tracking you if you use any Google service and you log in with your Google account ID unless you turn off the tracking you're giving data every time you use Chrome with such a logged in service you don't have to log into the browser now that since last year they changed it so that just using the service logs you into the browser across all your tabs so this is what you know just on a zoo off call surveillance capitalism I don't know the terms not original to her this is something that I think a lot of people don't want to see unchallenged because you know you perceive it in many ways you're tracked by ads that bother you maybe they're they're targeting ads you've already responded to by buying the product in which case there's no point that's just annoying or they're targeting you with ads that you don't for things you don't want or they're disclosing that your children's birthday gifts ahead of schedule or they're being used free outright malign purposes like malware distribution malevolent stuff service spying on you harassing you maybe they're also being used this is the other side of the system where you're not involved but the advertiser is spending money that's going to a fraud system that pretends to view the ad when it's really just a robot software robot in a cloud browser so there are a lot of problems with this system when when Google bought double-click the judge supervising the acquisition through a consent decree said you have a search business you've just bought a display ads business you should not arbitrage those two markets you're gonna have instant price knowledge for a bunch of brands that are buying keywords for search and they're buying you know segments what they call segment identifiers or basically keywords for display ads and since you have instant price knowledge you can make risk-free profit you shouldn't do that but the consent decree expired after two years and Google unified the Ad Exchange it isn't just arbitrage it's now at a panopticon and this is this is something that I think is a problem for everybody publishers face not only the fraud problem I mentioned where they don't get the remnant the residual ad revenue share because the the there's no viewer looking at their site it's a robot looking at a copy of their site but the advertiser still pays advertisers don't like that as much but they they kind of have to turn a blind eye because they're throwing money at the wall and seeing what sticks publishers also are at the end of the payment pipe so they get whatever is left in the pie tin and sometimes it's only one small slice it's like 20% or 30% of the gross revenue spend and there are other problems but the social problems become even worse people you know worry about things like Cambridge analytic and I think there's something to it the amount of data leakage when you use these kind of ad systems is horrifying you don't know when you go to a page without protection like brave shields offers where your data is going it could be going to a bunch of partners of partners sort of 7 degrees of Kevin Bacon separated from the Google or the other Ad Exchange operator and it again it can be used for very bad purposes so how does brave work so browsers for a long time just were sort of the users agent in in the software sense that they would do whatever you said when you clicked on a link or open a new tab but I created JavaScript and even before that with cookies and images there were ways to track you so what happened over time is the system of surveillance evolved kind of unplanned based on these these fundamental building blocks the cookie the image and JavaScript and if you don't block those by default you're not just a user agent as a browser you're sort of a blind servant of the advertising tracking system so brave blocks all that stuff that's important we don't want the default to be tracked and in danger under threat so blocking by tracking by default is complex because there's no formal grammar in the web standards it says here here is the web standard for viewing the web page without being tracked and here's the the technology for being tracked you can just block that cleanly it's much more subtle it involves all sorts of variations on themes it it cannot in fact be formalized in such a clean way because there are always ways across a network to track somebody if you're determined enough to do so but what we have today is such a permissive system that there's tons of ways to track and fortunately for brave there are lots of ways to defend other I would say browsers are starting to do this for a long time the only real protection came from browser extensions so Firefox pioneered the extension model for browsers and then other browsers did their own versions of it and Chrome's became predominant because of chromes market power and so people can use extensions like you block origin which we think very highly of or ad blocking extensions some of which don't block tracking well at all there are some like ghostery and disconnect that are more about tracking production as well the the diligence and degree of protection vary among these extensions and you have to know about extensions you know does the average user even know when the extension is or how to get one with brave we build it right into the browser we do something beyond that when you do block tracking when you block this sort of subtle mix of content that can track you that's woven into the content you do want to read you can break the content you want to read you can break the experience you can break the page so we need our users to be literally brave we want them to have you know some fortitude in the face of adversity because they're going to get some breakage they're going to even get some hostile you know dialogues from anti adblock or anti anti tracking systems that publishers sometimes run those systems generally don't help publishers they lose readers but they're out there so by blocking all this by default we can protect the user then we study the emerging threats using machine learning and web crawlers we build sophisticated models of how tracking works these are rolled up under a name we call page graph and that allows us to automate the ongoing shields that we ship to users as a set of rules to block things so we have a very adaptive system we can respond to threats within a day or so through a data service that a browser gets these rules through these rules are not trafficking you to us we don't track our users in any identifiable way but we can update brave quickly to respond to new tracking threats and we can quickly resolve any sort of breakage that they might see so we're trying to push the web toward a private by default state and that requires this kind of advanced research and development because we can then inform the web standards so we do have a proper grammar for what is licit or legal tracking versus versus not and then users can more easily and assuredly block the traffic you also created the basic attention token why did you need a token so we started from a position in 2015 of brave wanting to excuse me block ads block tracking relief which might block ads but essentially we were focused on blocking tracking when you do that you cut off all the sort of bespoke contract-based even if it's software as a service contract based payments that go from the advertiser to the publisher through a bunch of tracking intermediaries so-called third parties we realized therefore we were going to hurt some publishers and our users our early adopters also realized that because they they're ecologically minded they don't just want to track they don't just want to freeride they would like to give back if possible to their favorite websites and YouTube channels and so on and you once you block all those those tracking pixels and tracking scripts the payments will not be confirmed and the publisher or creator will not get paid so to re-connect payments you need something like a browser payment channel directly to the Creator and cryptocurrency was on our mind from the beginning so I talked to the etherium London folks in July of 2015 about doing something I called brave coin at the time to make it possible for not only users to give back their favorite creators but to give users some some coins to get them started and maybe even as an ongoing grant almost like a citizenship of income because I didn't think users should after having been abused for decades by tracking have to open their wallet and and somehow acquire cryptocurrency and that was difficult to do then it's it's not really any a whole lot easier now but the etherium network had just launched and the 2014 and was not ready and so we turned the Bitcoin and as we brought up brave in 2016 we rapidly integrated Bitcoin so that you could buy buying bitcoins send a little bit to a multi-sig wallet that no no entity had two of three keys control over and that wall would irrevocably commit whatever you sent to it to be distributed among your sites and we tried signing up websites to receive the Bitcoin that was being sent we used a protocol called ananias to zero knowledge proof protocol we had a centralized but blinded accounting server so there was no link back to user identity from any of the donations that went through this mechanism but we could settle to publishers who signed up to get their Bitcoin and it was a beta so we we had to comply with regulations but we didn't have any partners helping us settle so we had to you know collect w9s or you know the equivalent tax forms from recipients and they had to be willing to set up a Bitcoin address and we'd send to them this was difficult there were many problems the first I will say no offense to Bitcoin wouldn't true of any crypto a lot of publishers don't want any cryptocurrency the big ones especially the legal finance department and IT department don't want to touch it so they need something more like what they're used to with getting paid by ad vendors or Google and that looks more like a ACH you know bank connection or some kind of a way of being invoiced and/or getting paid on an invoice basis they they wouldn't touch crypto and so we talked out around the thousand publishers signed up and it was very hard to grow further but that was only on the settlement side the publisher side the users of the system had to buy their own Bitcoin and bring it in the US we had a coin base by widget we integrated which was itself a little challenging because it had to worry about fraud credit card fraud so it had a sort of acquisition funnel that would study the user and take extra information not quite you know know your customer level information but still enough to do fraud anti-fraud working credit-card fraud which is a real risk these by widgets that you're probably familiar with this if you want to buy $20 in Bitcoin with a credit card the risk is credit card IDs are under $1 in bulk on the dark web so stolen credit card at these so somebody can just buy a bunch of stolen IDs make a bunch of $20 Bitcoin buys a net $19 profit or more as it only cost them a buck or less for the credit card ID that was stolen and there's no way to prosecute the the charge back so you know the whoever is involved the the the bank of the stolen credit card is going to just have to eat that and they're going to try to shut it down but it's it's hard to police so coinbase and others who have buy widgets have to do some machine learning based anti fraud and that that makes the user experience less ideal but even then you're asking the user to buy Bitcoin and we wanted users to get paid we didn't want them to by asking the user to buy something it's going to lose a lot of users right away a lot of people just say why should I pay the web's already free I can use Chrome or Firefox with you block origin which is that great blocking extension I mentioned by the way chrome is chrome is still planning to somehow break the capabilities of you block origin and other rigorous blockers in order to they say improve the security of their extension API so there's a real risk that some of these blocking extensions will be neutered over time but then you have a you the problem I mentioned earlier that users have to know what an extension isn't how to get it sometimes how to configure it and and in the end our ecologically minded users had no way to give back so when we set up this Bitcoin system they could give back but they had to learn about Bitcoin they had to buy it oh and then of course 2017 we had real congestion problems on Bitcoin due to the block size dispute and other problems that were not solved until Sega it was turned on after a fork late in the year and that that meant the network was very slow and the fees the coin base was charging for a small Bitcoin buy or inordinate so we had users who were not crypto savvy and because they saw this coin based by widget if they were willing to navigate its you know sort of anti-fraud multi-step process to get their credit card in they would buy five dollars a Bitcoin and they would see a four dollar and fifty cent fee because the network was so congested so some of them said okay I'll just buy in bulk and I'll amortize the fee better I'll buy you know more Bitcoin at once and I'll trickle it into my brave wallet over time but again you lose every time you add friction like that you lose users every time you say oh you know what get a Bitcoin wallet that optimizes fees you'll be fine it'll be great a lot of users don't know what to do they just don't have the expertise and they won't acquire it and the idea wasn't to force everyone using brave to become a Bitcoin expert it was to help the lead users of brave who are switching away from chrome who want to get protection through brain shields who want to give back to their favorite sites some way to do so without without a lot of pain and friction and overhead and fees so then basically you introduce basic attention token but but just so I understand like you were saying earlier that publishers don't want to accept a cryptocurrency so why would they want to accept bad and like why wouldn't you just use a stable coin do you know what I mean just keep a clean like if they're wanting dollars then it can be all denominated in dollars we're global that's one reason the dollar is is the king of the Fiats but there are places no or whatever the local steelbook turns at their choice well there weren't a lot of stable coins then but to answer your question more directly yes publishers mostly especially the big ones don't want to take any crypto but basically token does not require them to take any crypto we have a partner uphold which we used from the start to do settlement and they can exchange to Bitcoin and then to any fiat and they do so when we partner with uphold in 2017 right after the basic attention token sale we had a way to do settlement in any currency that the publisher chose initially that was predominantly for the local Fiat but as we grew especially as we moved the system to support YouTube channels where you can actually tip a reward you've a recurring anonymous contribution to your favorite YouTube creator a lot of them said we're going to keep that and they didn't exchange out so the the choice of what to take in settlement was another variable like I said that's the point of friction because you can't impose crypto whether it's bad or Bitcoin on the other hand you need an exchange partner to have the freedom to let people choose whatever they want and then let the market sort it out and so - why don't you describe how that works for the listeners sure so the idea of brave coin that I mentioned what I discussed in London with the etherium folks was in part to create something that was not a larger store value coin like Bitcoin let's say where there's enormous speculative supply and demand pressure and fairly high volatility we create a basic attention token for a smaller tokenized market which is the attention market that's mediated today very badly through tracking in browsers through all these surveillance java scripts and images and pixels cookies so that market as our white paper argues can have price stability over time and we also have the option which brave coin the initial idea wanted of giving users tokens to get them started grants to bootstrap the system and that was part of the the basic ignition token plan that came from the Genesis block of the capped token sale and so we did on ERC 20 token on aetherium Wheatley had been inspired by the Golem project in which sold in November of 2016 which was very successful for its time and even more so in view of crypto summer and the run-up in etherion price ether price we also looked at other early token experiments like First Blood and we we saw the emergence of ERC 20 as signed to get off Bitcoin we we have no you know religious commitment opted for your commitment to any coin were huge fans of Soto she's work and were convinced that the crypto is here to stay but we use it as a means to an end and that's tokenizing attention economy rewarding users rather than making them pay reducing friction for all crypto normalizing crypto for not only attention economics as mediated by a browser or an ad bearing app like a game but also for e-commerce and and other things one of the things we noticed with Bitcoin that I heard about from an open Bazaar founder who talked to me the other month was it is a store value it is subject to the speculative and fairly volatile changes in price and therefore people don't want to spend it generally the open Bazaar founder said well they want to Hottel it and I understand that that also worked against our using Bitcoin and so when we use the basic attention token it wasn't quite a stable coin but if you look at Willy lose charts whoo nom ik from 2017 bat was actually second least volatile above US dollar tether among a basket of tokens and coins he looked at and Bitcoin was more volatile etherion was more volatile so we actually as our white paper argued did by tokenizing and using a custom token we did achieve lower volatility because we're not locking up the coin for a long time we're using it to settle in 30 days we don't see volatility is a big concern and we don't think our users are burdened by it because they're getting a revenue share from ads now private ads in the browser which we can offer them as part of brave rewards this is optional they're getting 70% of the revenue in tokens and they can they can take it out right away and we we do the conversion at the end of the 30-day period so we think the volatility exposure is small but like I said we're crypto agnostic so we will use multiple tokens we and coins we will use stable coins in brave for many purposes such as e-commerce and we're integrating these now you're already seeing this in frame for desktop with an ethereal wallet that can support eath and ERC 20 that's already in we're adding other main chain coins and tokens this year first half of this year not by adding you know full full nodes or custom like clients to the browser but using something like alchemy herb it go okay and so just to summarize for people you know cuz we need to kind of move on to different topics but basically the way it works is that so you block the the ads that publishers serve up and then you insert your own private ads and users can earn money from watching those ads they get seventy percent of the revenue and if they feel like they can give some to the publishers and that's how then the publishers earned that is that the full cycle not quite there's some careful wording required here we do not insert ads into web pages without publishers agreeing to it and we haven't done that yet we're working with some publishers to do so our ads are user private they go in separate spaces in the browser that belong to you the browser user they are not going into the publisher page you know that would be wrong but we think it would also be legally grey area and we want the publisher to get paid seventy percent if they are hosting the space for the app but we we definitely want the user to have their own space available so we have a notification based ad unit if you click on the notification because you like the call-to-action it's like a little search ad like you see on Google search but independent of any page you get a separate tab with a full beautiful tabs worth of ad content and that is private there's no signaling there's no tracking by anybody even us it's done through local machine learning in the browser that matches against a fixed catalog and again the the basic attention token lets us do the the settlement and lets us do the the granting to the user it lets us have a unit of account for attention but the mechanics involving the browser are equally important people think blockchain alone can solve things like proof of humanity or anti-fraud or attention measurement blockchain cannot do no such thing you have to have endpoint software like a browser you have to harden it against fraud you have to use secure hardware sometimes and we're doing all of that so our entire system is blockchain plus browser and that's what the bats all about to answer your question in a moment we're

my conversation with brendan eich of brave so you now have 10 million at monthly active users how many publishers do you have and who are some of the big ones so I'm gonna encourage you to see a new site called bat thought growth it's a new domain bat growth that shows we have over 400,000 publishers signed up and you can see the top ones there including Wikipedia and The Guardian The Washington Post Vice courts there are many others but also a large number of YouTube channels some of the top ones especially about music deejaying techno music and that that site bat thought growth is only the latest iteration from a volunteer-based on our our data analytics endpoint service that we run there's an earlier one called bat growth calm so encourage you to look at those because these are independent sites that are showing nice charts of our growth curves for for signing up creators youtubers more than web sites but all of them we also have tweaked twitter users signing up in large numbers redditors you can tip a reddit post if you like it or a comment you can tip a tweet we take advantage of the browser I mentioned our system is browser plus blockchain so we actually put a tip button on every tweet in brave and we do it safely without stepping on anything that's in the twitter rendered content without letting any security holes or cross-site scripting holes and from how we do it so that that kind of tipping and as an entry point to the brave reward system to using bat that's been very productive because you see a great piece of content you want a tip that helps you get on board then you can start setting up recurring payments like patreon in the browser and you can let's let some of your monthly budget of tokens flow out automatically to sites you visit that are signed up so with over 400,000 sites some of our users are actually finding their budget is well spent because most of the sites and channels they look at are signed up with us and is Dow Jones still a partner because I didn't see that on a current list oh they are okay are there arts we're doing something you know see barons and market wats we're particularly focused on them we're gonna grow out from there and on the growth side we have eleven over eleven point two million monthly active users we have over 3.5 million daily active users and we're driving daily up because we want users to switch from chrome full time what you'll find and Mozilla has numbers like this too is when you have a browser in the modern world especially on a laptop or desktop people use it in a mix with other browsers and and they don't use it every day so sometimes you get really loyal users sometimes you get users for dip in only for certain sites when they're thinking brave is going to protect them more but as we grow and we use the token as a reward and we show greater you know utility we get our message out we're converting people to use brave all the time and it really is a good upgrade from chrome now since about a year ago we've had the ability to support all the Chrome extensions that you could want not just a few we had in the previous version of our desktop product well we're going to bring extensions to Android so we're using the same chromium based core code on Android very soon as we do on desktop and that's going to be interesting because Google has not allowed its browser extensions onto Chrome for Android and that means there's no a blocking extensions there's no no you block origin on Android for Chrome I was curious also doesn't block ads from Google or Facebook which you know are not content creators they just serve up content that other people create but then the people in companies who actually are content creators do you have their ads blocked you know like the New York Times site or something so why is that we block tracking and scripts that are abused abusive like tracking scripts scripts that are tied into Google's Analytics which are per their privacy policy used for tracking get blocked this has collateral effects it damages first-party ads either they don't perform or they disappear I'll take an example from a fashion site Elcom lle that's a huge ad on that front page takes up half the lower half of the viewport and it's a direct sold ad it's a great ad I've talked to Hearst about this we have no problem with the ad itself but unfortunately Hearst uses Google's ad server to place it they use Google's tag script tags to place it and we block those now we could and we're still working on this with publishers just for a few safe mock-ups of script api's similar to how we do the tipping button on twitter we could restore that that lost functionality to make that ad appear but that ad then is a custom video carousel and it has another tracking partner that's part of the the surveillance capitalism system and we block them too so we'd have to rework that to use our own anonymous confirmation cryptographic protocol and that could be done but again it starts to get you know costly to both us and the publisher so the collateral damage is real and this is not something we like but we're not going to compromise on protecting users here we serve users first even if it means there's some collateral damage to publishers and this is well supported in case law ad blocking has been taken to court especially in Germany but elsewhere and the users right the block has been upheld every time Axel Springer in particular has just thrown money at this in German courts and lost time after time but I'm curious I mean you know we talked about earlier you know you have your own ad platform you strip out the ads that are already on a webpage you replace them or you don't replace them but no replace you have another way huh we don't replace anything in the page we we give users the opportunity to get user ads right see but you have another way of you know showing ads it doesn't that just make you another a middleman the browser's always in the middle this is the insight that I had by living through Mozilla and realizing Firefox had become Google's middleman and why should the browser work for the surveillance superpower instead of for its user if you want the browser to work for you including paying you so you can give back to your creators then you want brave and and nobody's built a system like this it could have been done but that's not how Google evolved they were a search engine so they centralized data collection which is what you do when you build search indexes and then they they bought an ad business and grafted it on they could have done everything we've done in brave the technology is is you know not unknown the research was there on things like zero knowledge proof sand other means for doing anonymity but they didn't we did and we're pioneering a movement now you see among other browsers Apple has always blocked third-party cookies but not necessarily other trackers but now with Apple intelligent trafficking Prevention they are blocking tracking systematically Mozilla has turned on trafficking Prevention finally there was a real struggle to get that on even when I was there we stepped away from blocking tracking three times and so I'm not pointing fingers at anybody I think we were worried about rocking big boats including the search partner Google we were worried about changing the ecosystem in a way that wouldn't make it any better while brave has a better way and we're willing to standardize everything we do so as we work especially in the w3c the World Wide Web Consortium standards body we're working with Apple Mozilla Samsung I would say Microsoft a bit they're there they're trying with their new Chrome based browser chromium based browser to do some kind of tracking protection you're seeing a new normal of privacy by default privacy by design that's turned on to some extent and we turn it up to 11 so that's that's why we're doing what we're doing but you have to realize the browser is not out of the middle position it's very much in the middle position and either it serves the user or it serves Google there's no other way well how so I understand what you're saying there but then at the same time I think if people want to participate in the brave rewards they have to get an up hold wallet and they're very how to participate okay why see right no no they do not know yeah no that's incorrect in order to join brave rewards you do not need to sign up without hold you do not need the KYC the that's it very important because we wanted the system to allow the user with the browser serving the user to direct their revenue share that they get from these anonymous ads back to their favorite YouTube channels and websites and that does not require kyc that's the default mode when you sign up for brand awards you are not told to go sign up with uphold you're not required to do so the only time you have to sign up with uphold is if you want to take out the revenue share for your own purposes to buy you know lunch it's five dollars a month it's not a huge amount a lot of our ecologically minded users want to give it back they don't view it as as important income to them they could take it out but they don't and so the default is for it to flow back to the creator's and that's super important and I think there's been misinformation about this there's been some sort of association of kyc with the basic attention token but that's also false because any three sided market like the ad market which has advertisers publishers and users it's going to require revenue shares and even if you tried to do this on chain with a smart contract the latest guidance from May from last year from FinCEN the Department of the Treasury agency says you need a license as a money services business or a money transmitter so that is why we use uphold we are not in trying to defy any regulators here we want to be compliant unfortunately even with a smart contract with decentralized revenue shares through a smart contract FinCEN and I think the SEC agrees in the ether delta case says if you're doing something that looks like a custodial smart contract the entity that deployed that contract has to have a license so we use uphold and we use anonymity tech and as we migrate on chain we'll have to figure out who's going to deploy the contractor who has the license but this idea that bat requires kyc is false it's a canard and in fact any crypto asset that we use whether it's a stable calling or Bitcoin through this revenue share split that advertising inevitably imposes will require a compliant solution like we use with uphold if the user is to get paid but again our model is not that the user must take the tokens out for their own you know extra change in their pocket it's to give back to the creators and that's what the technologically minded users early on wanted they told us before we even did the Bitcoin prototype they said I never click on a net but I know that there's a cost per impression so called ad model or an ad impression of you like in in Facebook's model two seconds of a quarter of a video player reaching your eyeballs makes it a brand impression on you and somehow there's some money flowing you know fractions of a penny so I want to make up for the damage I do I love brave but I'm I know I'm blocking some cost per impression ads can I give back and that's what the default for bravery Ward's is if you join the ads are enabled they're private and anonymous and the tokens go under your direction back to your creators and you can tip you can set up fixed recurring manual contributions and you can let the rest sort of sweep out through automatic contributions based on in browser analytics of what sites you've been to so basically they'll earn basic attention token from watching ads and then as long as they don't try to cash out the money for themselves they don't have to go through kyc it's only if they if they want to cash out or if they want to add their own funds that's the other direction that the government's regulate so taking money out or adding your own funds in puts you in under anti money laundering a regulation and that's why we use uphold but if you're just participating without adding funds or taking out funds then you're okay and there's no kyc at all all right when you did your IC o---- you sold 36 million dollars worth of that in 24 seconds and I'm quoting your PR person here she said it was to around 210 buyers which may be because she couldn't say specifically 210 means maybe more than 205 but less than 210 so what would you have done differently with the IC o---- so we did it in a period when we had excellent advice from Perkins cuy on the legal front and accounting from Deloitte and we comply with all the relevant laws but the one thing that was out of our hands was etherium and there was no way to do sort of a fair crowd sale on etherium we figured that because gas which is the fee built into aetherium was designed to arbitrate contention the network fairly it would not have exponential growth it would it would scale linearly with the load that we should just use gas to moderate the sale we didn't know how fast the sale will go there was a lot of uncertainty and so we ended up just doing a capped sale and it sold very fast quicker than we thought and other projects looking at that tried to do other things they tried to say well well we write a complex smart contract to you know make the sale more fair or we'll just raise the cap so there's more opportunity for more buyers to get in before the sale ends you saw status and Bank and tezo's all go very big they all had I think troubles about going so big we didn't go big but we had a sale that ended quickly and I actually tweeted a Vitalik a booter in about this and he wrote a nice blog post a month or so later about touken sales and how to make them better on aetherium but it was he was very clear he said you couldn't do much better than the bat sale did right now here are some ideas for improvements but they need more work and so I think we played it safe and did the right thing if we had done something novel to try to make the sale slower or more fair there's a huge risk it would have failed or had a big security bug you may recall there was the parity multisig wallet attack later at late in July I think the 2017 there were a number of serious problems with law and security even after the famous dau attack of 2016 so are we kept our smart contracts very simple we had them audited by three auditors and we avoided any any risk there and had a very fast sale and that was the trade-off is it possible now to use basic attention token without using brave sure it was all as possible the minute the sale is over the token was at on aetherium as an EEOC 20 token and could be used and early on suddenly you mean when you say that do you mean traded or like could could it have been earned well not earn but traded and used to donate back so somebody in Germany I think he was a student or a young young person built an extension for Firefox and Chrome that used basic attention token used our anonymous accounting server to let people buy tokens and send them back it was called bad if I you may evil it may be out there still it only had a couple of dozen users because again without the extra work we do with advertising and anti-fraud we couldn't give out tokens to the bad if I users but this person wanted to create an extension for those who would have their own bat or buy their own bat to give back and so that bad if I extension was a second app and our our ecosystem very early on again I don't think it was going to deal well because making people buy crypto is is a high cost it's a high friction surface and it's not our model we want to give users tokens give them the option on tokens let's say that they can then let flow back to their craters or if they they can sign up and take out they can add their own funds if they if they really don't like ads they can turn off the ads that are part of brave rewards the anonymous brave ads but leave on the anonymous contribution and they can bring their own funds through uphold and let them trickle back to their creators do tipping do manual contributions so we have a lot of flexibility for users but the default has to be something that doesn't require the user to buy crypto because that is just a negative for most people so but did you say that there is not a way to earn that without interacting with brave right now because of the ad deals were doing in the anti-fraud system we're doing you have to use brave but we have on our roadmap for the third phase of bat development building an SDK that can be put in other apps again I mentioned earlier blockchain cannot solve anti-fraud it cannot prove there's a human on the other end of a network blockchain cannot by itself deal with paying a revenue share to users without regulated compliant you know flow of some sort whether it's through a smart contract on chain or through a centralized service like we run or with up hold if you're doing anything that's regulated like that you're going to need need something more than blockchain and so what what is that something well in part it's client software it's what I call endpoint software it's in the brave browser right now but it can be put in a in a defensive software development kit so called SDK really a library with some hardware hardening and defense against tampering and that can be put into other apps and that's on our roadmap and we have other apps browsers games podcast apps that want this because they all are tired of the miserable revenue show they get from ads a lot of them the browser's are beholden to Google for search revenue deals they would love to have their own way of making money in a more direct model like we have in brave so bringing the model we're proving in brave to other apps is on our roadmap but it is not something that you can do overnight because it involves like I said making a defensive library out of our back code and making it fraud proof and then providing it for other apps in a way that they can integrate in the last year we've seen that as you see focus on tokens that meet the four prongs and how we test which is to be an investment contract in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits dependent on a third party so you know if we're talking about how at the moment in order to earn bad you have to use brave do you think that basic attention token could meet the Howey test and if so you know is does that give you any concern no I'm not going to play lawyer I pay enough real bills to them but we have no concerns we complied at the time we did the sale and we've never had any problems and we've been compliant ever since so as the as the guidance changes you have to read it and understand it and I think Kim got in big trouble because they didn't respond to the Dow Bulletin of July like July 2017 they didn't seem to take that into account in their later sale but we have always kept current so we don't have concerns but I'm not going to play lawyer on on your show because I think that would be bad for me and for the listeners and I need to be paying a lot more if I were a lawyer right I think I've never been about money but I'm an engineer by training and I've learned a lot about business over the years and the one thing I do know is to get the best so Perkins cuy has been our a great counsel on this yeah I mean it's not only kick but then you probably saw the recent news about telegram which is apparently in a battle with SEC they did issue a notice where they tried in pretty much every way possible to separate that company from the ton Network and the Grahams cryptocurrency even to the point of saying that ton the ton wallet will not be integrated with the telegram messenger service so you know obviously now you're in this phase where your network is more centralized you know what do you have plans to like speed up your efforts to become more just centralized and and what will it look like when you do become more decentralized well the parts that are very decentralized for us already are the browser pieces even though it's all brave it's open source and we have this bad if I extension which does part of what the end point does in brave and as I say we're working on the SDK but I don't think we're gonna speed up I think we're already in some ways we're grandfathered from the past the problem for telegram or new you know new sales or recent sales is that they they came out after further guidance and clarification and actual frameworks from the regulator's and if they didn't take those into account then there's no sort of ex post facto law protection a retroactive law protection so that's their problem not ours we are diligently working to decentralize in this third Apollo phase we're using the u.s. space program as a trope the bat Apollo phase of our roadmap and we're looking at you know future options on a theory and we're looking at other chains too but we're not looking to change change that we don't have to and you know the the difficulty I think for newer projects is that they have to do things in a different order in order to operate in the US now there is something I will comment on here and that's the u.s. is I think of two minds on crypto you see this most clearly with Libra where there's obviously a confounding variable there's a lot of antipathy towards Facebook which I understand based on their data breaches and their privacy policies and Cambridge analytical but when the government is is very much against Libra and there's there's spillover effects on other crypto when in in contrast in Asia or know in some ways the rest of the world you can do aggressive crypto projects and get uptake quickly the innovation is moving out of the US and this is not an original point like many people have said this over the last few years and I think it's it's it's to the detriment of the u.s. that this this happens I think the regulator's are mostly doing their job which is good but what is their job that's defined by the legislature and the legislature outside of the state of Wyoming seems not to be Pro crypto so can you describe a little bit more what it will look like when it's decentralized is it gonna be the kind of thing where people can use other browsers and earn bad or I don't as I said there's a if we build an SDK and the other browsers put it in then yes if we combine forces that way it will be good because it'll bring advertisers at greater scale they'll have multiple options for compiling their offers into the the catalog that our browser downloads that is the way we avoid tracking on and targeting on ads so getting other browsers onboard is generally good for the ecosystem we want to do that that's for the SDK side for what's on chain and for how you settle well we our whitepaper talked about a revenue split on chain in a smart contract and we need the shield identity with zero knowledge proof and we would per Finn's and we would need to have a regulated entity to deploy that smart contract so there's no simple answer here but it looks more like a side chain maybe a proof of authority side chain which is what we're researching in the bath Apollo project right now it looks like putting our blind signature cryptography or zero knowledge proof on chain in a way that can't be linked to the user but is authentic and can be checked this involves more cryptography than zero knowledge proof and in fact we've we've moved toward blind signatures which you may know through privacy pass we've also because we want to allow advertisers and publishers to check the chain to believe us not to trust us or have an auditor for us or a verified partner check us checking the chain means something like partial homomorphic encryption multi-party computing we're looking at a large crypto toolkit so it's not just blind signatures of ZK piece it's also MPC and Phe and and that that means we're doing advanced cryptography on chain on a side chain probably for throughput and other reasons so that's that's where we're headed with battle Colo but it's it's not set in stone it's experimental and we're bringing up you know basically test running tests and bringing up what might become a side chain test net for this how it looks to the user is they just see more apps with the attention token integrated through the SDK what it looks like the advertiser is they get more reached they can reach all the Firefox users they can reach all the Samsung browser users what it looks like the publishers publishers are already seeing ad blocking rising over the last fifteen or fourteen years since the adblock and about plus broke out as Firefox extensions and they they can't do much about it if it's 30 percent of their monthly uniques they'd love to turn it around that'd be a 43% win but you can't nag adblock users still to whitelist your site or subscribe that generally drives them away so brave is the best option for diligent let's say tracking protection users and a block users for publishers who want to recover some revenue because then they aren't alienating their users by saying go away or turn off your ad blocker or pay us a subscription you're saying hey you're using grave great maybe you have some tokens you can send this here's a premium product you might like to buy one-click buy low-friction no identification now the publishers sometimes say but what about my my need for subscribers with whom I have a credit card an email relationship and we understand that we don't want to reduce that conversion but that conversion is 2 percent or less on those paywalls you're probably seeing a lot of these paywalls now and say hey you've had your three free articles time to pay they have miserable conversion we could actually help improve the conversion by instead of driving users away with a hostile dialogue say hey you've got some back why don't you spend it to buy a few more articles and then hey you've bought a few more articles three times you bought nine articles and you've overpaid compared to a monthly subscription you're better off subscribing how about it at that point we think this description conversion goes up and if we have more browsers with the bad sdk we have more ad buyers for scale funding the user wallets then I think the whole system will perform better and publishers will come around in in bulk but again when you when you still build a system like brave you're you're gonna have to pick your first constituency and ours is the user so publishers have to follow and I think they are that's why we have the working relationship with Dow Jones Media Group and other publishers who signed up that you see at batduck growth so based on the number of ether skin while it's in the number of fav wallets at least a recent report said that only 4% of rave browsers monthly active users are using that so yeah that's an error because they don't they don't look at upholds wallet architecture as I say we use uphold not only as a money services business for regulatory reasons but they provide a member to member off chain sending capability as a percentage then so we have over thirteen percent of our users opted in to brave rewards and so that's and what percentage of those are paying that's over 1.4 million users well the default is that they they get ad revenue and it trickles back to their publishers so almost all of them very few of them turn off ads we actually don't be concerned privacy browser we don't have detailed telemetry on our users we don't want to track our users if we took too many bits of information from our users we could form a tracking identifier or a fingerprint so what we know are certain you know very few bit answers to questions that we do measure and we haven't studied that closely but most users just stick with the defaults this is a rule in all apps certainly in browsers that if you pick the right defaults the user stick with them this is why Google search is the default for Firefox if you made it Yahoo search which they did people would override it back to Google so our default for brave rewards is that it goes back the ad revenue comes to the user but they let it trickle back to their site so apart from the the fee we take that that's all going back to the creator's so then what if if I'm a publisher based on like if I were to compare how much I'm losing from the ad blocker on brave versus how much I'm earning from the 13 percent of users who who pay publishers then am I'm back in the black that's a great question it requires a case study with a publisher which were working you can't generalize the numbers easily because there are a lot of black boxes here not only the publishers business which is their business it's not public generally how much they're making off their users but also there's Google in the mix which we block so we we don't know the opportunity cost of blocking but users have the right to block so the user is gonna block anyway what brave represents is a positive sum game found money a good day compared to just blocking pure blocking is just a negative for the publisher with brave there's tokens trickling back and we're driving that 13 percent up when we had brave rewards in the desktop only we had 40% opt-in as we brought it to mobile because mobile is more challenging smaller viewport you know one app at a time we had the opt-in go down but we're gonna drive it back up and so the 13% is blended so the opt-in on desktop is higher I would also add desktop users or more valuable people say you know mobile kill desktop it's not true desktop is immortal it's a large part of Google's business it's still important even to Facebook which is definitely a mobile-first company so you look at people who are high value consumers and even producers they use a big screen laptop that you have you even a desktop at home they use smartphones and they use them all brave is an opportunity to reach them on all their devices in a private way and in fact we can do things that are illegal under the European data protection laws like cross device attribution where you're researching a major purchase like a car on your home big screen and then you go on the go and you see a car you like and you look it up on your smart phone tracking ad tech tries to look at this journey because it's a very valuable thing to follow and if you get the user close to buy you can tilt them with a discount or a brand they hadn't heard of to buy differently but it's totally surveillance with brave it can all be done on your device if you use our private sync system it's encrypted with a key only you have and so each browsers machine-learning agent can study the sum of all your data that's privately encrypted and shared across your devices that we're building out that's not there yet but that's that's just an idea uh that gives you an idea of how much we can do by using this private approach that Google and the big tracking companies have trouble doing because of not only laws but things like cookies not working well on mobile so we have a solution we think is actually more accurate than complete it's more private by the sign it's user first so we we touched on some of the things that you're working on for this year what else does rave have planned for 2020 so that the bat Apollo work is important adding crypto assets of different kinds that I mentioned is important we we don't want to force users to use crypto and say a lot of users don't really want to jump into the deep end of the crypto pool but there are users a brave who do have crypto and want to spend it not not really Bitcoin which they're huddling but stable coins or other assets and and that we want to add so we have the ability with our scale to bring crypto to a level of use that you don't see outside of Korea where if you have millions of brave users opted in which i think is a reasonable number over the next six months they can not only use the basic attention token they can if they have other crypto assets or if they want to trade bat through uphold or other partners we can add they will be able to use stable coins they'll be able to use whatever crypto asset they want and will have the the infrastructure for them to do so this this is not just about advertising this goes to e-commerce this can help merchants who suffer from the high cost of chargebacks credit card fraud which is a concealed cost on the merchant it's it's also by the way going to get rid of the interchange charge which with credit cards is like 2% so crypto is important for we think ecommerce and we can make it safe and secure in the browser one of the things Netscape did that mosaic pioneer but Netscape really brought to fruition with secure sockets HTTPS and with the ability to do secure connections is normalizing doing business on the web and unfortunately we didn't have Bitcoin then we didn't have block but now we do so we think payments should be completely frictionless if you have crypto assets we can even match make through an exchange you could have a local buying wizard in the browser that's helping you do the best exchange options if you have to matchmake between an asset you have an a digital asset the merchant wants there's so much to do here that could be automated and could just work beautifully for the user and the merchant and get all the intermediaries who are taking their you know cuts while they tolerate fraud out of the picture so what we're doing at scale with ads also applies to transactional models ecommerce and this is good for the merchants they aren't just commodified in Amazon and then replaced by ripoff artists it's good for the brands who have a direct relationship with our user ads in the notification and a tab with their users their fans so we want to build up not just ads but long-lived brand engagement channels if I get a brave Ally like I sometimes leave that tab around and I use it to interact I may even go so far as to buy through that tab so it becomes an e-commerce opportunity for the advertiser we're all about direct relationships getting rid of the indirection in the current system which evolved opportunistically based on low level things like the cookie the image and JavaScript if we can make direct connections authentic and low fraud and frictionless I think everybody does better it's a rising tide it's a positive sum game even ads are better but if you don't like ads you can bring your own funds and you'd have fewer fees taken out in the middle and you have much less fraud where can people learn more about you and brave so brave calm is the big site and at brave on Twitter basic attention token org is the project page and we still mirror blogs and we do some custom work there especially around research but yeah I'm active on Twitter and we're very approachable one of the things I learned that Silicon Graphics in my youth was engineers doing customer support is a good idea that's what Jim Clark had us do so I would sit on the helpdesk day a month and so we are very respond of across the org you can reach engineers you can reach product people you can reach everybody a brave who has a Twitter account and they're pretty responsive and this is huge for early adopters because with Google Chrome or with Apple Safari you just get no dial tone they're just they're not going to talk to you but there are always bugs they're always peculiar things that happen with software so we're there to help great well thanks for coming on Unchained it's my pleasure
