topic is the US Crackdown on crypto here to discuss are Brian quinten's Head of policy for a16c crypto and Nick Carter General partner at Castle Island Adventures welcome Brian and Nick thanks a lot thank you in recent months the US government has been cracking down on the crypto industry in a number of ways let's start with what appears to be the first inkling of a more coordinated effort which Nick I believe you dubbed operation choke point 2.0 and you first identified this in a pirate wires article and I was wondering if he could explain what operation choke point 2.0 is and what evidence you have that this is actually happening sure so the name obviously is a callback to choke point it was just called operation choke point which was actually the official government name which was uh took place from about 2012 to 2017 with varying degrees of intensity and it was a attempt to basically marginalize certain industries in the US by persuading the banks not to do business with them and uh the primary agencies that were responsible for this was the FDIC in conjunction with the doj and the OCC was involved for a lesser extent and the primary targets were just politically unfavored Industries so payday lending I would say is the number one target of choke point 1.0 and some other industries were also targeted like Firearms manufacturing and basically the objective was to marginalize those Industries not through Congress or any sort of formal process but by having the bank Regulators tell the banks that there was reputational risk in serving those Industries and that was the problem was that it wasn't really done through legal means it was done by insinuation and by casting aspersions against the industry and suggesting to the banks that they would face reputational risks and more onerous oversight if they banked them and it was pretty successful now 2.0 is similar uh I would say it's more explicit actually it's less subtle it's less under the table it's more overt it's in plain sight for the most part and the target is the crypto space so of course there's a lot to discuss for regulatory perspective with regards to crypto so of course this yes you see in the cftc and there's all of those undertakings but the primary thing that I'm calling choke point 2.0 is happening through bank regulation and it is coordinated for sure uh it concerns the fed the OCC and the FDIC and also the administration itself and uh the evidence that I started to see really became clear in January our portfolio companies reported to us they're having trouble with their banking certain Bank Executives I talked to indicated to me that they were facing more onerous data requests from their Regulators of course we saw what happened to silvergate and signature those aren't evidence on their face but certainly the circumstances of signatures uh receivership were suspicious given that it's probably the first fully solvent bank that was put into receivership in the US and this is a large bank so it's a you know lots of suspicions around that including what Barney Frank had to say but I would say the evidence is simply the fact that starting in January really all these agencies started saying the same time that Banks serving the crypto space was a threat to the safety and soundness of these Banks we now know over and above that that the FED in the FDIC have been pressuring Banks not to do business with the crypto space and I'm sure more evidence will come out in time but I'd say the totality of the evidence you can also point to the disapproval of custodia's license and the troubled state of the federally chartered crypto institutions uh like protego I think the totality of the evidence suggests very clearly now that there is a coordinated cross-agency attempt to really limit the ability of the crypto industry to obtain banking in the US and so that's why I call it choke point 2.0 and earlier when you said that your portfolio companies were saying they had trouble with their Banks how do you define that well um you know obviously when startups raise Capital they need to one of the first things you do is just got a bank relationship and that should be trivial right it any legal business in the US should not have trouble obtaining banking but the reality today is there's only a handful of banks that service crypto firms the ones that do face higher costs for doing that if they're perceived to be crypto friendly Banks and so it's not worth it for them to take on smaller clients for the most part additionally Banks face these de facto limits on how many deposits they can take on uh there's these informal thresholds that are now messaged to banks in the kind of 10 15 range so today post silvergate and signature collapses no Bank can be an explicitly holy crypto Bank the banks that are doing business with the crypto space have these effective limits of deposits that they can take so basically if you're a crypto company you go to any of these banks that are known to service crypto you'll still have trouble persuading them to take you on as a client a lot of banks just have a straight up ban on crypto they'll just say we literally don't service businesses that do crypto stuff and the banks that do are pretty averse to giving you actual Merchant accounts so if you think of an exchange where you're processing transactions on behalf of your clients wires in and out that is sort of the more full service type banking engagement that is extremely hard to get today so if you're a crypto firm you go to a bank you ask for an account they may give you an operating account basically just for cash management but going for the Fuller merchant account that's extraordinarily difficult today and that's that's the unfortunate reality and Brian what have you been hearing from the a16z portfolio companies in terms of their banking relationships uh yeah thanks Laura so I I I can't speak to any one specific company but generally we have seen Port codes being debanked that said uh so far all of our Port codes have found banking partners but it highlights I think the importance of smaller and Regional banks in the U.S startup ecosystem there needs to be Banks and institutions that service that industry and that know that business model generally thinking about this you know from a first principles you know standpoint you know banks are in the business of accepting risk and managing risk and Banks manage risk from like the unique characteristics of the customer in the industry and crypto is no different crypto businesses can pose risk to Banks but they have tools to manage those risks just like they have tools to manage risks of other types of Industries and other specific types of companies especially when it comes to diversification across very large balance sheets again even maybe stepping higher than that above the banking sector the regulation of banks is supposed to be an objective partially subjective but objective safety and soundness practice it is not supposed to be a policy vehicle for Value judgments or for ideology to express its viewpoint and we have a system in the United States where political accountability is supposed to be built in to policy decisions and when you start getting into more of the you know regulatory apparatus of Independent Bank agencies that really starts to go away pretty quickly and so you know there do appear to be a lot of questions I think Nick raised a lot of strong evidence there appears to be a lot of smoke and I think the American public and certainly the crypto industry deserve answers to those questions yeah and just to fill in some of the details that I heard from another source who has experience in both tradfy and crypto I'll just call this person X they said of their experience working at a crypto company we were told by a bank no guns no cannabis no crypto based on the direction they had received from their regulators and X also and this kind of fills out something that Nick mentioned said that some things are required to file cras which are crypto related activity reports monthly and then drawing on X's traffic experience they said I know how it works I've been in the room with the OCC when they squeeze Banks they have very punitive tools stress tests for the globally systemic important Banks G Subs these include qualitative and quantitative tests they will require incremental Staffing reporting etc for for instance banks that continue to service crypto companies and so one example would be like they would force that thing to have a higher minimum of regulatory Capital per unit of you know like crypto industry deposits or like exposure to crypto and then so their assessment was if it's a new industry and has limited Revenue they will kill you with overhead to make it very unprofitable you know for instance like requiring these cras and um then they noted that uh this is kind of being incorporated into the Basel requirements which are you know big requirements on Banks and they sent me a link which which I can include in the show notes but I kind of took a look and from my understanding um there's like what they call group one Assets in group two and group one is tokenized real world assets or um kind of more conservative stable coins and then group two is um all are the cryptos and then sort of like riskier stable coins and group two obviously has like much more onerous if you have more exposure to that then that has more honors requirements you know this person's assessment was if you're a senior Banker you spend most of your time trying to optimize regulatory capital and return some regulatory capital for crypto they punish you by making reg cap very expensive so and then you know like Nick's said they added of course then it's harder you even if you get a bank account you it would be super hard to get things like a loan yeah I don't know if you wanted to add on that but I just wanted to you know because it is a leap to like say okay this is happening I mean we can sort of see this trend but now you know just the more voices that we have on this I feel the more it kind of fills out the picture well yeah I mean I think I think I think to put a finer point on that and I I think this is accurate I haven't looked at it for a little while but I think the Basel committee came out with a 1250 risk weighting for crypto assets which that was the category too which added you know an eight percent Capital you know requirement equates to a a dollar for dead equates to a hundred percent Capital requirement so equates to holding dollar for dollar against you know any type of crypto asset so banks are a business right they don't do things for free um they they do have to maximize regulatory capital and I I I have always felt that you know some of the seeds to the next financial crisis are laid in the regulatory you know constraints the of the present day um and how that creates you know management issues uh incentives uh that steer activity towards the most advantaged uh regulatory products and that's where all of the interest goes and then you leave things that have massive potential Innovation benefit uh behind yeah I'll just add to that I mean the Red Cap question that's a very explicit way of raising the cost but frankly most banks don't want to hold crypto directly I mean a lot of what we're talking about is simply Banks doing business with from a Fiat perspective with firms that touch blockchains or their software providers for the crypto space and there's implicit costs there so certainly what bank executives are telling me on a widespread basis is if you are engaging with crypto depositors you just fundamentally face more scrutiny higher demands for more stepped up AML kyc requirements and more frequent and burdensome data requests so it's my understanding now that the fdicd does make these crypto specific data requests on an ongoing basis with the began in about Q4 of last year so if you think about it if you're a smallish bank and you're not exclusively focused on crypto which is the case today there's no banks left that really have cryptos their sole per view it becomes very costly to have sort of 10 or 15 of your book be crypto related because you have a higher fixed cost you're considered you know that you're considered to be sort of a higher risk institution you're facing a higher risk industry and those costs are almost not worth it at that point because the revenue you're earning from crypto if it's a smaller share of your depositor base is less so it's kind of a bit of a catch-22 I know the FED says they don't really want Banks to have depository bases that are correlated but if you're a smallish bank and you only have 10 15 of your deposits that pertain to the crypto industry the costs almost become not worth it so it's a bit of a catch-22 the combination of those two things yeah that's an important Point Nick you know there's a lot of soft power an immense amount of soft power that a bank examiner or the bank regulatory Community has you know through things like paperwork requirements um all of a sudden and I've heard this directly from a you know a senior executive at a globally systemic important Institution that if they were to take on any crypto business the sheer amount of paperwork that they would have to complete just does not make it worth their Department's time so there are ways to not prohibit it but effectively you know disincentivize it to the point where it is you know uh no longer uh ex you know uh bankable yeah and so a lot of these things are um yeah just different ways to kind of pressure Banks to not deal with crypto companies um but I did want to also highlight something from the National Economic Council statement back in from January 27th which says quote legislation should not green light mainstream institutions like Pension funds to dive headlong into cryptocurrency markets in the past year traditional financial institutions limited exposure to cryptocurrencies has prevented turmoil and cryptocurrencies from infecting the broader Financial system it would be a grave mistake to enact legislation that reverses core and deepens the ties between cryptocurrencies and the broader Financial system so you know between what we've been discussing like some of that is sort of behind the scenes and then this part is just sort of explicitly being like don't do it so there's so many directions we could go from here um well Laura I mean you know I mean let me just chime in there I mean I was at the cftc in March of 2020 when there was a massive dislocation in the treasury markets supposedly the you know most you know deepest and and most liquid markets in the world with the most you know secure supposedly risk-free asset and at the same time the price of oil in the Futures Market went negative so you know we do live in a world where volatility exists and it expresses itself um in a number of ways in a number of different products and venues and the point cannot be to eliminate risk from the financial system because then you eliminate the financial system and people can answer for themselves whether or not that's their true goal but the point is to appropriately manage risk within the financial system through the tools that we have that have come to evolve yeah and if I may add prior to the current banking crisis there were a lot of statements from various Regulators that to similar to the NEC statement there that they wanted to insulate the traditional Financial system from the purported risks of the crypto space but if you look at the ultimate causes of the bank crisis that we're now experiencing crypto is not the Cause right there had been worries that perhaps stable coins would perturb the treasury market if there was a run on a stable coin all the treasuries were sold off that was one of the worries there were also worries that there was concentration in the banks that focus on crypto and that that might cause a financial crisis but really from my perspective the ultimate cause is simply whipsawing interest rates interest rates that Rose really quickly and cause the value of the assets that the bank's conventional Banks were holding to fall and then combined with some of the liquidity risks that for instance we saw with svb with the flighty depositors but this is like a global problem it's not confined to crypto the banks that are now imperiled Credit Suisse didn't have anything to do with crypto for instance um svb had as far as I can tell one crypto client so the ultimate cause of this ban crisis is not a crypto thing but the regulator sure gave it a lot of air time the idea that the risks from crypto could somehow infect the traditional Financial system but that's not where I would sort of apportion the the blame for this current crisis I I agree with that Nick I mean like look the banking system exists solely because of of confidence in it right if everyone rushes to a bank and withdraws their money the fractional Reserve banking system cannot survive um which is why you have a regulatory structure designed to prevent Bank runs and ensure confidence and it was no accident I think that as silvergate was running into difficulties and sold through you know their treasury you know security portfolios and took on a huge loss now I think we can debate whether or not that was actually the best decision as opposed to doing something else with it like going through repo but you know in realizing that loss it's probably crystallized in a lot of people's minds well geez if it can happen to that bank and they have to sell Securities and they're going to take huge losses where else could that could that happen point of Regulation is to prevent panics uh and unfortunately Regulators acted you know uh after that Panic had occurred so silvergate received a 4.3 billion dollar loan from the federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco for reasons unknown they decided to pay it back in full just days before it shut down and I think you guys probably saw that article in coindesk where a spokesperson for severgate told coindesk fhl Bank San Francisco did not request or compel silvergate Bank to prepay its outstanding advances silvergate made their determination to prepay their outstanding advances based on their own assessment of their position so this is confounding to me what do you think happened there did silvergate make a mistake in their risk assessment which then caused them to shut down just a few days later or do you think they're kind of hiding what happened about being you know having to pay it back or what do you think happened there I I mean you're right to zero in on this this is one of the two main catalysts for the dissolution of silvergate and there's enormous open questions there so the you know the fhlb denied that they explicitly compelled silvergate to repay the loan but it's absolutely the case that there is a very active political pressure campaign against the fhlb when it became clear that silvergate was using that facility to honor their withdrawals so it would not surprise me if silvergate was considering that and realizing that they perhaps could be imminently cut off from that facility it was also a short-term rolling facility so um you know a non-renewable non-renewals tend to amount to forcing them to pay back the loans but you're right because that is that was a decision that basically precipitated their their liquidation and so a bank doesn't just commit suicide like that so I think there's still enormous open questions as to what specifically happened there and whether the political pressure that the fhlb was getting contributed in any way to that uh to the paying back of the loan I think I would just say what I had said before which is look there are a lot of questions here the longer those questions go unanswered the longer a lack of confidence is going to remain in uh both either the either the motivations of the parties involved or um in the uh the solvency of of any individual institution if you're you know just just a retail participant and um reading the front page headlines I mean the one thing I would say about silvergate and this also applies to Silicon Valley is I think that the you know what happened with both of those things demonstrates how important it is to diversify your clientele um because you know if an industry gets affected in one way or another or or there might be similar behaviors or characteristics among that clientele which would you know expose you to more risk so that's just one thing but it I don't think it's necessarily it doesn't have to do with what we just said so much as just a general you know banking uh best practices type of comment um but I also wanted to talk about signature because that was another one that is very confusing because obviously First Republic was in a worse situation but that one was able to get saved and you know with signature it sort of seemed to be preemptively closed and I know Nick you've talked at length about what you think that irregularities are there actually one thing that I do want to note for people who listen to the show with Caitlyn long and Milton is that melt into mirrors is that I was not aware of this at the time we recorded it turns out technically it is legal for the regulate for the New York Department of Financial Services to and put a bank into receivership if they feel that they're not getting good data um which is interesting to me it doesn't seem like that should be possible um in in my personal opinion um but I did want to correct that fact there because I I it didn't occur to me that actually was legal because it just sounds like it shouldn't be legal um but Nick can you elaborate a little bit on what the irregulators were with signature sure yeah you're right the New York banking law is extremely broad with the set of conditions that would render it permissible for DFS to put a bank into receivership and that is one um so so DFS noted a crisis of confidence and Leadership and insufficient data as their primary justifications for putting them into receivership I think that that situation needs to be looked into absolutely because if Barney Frank who's on the board a signature of his allegations are true then it's very unusual to have a solvent Bank put into receivership I'm not sure I could name another example in U.S history when that's happened uh the timing is Odd as well svb was closed on Friday afternoon signature wasn't until Sunday night typically it's done on Friday and then there's the weekend for the FDIC to try and Shop the assets or arrange an acquisition to basically close in orderly fashion that didn't occur in this case you have Barney Frank's allegations and then frankly you have the treatment of the crypto deposits at signature where ultimately the buyer of signature did not assume either Signet which is their Fiat settlement Network which was the biggest of the two between Sun and Signet then they did not assume the crypto deposits the crypto deposits were the FDIC told crypto depositors and by cryptoposits I mean Fiat deposits of crypto firms or clients of signature the FDIC told them to withdraw the remaining 4 billion so that portion of their business which was a very material part of signatures business was ultimately not included in the sale uh to NYCB I believe it is so you know that's an open question like you know in one day this is a crypto focused bank or at least crypto is a meaningful portion of their business and then they're put into receivership and then through the acquisition the assets that are sold include no crypto element whatsoever so if you wanted to ascribe um an anti-crypto motive to the receivership that point of evidence would strongly support that conclusion I think so um um this um as being something that appears to be coordinated at least in the banking sector but at the same time that all this is going on we are seeing enforcement actions from the SEC against for instance Kraken and coinbase and then cftc obviously had its charges against finance and so when you see kind of what's Happening across these different agencies I wondered if you thought that this was a generally coordinated Crackdown on crypto across government agencies because you know it sort of looks like that from the outside based on the timing but then I also see people joking or surmising that government agencies either don't really cooperate with each other or don't do so effectively you know people point out how the SEC and the cftc are sort of at odds over whether or not cryptos or Securities or Commodities and Brian I wanted to get your opinion on this since you used to work in the government you know what's your take like is that a conspiracy theory to think that this is a coordinated Crackdown or is that plausible so um right Laura I was a commissioner at the cftc from 2017 through 2021 and uh I was there when the Futures contracts on bitcoin and eth were listed on cftc registered only uh exchanges and um they are still listed on cftc only registered exchanges so the status of those products is um at this point I think you know it it's not it's not necessarily in doubt if the SEC views any product as a security then they can take actions um to you know overtly declare that they can ensure that those contracts are taken down from cftc registered exchanges you know they can file actions uh against um uh individuals trading those contracts so none of that has happened so despite a lot of the language that we're hearing that is appears to be creating deliberate vagueness to me the status of those two products is Crystal Clear in terms of your uh your question around you know a deliberative a deliberate coordinated approach maybe I'm I'm biased from working with the cftc but I see a very strong distinction between apart from the timing which I I I don't know what to make of um but I see a very strong distinction between the cftc's case against finance and um the settlement against Kraken as well as the uh seven line Wells notice that was submitted to to by the SEC uh to uh to coinbase you know the cftc's complaint stretches back three and a half four years it has very detailed text messages recordings um other kinds of documentation transcripts around conversations that really seem to allege a deliberate attempt to evade U.S laws while also showing in overt attempt to cater to U.S customers you know for a platform that had Direct compliance obligations especially in the derivatives markets I mean the derivatives laws are very clear you know this is this is not you know a subjective how we test uh where people can go and you know take one prong and then wave it around and say everything's a security and the derivative laws are very clear about what derivatives are and that if they are offered to U.S customers there are certain registration obligations that have to be followed those were not followed in this instance and they also then created BSA obligations Bank secrecy act obligations on finance.com which again according to the facts that were alleged they knew about and deliberately uh tried to work around so this this this feels like a a very very strong and clear case that the agency has brought and I think you know from from from our perspective you know and I I I know you know Nick agrees with this in terms of someone that's been so vocal about the potential of of this technology we believe in in the world computer aspect of this Innovation not the World Casino aspect of this Innovation unfortunately it's been hyper financialized and I think you can see that also in some of the examples shown in the binance case alleged in the binance case binance offered 125 times Leverage on some of their products that wouldn't be allowed anywhere in the U.S derivatives markets no matter basically what you're trading on and they also had uh you know games and contests where you know Traders could compete over the course of one minute to see who you know made more or lost less uh in derivative Market transactions I mean this this is not with this technology in this Innovation was meant to achieve this was someone looking at it from uh the most financialized aspect possible and uh unfortunately creating a bad name uh for for the ecosystem yeah or like gamified it feels like like video game type stuff like leaderboard type stuff so yeah yeah absolutely um you know and so I think that there is a completely different promise um to this technology and um I think the sooner we get back to that by um ensuring that exchanges uh that are Fiat on and off ramps um into this ecosystem are complying and I think coinbase is a great actor in this ecosystem they spend a tremendous amount of time and resources uh on compliance they're a publicly traded company and again to me in my mind you know a vague Well's notice issued by the SEC that could portend to some kind of enforcement action to them stands in complete contrast to the very detailed and clear case that the cftc is bringing against binance so in a moment I would like to ask you a follow-up question but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible join over 50 million people using crypto.com one of the easiest

conversation with Brian and Nick so if we were to leave aside the cftc case against Finance which you're right it's 70 pages and um there's quite a number of damning text messages and other things in there um you know when you look at least at the other actions we talked about the SEC and then operation choke point some of these statements from the administration does that look coordinated across agencies to you so the intent or possible outcome of that activity looks very similar and I think you know it's reasonable to ask yourself uh or anyone to ask themselves or to ask you know the SEC why has there not been updated guidance in this ecosystem for the last four years when Legacy rules cannot fit the way this technology works and do not apply uh and whose underlying rationale you know aren't aren't applicable to the motivations of anyone that are is is purchasing a number of these uh a number of these tokens or the way that a lot of the software is being constructed you know it it's reasonable to take the view that if you know uh if no new guidance is being issued uh and only enforcement is being used is the only tool to address the space to go after the space and express a view that is not clear you know is that that is that really appropriate I mean is that is that what the Securities laws were meant to do and I think that they're a lot again there are a lot of questions there I think there will be um a lot of questions about that uh in Congress um and I don't know the quality of the answers that we should expect I think what that does mean is that it it's it's an extra motivation for Congress and I think it's a strong one and I think they're hearing it that the solution lies with them uh on on on how to construct something new that does respect this technology that does respect consumer protection you know that brings a lot of the aspects here into a regulatory fold that is designed appropriately calibrated thoughtfully um and and I'm and I'm hopeful uh that that we'll see that and I I'm here I'm hearing positive things about that yeah no I'm broadly aligned with Brian's thinking on this frankly I think the SEC it it's been clear what their objective and agenda is with regards to the crypto industry for years now so I don't see any necessary change or discontinuity there they have maybe become more aggressive recently but this it seems like the ordinary course of business for them on the banking front I'd certainly see coordination um so I wouldn't necessarily tie the actions of the fed the ftic and the OCC to those of the cftc and the SEC on the making front I do see a sea change starting with the collapse of FTX where I believe the bank regulators decided that they needed to use the tools at their disposal to start to limit the access of crypto firms to the traditional banking sector and certainly when you see an interagency statement covering the fed the OCC and the FDIC that obviously implies a degree of coordination and when you have the National Economic Council releasing a statement on the same day as the custodial denial for instance that clearly implies some coordination um I actually don't think it's the Biden administration's sort of top or even top five priority to marginalize the crypto space but I do believe that now that Congress is somewhat hamstrung or at least divided between the two parties the financial Regulators especially banking supervisors realize that there'd likely not be congressional action to stymie crypto for the remaining two years of Biden's term and I believe that post FTX they effectively decided to take it upon themselves to limit the reach of the crypto space and certainly limits limited some ability to uh Chronicle in fact the traditional banking system so yeah no doubt in my mind that um at least with what's called choke point 2.0 that is being coordinated on a cross-agency basis yeah so two other um notes on this that I want to uh point out are coindesk came out with an editorial saying that it looked like there was a an attack on crypto by the government um and then Cooper and Kirk which is a law firm that had um I think sued the government over the first operation choke point did release a white paper kind of collating a lot of the information they had and saying that this was an operation checkpoint 2.0 directed against the crypto industry one thing before we move on to what I really feel is quite possibly the biggest outcome here which I think is more in the geopolitical realm is uh you know let me summarize a little bit what I think you guys are saying and then we can talk about it um it's that um you feel that there needs to be smarter uh either legislation or guidance from the agencies rather than sort of cryptic enforcement actions um or punitive ones that that don't kind of allow people to follow any rules because there aren't these rules in the first place but that some of these actions are legitimate for instance maybe the one that the cftc is bringing against binance um and that some of this also is potentially like an overreaction against FTX is that a good summary of of your thoughts there yeah I just I guess I might just add a little bit more more to that which is that um the lack of clarity here forces good actors that are intent on on trying to comply with with some vague standard to be ultra conservative which then highly advantages you know overseas activity that is not necessarily you know motivated that way uh it could be adversarially motivated and really disadvantages the development of that ecosystem here the best way to to to disincentivize illicit activity abroad is to have a a robust ecosystem here in the United States and I think that goes for the derivatives markets too I mean we have the most liquid most transparent most robust derivatives markets here in the US and I don't think it's a coincidence that we also have you know the strongest economy usually in the world we only have two derivative products that trade because of the lack of clarity of the status of these tokens we have derivative contracts on eth and we have derived contracts on bitcoin if you want to trade any other derivatives contracts use them for risk management purposes which is the you know the foundation of the derivatives markets you have to go overseas right so the way that you develop um uh more incentives to stay here and more disincentives for those operating illicitly abroad is to provide the clarity which has so far been missing I agree I think we could certainly do with more clarity regarding spot Market regulation and just who oversees the markets and the framework there and of course on the Securities front we have no framework whatsoever for how for a common sense disclosure regime for instance for token issuers and I don't believe that the Legacy Securities regulation that we have here is fit for purpose so much work to be done there and I think that's in the hands of Congress on the banking front it's slightly different I mean I think we basically have a violation of due process um I would say it's primarily a fifth amendment issue where you know these Regulators are taken upon themselves to determine who the banks can and cannot deal with that's a vast overage that's not their mandate their mandate is to ensure the soundness of these Banks uh it's not to pick and choose what industries they can serve so I consider that a significant overreach and of course the net effect of that and the prior thing is that crypto firms are increasingly looking abroad for new homes or they're looking for more crypto native Solutions so instead of holding the funds of the bank maybe having their balance sheet in stable coin format so I think the US benefits from being the world's home for Securities markets the US is something like 25 of global GDP but 40 of global public Equity capitalization and that's been a huge benefit to this country historically uh so I do think they'd be squandering that that Advantage as they continue down this path and discourage crypto firms from domiciling themselves here between the outright hostility that we're seeing on the banking front and then um either the lack of guidance or a right hostility you could call it from the CC all of this basically makes it difficult for entrepreneurs in the US and I wondered if you felt that the government was taking these actions almost because uh crypto could pose a threat to the US dollar or to the U.S financial systems and if so um you know how you thought that would play out as the technology develops and you know if this trend continues of entrepreneurs moving offshore I mean I certainly don't believe for myself I don't believe crypto is a threat to the dollar at all I mean what we actually see in the crypto space is the dollarization of the crypto industry so initially you know Bitcoin was the sort of medium of exchange and unit of account and crypto and increasingly became dollar raised the collateral and smart contracts is primarily dollars right I mean when you have a contract that has some long duration you want it to be denominated in dollars you don't want to take on the exchange risk so stable coins have infected the crypto space not in a pejorative way but they are increasingly the dominant collateral type and medium of Exchange in crypto there's more value settled in stable coins than there is in Bitcoin or ether stable coins of a higher velocity than those crypto assets and 99 plus of all stable coins globally use the dollar as your as their unit of account that's far far more than the dollar share of international trade or of uh foreign exchange reserves right so the other thing is of course crypto is a vector for proliferating the usage of the dollar globally it's a way to get people effectively U.S bank accounts in places where they would never have that access otherwise right so you know it spreads the property rights associated with the US dollar banking system globally and I think that has a huge welfare benefit to people in Emerging Markets with unstable currencies and of course if you look at the data you see the place is the highest adoption of crypto are southeast Asia West Africa Eastern Europe Latin America in certain places you have weak property rights poor governance not a lot of rule of law necessarily and maybe a banking system it can't be trusted those are the hot spots of crypto adoption so that tracks with this idea that the exported property rights is part of the appeal so I think there's you know tremendous opportunity to embrace the notion of a stable coin which is just taking the assurances we have of physical cash and digitizing it but there's so much opposition to that in this country in January one of the things that really made me set up was the FED basically said we don't want Banks issuing stable coins on public blockchains they effectively banned that but it'd be better if banks could be the ones issuing stable coins as opposed to just you know private firms it's unclear now what that pathway is going to be to take the existing stable coins and make them even more credible and give holders even better assurances uh the you know various trust companies that issue stable coins are sort of imperiled so I think it's very clear that stable coins especially dollar based stable coins are one of the key products that the crypto Industries is creating one of the key killer apps of the space and there is certainly a risk that the crypto space um you know becomes dominated by some other Sovereign Fiat like Euros or you know whatever it is um so that would be a tremendous shame if you lost that Advantage yeah and just one comment I'd like to make on that is that one thing that surprised me so much when I wrote my book was that when I was interviewing people who were European or Asian or whatever they would always quote the price of Bitcoin or ether to me in dollars no matter what their home currency was nobody ever quoted it in their actual currency and these were by and large foreigners and that was just something that struck me it was very fascinating um but you know just from that alone you know I interviewed like more than 200 people from my book just from that alone like it definitely felt like yes it's getting all these people who don't live in dollars to think in dollars and transact in dollars which was fascinating if you reduce the friction in foreign exchange markets and now people can go to their exchange as opposed to using some sort of you know Western Union or MoneyGram or something or you know a lot of these people literally have no ability to hold dollars in any other format they certainly don't have access to PayPal or venmo then the dominant currency actually grows it's market share that's what we've seen empirically not to mention the fact that the US does need new buyers of treasuries foreign central banks are divesting treasuries there's a lot of net sellers of treasuries out there every time you buy a stable coin from one of the credible issuers that ends up being expressed in the form of Treasury exposure so there's also that angle as there's 130 billion dollars give or take worth of treasuries that are now being held by these stable coin issuers that's also a benefit I would point to yeah I mean I think Nick put it so well and I think to summarize that I see a lot of deep thinking that reflects the benefits of crypto and stable coins to the dollar and I do not see a lot of deep thinking or analysis that reflects the threat that crypto and stable coins can have to the dollar so is it possible people have those views yes it is I haven't necessarily seen a very strong rationale for why they hold those views but you know they do seem to be prolific within the central bank ecosystem one of the Steelman cases maybe against stable coins is the US loses the ability to pursue sanctions but I just don't think that's true right so if you were to encourage a network of onshore stablecoin issuers all stablecoin insurers still have the ability to determine who is using the network um especially with regards to Creation Redemption they have the ability to freeze tokens on the network so it's not like you're just you know throwing the currency of the wolves and creating this totally anarchic system I mean the stable coin issuers still have discretion over who's using the network so I think you retain your sanctions making ability if that is the objection to stable coins if you discourage the growth of the onshore stablecoin market you empower the less accountable sort of crypto euro dollar stablecoin issuers that are not doing it onshore so tether has been a huge beneficiary of all the recent uh events in the crypto space as people have basically started to realize that there might be some risks just staying onshore uh of course usdc was affected to a certain degree by the spb issues and a lot of folks have shuffled around their balance sheets and now are holding tethers instead that can't possibly be something that the financial establishment the US is happy about I mean tether is completely unaccountable to them so if you discourage local stablecoin issuance people still want stable coins I'll just do it with a less transparent and less accountable entity yeah and playing into all this of course is the recent news that Hong Kong is going to be um issuing clarifying guidance on you know crypto assets over there and at the same time it appears that this has the blessing of China and that even you know crypto companies are finding that they're getting banking relationships over there so if this continues in this fashion then you know how do you see kind of the US's attitude toward crypto affecting these geopolitical issues and perhaps even the status of the US dollar as the global Reserve currency I think what's going on with Hong Kong I mean as you say it appears to have the implicit you know backing of China but yet that in and of itself is somewhat strange that that Hong Kong given the um the Dynamics that we've seen there over the last few years in coming under Chinese rule um to express themselves that in that way contrary to kind of the dictates that exist in Beijing is just a very strange Dynamic uh so you can't help but think that there has been some some level of of blessing of that of that process maybe they're creating sandboxes in Hong Kong right maybe they're trying to figure out how to attract development um so that they can crowdsource a lot of that Innovation um maybe they want to end up using it for safe purposes maybe they want to try to understand how they can better infiltrate the digital yuan into the kind of the crypto ecosystem or into kind of the next web3 economy I mean it's it's it's it's um it's easy to speculate on a lot of different kinds of things it's and it's hard to kind of figure out the thing that worries me is that when we kind of bring up the the China aspect in in Washington there are a lot of people that then use that as an excuse to advocate for a U.S Central Bank digital currency um and there are so many policy issues that need to be addressed very difficult policy issues that I think may be hard for you know Congress to achieve consensus on uh before a central bank digital currency could even be be issued that it feels it feels like it's a distraction I would rather kind of focus on the the advancements of the technology and who's going to own the next set of that Innovation who's going to own the tools of web3 who's going to be the home of kind of that Innovative Community where is that legal system going to be based where is that academic research going to be based where are the universities going to be located that attract that kind of talent whereas the funding Community going to be based uh you know where where do where do Dows locate with with appropriate legal protections and where do their treasuries then have the ability to pay taxes and hire third-party service providers I mean to me that's more of the geopolitical issue from the United States which is given the trajectory we're on you know um sure maybe China can make some advancements we risk losing you know that amount of innovative you know um intellectual Capital to basically anywhere yeah almost like if we had you know Silicon Valley along with Amazon and apple and Netflix and Facebook and Twitter and yes okay of course I think some of some people view some of these companies as problematic or that they became So eventually but there's no doubt that there was a huge amount of capital and value and jobs and um yeah just there were a lot of benefits I think to having that located here and this is not only technology but also financial markets uh that were you know building in in the space then yeah both of those things could potentially go offshore um so in a way you know because I I phrased my question as being about money itself and you're saying well it's really about these centers of technology and innovation it's possible it's just hard to speculate you know um I'm not going to pretend to have a crystal ball to understand uh what the Chinese Communist party is thinking or what that relationship is between between them and Hong Kong and how this is trying to play out but I think it's certainly a risk and I think it could be a motivation yeah and at the same time we are seeing that China and Russia are trying to do more um more of their own economic transactions not using the dollar so um nick uh so what are your thoughts now for all of this in relation to bitcoin because we did see that biology srinivasan um had some strong thoughts on that and I was curious um to hear yours I think frankly the Bitcoin narrative has been strong of course you know Bitcoin is a lot to say um your position themselves as an alternative to the fractional Reserve banking system I will admit I'm one of the bitcoiners that uh supports uh fractional Reserve banking I think it can be done prudently and I think there's plenty of historical examples I've never we've never even seen a historical full Reserve banking setup that was Market determined that actually existed so you know all banking historically is fractional reserve and I think credit creation is good for society I think the main reason bitcoin's been rallying is simply that the FED in response to the banking crisis adopted a more accommodative posture and um their balance sheet started growing again and they started injecting liquidity into the markets so that's an exogenous variable to crypto um I would causally ascribe that the bulk of the explanation certainly I think they're going to face further issues trying to restore the confidence in the US banking system I don't know if an unlimited depository guarantee is a solution but it certainly does betray the fragility of of our current banking system and I think it implies for the liquidity liquidity injections down the road so I would say that's the main reason Bitcoin has been rallying here is is not any endogenous crypto factors but simply the broader liquidity environment I don't think that's conducive to a million dollar price though unfortunately Brian what were your takes on his that which was that the installer was going to um sorry that the the price of Bitcoin was going to reach one million dollars in 90 days because there was going to be hyperinflation in the US yeah it was I mean it's interesting you know um there's there's some level of entertainment it's very diplomatic term the level of debt in the United States has skyrocketed um uh over the last uh you know pick your term you know one year five years ten years 20 years um and you know right now we're over a hundred percent debt to GDP I think it might be up to 120 you know that bill comes due at some point uh you know people want to hold dollars because we have a very strong economy we have relatively stable monetary policy you look at the level of indebtedness of a lot of top economies in the world and it is astounding um and we also have a um a government process that kind of advantages deficits you know uh we have we have a process called reconciliation uh in the Senate um that advantages tax cuts when one party's in charge and advantages incredible amounts of spending when another when the different party is in charge um and you know I understand both of those meet the philosophical needs of those parties but compounding that over time does not you know it it starts to spiral into a pretty big problem um if the economy is not spurred faster you know then those things add to the deficit uh by either of those actions uh and so you know that that could be coming at some point and yeah we'll see the loss of confidence in smaller Banks which is what's happening right now of course we see deposits flowing to large Banks and then go to treasuries directly that is actually deflationary in my opinion because it was a small and medium-sized banks that do the bulk of lending in the economy small Banks lend to small firms and if you lose that you lose a strong driver of money creation and GDP growth so I actually see it being a drag on the economy and uh destructive to the money supply the Dynamics that we're seeing in the bank sector longer term of course the existence of the debt as it is is an inflationary thing because No One's Gonna adopt austerity so and we're certainly not going to default so the only choice there is an inflationary reset so I do think people need to be prepared over the next decade or so for a structurally higher inflation environment but in the immediate term I actually think the issues the banks are facing is somewhat deflationary so now we've outlined you know all these different things happening uh crypto companies in the US um at this moment in time what do you think is kind of the best recourse for them you know what activities are they doing that you feel maybe could lead to good outcomes eventually or you know what sort of gives you hope well regarding the sort of repression happening in the bank sector I'm seeing crypto firms just re-domiciling that's actually pretty hard it's easier said than done especially if you're a citizen I'm seeing some firms adopting more crypto native Expressions so they're just choosing to have their balance sheet be on chain and maybe held in a multi-sig and using some of the great tools that exist to manage their corporate treasuries which is a pretty interesting solution um and some are just hunkering down in the US and hoping for a change in the administration or something like that as far as recourse is concerned um there's some interesting initiatives underway where there's potential litigation as I said before I think being on on fairly deprived your banking relationship because of the industry that you're in is a violation of due process um and there may be some recourse there those were the lawsuits that were lodged around checkpoint 1.0 and I think I certainly know those interested firms that are trying to prepare that type of litigation uh so that would be one thing and frankly I think Congress has a role to play in terms of their oversight they've already been hearings pertinent to the the choke point issues that we're seeing the first time around Congress did play an important role in servicing valuable information and bringing these Regulators um actions into the light and placing a check on their behavior and of course Congress is the entity that has been and The Regulators have been sort of usurping their authority to a certain degree so I think there should be a reaction in Congress and thankfully in the house we do have some folks that are really attuned to these issues and do appear to be reacting so I would say as far as the bank situation is concerned those are the two main channels that I see is litigation and then more Congressional oversight yeah I'd agree I'd agree with both of those I mean I I think litigation is a critical tool when you believe the government's overstepping its Authority or not being transparent is how it's operating um or is imposing value judgments uh through non you know non-political process means um and as I said before there are a lot of questions that need to be answered and maybe that's the best way to answer them a congressional oversight uh should happen I think I think it will happen I think other other areas of recourse are there are what uh you know 20 million people in the United States maybe maybe more that own crypto every single one of them has one member of Congress and two senators I've worked in a congressional office before they read the mail they read emails they answer the phone you know they should be calling uh if they if they care about you know the future of this technology and and the ownership over you know those tokens they should they should call and write their members of Congress and their senators and say it's okay and probably good to regulate crypto and and protections are fine but don't ban this technology uh there are use cases for this and and you know I'm a proud owner and I see the potential benefits of this um and the last thing I think that gives me um gives me hope and I think it's stronger than hope it's it's some level of belief and it's to Nick Nick's Point uh that there there are informed members of Congress in positions of authority that care about consumer protection that are not just blind Advocates uh uh you know of of of crypto that are working hard and cooperatively across the aisle to develop legislation that can bring some rules of the road um and some clarity and so much leading Clarity to this space because other otherwise the other you know piece of Hope and and belief that I have is that there are four jurisdictions uh the UK is a prime example that are um much more thoughtful and well calibrated in the broader messaging of the entire government uh than what we're seeing here and that uh while they're you know they're still working through some of the issues they are proposing Frameworks uh that appear to be very thoughtful their language is very thoughtful it's very well calibrated it describes the fact that there may be risks to those new kinds of Technology but they are likely different and there needs to be similar regulatory outcomes if there is similar activity that's involved as opposed to just saying that there are same risks if that activity exists and therefore there need to be the same rules regardless of the consequences to the technology um so I think there are a lot of there are a lot of opportunities to have hope or or belief in you know positive outcomes here uh we'll see which comes online first and what happens in the meantime and then I wanted to ask about the cftc lawsuit against binance versus the um acc's assertion that everything except for Bitcoin is a security and I wondered if you thought that there was a potential for that to be sorted out um within the next two years say like before the next Administration well as far as I understand from an interview I did for the Friday Unchained um it could potentially be sorted out by the judge in the cftc case because um they would have to first determine if the cftc has standing and since the cftc said in the lawsuit that Bitcoin ether and Litecoin and two stable coins are Commodities that that would have to be determined first and I was curious if you you know thought that that was going to happen um kind of on a faster timeline than some of this other stuff might happen I don't I don't think that that is in doubt legally it may be in in doubt um linguistically uh or politically what do you when you say that but I mean the SEC keeps saying other cryptos besides Bitcoin or Securities or at least here Gensler does well I mean I think I think the I believe that there's Clarity around ether specifically because contracts Futures contracts derivative of contracts on either have been trading on cfdc only exchanges for the last four years so if the SEC viewed that as a security seriously then those exchanges the CME Group for instance is violating the Securities laws so they would be facing an enforcement action or they'd be told to de-list the contract that contract is up and is continuing to trade um so then how do you view chair gensler's statements that everything about Bitcoin is a security the actions of the agency don't match that rhetoric in terms of their ability to enforce that view by telling cftc registered only exchanges that they would need to de-list those products because they view them as securities okay interesting okay it seems like you're you're saying that no matter what chair Gensler says that um the way the agency has been acting these last four years is that ether is a commodity is a non-security yes yeah oh okay non-security yeah okay so you're saying it's a settled matter uh the the SEC can always bring a case against somebody on anything at any time you know they could say bitcoin's a security uh you know a a turn of a switch and unfortunately that's the way you know the Securities laws work and that's the way that they have um uh ensured that they can respond to updated facts and circumstances as things evolve and change and there's a rationale for that um but as it stands now and as it has stood uh for the last four years uh both Bitcoin and eth are non-security Commodities and then would a further extension of your statement be that um with this Wells notice when coinbase responded that a number of the offerings that the wells notice might be referring to were ones that were listed and it's S1 back in 2021 are you saying that that would be a good argument for coinbase that that would then um be a way that they could push back on the SEC well I see them as as basically separate issues you know I was talking about the status of eth as a non-security commodity because of its current regulatory treatment you know in in the regulatory Community which is that if it was viewed as a security it would have to trade under a different regime than it is currently trading now in terms of the coinbase wells notice there's not a lot of detail uh in that Wells notice which kind of which defeats the purpose of what a Wells notice is supposed to do it's supposed to give the defendant or the respondent enough Clarity to actually submit you know a defense of the facts to the Commission in advance of being charged uh so I think that the Well's notice was vague enough that uh no one is necessarily certain as to what the SEC is viewing as as Securities in that instance you know they could view uh the security they could view the tokens that were listed in the wahi case as Securities they've already made that claim they could view others but there aren't Futures contracts trading on those so those aren't within the current regulatory fold where um the SEC you knows lack of action you know basically constitutes uh a um an acknowledgment of of the status of a product as being within the cftc jurisdiction and trading as a non-security all right last quick question for you both so um we've now talked about you know this relationship that the government has to crypto and then how some of that could play out in a geopolitical way and um I was wondering if you both uh just had any missed message that you wanted to give to essentially any entity or multiple entities in the government whether Regulators or makers or both what would that be I would say that there is an opportunity um to create a regulatory system that both respects the technology and its promise as well as protects consumers uh there's some hard work that needs to be done the current approach is not sustainable and the the The Innovation is valuable enough and meaningful enough and is impactful enough and transformative enough that that effort's required and it's required now yeah mine's very simple you know when the executive overstubs the bounds its Authority we are a system with checks and balances and um one check on their Authority is the courts of course and that'll play out in time but also it's congress's duty to act as a check on some of these Federal Regulators that are are clearly overstepping the balance of their Authority and uh and acting outside the normal course of Duty and I'd like to see more from Congress in investigating the actions of the federal agencies that are depriving crypto forms to their Bank relationships I think it's it's very straightforward that it's not their job to determine who these Banks can do business with if it's a legal industry which it is so I look forward to seeing more from Congress all right perfect well where can people learn more about each of you and your work all my uh my entire Corpus can be found at nickcarter.info uh I I don't have one of those but um my biographies on a16z cryptos website you can learn more about a16z crypto or e16z proper uh through his website and Nick and I are both on Twitter perfect it's been a pleasure having you both on
