game of chicken which is nearing at least the first cliff with me today to discuss the upcoming events of this asset this digital gold that has started all this crypto mania are Eric's Lombroso a Bitcoin core developer and Brian Hoffman CEO of ob1 which runs the project to open Bazaar the eBay of the decentralized web welcome Eric and Brian thanks for having me Laura yeah thank you thank you for having me on ok so I needed to start this discussion with a little framing for our listeners as particularly those who are new to the space so that we can dive into the meat of the discussion about three years ago the Bitcoin community began to face the question of how to scale the network some of the early core developers that had been deeply involved in the project wanted to lift a cap of one megabyte that limits the amount of transactions that can be processed at any given moment they wanted to lift that you know from one megabyte to different caps such as with some of the different proposals were like 8 megabytes 20 megabytes a flexible cap but that cap at the moment that this or the new proposal seems to that seems to have the most support from people is 2 megabytes however that frame big flocks versus small box is only one way of looking at this question another big issue that the question raises is whether or not to conduct a hard fork in order to scale the network since that is what would be required in order to change that cap the core developers say that doing so runs the risk of splitting the chain which could result in two versions of Bitcoin and that would have a deleterious effect on bitcoins reputation as digital gold a couple years ago they began working on another scaling solution called segregated witness that would essentially enable more data to be processed in blocks without requiring a hard work it also included a fix for a problem called transaction malleability seg would as it became known was also greatly anticipated because pushing it through would enable something called the Lightning Network and that would bring many more transactions to Bitcoin not necessarily all of the Bitcoin blockchain but to be settled on it at some point the devs and the miners had a meeting in Hong Kong where the attendees signed a document agreeing to implement both secwet and hard fork to two megabytes but what actually happened in this meeting is in dispute because the attendees had different conceptions about how much authority this Agreement had regardless once the work was done to begin implementing segueway only about 30 to 40% of miners actually gave it support but the threshold necessary to implement it was 95% one miner in particular who owned the largest mining pool as well as a company called bit main headed up by a man named Jihan wu and bit main is also the largest mining chip manufacturer and they opposed SEC way unless a block size increase came along with it so I still made ocurred SEC what was sort of held hostage by a bit Maine's desire to see this 1 megabyte block size increased and as the divide deepened each side began essentially threatening to cut the other side out of Bitcoin and I did write a few articles on this which I can link to in the show notes however in May Barry Silbert who's the head of digital currency group which is the biggest blockchain VC firm brokered an agreement among the biggest economic actors in Bitcoin to push through something that they're calling seg what 2x or is often called the New York agreement as well which basically says that seg would will be implemented with 80% of mining power and then after that the network will upgrade to a 2 megabyte block size limits through a hard Florrick it's essentially the Hong Kong agreement from a year and a half ago just with some details that are different and the companies that signed this agreement include some of the biggest economic actors in this space such as coinbase blockchain Zappo shape-shift and of course Pitt Maine which is this company that is most reviled and blamed for a holding segwayed hostage so in response there was more support began to build for something called a user activated soft fork or you ASF and that actually also risks causing a chain split so the deadlines for both segment 2x and for the UA SF are nearing at the moment of recording it's actually Thursday afternoon it looks we're very close for so first I quit 2 X 2 to be locked in 91 okay it's called dip 91 for those of you who maybe don't follow all the technical details and I and if it does go through then that should prevent a chain that chains that that could have been caused by the u.s. UAS F but it doesn't resolve the question of whether or not we will see a chain split in November which is when the hard fork to move to the 2 megabyte block size will actually take place so that's everything it's a very long summary but we needed to get through that back story in order to have a media discussion so I actually want to start our talk with Brian Brian Obi Wan's signed the New York agreement why so you know I think that was a pretty good summary of what's happened at a pretty high level I mean it's been several years now and obviously there's a lot of details left out between this but you know I mean from from our perspective I mean we I'm not a accord EV as eric is or or even work with the bitcoin core code directly but you know we built a business and an open-source projects on top of the protocol and you know our success as well as a lot of other groups that are building you know on top of the bitcoins network effect understand that you know the project has to scale in order to be able to support what these these groups want to do and i think that there's this disagreement about how that happens but you know ultimately the most important thing for us is that we try to move forward in some in some way that all parties that are pertinent to the discussion are not fighting with each other and so i'm wondering like when you were saying you know it's necessary to scale as we mentioned earlier segue it actually would enable more transactions to occur on the network at any given moment so why sign the agreement that would not only bring segue to X but also increase the block size limit well I mean I think it first of all it's important to understand that like there was a time before segments existed and there were many discussions around how Bitcoin could scale before seg what is was even a theme and I think a lot of the people that feel this way about scaling that segment is not the optimal option option are the ones that are have been pushing back for the last few years and I think you know fair or not they feel that segue giving segments now is a compromise that moves the the market forward without you know ruining too many things but yet a hard fork later on would would be the part that they would be most interested in and I think you know I I think that the conversation has been reframed where you know oh well everybody agrees that seg would is awesome and the hard fork is not great is not great but that's not how these people feel so what what is there objection to segue why do they feel it's not the optimal solution I mean it this this conversation will probably get in the weeds and and era can probably talk circles around me in terms of whether it's it's you know technically accurate but my understanding is that you know segments could be enabled through through a hard fork method method and it could do there are several other defects in the protocol that we could also kind of package as part of that hard fork and clean up the code and instead many of them feel that segue in its current implementation as a soft fork is a little bit hacky and and maybe not as clean as it could be and I think they that's that choice was made in order to sacrifice not having this or to have backwards compatibility with other apps instead of breaking the network maybe with a chain split Oh interesting and then and then and then for them or for them and I'm assuming you why is it that increasing the block size is the better way to go I mean obviously increasing the block size is only a temporary fix I think everybody pretty much agrees that that's true and and I think there's a lot of potential outcomes here we could raise the block size and it could immediately be filled up with spam and and be a problem once again which is what some people speculate and maybe it's a it holds us off for another year but I think the work for me the most important aspect of this is that I don't feel that this change is something that is going to long-term harm Bitcoin and and the and the goodwill and and positivity that comes out of actually moving all of the players in Bitcoin forward together is going to allow us to not have to go through these Mexican standoffs every time there's a critical change to be made to the network well but wait but do you think it is moving everyone for we're together because I see that the core devs are not moving forward I mean you know they're sort of being for so long when they wrote BIP 91 I mean you know but I mean BIP 91 in the whole everything that's going on with like making sure the transition going is going smooth I mean there's a lot of core developers actually working on making sure that that that said would actually activates and smooth and there aren't any market disruptions so so there are there are you know core developers that are actually actively working on trying to make this transition as smooth as possible okay yeah I agree and I think that this I mean there that does not mean that everybody agrees with what's happening but I think we're all trying to work together to make sure that this isn't a disaster in a some some way because ultimately the market is deciding that seg what is gonna happen right we're obviously seeing that 91 is probably going to be activated soon yeah but not just segment but segment to X which is a different thing well we don't know about that that's like several months you know you know further on and yeah right now like we're just concerning ourselves with like the current activation and then like seeing what's gonna happen because a lot of things can happen between now and three months okay but so I want to go back to at this point about whether or not the core temps are coming along because they wanted to or sort of because they realized that it's happening anyway and so they need to jump aboard what which is it well then let me just clear up a few things you know when you talk about core devs you're really talking about a whole bunch of volunteers that you know work from all over the world it's not just like this one homogeneous group that like agrees on everything there's there's a lot of internal you know disagreements and minor Tiff's of you know different different approaches of doing certain things but for the most part I think there's a general agreement as to the general roadmap as far as like you know the best way to to move things forward and but let me let me just comment a few things if I can um just to give a little bit of context of my current situation in this when I first started working on Bitcoin I saw it as a proof of concept I did not see it as a completed product it was only worth like you know the market there were barely any markets and it was worth just like a couple of dollars or something like that and when was that this was like 2011 okay and I expected it to become obsolete to you know since for someone else to come up with a better cryptocurrency that would replace it eventually that was kind of my expectation and then I saw the rise of ripple and aetherium and several other projects which I participated in in the early stages hoping that we would be able to fix some of the issues with Bitcoin and create a better cryptocurrency so it's not like I was a Bitcoin maximalist that thought that you know it's got to be Bitcoin and everyone's gotta you know do it this way I always thought that if someone came up with a better idea and wanted to have a better cryptocurrency that was far it'd probably be called something other than Bitcoin so like you have aetherium or ripple or whatever right and eventually maybe users would migrate over to that because it would be a better platform at some point but then I quickly saw that other projects made even worse mistakes than I think Bitcoin made and there was a huge breakthrough which was the discovery of how to be able to change consensus rules in a backwards compatible way and this was like the really big breakthrough that made me please call this a fork well yeah it's a soft work plus a whole bunch of other things that go into it's not being a software cologne doesn't make it backwards compatible but it's an important tool in the whole arsenal of making things backwards compatible so for instance like the you know the way that's just for people who don't know what all this means the the reason that that's significant is because then you can prevent a chain split and therefore prevent two versions of Bitcoin being created is that is that it that's that's one of the big points and the other one is disenfranchising people for instance if you change compatibility then maybe people's preferred programs are no longer gonna work on the network anymore or maybe coins or contracts that they had before I'm no longer gonna be honored by the new rules or stuff like that so um though that's also an important factor that that figures into the backwards compatibility and the software alone is not enough to ensure that for instance the software could be used to blacklist addresses and that's something that's a big no-no that's something I don't think anyone any of the developers would support for instance even if we could be done as a software so it's really the combination of no chain split plus making it an optional feature in the sense that people that don't want to use the feature are not adversely affected by other people using the feature so it was discovered that it was possible to extend Bitcoin in a lot of different ways by committing to extra data to the hash of an extra data in a block and I I think you know some people have made a big deal of whether it'd be easier to implement something like I said what is a hard or not and the truth is no actually it's it's really no different it's just where the commitment actually is placed obviously with a hard fork if we have full ability if the full ability to change anything we want and we don't care about compatibility you know we could start from scratch and with the lessons of the past we could fix a lot of other things if we wanted to but one of the big challenges and I think this is the biggest engineering challenge and Bitcoin it's like when I when I design a lot of other systems I usually especially if I get to start from the early stages try to design it from the start the way that I want it to be but Bitcoin is how it is right now and we're bootstrapping this network that already has a lot of value and the real engineering challenge isn't you know how would I build it from scratch better but how can I take what exists right now and modify it in a way that isn't going to break it that's going to add the functionality that we want so for you it sounds like you feel like the number one priority at any point when you are making decisions about how to develop the protocol is whether or not you can make that change in a backwards compatible manner which would therefore prevent a James but is that what you're saying huge component yes and if it is if it's not possible to do that then I would probably consider doing something like etherium or ripple which is a separate blockchain so I mean if I wanted to really change Bitcoin drastically and do something that was very different that it was very hard to do in a backwards compatible way I would probably just start a new blockchain so I want to actually just take these thoughts and shift them over to segue to X here we are at this moment where it looks really likely that Biff 91 segment to X is going to go through which means that segment will lock in and then in November there's likely to be this hard fork to a two megabyte limit so what is your position on that do you think that it's a good thing or a bad thing that this is probably gonna happen well first let me clear something up the whole miners signaling thing is actually an arbitrary mechanism that was added to the software to help coordination and to make the transition smoother the first place my minor signaling you mean this is how we come up with these percentages like 80 percent okay that was actually you know something that was that was invented way after a Bitcoin actually started the first few soft Forks did not use that mechanism at all they had they just had a flag date or a block height and basically you know users would run the updated software and at some point blocks that did not conform to the new rules would just basically be rejected by those nodes so so there was a form of user activated software even if it wasn't called the miners signaling was at it later with a mechanism that's called a supermajority and I believe it was BIP 30 something or other that was the first one that was deployed this way and what this allowed was for miners to signal you know intent to start enforcing the rule which made it so that it was easier to transition the network more smoothly and give people time to make sure that that they don't end up mining orphaned blocks or that they don't end up accepting invalid confirmations and stuff like that it's a good thing that this is the way we do it now well it was a coordination mechanism that expected cooperation and as long as there was cooperation between developers industry miners users etc it was fine but the problem is when you get this kind of adversarial scenario and in this kind of a situation it just does not work at all I believe that it has been abused and and it's been given way more importance than it really has for instance this whole 95 percent thing that was an arbitrary choice that was made in the softness in the Segway deployment it could have been made as low as probably 60 or even lower and probably still would have been relatively safe but there probably would have been a few miners that would have mined a few bad blocks and there might have been you know a couple you know small team splits just a few blocks deep and then other issues like that 95 just makes this list like almost guaranteed that there's gonna be almost no you know no chain split at all but safety measure but Eric I mean like you were saying like oh we could have made it sixty percent and stuff but I mean it it only ever got thirty to forty percent anyway so it wouldn't have gone through even if the threshold had been lower no but at this point it was all just political posturing I mean really if you think about what happened with the signaling was people were just starting to stick random data into blocks and using it as a signaling mechanism that didn't actually trigger anything in this often in the software that people were actually using so if I'm running a node and someone decides to stick something in there clemmy's transaction that says I support the New York agreement or whatever yeah okay that's a great to kind of demonstrate support from miners for something like that but it's not gonna change anything of my software it's not gonna make some blocks suddenly become become valid that weren't valid before ok so what you're saying is like but like I guess what I'm trying to get is I don't know exactly why you're me or me why this a point is important to you is it because you feel like this is a bad way to go about doing things because I actually did want to ask you that later like what is the best way you know to make decisions like this is but is that why you're telling me all this the reason I bring this up is because I think there's been a huge misconception by some of the community that there's this kind of political process that's established in Bitcoin that works by minor voting and that's actually not the case at all I know that the Satoshi white paper talks about you know one cp1 vote but I think that it's very confusing in a lot of ways and people have tended to misinterpret that back when the the white paper was written it was still something that was being prototyped it wasn't even released yet you know but if you look at the original implementation of the Bitcoin the software checks to make sure that blocks are valid so really what miners are choosing is which blockchain to extend and which transactions to include in their blocks they're not actually getting to choose which rules the the blockchain that they're choosing to follow will enforce and you see that in all these markets where you have a bunch of different block chains like for instance look at Palani X or something you have all these different block chains and all these you know my name pools that actually shift there have some power depending on what's more profitable to mine at any given point in time so really miners are following whatever chain is the most profitable for them to be mining at that particular moment and they're providing a service to users which is to secure their transactions by making it expensive for someone to reverse it that's what that's what proof-of-work actually does right it's not it's not actually a voting mechanism it's not actually a political decision-making process at all and it was never designed that way and I think that this this signaling mechanism that was used for soft Forks got kind of played into that wholeness and misunderstanding so now we have this kind of like theater for all these different you know signaling of different proposals and this and that but that actually doesn't change what the software does unless people choose to run software that actually enforces those new rules so even though so Eric I just I just want to stop things for a second because like I feel like you know we're getting into the weeds here I actually probably just really want to talk about this later like what is the best way to do this because like I just need to give listeners a framework to also talk about like for the rest of this podcast I actually just want to hear from both he you what deadlines and events are you most worried about over the next few months like what what do you what what are some of the deadlines that are coming up what is gonna happen at those moments what should users be aware of and what are the risks that happen at each of those points okay so right now we're waiting for bit 91 talk debate what bit 91 does is it requires signaling of the currently deployed version of site wit which is running on over 80 percent of nodes right now has a particular trigger for it activate and once it triggers then at that point all blocks are going to have to enforce or blocks the use segue are going to have to enforce the segment rules so does that mean that immediately the chain has the segregated witness feature which means that lightning can be implemented not only not immediately that's just this is just a trigger for the next trigger it's kind of like a Rube Goldberg device it just it triggers the next trigger which is going to be you know a two-week lock-in period and then a two-week activation period so we're probably looking at activation about actual separate activations sometime probably mid to late August okay so basically if we reach that 80% threshold which it looks like it'll be today I think that means that it kicks off like a two-week period of what because it doesn't have to do with well you know when that difficulty actually okay so can you explain that yes so the way that that word is currently deployed is using what's called bit nine which is which is a signaling mechanism that operates on every retargeting interval which is every 2016 blocks every 2016 blocks if if 90% of those blocks signal for seg wit then at that point it locks in and then you know they people are given two weeks to to upgrade and then after two weeks at the next retargeting interval after another 2016 blocks at that point people can start using sublet transactions okay in this retargeting interval that has to do with the difficulty the hashing difficulty on the network yes and it was just chosen because it was a convenient interval that are existed as part of the protocol so it was decided that that interval was can also be used for the VIP nine activation mechanism okay but then you were saying so then after that first two weeks then then what happens to what has to happen after that in the next two weeks so after it's locked in then two weeks after that all the notes out there are going to start enforcing segue so if miners mind blocks that do not enforce it that include the transactions that are invalid according to the segment rules they're gonna get rejected by these notes so that means that miners have to you know if they include segment transactions they have to enforce the said what rules at that point so that's when you can consider the activation to actually have been completed okay so if I'm a miner and I don't enforce that rule and I mine a block then I don't get the block reward exactly oh okay so there's an economic incentive for them to do this mm-hmm exactly okay so and then at which point can can the different actors in in Bitcoin use the feature of segregated witness as soon as it's activated which is going to be one retargeting interval after it's locked in so it's basically going to it's probably gonna be somewhere in late August like a month from now or something like that where people can actually start to use it huh but that sounds like - oh okay so that's so it's like two intervals away yeah yes okay and if that happens then that means that the user activated software will not go through which then means that the risk of a chain split from that will also not happen is that correct yeah yeah basically what happens is if fib 91 activates and miners are you actually start enforcing it then that kind of makes BIP 1:48 moot assuming that they do follow through with it however a lot of users still are running bit 148 just to make sure that miners follow through on that because most users are actually not running bit 91 bit 91 is for miners to enforce among each other 148 is for users to check the miners and it's kind of like checks and balances to make sure that the miners are actually following the rules okay so then it's like the next big deadline for people to focus on and in particular to worry about whether or not the value of their bitcoins will drop or whether or not they'll suddenly have two different versions of Bitcoin or even more it will take place in November so can you describe what's going to happen then and actually Brian do you want it do you want to do that since Eric's been talking a lot I mean the principle behind segment 2x is that it's roughly three months or 90 days past the activation of segue you know then would be the attempted hard fork I think it's important to realize that that's it's not necessarily like a sure thing right like this is clearly going to be a massive contentious time period I think I don't know if Eric agrees with that but you know I think there is speculation that a lot of these people that just want to get psych without are going to go along with this and then you know once said what activates the landscape could change in terms of support for for a hard fork or any other perceived outcome and so I don't know I mean I'm holding my tongue for what will happen but certainly that's the most important data I think in the near future is is what happens within you know at that 90 day period okay so I actually earlier in this conversation I kind of had you both argue your own side but one question that I got from Twitter which i think is a great one is I want to hear you guys describe for me what you think is the best argument for the other side hmm well I don't really think that there are sides the way that people are painting it I think that it's kind of like people have kind of created these ghost ramen and tried to kind of pitch one side against the other from the very beginning I've been a very strong supporter of increasing block size if it's found if there's a way to do it safely and a way to do it that you know does that that doesn't cause a lot of other problems and a lot of other court developers have also been very supportive of this including Peter Willie who's one of the main authors of seg wit and actually was one of the big motivations to actually try to merge this into Bitcoin core was fact that we could get a block size increase without all of the other issues including you know chain split risks and and compatibility Peter will use the support a supporter of Segway 2x no no he's a support a big blob of bigger blocks also if done in a safe way and if they're in a way that's actually you know that has peer review and that is not going to split the network where it's not going to coerce people and I think that a lot of you know it's at least several of the you know major core developers core contributors since this whole issue was brought up in 2015 at least in the you know discussion forums that that we generally use for our communications such as the mailing lists and you know the IRC chat channels and other places like that on github then you know the general idea was okay let's see if we can find a way to increase block size that safe that's not going to cause a chain split that avoids a lot of the political contentious issues etc and Sega was kind of you know the solution to all these things that we found for the moment and so I I want to just you know make it clear first of all that I'm fully in favor of you know being able to increase block size how if it's possible to do it in a safe way I don't think that we currently have a way to do it that's safe given the current political circumstances so I asked you to argue you know what you think is the best argument for the other side but it seems like you're going back to saying like a hard fork no matter when or how you do it is is a bad idea no I'm not saying that at all I think artwork would be fine under different circumstances if we had better research under you know a for it and if we actually were able to get market support for it and right now it just doesn't look you don't feel like there's a market there's market support for this when we have every single time that that any hard fork threat has been pushed hard the markets have dropped significantly every single time that segwayed has been pushed hard with with the signaling the markets have gone up so the market signal almost unambiguously shows that hard forks are not popular in the market and said what is yeah what would you but read Eric but Eric would you argue that I mean the we're getting segue activated right now because of both the combination of the UA SF threat and the segue to X threat they're both coming together in Korean scenario where people would rather not have to deal with whatever is worse and they're gonna do it and we're seeing the market get pushed up and that we're New York agreement I mean is is is seg wit plus a two megabyte hard pork now I don't know if people are just bluffing and saying oh we want the segment and we don't want the two megabyte we'll just take this for now or not but it certainly seems like the market is saying we want both of those things and we want to move forward and the price is going up I mean we're getting close to $2,800 now from last week when were under two thousand so because we're about to have to be a bit 91 so I don't I don't I don't necessarily buy that like the market is rejecting the hard fork I think hard fork has certainly gotten the connotation that it's just this horrible awful thing that could possibly ever happen I mean at some point in time Bitcoin is going to have to hard work like you said we'd like to do it in the most safe and responsible way and have give everybody enough time to prepare for it but we've been discussing this stuff for three years now and we keep saying that but like and then there's a hard fork research website you can go to and see about spoon net and all these other options but like at some point there has to be some progress made and I think you know you're seeing frustrated frustration within core devs as well I mean you see Luke jr. and Greg Maxwell arguing around whether bit for 148 is responsible or not everyone is too fast or this or that so everybody agrees it's hard to get people to agree period and that's a political problem that's something that Bitcoin does not solve and I think that you know more people I wish more people understood that bitcoin is not a political system it's just a protocol which defines a set of rules that if everyone follows it's predictable that you know it's gonna be he of a certain way assuming that it works correctly changing the rules now gets into the realm of politics and Satoshi unfortunately did not give us a system for really being able to do that in a way that is you know that it's like spelled out for us so we're kind of trying to create a way of doing that but you know just someone that's been that that's had a lot of experience working with the protocol and trying to make changes I can tell you that it's extremely difficult like once there's a certain momentum and a certain amount of market value and stakeholders and all this involved in it's very hard to realign people and to you know steer the ship and and and to get you know people to to to accept changes to it so those issues are way beyond just programming and coding or engineering or I mean we're talking politics here and I I think that you know people can can write up all this code for four hard Forks and you know all these different scaling approaches but in the end it's like people need to run the actual software you need to convince people to run it and people need to and you need to make sure that they you don't get any kind of divergent interest that you know want to see any kind of situations where they can kind of exploit weaknesses I mean because there's a lot of there's a lot of things that can go wrong if there is a divergence of interests and you don't get the right checks and balances there context and and this this is the whole issue that I have with the UA SF movement is that you know we're trying to get people to run the software like you're saying people have to use it people have to put it out there into production right like a couple thousand users and running in UA SF is not going to do it necessarily either like we need the miners as well and this whole like demonization about what they're doing is there's like the wrong way to go about that's why I like we're so supportive of trying to do something with seg with 2x now we didn't know at the time we signed the agreement whether it would be accepted by Cortes or not or any of these other people we just thought that this is the most pragmatic approach to get everybody on board the problem is now we have the situation where the miners kind of work out it works out for them whether we get segwayed or not I mean let's be blunt I mean if segment doesn't go through and they in the Box stays small and the fees go up they make money off the fees and if the blocks get bigger and and everything works out and it scales up and they get more fees that way so you know the ANA can play games with both sides and then that's actually what's really kind of like it upsets me a little bit that I feel that you know um maybe interest between a lot of people especially in the DCG portfolio and say like Bitcoin core developers are more aligned than a lot of minor interests and DCG companies and and and I you know I kind of feel like um I mean I'm not saying all miners I think there's a lot of great miners out there that are doing a great service for the network and then they're definitely you know doing their job of making sure that the network is hard to attack but there's also interest there that as you point out conflict with other companies you know obviously miners want to collect as much in fees as possible businesses that use Bitcoin want to pay as little in fees as possible right and so there's a negotiation that occurs here I I think that's you know definitely none of those fees are going to the developers I mean you know we're not getting paid any the miners are getting all this money so it just feels to me like like you know industry maybe like pick the wrong allies when it comes to like actually figuring out like where their interests lie and you know I understand I mean I know that that I mean I don't know I'm not trying to like demonize anyone in particulars they think that everyone has their own interests and whatever it's like obviously you have to expect people to be selfish and if you expect people to not be selfish and for this to work then obviously it's not going to work so let's hold that thought right there we're gonna break now for an important word from our sponsor on-ramp and then we'll go back to this really interesting topic so with so many companies vying for people's attention now it's important to stand out from the pack if you're

hoffmann so we were talking about the politics of this whole thing and about governance in general and I wanted to ask you guys what you think is the best way for Bitcoin to make big decisions like this going forward well I mean we there is it a process right now I think a lot of people might not be very familiar with with all the intricacies of it I think that there's a big kind of clash of cultures maybe between like you know free open-source software development and more corporates software development but there is a process for submitting proposals for getting them reviewed there's a you know big open community out there for for you know doing this stuff but what's the process then for deciding between those different proposals well I mean right now yeah that's a good question right now basically people can run whatever software they want I believe you know I believe is a fundamental right and this is one of the things that actually I believe was one of my biggest bones of contention with with the New York I mean with the Hong Kong Agreement and also you know a problem with a New York agreement is that I do not believe in telling people that they need to run specific code I believe that people should be able to run whatever code they want if it happens to be code that's buggy or that has problems or that splits them off the network or they end up losing money well I mean caveat emptor I think that you know that's just part of crypto if you want to really have control over your own funds then you know you're also responsible for making sure that you're running stuff that that you know that work see you support more like a laissez faire style where it's like not really making decisions is sort of like let anybody do what they want or I believe that miners should be able to mine whatever blockchain they want of mine you know and and users should be able to use whatever blockchain they want to use and merchants should be able to support whatever block chains they want to support and exchanges to be able to list whatever whatever blocks means I want to list but then in this case where there's you know this issue with a network where there's more demand for transactions than the network is able to process how do we you know that like I totally get your your philosophy here maybe for other things in life but when it comes to this kind of network where kind of everybody needs to be on board in order for for for the whole thing to stay together what is the best way to make these decisions but do they I mean for instance aetherium has been going on without the need for you know I mean obviously Bitcoin is used as a reserve currency for all of crypto but you know besides that I mean you have other block chains that that are chugging along if people want to create a crypto currency talking about the fact that if cerium had a fork and so the more disagree or not no no I'm just saying that if you want to create a blockchain that house features that are you know above and beyond Bitcoin nobody's stopping you you can create a blockchain it won't be called Bitcoin but you can you know ground it and give it you and make it something big and if you if you do a better job than Bitcoin you should be able to win on the markets I believe wait what I would I don't know people but people that have already invested in Bitcoin they want to retain that investment they want or the value of it you know that but that works both ways though because people that invested in Bitcoin also subscribed to a particular set of rules a lot of users and and you know if you break compatibility with that then it becomes a question of whether or not you can really still call that Bitcoin because as soon as you start to break rules that some people accept it as part of the rules of Bitcoin I feel like you still haven't answered this question what is the best way to make decisions about how to change the network well first of all anything that's technical requires technical review requires a lot of peer review and making sure that I mean this is a lot of cutting-edge stuff that you know hasn't been really fully field tested yet and we're talking about a bounty of you know tens of billions of dollars so there's very very little margin of error here it's it needs to be really really carefully reviewed and tested and made sure that that it actually makes sense you know scientifically and technically but then once we have a proposal that actually makes sense on all that on all that getting everyone to actually agree to use it really yeah awesome that is a matter of aligning incentives there really is no that's one of the things about Bitcoin is that there's no formal governance structure in and I think a lot of people want to keep it that way there's incentive structures and if you can get the incentives to align correctly with a particular idea that you have then the network might you know take you up on that and I think that certain things make it much more likely for the incentives to align for instance not disenfranchising people are making features optional or supporting doctor so from what you're saying though then it sounds like what bit Maine and G haunted was rationale because if they that you know their incentive is for it for the long term to have more fees come to them and to have more transactions processed on chain rather than off chain and so by you know and and G on you know fully it told me like he's not opposed to segment when he's opposed to is segment without also a block size increase and so then it sounds like what you're saying here is if incentives are the way that this should be run then what he did was completely rational because therefore now he's getting home well hopefully if is gonna sue he's gonna get what he wants which is the block size to be bigger and for more transactions to be processed on chain and so then it worked but I think that there's like a little bit more there's a little bit more to it here that I think Eric alluded to in the beginning of this podcast which was that there's some control issues here that that are getting glossed over I think you know for jihun to say I support Segway but I want a hard Fork I mean this is a temporary fix so it's not like full ourselves like even if we move to 12 mega byte blocks at some point that's gonna get surpassed and we're gonna be back to the same issue right so you know what's really nice lightning Network or something solves everybody's problems but once again it still requires on chain transactions and so this is still a problem and you know I think you know then it wouldn't be developing the UA HF and these other bu and Bitcoin ABC and all these other things that change the governance model of Bitcoin if there wasn't like more of a power grab also here at play and that's something that we shouldn't ignore so you think that Jihan orbit main was basically doing this as a power grab against the core developers to be like hey I know you guys want this thing but you can't have it unless you kind of like go along with what I want is that what you're saying my hunch is that I think they felt like they had a lot of control when like Bitcoin classic and Bitcoin unlimited came out they thought they had enough power as miners to kind of force some of this governance stuff through and they realized that wasn't going to happen so now this is somewhat of a little bit of I think a gracious capitulation to to the market because users were rejecting them as well and not adopting unlimited or these others and they're gonna maybe make another run at it I don't know this is my speculation you know I also want to ask you the same question about what so what do you think is the best way for the Bitcoin community to decide on big decisions like this well I mean I certainly think that we need to re-evaluate how much weight we put on miner signaling and influence I mean I think it's clear that they have too much control we have to always fly to Hong Kong and talk with them every time there's like a problem or we want something done and I think that that kind of is not a tenable long-term solution I don't necessarily know what what the problem is but I mean what the solution is but I mean I think we're in this weird transition period where we had this like very like like Eric said I proof-of-concept blockchain with a consensus model and in a process for like trying to figure out how we get new rules into the protocol the bit process was created after the fact you know all this stuff was kind of added on and we're getting to the point where maybe it's almost better that like the protocol is this like it's like tcp/ip like it's not changing all the time it's not dramatically like we're not adding new rules to tcp/ip every you know six months right like everything has done another level up so then making it a settlement layer as you know which would happen if it will if if we kept the the limit the block size low I I don't I don't know if that's certainly the best solution but I think at least if that was the plan and everybody understood that that we could kind of use that as a foundation to build off of and then maybe more people would put effort into the next level up I think right now that because since you assigned the New York agreement which was you know something that was kind of against that philosophy of keeping Bitcoin more like a settlement layer well it but it's it's weird that no it feels like you're sort of arguing against yourself I'm not arguing against myself because I don't personally consider myself on his side I think what disagree as much as it seems like right like I think we're all very pragmatic about what we should do and I think most of the disagreements are around petty political arguments I think what we agree that we need to be safe about our scaling enhancements and and I you know the reason I took like I said before the reason that we support the the New York agreement is because we feel like this is the best chance that we can get seg wit which I think most people agree is better than what we have right now and at least solve some of the problems for now and sets up Lightning Network and helps us it was just like a pragmatic choice it's like this is the best thing but it's like the highest chance of ending this debate and just moving things forward I think so and a lot of people would argue that that's not a great reason to support something because you should always do what's technically the best thing but you know what that's not the way the world works you know you know often you have to kind of just sometimes you just have to like accept it and move on and we build off of it because ultimately I think Bitcoin is stronger if we have miners big businesses small businesses users cortes everybody moving in the right direction like together I mean I don't think that we're ever gonna really like do much what we're gonna do is we're gonna encourage people to go off and do altcoin development and and start these other projects I mean we're already seeing that and and yet said that a lot of other garbage comes along with that and you know the people that are true Bitcoin believers have been here for like many years before all that stuff kind of existed they understand it like the core does that work on Bitcoin are probably some of the most devoted and most dedicated people in the space they're the some of the brightest and they don't give up on their principles and that's yes why we're seeing this battle because so I want to ask about something that Eric brought up earlier which is such an interesting question to me but one of the using because so I tweeted something like hey I'm gonna have a big blocker in a small bucket on my podcast wait what should I ask them and all these people take issue with the way I framed it and one that I loved was like you know it's more like corporations versus cypherpunks so what do you think because I feel like there is this tension where you know Bitcoin started the early community largely cos instead of libertarians and then the people who more brought it to the masses were these corporate entities like coin BAE's Oppo blog BTCC so what do you think about that idea that this is you know what's really going on here that that is what really the the battle is right now personally I think it's kind of a sad argument because you know first of all I think the Cortes in poppers in general and a lot of the supporters I mean Eric I mean call me out please if I'm getting too incendiary here but like I think they're very vocal and they like try to explain their positions and I think a lot of the companies don't say anything like I've talked to many of the people that are leading these companies and they just kind of like we don't ignore that noise and they don't defend themselves or their positions but you know well I think some of them try I mean they they for them it's like too risky you know like coinbase trying to do that Bitcoin classic thing it failed miserably for them and um you know I have personally asked some of the other CEOs in this piece about this issue and they just will not touch it they won't say anything publicly they definitely have opinions but they know that if they say anything publicly that will be the death of them they'll get embroiled in these debates on Twitter and blah blah blah so but you know I do feel like that is kind of what we're seeing happening like if it it kind of burned themselves I think or some of these CEOs I think kind of burn themselves in the hole you know blocksize debate because I think that they took very vocal positions when the environment might not have been very conducive towards that being successful and that's not to say that CEOs should never go out on a limb I mean I'm also you know I also have a company and I also am interested in you know making a successful business and I also want to see Bitcoin scale and you know definitely um I'm trying to be as pragmatic as possible it's not just about being ideological I definitely did not come into this space just you know thinking in terms of like you know libertarianism or like you know Anarchy or anything like that for me it was really you know a practical way to kind of like you know build a career and do something that I like and over time it kind of grew on me and I'm like wow like this whole concept of self sovereignty is actually very very powerful and but and by that like do you feel like what's important to make that happen is just a decentralized network well what's important to make that happen is to make sure that people are able to continue to validate things and to make sure that people don't change rules from under them and you know to make sure that people don't like cannot easily counterfeit stuff and or you know create money out of thin air that is not part of the rules don't wait but Eric when it what I really wanted to ask when I asked that was you know one of the concerns that I've heard about increasing the block size is that it will make it more difficult for small miners to support the network which will then increase minor centralization and so you know I feel like there's this tension where a lot of the people that advocate keeping the block size small it's because they want to keep bitcoin is decentralized as possible and then you've got these startups and other companies running on the Bitcoin network who are like oh my god these transactions aren't going through it's like causing us on these problems we've got these users who were really annoyed at us like you know and so for them it's kind of like this headache and then for you guys it's this philosophical thing of like hey we need to keep their network too centralized because already it's so centralized am i wrong I'm thinking that that's not black and white yeah it's not black and white but there's there's three points I want to address here I think there's there's like three issues that that you're kind of combining there one is this backlog part of it it just has to do with wallet software and fee calculation software that was just not prepared for full blocks I mean obviously if blocks are full mean it's just an economics thing if you know supply is low and demand is high obviously fees are gonna get higher but better fee calculation heuristics and in wallet software will make it so that you don't have to wait as long and I think a lot of the earlier situations where that were just wallets so we're not calculating fees correctly it's only gonna take us so far like five or ten years from now when hopefully there's a lot more activity on the network then what well I mean was well still I mean even if you have correct or better pricing some applications are gonna get priced out given a certain level of supply no doubt but the issue so the second issue is regarding validation costs how expensive is it to make sure that for you to check on your computer that the transactions that you received are actually valid and that's where we get into issues of bigger blocks requiring more download you know a bigger download and more computational effort more CPU to actually validate the transactions and blocks etc right now the blockchain is growing pretty quickly and and it takes longer and longer to synchronize a node and to be able to actually fully validate for yourself now with better crypto it's possible that we might be able to reduce this Cygnus it's possible that with better technology we'd be out actually able to support much larger blocks without requiring as much computational effort in in verification of the blocks and with things like the Lightning Network are often protocols most people do not need to actually be validating most of other people's transactions so you only validate a very small percentage of the total transactions that occur on the network so those are those are really you know good ways to avoid increasing validation cost which makes it easier for you to actually make sure that you know Bitcoin hasn't been co-opted or you know that someone isn't just suddenly creating counterfeit bitcoins out of nowhere where some state isn't deciding to just suddenly blacklist transactions or stuff like that right so um and then but the third issue which i think is the the most critical issue which i think also kind of received the least amount of attention first is really how do you actually guide the markets to adopt a particular incompatible change and if you're gonna introduce any kind of incompatible change to a blockchain you have to get all the markets to agree that now you know what we used to call Bitcoin is now no longer Bitcoin this is the new Bitcoin which is basically a protocol replacement and isn't that sort of what segment 2 X is I mean like all these companies that signed are like the big companies yeah that's what any hard work would eventually it would essentially entail and I'm not saying it's impossible I'm just saying it's very difficult to do and it's more than just writing code I mean I've been writing code forever and I can tell you that writing code is definitely not enough to make that happen I mean you need to get people to agree to run that code and and that's that's what this agreement did right yes I mean the thing is it's for it's forcing the issue right it's forcing the issue like we all agree that like the hard fork is probably possible whether it's smooth or not that's debatable but like it needs all this preparation but that segue to X is saying look this is not like a super crazy leap to go from one megabyte block size to a two megabyte block size let's let's do this we can do this since so since this has actually such a small increase really that we're getting I am wondering kind of like long-term what do you guys think is the best plan for scaling yes that's the thing that's interesting what what Brian just mentioned like just going from 1 to 2 I mean even if we were going to from 1 to 1.1 the same exact issues with with chain splits and incompatibility issues would arise so it's not a matter of how much bigger we make it right and if we make it bigger then you know are we really what are we buying what are we getting for that is it really worth the disruptions and all the potential havoc that can be reaped on the network just should we hard fork sit like four megabytes or eight or or two Bitcoin in limited I think you should be working on better technologies better crypto you know better ways to compress proofs to make it you know compact proofs there's a lot of really interesting resources being done in cryptography right now wait but how long is all that kind of takes like that yeah but going to X isn't gonna take us anywhere either really other than just maybe like kicking the can down the road and getting a lot of people upset so I just you know it doesn't take that can down the road maybe during that time we can do all this research on the better cryptography and stuff is that kind of what you think like again going back to my question what's the what's your idea of the best way to scale a long term well first of all if we're gonna do a block size increase I don't believe we should just bump it up twice and then just leave it at that because then that's that's a precedent that every single time blocks fill up we're gonna do another hard for for that that just seems totally silly so first of all you know if we're gonna do a hard fork you know in in the worst of cases I would like to see at least like you know an X percent increase per year or something of the block size so we don't need to hard work every single time first of all and second of all I would love to see a more dynamic or more adaptive kind of system that responds to actual you know market dynamics and to have more protocol like and support other functions besides just paying miners like you know paying that relay nodes and paying validation paying for proofs you know there's ways for cryptographically generating like you know snarks or stuff like that maybe and and paying people using payment channels to be able to do that kind of stuff once you start to get those kinds of incentives now you're talking being able to you know increase the capacity to much higher levels without significantly degrading security so but but it sounds like so those are things I don't I haven't heard much about them and I don't really know much about them but I it does sound to me like they're probably further off and here we have this network that's been congested for a while and so maybe it is not a bad idea to you as you put a kick the can down the road and maybe let some of the other technology catch up so it can be implemented later is that but at what price though I mean if it splits the network and if it causes a lot of discord in the community and if the market if it affects the markets if they if the price you know this is very adversely affected is it really worth it just for like you know a small you know like what we were saying before already so much well I don't know about so much but a lot of economic activity is moving off Bitcoin like you know how many startups have I talked to you where they're moving from the coin to Assyria more like coin or whatever it is and we're like already the fact that there's this much congestion which maybe isn't you know critical from your perspective like it's enough where businesses are making other choices and they're not using the Bitcoin blockchain so I think that's why that's where the pragmatism comes in here and when we're talking about going from a one megabyte to a two megabyte block I mean let's be honest it's really effective 8 megabyte walk right I mean with seg wit so now it's not negligible but it's certainly not gonna last forever and I think the thing is it's like it's kind of what you were alluding to Laura is that you know if this does the least get everybody kind of like okay well now we're not like just like dwelling on I mean how much time did we waste on the block size debates just silly bucks on a debate right now I mean really I know it's more than that but still we can't get past it and people are leaving yeah some people were actually working on code though I'm working on solutions and working on optimizing a whole bunch of other crap that makes it possible to have bigger blocks so I mean you can't mount the effect you know like for instance Peter Willy worked on the sec P 256 library this is a library that increases validation you know they read reduces validation time considerably it's like a factor of six or something just from the mean the the cost of validating signatures for a block so this kind of stuff and then like the headers first think what she did like way before that also Peter Willy all these things and then you know Matt Corallo with like the fiber networks so that the miners are more able to easily relay blocks to each other and then there was those are brilliant technical solutions that the perception is not feeding out into the mainstream right and expanding the the ecosystem for Bitcoin that are making it more valuable they are not catching that so I don't know maybe there is some kind of communication issue gasps you're finishing up is there necessary they're prerequisites without this what will happen is that you'll run a node and you'll not be able to keep up with the blockchain it just will not sink you'll the blockchain will be advancing more quickly than your computer can keep up with it without these advances if we were to use Bitcoin core from just a couple of years ago it would not be able to keep up with today's blockchain so all these advances are going on and install these are necessary in order to be able to do a block size increase so we're running out of time someone's gonna ask you guys one last question which is that as we go forward you know every single design decision that we make in Bitcoin is gonna require some trade-offs so when you think about the different kinds of trade-offs that you're willing to make what what would you be willing to do to you know keep the network growing well I mean I think that it's you know obviously there's risks involved in anything that we're doing right now it's it's a huge project with the huge bounty it's one of the biggest like you know socio-economic experiments conducted in history probably and I think that you know there's a certain risk tolerance that different people are willing to take any what's yours well I personally would like to see good solutions to scaling I think there's some really great ideas but I would like to see more constructive dialogue first without people just jumping to like specific solutions that they think are because of the this is the problem Eric what trade-off are you willing to make what trade office oh I mean there's millions of different trade-offs depending on the situation right yeah definitely for sure I think the self sovereignty aspect and the ability to validate transactions for myself is a huge part of what I value in Bitcoin more than it which is more like that decentralized decentralisation philosophy yes but I would definitely like to grow the network and make it you know support way more I would just like to see better crypto so so I just want to draw that out so if that's your priority then the downside to that the trade-off that you're willing to make is maybe for because like essentially if we keep it that way than not one of the ways to do that be to keep the block size low which then is something I think that will cause a lot of problem for some of the bigger economic actors and potentially also long-term for the miners is that it's really I mean there could be ways to grow the block size they're actually smart that makes sense that we can get a lot of support for and like boom we do it it's just that the ways that have been you know called for so far are just like really brute force like blunts you know things that a lot of people think well you know is it really worth the risk a lot of people are not going to get behind it it's probably gonna cause a lot of contention and in potential market disruptions and is it really worth it for you know just like getting a 2x increase for instance if it was a thousand x I'd be like oh yeah maybe it is worth it but you know if my business is just gonna 2,000 X then you lose your decentralization priority no no no you could still do a thousand times the number of transactions without sacrificing decentralization with better crypto another protocol okay and Brian what about you what trade-offs are you willing to make I think you know I have tremendous respect for the fact that changing or protocol is is very it's very difficult and it's not something you should take lightly and I certainly think that's the case with the hard fork that's that's looming over us but I also think that there there is some value with trying to get all the most important actors in the ecosystem together to go at this and and be contributing because right now what you're seeing is a lot of people that are trying to like push against each other and it does it just we've seen several years of this back and forth and so it sounds like for you like you know you want to move forward at the risk of perhaps having a hard fork alright sorry a chain split i I think decentralisation is this weird turn that people throw out there but it's a gradient it's not black or white like there's different degrees of decentralisation and whether or not this hard fork to a two megabytes is going to dramatically impact true decentralization of Bitcoin I certainly personally don't think that that's going to impact it that much there are others that do they feel like they will kill Bitcoin but I think the most important thing is it's like that we just like kind of push through this we get it and we do what the market is asking for and right now we're seeing that people are asking for I quit and they're asking for another you know an increase in the hall and the block size and the second part we definitely know about seg would but the second question for Eric which is that you know this change that's happening was implemented essentially without even though core develop many core developers opposed it so after this where does that leave the core developers in terms of their power with the protocol well I mean let me let me just clear up a little bit what happened there I mean I feel that there's a lot of communication problems that have been communications are pretty bad for a long time I mean like for instance most of industry or most of the DCG portfolio companies I don't think even really realized like who most of the core developers were or even like met most of us like until fairly recently you know back in 2015 basically like you know they thought that they had like you know they did that the Bitcoin core had spokespeople and like a couple developers and and that they kind of represented Bitcoin core to the industry and industry didn't really come to talk to us about any of these concerns at all we kind of had to pick this up indirectly because other people were complaining right and so first of all I'd be really nice just like people in the industry that actually have concerns about this like would actually come in approaches and like talk to us about this these things before like making decisions and like doing full-on you know campaigns trying to push particular agendas because if we can kind of work on these things and again get more consensus beforehand it'll go a lot smoother so I'm just wondering like I think it encouraged me if I'm wrong the main developers behind segment 2x are Jeff garsik and Mike Bell she is that is that correct so Mike Bell she's I don't think is a developer it's mostly Jeff and some other contributors and the team so in Jeff is with block V loq and his C or sorry his co-founder Matt Rose AK was on the podcast earlier and then Mike bill she's with bit Co so you know they're they're kind of like shepherding this massive change through and so after that like where does that leave the core developers well I mean to be completely honest with you it was a very small number important Ella purrs it actually were like the ones that were that got advisory roles and companies a couple years ago and like we're kind of like lobbying for this kind of push for the for the you know the vast majority of the called development community and Bitcoin I'm not just talking about core developers I'm talking about all the people that work on a whole bunch of different you know other parts of Bitcoin or layers on top of Bitcoin Allah yeah I think for the most part were in agreement that we need to find a better smarter ways to scale but unfortunately this particular point of view did not really get represented very well to industry a couple years ago and so I think you know and it's kind of weird to see like what happened with Jeff because I think you know Jeff Garza cat the beginning of 2015 was actually very much aligned I think with with what most of the development to the protocol development community was looking for but then like towards the middle there was this very drastic change that occurred and you know unfortunately I think that he kind of burned a lot of bridges with a lot of the rest of the yes he's kind of behind this segue to X and yet he's burnt bridges and you guys kind of oppose to segue to X I just wonder where that leaves things afterward like do you guys still have as much control over the protocol is what depends on what people are gonna use I mean Bizet's it's really up to the users in the end what they decide Bitcoin is right all we can do is release code and see if people want to use it or not and that's we're gonna continue to do and if people want to use you know if people want to do a two megabyte hard fork and it seems like that's what the markets want and there's a huge demand for that I don't think it'll be that hard to meet that happen but I just don't see that right now and I but it doesn't it doesn't seem like good market wants that they want it when it's hard to forget that like when when block stream was announced as a company it had so many of the core devs on there and important people in Bitcoin that the market everybody was so excited about sidechains they would thought that was the future they thought block stream was like this big company is gonna come and help us save it they like they embrace that and for the last three years we just haven't seen the side chains come to fruition and solve any problems and yeah and I wasn't part of that at all I mean I thought it was interesting but I thought that it had a lot of logistical complications and there needed to be a whole infrastructure in place in order to support that and I thought that we were still several years away from that so when I worked on seg wit you know say the first one once it was first developed by Peter you know really was working on that it was really working who's working on it as a side chain but when I really got excited about sight but was when we realized that we could actually
