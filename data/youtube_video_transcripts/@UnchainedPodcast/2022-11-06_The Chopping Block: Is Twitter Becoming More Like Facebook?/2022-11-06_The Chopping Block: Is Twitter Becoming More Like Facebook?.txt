the actual decentralized alternative to Twitter today which is de facto Macedon is still like a tiny nothing that nobody really cares about I mean it's cool it's an awesome project but in reality it's like so small compared to what Twitter is I I don't know it feels to me a little bit it feels a bit too shrill right now and obviously we don't know what changes Elon is going to make he's talked about freezing moderation decisions until they construct some kind of council and that council is going to be making like very large important moderation decisions for the platform which is basically exactly what Facebook has if I recall and so essentially Twitter is going to become more like Facebook which I'm not sure really how radical that is and also for some reason do people perceive it as radical on both sides like I think on the on the right people are like wow that's like a radical change of open free speech and on the left they're like oh that's a radical you know reversion to allowing hate speech and all these other horrible things happen to my mind it's basically turning Twitter into Facebook
