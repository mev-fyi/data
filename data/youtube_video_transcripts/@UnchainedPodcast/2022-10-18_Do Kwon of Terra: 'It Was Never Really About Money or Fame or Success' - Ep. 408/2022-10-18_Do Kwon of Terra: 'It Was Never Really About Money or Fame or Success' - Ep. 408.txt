hi all ever since Tara Luna collapsed in the spring there have been a number of questions about what happened exactly and how much culpability terraform lab's co-founder dokwan has interest in his case ratcheted up in September when South Korea issued a warrant for his arrest doe at the time did not turn himself in and the former Singapore Resident was reported to no longer be in the city-state even Interpol may now be on the hunt for him I had assumed to doe wouldn't talk to the media due to his court case but he surprised me last week when he agreed to come on the show I approached the interview with an open mind on whether Tara had been a fraud or not meaning I try to keep an open mind to both possibilities my main intention was to reveal more information that could let legal experts decide those questions I divided the interview into a few main categories starting with his legal case then probing him about various allegations that could potentially point to fraud and then finally wrapping up with some questions for users and also about his personal situation given the time constraints I had on the investigative portion I did the best I could and during the interview I tried to push back if I felt he hadn't answered my question as doe himself said in the interview transparency and information are important and I hope that this interview helps in the effort to understand exactly what happened with Terra Luna now here's my conversation with Doe foreign welcome to Unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host Laura Shin author of The

Laura thanks for having me thanks for agreeing to do this you are one of the creators of Tara the algorithmic stablecoin that collapsed in May wiping out 60 billion dollars in value between Tara and its sister coin Luna a South Korean court has issued a warrant for your arrest and even said that Interpol issued a red notice for you which is a request for law enforcement worldwide to arrest you why have you not returned to Korea well so just to set the facts straight we are currently requesting uh made a request to check on the status of the red notice but as far as I understand it is not an international restaurant and a state so explicitly in its website so um you know every Sovereign Nation can interpret a red notice the way that it sees fit a second point of clarification is since the end of last year I haven't been living in South Korea so it wouldn't be accurate to say returning to South Korea the more accurate point would be would I travel to South Korea yes and I agree with you that I reached out to Interpol twice to request confirmation about the red notice and have not heard anything so but did you similarly not hear anything back so as you can imagine this isn't um like an area so first of all I'm not a lawyer or like a law enforcement official and specifically even within that like how red notices work is something that I don't really understand very well but we haven't heard anything back yet there is an appeals process to contest even if it has been granted so we'll do everything that we can to make clarifications and make sure that this comes to a better result and so South Korean Court did Issue this warrant for your arrest and the charges are based on the capital markets act in Korea what do you think of those charges so the thing about you know like the capital markets Act is sort of the financial regulatory Authority in Korea is something called the FSC the Financial Services Commission which is I think from a U.S analog it's a amalgamation of the uh the SEC and the cftc but more from like a you know devising Financial regulation perspective rather than the enforcement part so there's a separate subsidiary organization that a civilian that handles the enforcement portions but generally the FSC sets policy and the consistent stance of you know the Korean government uh has been that and even from the Financial Services Commission directly is that cryptocurrencies are not Securities and securities as the way that they're defined in Korea is different from the way that it's defined in you know the US for instance and that it is not within the ambits of their jurisdiction to regulate cryptocurrency for that reason more specifically right now the the South Korean national legislature is in the process of devising uh specific regulation for cryptocurrency so we are a little bit disappointed in the way that prosecutors are attempting to you know create new regulation through criminal enforcement proceedings whereas that really should be within the job description of the legislature where at the very least the financial regulators yeah I would say your comments here are in accord with a crypto lawyer that I had on the show at South Korean crypto lawyer John pack Park who talked about how the reasoning behind the prosecutor's charges they're not something that you know is explicitly stated by the FSC and so and in fact it wasn't even detailed in the charges but I was curious so it appears am I wrong in thinking that the reason you have not answered the arrest warrant or or tell me have you not answered the arrest warrant because you disagree with these charges or don't find them to be legitimate we haven't seen a copy of the arrest warrants so every piece of data that we're consuming regarding this is from the media which as you can imagine in a situation like this it's kind of hectic and there's a lot of contradictory information so but I I thought that there was a PDF posted for you because they couldn't physically deliver it to you right yeah so I haven't seen a copy of this PDF so besides application of the capital markets act we haven't been able to see you know what specific charges that we might be facing we don't think that any of the charges pertaining to you know the capital markets Act is applicable because the government stance has been that you know cryptocurrencies shouldn't be governed by Capital markets act like they're not Securities that new regulation which several people in government have already indicated should be favorable to encourage the growth of digital assets in the country we don't believe that that those are legitimate charges and are politically motivated and so is that why I noticed that in August you told the Korea times you would cooperate with the investigation but is that essentially what changed that once the charges came out that you felt these are not legitimate no we we are cooperating so for instance like the South Korean prosecutors have asked for you know clarifications or supporting documents for various different types of things I I'm not out of Liberty to disclose what exact documents that we have been producing but we've been cooperating with all the document requests uh in the capacity okay so you were living in Singapore at the time of the collapse and Zach Guzman of coinage said that he interviewed you in Singapore in August however on September 17th Reuters reported that the Singaporean police said that you are no longer in the city-state and within the hour after that report came out you tweeted that you were not on the Run and roughly a week later you also tweeted yeah as I said I'm making zero effort to hide so these tweets would seem to imply that you're still in Singapore are you in Singapore or are you not well so just to clarify from the media reports that we've read the main allegation regarding as to whether I'm on the run has been that I left to Singapore in in pre-meditation of the crash that would happen in May but that is absolutely not true so there's been reports as to you know how we shut down a Korean subsidiary I think it was like in April or something like that and you know like various different team members uh from tfl similarly moved to Singapore to set up headquarters around that time but that is simply not true so we have I mean well you were still in Singapore in August so obviously it's not but what happened in September or did you move out of Singapore the main reason why I don't want to talk about my location to the media is because when the crash happened in May there were lots of situations where personal security was threatened right and uh so for instance uh people broke into you know my apartment building even multiple cases in which that was televised across you know my home in South Korea as well as my home in Singapore several of these people were reporters and several of these people were just regular people against whom I felt like a fair degree of uh threats to personal security and privacy so it's it's not in the interest of let's say being on the run or something like that that I don't want to disclose where I live it's just that every time the location where I live becomes known it becomes almost impossible for me to live there but can you at least answer whether or not you're in Singapore no I mean so I I could answer that but the problem is that I don't want there to be a bunch of guesswork in terms of like which country and like um which city or like where I happen to be living in and these things are fairly easy to find right I have businesses I have people that I meet so the easier that I make it for people to figure out my location the harder it is for me to continue regular life when it was reported that the South Korean Korean government said that Interpol had issued this red notice for you you tweeted for something that has notice in the name it sure gives no notice and you talked about how you try to search for the red notice and found nothing and obviously you just mentioned that you've tried to verify this but similarly after it was reported that the Korean authorities had Frozen 67 million dollars of your own funds you tweeted what has been probably the most surprising in all this is the amount of misinformation that gets spread there is no cash out as alleged I haven't used qcoin or okxen at least the last year and no funds of tfl lft or any other entities have been frozen so with these tweets are you basically accusing the South Korean government of lying about these things saying that the reports aren't true right I don't know if their intentions were to mislead I don't know if it was a simple mistake but there's just simply too many things that are not true that are coming uh Korea side for uh that I think you know across the board given how high profile this is does not serve in the interest of clarifying truth to everyone so for instance we would read media reports like uh dokwan is on the Run which is absolutely not true we went through proper procedures to pay all residual taxes and uh applying for employment visas in Singapore and things like that to go so obviously there's no reason why any government official would think that we fled to Singapore you know even though it was the year prior when we made the move or for instance like to say that our funds were that my funds were frozen I really have not used you know qcoin or okx or done any trading in those platforms uh at least as far as I can remember and I definitely don't have any funds there and if they froze I I don't remember the amount but if it's like 67 million I think I definitely would have noticed we're just uncomfortable with the amount of you know misinformation that is coming out and we think it's been consistent throughout you know the last few months you said in that recent interview with coinage that the Luna Foundation guard only has 313 Bitcoin but Ergo BTC which is um this on chain sleuth who um is actually like really really good um tracked the Bitcoin wallets of the lfg and concludes that actually LG has more than 313 Bitcoin and also that since September 15th wallets associated with lfg have been depositing roughly 65 million dollars worth of bitcoin into kucoin and okx and the Argo BTC said that um they were able to confirm the identity associated with these wallets because actually they've been used by lft back in 2021 and at the conclusion um he says if this analysis were incorrect we would expect to see a large whale or OTC complaining of unjustly seized funds and obviously there have been no reports of that so what do you say to this evidence that your or lfg's funds are actually Frozen at these exchanges well so I I think one of the things that people don't understand at you know trade agreements of this scale is that just because you know Bitcoin is being transferred doesn't mean that that naked Bitcoin has to be sure you know sold on a spot exchange so for example just because like Bitcoin is being used to defend UST Peg does not mean that somebody would put it into let's say like a PTC against UST pair and buy that asset directly there can be intermediary steps so for instance there's been allegations that we moved lfg funds into a Gemini custody wallet and then it's you know sitting there or something like that but all we did was to confirm a trade with a market maker and transfer the Bitcoin to an address that the market Maker's instruction so uh likely what would happen in situations like this because the market was crashing the market maker could simply take custody of that Bitcoin and use an equivalent amount in other assets that they might have ready at the exchanges so it could be like usdt or USBC uh whichever trading pair would exist in the changes that they want to trade and they would use those funds to acquire the US key and so but I feel like you're not answering this direct question which really is about some so you know as you mentioned earlier we were talking about the South Korean government saying that these funds were frozen but now I'm presenting you with more like on-chain evidence that shows a similar amount of money that was at these exchanges are you asking the question as to whether the funds were actually Frozen but I'm also asking what do you say to this analysis that shows that these wallets are associated with lfg and have much more than the 313 Bitcoin that you claimed so that's that that's not true so lfg the only Bitcoin that it holds is 313. I know but what about like tfl or you personally any entity associated with Terra Luna uh all right so are you asking whether tfl or myself has um Bitcoin well this 65 million dollars worth that was deposited into kucoin and okx like over a video call I wouldn't be able to identify like an on-chain audit Trail or something to that effect but what would be helpful is we've hired a sort of an on-chain analysis company and we've worked with them to provide uh all the trading data at lfg so they should be publishing report shortly which I think is going to provide a lot more clarity so there isn't any embezzlement or you know theft of funds or anything to that effect that seems to be cycling through the media and when do you expect that report to be released uh I think we're in their closing phases so they've gone through all the data I think they're just writing the report so I think it should be over the next couple weeks okay a lot of people have talked about the like an arrogance of your tweets during the time that Tara was on the upswing and you later said of these tweets that you had developed an entertaining Alter Ego do you feel any remorse for your cocky tone during that time so I I think I got carried you know too much carried away with interacting with other people on crypto Twitter so like the industry lingo for this is called  posting right so I think in retrospect I should have helped myself to uh sort of a more stringent standard so you know just because there's Anonymous cartoon characters that are shall we say more liberal with the words that they're using does not mean that I should have followed suit I so I think sort of the trigger that led me to be quite active on Twitter or something like that is you know in personal life I am quite a bit of an introvert so uh when I first started Tara you know there was not that much communication with media or Twitter which wasn't necessarily a big problem because there weren't too many people wanting to talk to us anyway but then over time you know as character there was more of a pull from the community to be more open and Frank about my thoughts and opinions and be more transparent about the things that we're working on so over time you know Twitter became the medium by which I started to deliver those news either over um you know Twitter spaces or you know Twitter threads and engaging with other people on Twitter and um I I think sort of like how I developed that Persona uh over time is I I do think it was largely for entertainment value because it it was fun you know joking and share posting like um other individuals on Twitter while I was doing it but um even for myself personally when I go back in time and then when I'm presented with a tweet that I would have written a couple years ago it is quite cringe and um and uh people have told me to take them down but I do think it's worthwhile just keeping them on there you know just for record keeping and posterity purposes fat man Tara posted some stories of people who had lost a lot of money in Tara there was one man who said he had a malignant tumor and he had received fifty thousand dollars from insurance for therapy but then he lost 90 percent of it in Anchor someone else lost a quarter of a million dollars a lot of these people had young children Taiwan news reported that a man in Taiwan who had two million dollars in Terra um had that value plunged to about a thousand dollars and committed suicide here's your opportunity to say something to the people who lost what many cases was their life savings um here's your opportunity to say something to a family who lost members to Suicide what do you want to say to them oh so whatever issues existed with Kara's design its weakness to respond to you know sort of the cruelty of the markets it's my responsibility and my responsibility alone so for the community that engaged with the care ecosystem used its steps you know sent tokens and coins into uh its many protocols the the downfall of the companies that chose to build on Terra uh for the people that you know chose to work on the ecosystem and for you know the hundreds of thousands if not millions of people that used you know Tara currency uh you know the Terra ecosystem which was all built on the stability of UST I own up to that responsibility fully and it's it's not easy I I think the hardest thing about the current situation is having to contend with you know so much astronomical loss it's it's it's it's quite hard to put into words but the the scale of the sort of the financial and emotional and economic damage that that happened here uh is is not easy to live with I want to ask one follow-up question to that which is so you said that you take full responsibility I didn't hear words like I'm sorry or I apologize but do you want to offer an apology oh yes I I am sorry I I think and it could seem you know with the way that we've been responding to allegations and use reports and things like that that were being defensive or something like that but that is absolutely not the case I believed in the stability of UST and I do understand that my beliefs and statements about how stable and safe USD would be led a lot of uh you know Traders and you know holders without the tools to understand the complex economic mechanisms uh underpinning UST to gain confidence in a system that ultimately failed and I I do apologize and I do own up to you know the full responsibility of that the only thing that we are attempting to do is that in the process of people dealing with this grief uh there's been a lot of people making allegations like you know it was a fraud or dopon probably shorted UST or there was theft or investment going on and I just want to I I think it's like not not even from like my personal perspective but there are people that are still in the Terra ecosystem and continuing to build things and um there are lots even for the people in grief I think it is important for their closure uh for them to have a correct representation of what exactly happened right and while it is easy to think this entire thing crashed because it was a scam or to point fingers to you know somebody and just assume there was some theft going on or something like that that was absolutely not the case it's it's probably really hard for this to resonate in in this current time but I've been a Founder in crypto for the last five years I you know hold the transparency openness and the Integrity of this industry quite highly and you know even to this day I am proud of the way of the Integrity by which uh we sort of tried to create our protocols the work that we did and the values that we tried to defend um so it's in the interest of providing transparency and the truth of the things that's made happened not to say that we ultimately created a protocol that ended up failing and destroyed billions of dollars in value um sole broadcasting system or SVS news uh one of the biggest broadcasters in Korea reported that the National Tax Service in Korea confirmed that you had moved the profits from your coin trading from Singapore from your Singapore Corporation to the Virgin Islands and that also you donated coins to your family to purchase an apartment how do you feel about you and your family making off well financially when so many Tera users lost large sums of money or even family members to suicide uh so my family members were like my wife for instance doesn't own any real estate I I do own an apartment in Seoul we we didn't move funds from the Singapore to the British Virgin Islands just the corporate structure has set up such that they there's a Singapore holding company and there's a BDI subsidiary uh that performs most of the crypto operations and if you look at many crypto companies that were established during the same time period so tfl was created during a time where there wasn't a clear accounting standard for how to account for crypto tokens whereas BBI came up with the framework much earlier than the common Accounting Standards did so a lot of companies that were created in Singapore during that time were structured exactly the same way so we didn't move any crypto to the British Virgin Islands um any crypto that was created by tfl originated in the British Virgin Islands and there was no movement that funds the other way if that makes sense okay so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about certain business decisions which will give you the

podcasts back to my conversation with Doe Korean news Outlet jtbc reported that one of the core developers of anchor recommended that the interest rate on anchor be 3.6 percent but that a week before launch they found out the yields would be 20 determined by you and when they suggested that it be lowered he refused why did you refuse so that's that's absolutely not true so one of the interesting things is like the the people that came on some of the Korean shows and claimed to be core developers of tfl or anchor literally just interns and if you look through GitHub or any of the you know documentation or anything that we would have published in open source or anything to that effect um not uh not a single line of code uh came from their contribution so I struggled to see how they can claim themselves for developers of anchor so to to contextualize how anchor came about it was you know it was being contemplated throughout 2020 and it launched in the early days of 2021. and during those days if you took a look at what was happening in D5 20 was not actually not extremely high yield so you remember doing D5 summer when a lot of the yields across defy were three digit four-digit percentage type of yield uh in fact when we were raising Venture Capital around the ANC token for the first time the most common feedback that we heard was looking at the comparables of FIFA yields at such a high rate like do you think anchor could actually get any users and that was the primary concern uh around the time that anchor launched now the issue was Anchor's main value proposition was that the yields would change more slowly over time like over something called The Anchor raid which is governance determined so the one of the main problems that it sought out to solve in the beginning was that it would take what was previously very volatile yields that were coming from you know crypto money markets like compounds or Ave and then attempt to stabilize it over time so that it would be easier to use in other protocols and for average users and that's I think been one of the biggest problems with anchor right because defy yields as you know pressure to almost zero as crypto Markets started to slow down over time and liquidity can form that very quickly and then anchor wasn't able to change its rates in line with the rest of the market such that there became a lot of let's say trading funds or you know market makers that were buying uh UST at very large sizes to be able to farm a yield but you know in the beginning like even internally a lot of the questions came down to is this yield going to be attractive enough such that people and other protocols which used to integrate with anchor coin does Korea confirmed that Tara had a pre-mine of 1 billion sdt which was a terrorist stable coin that was pegged to the value of the imf's special drawing rights basket or SDR and at that time strs were worth about a dollar forty meaning that terraform Labs had essentially been able to print 1.4 billion dollars out of thin air now this fact actually wasn't explicitly or officially disclosed for the public to easily see or know about in a way you could sort of say it was hidden in plain sight additionally it looks like investor decks and the Terra white paper did not mention this and conversions that were being made of these sdts to Korean Won Terra or KRT were actually being censored on the Terra station block Explorer and they were only visible on Independent block explorers so why not be upfront about the minting of the sdts from the start with the SVT issue I think the major confusion that people have is so like if you went to pair station which is the main wallet of the Terra ecosystem there's a dashboard page and the amount of stt that existed in issuance was visible there the whole time so in the beginning when the tear blockchain launched there was the main block explorers were uh you know Terra station or uh terra.state.id and in both of those things the existence of SVT was very clearly disclosed at the Genesis events we had a conversation with validators as to why sdt needs to exist and there's a pretty clear reason so the way that UST operates or you know back in those days I guess you know karate or some other stable coins like MNT is that there's a market swap mechanism to create uh UST by burning Luna and vice versa redeeming UST into Luna and how these swaps work is that there's a virtual amm pool uh such that you know when a certain side of the trade is being favored the exchange rate changes quadratically similar to how you would see prices change in places like uniswa for sushi Swap and so on and so forth now the issue was that for an amm like this the amount of stable coins that you can effectively Mint or redeem would depend very strongly on the amount of liquidity that would exist for Luna on off chain exchanges so which meant that like in the very beginning it was very hard for us to estimate how much liquidity for Luna would exist because it's impossible to predict such a thing but at the same time in the very beginning when there was no Luna liquidity there needed to be a way to be able to create parastable coins because the entire points of Terror as a project was to be able to create stable coins and if you needed to pay let's say a 10 fee to create like a thousand dollars worth of stable coins for instance the system wouldn't function very well so it was a whole river system to make sure that various different apps that were being created on Pera uh which in the beginning was largely being driven by the efforts of tfl would be able to gain access to stable coins without having to pay some ridiculous fees or pass those fees onto consumers so you mentioned that it was visible that these stts existed but as I mentioned this wasn't something that was talked about in the white paper or the investment decks and the conversions of sdt to KRT were as I mentioned they were censored on the Terra station block Explorer so again you know this is like what I said in the question that it was sort of hidden in plain sight like if you knew where to look you could find it but like other than that it wasn't kind of more proactively disclosed so why not well so for example if you look at Tara's white paper it doesn't actually describe anything like tokenomics it's so it's it's written in a high level way that describes how UST can be created and minted and why a decentralized algorithmic stable coin is an important thing for the industry so uh it didn't go into token supplies or how the Genesis token event would be distributed or anything to that effect we intended for it to be written in the format of more of an academic white paper as to why this particular algorithm for creating decentralized currency was important and exciting in terms of let's say investor Decks that we used in the pre-sale we had multiple versions of this right so we hadn't contemplated on the need for a stablecoin Reserve at the very beginning because we hadn't fully worked out how everything would work when we first started doing let's say pre-sales of Luna so in the later versions of how we socialize this that the need to create a stablecoin reserve the tune of about a billion dollars is clearly stated and why were the sdt conversions to KRT not visible on the Terra station block Explorer I I don't think we've blocked any conversions of SKT to KRT or anything like that in fact I've seen block Explorer links to finder circulating when people wanted to ask us questions for what exactly sdp was for instance so I'm guessing it was visible we made no effort to censor any type of transaction on the finder block Explorer whatsoever and it's open source right so how the finder code base is managed is that everything is open source and then it's pushed into finder about terabyte money reversal so even the deployment is handled through GitHub so whatever censorship that we would have done would have been very apparent for other people to see because everything that was worked on by tfl post launch has been open source and other people could View and audit it right and as I mentioned I did see a block Explorer showing no transactions you know for that conversion and then for the same uh from a different block Explorer an independent one I I was able to see that so obviously and well as you described you were using this these sdts to obtain some different stable coins you know to you were talking about like liquidity um but so what did you do with the stable coins that you were obtaining uh with the sdt um so the needs changed throughout time right so for instance I think when UST first started to take off and the on-chain liquidity for Luna wasn't sufficient yet I I think the all-time high for UST was about a dollar and nine cents so during times in which like the on-chain UST creation mechanism would not be sufficient to be able to let's say bring down the price of USD to the dollar peg in the early days we used those SVT reserves to bring down UST price in the very beginning of the process a part of the SVT reserves were used to allow chai to gain access to charity you know like the idea there being that huge slippers costs on an exchange for a payment system to run wouldn't make sense so it was making stable coins available for the apps as well as making sure that USD was pegged and so if you're saying that you needed these stable coins to keep the peg you know at parity with the dollar then is that an admission that you knew that the algorithm was insufficient to maintain the peg no that's that's not what I mean so what I mean is if you look at how like the virtual amm like the UST creation mechanism works it's bounded by how liquid Luna happens to be and that's because how this virtual amm works is that there is an oracle that is Reading in the price of Luna denominated in various different currency pegs so the price of Luna and KRW US dollar SDR and so on and so forth and then how the slops work is that around that Oracle reference price the price actually um you know moves up and down quadratically depending on which side of the trade is being favored by the ammo now the issue is like when the blockchain is first launched in the initial phases you can't create a lot of stable coins because Luna is a new Young asset is not liquid and over time as lunar becomes more liquid the minting and the Redemption capabilities of Paris stable points goes up but in the very beginning like in order to you know allow apps and other types of things to be able to gain access to stable coins like it's important for the entire system to not be bounded to a few hundred dollars or a few thousand dollars of minting capacity because of what the liquidity conditions looks like uh for the Luna token right and later down the line when Luna became extremely liquid I think I've seen daily trading volumes of like four billion dollars six billion dollars uh in certain situations like the minting capacity was able to be raised significantly through governance through the tune of I think maybe like 120 million dollars a day um something to that effect so the system scaled well throughout time in initially it needed help bootstrapping and so I guess like the one thing is that I feel that this sort of shows you were using market operations at least to the beginning and maybe could you put a time frame on that like when did you stop using market operations to maintain the peg well so for something like chai It's not a market operation right it's it's you know I know I'm talking about UST right so it just gradually became not a market operation right so what what I mean by this is like over time the trading volumes for UST and Luna prove so much that whatever trading that we did from time to time was a negligible percentage of like overall volume decentralization didn't happen because we stopped doing a particular thing it just happened because the ecosystem grew very very large and I think one of the things that people are forgetting you know in the light of recent events is that like UST was one of the largest and the most liquid stable coins and Luna was one of the largest uh proof of stake networks in the world right so as a function of doing that our interest in uh terms of you know trading USB and Luna you know shifted from let's say you know wanting to maintain pegs so we're making sure that enough liquidity was available and things like that it shifted more towards investing in various different types of projects that would launch on Paris so we might take like an interest in acquiring something like you know ask report for instance but but here we are talking about how you were using these sdts to obtain stable coins which would help you maintain the Peg and then you know so maybe at a certain point you stopped that but then later on with the new plan um you know last year to maintain the peg through this BTC backstop isn't that sort of the same thing and isn't that again this notion that through market operations you need to maintain the peg because the algorithm would not do it on its own oh so one of the things that people misunderstand about lfg is that a lot of people think that lfg's role would be an active Market maker so that's not how it was designed at all so the initial goal was lfg to you know to raise large amounts of BTC by selling Luna to you know venture capital or um you know other people and then the idea would be that this BTC would be bridged over to the Terra blockchain such that it would be a secondary way of minting and redeeming UST not just Luna so the goal was that we would have BTC so you could you could mint UST by putting in more BTC into this on chain reserve and vice versa you would be able to take out uh BTC by Redeeming the uski against it and the goal was to set this up for multiple currencies so for instance uh we had acquired um like a 100 million dollar position in avalanche uh to be able to do the same thing with avax tokens so the eventual goal was to get to a state where UST would be backed by every large and promising cryptocurrency now the issue was that while the BTC bridge and The the Reserve mechanism was being worked on by various teams the crisis struck in me so we had a choice so we had the choice of either not deploying the BTC right because that's not what we originally intended to do with it or we could try to deploy it to you know absorb what we thought then would be a short-term Market volatility I think given in the light of things that actually happened people think that Terra was designed to be a system where lfg would just act as a market maker to defend USP Peg and that is absolutely not the way that it was designed at all evidence shows that you or tfl or lfg used abracadabra's Degen box to cash out billions of dollars worth of UST into harder stable coins such as usdt with d10 box you could stay collateral to buy UST then you could put that into anchor for the yields and then use the AUST to borrow more UST which you could then again put back into anchor and et cetera et cetera thereby amassing a ton of UST and then when it came to the DJ unbox there were liquidity providers that were incentivized by spell rewards to provide a ton of liquidity in the curve pool and that then made it easier for you or anyone to cash out of UST for a stablecoin called MIM magic internet money without it having harm the UST Peg so there are multiple people that have showed that these wallets associated with you or tfl or lft cashed out 2.7 billion dollars worth of UST for MIM the vast majority of which were turned into usdt summoned to usdc and that money was then sent to exchanges such as binance kucoin huobi okx and others what do you have to say about this evidence which is available on Dune analytics and this notion that you cashed out 2.7 billion dollars worth of UST in a short period okay so I think what people misunderstand uh is tfl cannot create UST out of thin air so I think the primary question that they should be asking is where did the USD come from the sdt reserve was already decommissioned by the point that magic internet money came around so basically in terms of design box the only thing that we did was digimox was actually quite destructive to UST because when uh design box was going up essentially when crypto markets were on the up and up it would make it more difficult to Mint UST because there were a lot of people trying to Mint it and then on the downside magic interior money kind of operated like like a multi-sig-based hedge fund so during I think the MIM crisis of let's say February this year I think the Abracadabra team just basically sold down um all of their UST on I think a companion app called Popsicle or something to that effect I think hundreds of millions of dollars in like a couple of transactions so I think in terms of that volatility it's not something that helped repair ecosystem at all but whatever transactions that we did against Min selling UST into usdt and then acquire Luna with that usdt mint more UST and then so on and so forth against you know decent box and the way that dijonbox worked was quite insane So like um you you would allow minting capabilities on on visionbox and then there would be so many people that were coming in from places like Tick Tock and things like that and buying out that entire capacity in a matter of seconds and really UST doesn't handle those situations particularly well as you can imagine because its minting mechanism is based on amm pricing so it's it's not that I I think people confuse trading volume with cashing out money and tfl did Supply you know UST into dijan box so that us key wouldn't depeg but it wasn't definitely not a situation where we cashed out 2.7 billion dollars or anything to that effect and did you cash out any amount of money are you disputing the 2.7 billion dollars or that you cashed out at all using DJ inbox if you're asking the question whether tfl ever sold any UST or luna yes we definitely did but I I think people are sort of drawing conclusions based on incomplete on-chain data we definitely did sell Luna and UST over time to be able to fund operations but you sold them for MIM which he then turned into usdt generally how we would you know sell something like Luna or usbp would be either by using OTC or if we needed funds quickly just sell it on a centralized exchange so you never use this mechanism that I described with Mim no we did use Min but that that was an Arbitrage mechanism right so like 2.7 billion dollars or um anything to that effect was not uh something that tfl use to catch up money or or anything like that so one of your defenses in the coinage interview was that failure is not fraud I think I also saw this in a Wall Street Journal article about you however Tech in Asia reported that in May right after Tara's collapse chai claimed that its partnership the one in which it was using Tara for its back-end operations had been discontinued however it actually turned out as technician discovered that this relationship had actually been terminated all the way back in 2020 and taken technicia asserted that in the intervening years Tara and chai kept users in the dark about this in fact in 2021 you tweeted multiple times about one of Tara's use cases being chai for instance you said that chai and meme pay contributed 2.5 million users to Terra that same year you claimed on the defiant podcast that 2.6 million Koreans were using Tara stable coins for payments and in March of 22 which is just you know half a year ago you noted that chai used Terror stable coins on the pump podcast and it turns out so chai and Tara did have some kind of marketing partnership in 2021 but there was so little volume nowhere near millions of people that eventually this was discontinued just after a few months so why did you continue to claim that chai brought millions of users to Tara during a time when not only that that wasn't true but that it even couldn't be true because that initial arrangement with chai had ended okay so in in terms of chai terminating its support for the Terra blockchain it's actually something a notice that they put out in March 19th of 2022. so they they put out the post then that they would be terminating Tara support because of lack of usership right so um what is true is that in 2020 Daniel left TFO So Daniel shouldn't uh my ex-co-founder left tfl to focus on child full-time and then I stepped away from chai which was a company that I also co-founded to focus on tfl in terms of usership chai bid you know get to 2.5 million users or something in that range but it is true that in 2021 and I think in 2022 usership had tapered off as um it had you know started to focus on other business lines like a payment Gateway which had nothing to do with crypto it's called import as well as like a new more you know crypto based business sign that they had been contemplating so it so I I did mention uh from time to time that you know for example Daniel Shin was no longer you know uh working at tfl and is focusing on child it's not something that we advertised loudly right because a lot of it didn't really seem like one of those things that you know really mattered all that much I I considered myself to have been a more act the more active co-founder uh in building both of those companies so in terms of day-to-day operations it didn't really have that much of an impact uh but so why did you continue in 2021 multiple times to say that chai was bringing 2.5 million users to Terra or that 2.6 million Koreans use Tara stable coins for payment you know even in March of this year you were saying similar things why did you continue to do that well so um in in terms of chai usership um I had limited visibility into how exactly many users would be able to do it um so there was a service called chiscan that tracked exactly how many number of wallets were actually using chai so by 2021 I think that number had fallen to something like you know 700 000 or 800 000 or or something to that effect it's it's like a Top Line number that I remembered from the days in which I was using chai and I think I should have been more consistent with the way that if you know fact check numbers uh because generally like the idea is that for a payments company like you don't think that users are going to you know decline over time like generally they go up and up or at least they stay stable and even when they go down it happens over a really long period of time I I think that's more of a function of me you know having stepped away from China and not being part of day-to-day active management or like even really being invited to board meetings is definitely you know um shortfalls on my part there and so was chai transaction data visible on a Terra block Explorer on the Terra blockchain yes so people have noticed that the transaction volume didn't really change over that period despite the um you know ending of these relationships so was terraform Labs faking that chai transaction data on the blockchain whatever transactions are written to the Terra blockchain is written by chai right so there's been like allegations like for instance you know there's been statements that were made to the Korean media about like how Daniel and I had like a personal Fallout or like chai uh and Tara have no relationship and even like statements that contradict facts of announcements that were made to users so it's definitely true that'll notice in March of 2022 that they would be terminating the usage of you know like the Terra blockchain I think that's more like in the interest of I mean like as you can understand like like after everything that's happened people would want to distance themselves away from Terror especially if you're in Korea because you want to minimize you know attention and you know liability and I think a lot of those statements are more in that interest rather than like of what actually transpired and while I wish things would have been different like I can't fault people for wanting to minimize personal risk during times like this for this question I would like to credit the Stellar reporting of coindesk's Sam Kessler in a June 2019 hard Fork of Tara there was no public discussion but a line in the code for the new blockchain essentially amended the blockchain's Genesis file to change the wallet address of a Terra investor TransLink Capital perhaps because it had lost the private keys to its address so this is a very similar move to the one that occurred with the Dow hard Fork on ethereum where people now call that in a regular State change essentially the money was moved in this irregular fashion from one place to another however as I'm sure you're well aware the ethereum community had extensive conversations about this on the internet um I mean it really was kind of a moment to moment just you know people were constantly online discussing this and the decision was one that was very clearly communicated to the community however when Tara did this essentially you know very similar move with this June 2019 hard Fork it appears that terraform Labs sort of unilaterally decided to allocate these new coins to TransLink capital and didn't have the community weigh in on it why did tfl make this decision without having a public discussion uh well so I I do remember a public discussion but like you you have to remember that in 2019 when Tara first launched look there was no meaningful Community to the size of ethereum when that happened so like it's not so much that there was a lack of discussion it's just that the community was just a handful of people you know back in those days like 2019 was no I mean you you I I don't think you were in crypto in 2016 but ethereum was not even a year old at that time you know the Dow hack happened basically um 10 months into ethereum's life so I don't think it's that dissimilar I keep going yeah but I I think it was even smaller than that like if you went into you know Terrace telegram room it was mostly Bots and maybe they were like you know five or six people that were talking and then everybody else was just lurking um so uh for instance so basically with respect to transient Capital we created sort of a web interface that asked you know pre-sale participants to create a new wallet using station and to supply the wallet address to that web interface now what we you know couldn't verify was whether a wrong address had been inputted because of an issue with the software or because like you know transient Capital lost the keys or something to that effect but the way that the Terra blockchain works is that tfl can't unilaterally decide to do an upgrade like it's each of the validators would read through the code uh it's it's it's basically a migration script that upgrades the blockchain from one state to the other and then they decide as to whether they're going to upgrade software at a given block time or not there are cases in which validators refuse to upgrade software especially in the case of let's say an emergency software update where like only the binary is provided but the source code is updated later in order to prevent the hacker of misusing that information prior to the upgrade having completed right so it's it's essentially a validator driven process and when we made this decision because we weren't sure whose fault it was in the very early days of the network to provide a fresh address it did come up in validated discussions there were some people that were uncomfortable with it but General consensus during that time was yeah I mean it's not a big deal as if you don't know whose fault it is we should just go ahead and do it and that's how the network update happened validators and Cosmos can be quite stubborn just because you tell them to do something doesn't mean that they do it after Tara crashed it was revealed that you were part of another algorithmic stablecoin basis cache which failed to reach dollar parity and eventually fell to a value of below a penny why were you so confident and frankly arrogant about Tara when you had this other experience with an algorithmic stablecoin that failed spectacularly so I I think I discussed in the coinage interview but basically the way that TAF 4 Labs you know did work is it's it sort of became kind of an accelerator that would create lots of different apps and that's sort of like the mental model by which I operate so for example out of tfl came you know apps like you know pylon which used to be like a yield based I forget what they're called but you you buy tokens through yield and we also created things like you know anchor we create a mirror we created you know from our alumni Network came things like Atlas and satin and things like that so generally speaking if somebody becomes entrepreneurial and then wants to do something we we throw full support and and just let them so the context here on basis cache is that when we first brought in like the initial team that would start to build anchor it was actually like um maybe a five or six person team but we found that only one person had the interest and sort of the mechanism design skills to be able to work on anchor whereas the other people were sort of unmotivated and not really excited about the things that were going on what they did is they were spending a lot of time you know like yield farming defy around that time which is not something that I had too much experience doing so the the lucky thing is that these guys brought in data points about how you know this thing called like yam Finance or you know yearn and those things would work and that's sort of how I first became an active user and became acclimated to D5 and then over time uh they said I we we would like to take a protocol that had never launched something called basis which I think shut down in 2018 or something like that and and then said they wanted to do an implementation of the basis protocol and then to launch it anonymously like during that time like Anonymous launches were all the rage so I'm not even sure if those guys actually wanted to hide their identity because it didn't have a pre-mine right so like basis cache didn't have any sort of a premon or something like that I think they just wanted to get the experience of being in an anonymous founder and then they started you know cranking out the code and writing things um and then they assumed the Persona of you know like from the Rick and Morty series like you know they there's like death and summer and all these different characters given that they each of the members there were too comfortable with English they asked whether I could be Rick and then speak to people so that they they can get you know attention and users for basis cash right but it's occurred my very specific question which was like when you went to launch Terra why were you so confident and you know seemingly arrogant about it when you had this other experience with the stable coin that failed well so Terra predates spaces Cash number one and number two I don't I don't think algorithmic stable coins fail because of algorithms I think it fails because of the stability of the economies that are backing them what I mean is like an algorithmic stable point and a national currency or actually very similar constructs it's all based on the quantity theory of money and the idea is that like you should be able to absorb contractions and expansions and currency and the best way to do that is to build a robust economy surrounding it so for instance when there's a currency failure of a small developing Nation it doesn't fail because of the monetary policy of the central bank has failed or because they don't know how to use mechanisms like bonds or things like that to pick up the stock and currency demand it's because the underlying economy is weaker right so I don't think there was any fundamental problem with like iron Finance or basis cash mechanism-wise that let these things to fail it's because there was no solid economy that was being built on top of them in such a way that wouldn't make currency demand volatile and but do you feel that the investors in Tara would have had an interest in knowing that you had this other experience working on a similar stable coin that it failed so in terms of basis cash I mean sorry to use this word again essentially all I did was to join telegram rooms and ship post so right after they launched basis cache they spun out of tfl so they they handed in their resignation I think on that day or maybe the day after and then they like hired Community managers and other developers and things like that and then ran that for I think a few weeks until basis cache depeged and they had to look for other jobs but in terms of like how exactly basis cache was implemented or like what they plan to do with basis cache to encourage the use of the stablecoin I had no involvement in those things like in retrospect should I have like assumed like Rick's character and then she posted on telegram maybe not uh it was an educational experience I learned a lot about D5 and why like pseudonymous foundership makes sense in crypto I saw the energy of the communities that were interested in D5 at that time and I think without basis cache it would have been like much harder to get that learning experience earlier on but I just want to say that basis cache is not something that I designed or operated it's something that I encouraged and have you ever anonymously founded other projects no so let's talk about the week of the deepegging what happened to the lfg funds during that week it's actually you know stated in in like a tweet thread that LG put out or maybe it was like a PDF or a doc send or something like that so basically I think it was morning Singapore time of I think May 7th or May 8th or something like that um so I got up and there was a bunch of notifications on my phone and I think UST had depeged about 2.5 at that time and then there were some very large trades that had been made against the curve liquidity pool of UST versus 3crv that led the curb Finance pool to be almost completed and there were also very large sell orders on exchanges like Finance on the UST to cover pair so we saw that I didn't really think it was a serious problem because UST like went through several cycles of you know site epegs both in the upwards Direction and The downwards Direction so we like initially thought this was something that time would solve but then again like over time that disparity seemed to get worse and worse and there were you know patterns of very specific orders doing very large cells against us T and I think it was like maybe like the day later when we decided to use lfg funds to buy UST because um not only were there very large cells happening but on social media like Twitter the sentiment was starting to catch on and rumors about like uspd pegging and things like that and just in general like in these runaway situations that's never a good thing in the initial clip of capital we deployed a few hundred million dollars to a market maker I think we deployed like this some residual amounts of usdc and tether that lfg had like maybe 100 million dollars in total the the market maker like went in bought like a bunch of UST but then like UST repegged for a brief movement in time and then just the cells started to get worse so we repeated that over the next couple days trying to bring UST Peg to parity the price of Luna was falling uh both because people were dumping but also because shorts were piling up and then that happened to both currencies so sometime during the middle we we sort of had a war room of various different you know you know ogs from the terror community and then we decided that it might be worthwhile to raise fresh Capital to bring back confidence in the USD markets as well as be well just be able to buy more UST so we started to put together like a mid midnight you know fundraising round which very quickly got leaked like during that time I I think more like even more shorts started to pile up against una so and we were planning to sell Luna to investors to be able to raise that Capital to be able to buy back UST so when the total value of Luna fell below like a certain market cap just the the race became untenable and uh so so now it's been about five months later why hasn't the lfg released an accounting or trading logs of how that money was used or even mentioned which market makers executed the peg defense well so in terms of the market maker I think I mean I I am bound to some confidentiality technically but you know I I think there's been pretty accurate assumptions like in the market of uh who the market maker was and things like that so I don't think there's too too much need to clarify who the market maker was in terms of like the accounting of LLC funds like honestly like in the beginning like a lot of funds uh a lot of firms just didn't want to touch this right and then it took us some time to secure uh somebody that was willing to work on uh the report and there's a there's a lot of transactions right so uh it took a little bit of time for them to parse that data as well as try to work with the market maker so that they would produce their data I think finally when they're closing phases of that and that on top of like we've we've had a lot of people quit with the Deepak as you can understand there's um when something fails this spectacularly even the most Ardent supporter finds it very difficult to stake their career on like a new version of something that is quite different from what they initially believed in so it's it's been challenging just across the time uh just across the board at tfl like wanting to do even basic things since you made that lfg to increase Tara's decentralization why did you unilaterally pull out that last tranche of Bitcoin for deployment by yourself without executing a vote okay so basically like in terms of lfg directorship the way that we we structured it is that initially uh we had two directors so which is myself and Nick Claudius who used to work at tfl a couple years ago um and was one of the authors of the white paper and then the idea was that we would gather paperwork from each of the other uh soon TV directors yeah so we were in the middle of that paperwork when the tea pegging happened so the timing was just terrible for almost everything uh by the time that we were executing the last clip um like there was pretty strong Market sentiment that this wasn't going to recover right you know like the lfg council at that point was kind of like in in Shadows right so there were people not engaging I I think there was some side chatter about resigning or like um potential director risk and and things like that so we were in a situation where we had to execute the last trunches of the trade against sort of like an industry that had sort of turned turned their backs against us at that point I want to ask one more question about the money so on September 9th 2021 you announced project Dawn which would unlock 3 million Luna a month for tfl for operating costs so there were times in the following months when this basically meant that 300 million dollars worth of money was being spent on tfl's operating expenses per month where did that money go okay so if you look at like the project Dawn announcement it says that 5 million Luna would be used to establish uh like a like a separate pocket of capital that could fund General Cosmos development and the three million a month we clearly stated in that announcement is that in addition to project on we would not be withdrawing more than three million dollars from the Genesis wallet to be able to fund you know TFO operations wait even three million not three million dollars ah sorry 3 million Luna and during certain times the amount of uh Luna that was being the dollar value of the Luna that was being withdrawn was extremely high right but um like and I think uh a lot of the employees you know that work the tfl buy dollar value in the Luna that they got uh would have been massive amounts of money right but the thing is like when you bring on somebody to and and then sign a contract with them generally they're going to want upside in tokens right and you know there was discussion as to whether we should like bring down the amount of tokens that were being distributed or something to that effect but it seemed inappropriate to try to take away the the upside that people had earned despite the career risk that they took to join an early you know cryptocurrency developer company when in fact when the opposite would happen we wouldn't necessarily raise uh the amount of you know tokens that we would promise because the idea is that you you you you shoulder the risk and then get upside the other way but one of the things that we did because we were sensitive to that emission was that I personally haven't taken any tokens from tfl from May of 2020. in terms of the total token distribution we did make an active attempt to try to make sure that as few tokens end up you know in the open markets as possible as sensitive to like the interests of the community so you're saying that those tokens that that were being unlocked every month were basically going to pay these contracts with the employees and so the employees were largely getting that money well that and like for example like an OTC sale that we did with you know let's say Galaxy and Pantera and several other players so in essence like token purchasers we're bested over many months a lot of them went to like meet you know things like contract obligations and things for that effect okay so it essentially wasn't for operating expenses uh in the way that most people think of that but it was for these agreements yeah so what what I meant by like operating expenses is like stuff that we need to like disbursements we need to make out while operating tfl and one other thing about this in the blog post you said that the details around each unlock would be transparently related to the community did you have like regular reports about this so that that that's something that we weren't able to do because for instance like any sort of purchase contract has confidentiality obligations right so we wouldn't be able to say this person purchased this much and uh even in cases where it becomes very easy to guess that would create liability for us and just just as a like a HR practice I I was advised that it would become very difficult if you you know make it transparent for how how many tokens uh each employee was getting and the disparities admittedly were quite High because people joined at different points in time so for example somebody that's wearing when Luna was like 15 cents would be getting a lot more tokens from tfl than somebody that joined with Luna was a hundred dollars right and while theoretically people can understand why that happens it's kind of like demotivating in some sense to have to work with that amount of disparity but you know people talk and they found out you know hints of who had many tokens and things like that over time so that that had been one of the consistent problems in terms of HR policy at tfl and I I would assume many other crypto development verbs I want to um ask you um some questions about your situation and you mentioned your finances um a minute or two ago what was your total net worth before you started Tara and what's your current net worth yeah I'm not sure if I'm comfortable answering that question all right in the next several days it looks like your South Korean passport will be invalidated what do you plan to do at that point I'm not using it anyway so it doesn't I can't see how that makes a difference meaning you don't intend to travel from where you are now no that's that's not what I meant do you have another passport that you can use to travel yeah so just in general like with personal travel plans or location or things like that it does get pretty horrible for me given the amount of publicity around this so I just don't feel comfortable talking about you know location or how I plan to travel and things like that I also wanted to ask some questions on behalf of some of these token holders on May 21st you tweeted that pre-depeg UST holders would receive either usdt or usdc and the Luna Foundation guards tweeted something similar in the 16th saying that Foundation would return remaining assets to compensate the remaining users of UST prioritizing the smallest holders when will this occur so right now the Luna Foundation guard is not at a state where it can make clear disposal of its assets uh there are various depending in civil litigation against LG so until those are resolved we we just are not able to distribute tokens and enter this question so I don't have a lot of clarity on how long that process would take but it's yeah hopefully soon will you pay interest for this delay in the refunds well it's it's not a refund right it's not a it's I mean so a refund is only established if people bought something from us it's not a system whereby like we are a vendor of cryptocurrency and that people give us money and then we give them stable coins so it's it's it is not that model right so it's not a situation where and and I think a lot of the misconception comes from like people think that all stable coins are the same so the idea is that okay I just use a stable coin I don't care how it worked but given you were the face of you know Terra stable point it didn't work I want my money back but we weren't the counterparty it's a stable coin Acquisitions right so it's more of a like a Goodwill effort us realizing that using this 313 Bitcoin is not going to repack USD so we're going to distribute it to ustc Holders but it's definitely not a refund right so this compensation but will you pay interest no we're I don't think we're making any like yield on the underlying tokens now so we're not generating interest so there will be no interest and would you ever contribute your own personal funds to these reimbursements or to this compensation my personal funds are not significant enough to make a difference to any of these distributions through some extreme highs and extreme lows in your young life you went to Stanford undergrad which obviously is something seen as an achievement in and of itself you became I think the biggest crypto star in Korea now you're probably one of the most notorious men in Korea the South Korean government wants to arrest you how do you feel about the direction that your life has taken foreign so Laura to be honest I think it's going to take a couple years um and some sobriety of retrospect for me to fully internalize everything that has happened but like one of the things that I want to clarify is given some of the jokes that I made on Twitter or anything like that but it was never really about you know money or you know you know fame or a success point of those terms I'm sort of like a person that like likes making toys right so what I mean is I derive a lot of enjoyment from from just simply tinkering with things so friends for instance like even outside of programming I enjoy building furniture for instance or these days I guess sometimes to cook so like from that perspective like I think one of the things that I hope the next few years would clarify is what happened with Tara was it wasn't a scam like it wasn't a fraud right it was a massive market failure but I think one of the things I want to clarify is I believed in the need and the viability for decentralized algorithmic stable coins more than anyone else and as Founders we are we we sometimes have a bias and in some cases Aaron is biased for being bullish right so a lot of people say that I'm an idiot for you know buying Bitcoin right before it was about to crash or something like that but dispositionally speaking like isn't crypto made better or any industry made better if there are people that just just a little bit like believe in things and is more optimistic than other people about how things are going to pan out and how things are going to work I I think the most important thing is like we really did try to hold ourselves to a pretty high set of integrity and I think now we're starting to make some attempts to make sure that we provide the right kind of information out there so that people can understand what happened better we are a pretty small organization at this point so there's sometimes going to be things that we won't be able to answer everything right because there's just too much accusations coming out and some without like any natural basis or something like that but we are trying our best like in terms of what it when it comes to my life like I think like I the way that I think about it is I Amber 31. and I would still love to contribute so it is going to be an exciting time because I think you know more of the work that I'm going to be doing is going to be in the cold I get to do a lot more engineering which I didn't get to do in 2021 when Tara was just exploding so a lot of my time was spent in calls and meetings and podcasts while this is definitely probably the hardest uh you know time in my life in terms of the work that I do and the challenges that we are having to work through it is a a refreshing change of pace so you know here we are in this sort of reflective mode and I was curious if you were to go back is there anything that you would do differently and if so what I I think the sort of the changes that I would make is from like a lot of the discussions that we covered for today you know I I think there would have been things like maybe deciding to you know build that PTC on tune reserve a little bit earlier so that the reserve would have been more significant before uh the boulevard compressed that could be one of those things for example being less aggressive and less joking on Twitter I think definitely would have been one of it yeah spending less time on social media and talking to people I think definitely would have helped probably that may get a lot more work done but I I think look so I think the next attempt at creating like decentralized money is going to look a lot different right so it might not even be a stable coin right so it might not even be dollar pegged uh there could be different types of Reserve Dynamics in play but I I do really think that building decentralized money is one of the most important problems that crypto has to solve right because without it what are we even doing here um and I think in terms of the recent sort of regulatory clampdown on censoring transactions and arresting developers from tornado cash and things like that is indicative of how we need to work towards that decentralized future and while I am deeply regretful of how everything panned out with UST I I do think it's important for new developers to learn from what happened here and to keep attempting to create decentralized money that is not just censorship resistant but more robust more transparent and resistant to failure and I think if some of the work that we've done at dfl because it's it's not really all about the failure we did some interesting work we built interesting apps if some of the history of the work that we've done in sort of creating UST and seeing it scale and grow for three years is valuable for other people to be able to create that decentralized currency I think that would make me very happy well is there anything that I didn't ask you that you would want to say just generally speaking I plan to be I am working on like lots of different things like I'm not going to talk about them I'm not necessarily gonna you know some some of these necessarily are not even going to launch are you working on Luna classic at all no not at all the Terrace station wallet I think still supports lunar classic but we we don't um really have a relationship with the Original Classic boxing anymore so I'm just in general like I plan to be working on things that are you know exciting to me once again I am about 31 I still want to contribute definitely all of these are going to be highly experimental right so as in like just for like my fun in building them uh if it's useful feel free to contribute ask me questions um you know to build on them and if you don't like them just don't use them but you know yeah I I plan to continue building and uh look forward to working with several of you in the future all right well I really thank you for agreeing to this interview you know as you mentioned that you find Transparency and like revealing the facts to be important and I you know really appreciate that you took the time to answer what were some tough questions and I'm helping that effort so thank you so much for coming on
