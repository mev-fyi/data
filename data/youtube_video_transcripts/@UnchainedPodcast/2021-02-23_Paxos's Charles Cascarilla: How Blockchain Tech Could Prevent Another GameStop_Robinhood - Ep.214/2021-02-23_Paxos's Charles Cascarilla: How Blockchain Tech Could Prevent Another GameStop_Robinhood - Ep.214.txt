started in bitcoin super early why don't you tell us your background before bitcoin and then also how you got into bitcoin yeah sure so um background is really uh almost entirely in financial services and um uh i started uh working at goldman sachs and bank of america uh really covering financial services companies uh uh from the sell side and then i went to the buy side it was an investor and then i started my own asset manager in 2005 with a co-founder emil woods and that specialized just investing in financial services companies and we came across bitcoin after going through the financial crisis and getting a lot of things right about it and uh saw bitcoin at three or four cents and was immediately intrigued uh by the technology um certainly would never imagine we'd be at uh you know high 40 000 uh price of bitcoin here which is um obviously really exciting for everybody but we really thought the technology could be transformative not just bitcoin and that got us to star paxos um about seven years ago now and so i've also heard you say that what you saw in the financial crisis got you interested in bitcoin so why don't you connect the dots for us there yeah so um i think some of the key themes that we captured as investors was how the electronification of markets changed uh price discovery it changed how you traded in a really fundamental way and um you went from basically being on the floor to microseconds in about 10 years huge amounts of innovation and in that same time you basically went from t plus five to t plus three settlement so almost nothing changed in the middle and back office but everything changed in the front end and so when we came across uh bitcoin and blockchain we immediately recognized a possible way to solve those problems in a new way and in a way that could really fix the infrastructure and the plumbing which um you know very desperately needs it and we've seen that in lehman brothers we've seen it with game stop and frankly we're going to see in the next financial crisis if we haven't upgraded that the plumbing is actually really exacerbating the crises and in certain cases actually creating them and um bitcoin and blockchain offer pass forward because you're getting real-time movements of assets not uh real lags in them and um so coming out of the financial crisis when we saw this technology we immediately thought here is a way to know who owns what when and that's not possible in today's financial system i know that's kind of shocks everybody but you don't really know who owns what when i mean it's a fairly basic concept but financial markets were set up from an infrastructural standpoint to promote liquidity and trading not to promote clear ownership and chain of title because of lots of weights of history going back 50 years and that's what really fascinated us about this technology is that we could see a way to change fundamentally how the financial system would operate and to make it fairer and safer yeah so we're going to tie together a lot of the strands that you just mentioned on plus some new ones because there are so many things going on right now in the markets that i think um really make everything that you just discussed kind of illustrate the importance of all that um but one other thing that i wanted to ask you about was in the early days as you mentioned you got that new york state trust company charter and you received it in may 2015 but you started the process of trying to get it in 2012. i think i once heard you say it was may 2012 so can you describe what it was like working in the bitcoin industry at that time and compare it to the bitcoin industry right now well i don't know it's like uh we were wandering in the desert it felt like in some sense um you know if you go back to 2012 there wasn't even ethereum so we really were believing that this could fundamentally alter the financial system in a profound way um from very very early days when you know it was really in some sense a bit crack pottery to believe that and um and you know catching things early is really exciting because you can see how things evolve and i mean it really evolved a lot i mean it was a very early uh community uh very i would say a cyber punky it was really um not hugely financially literate in a sophisticated sense it was really much more about being technology technologically illiterate and you know there's so many exciting things when you're that early to see something evolve into what it is now and it's gone through a number of different stages you know from really the absolute cutting edge like kind of cyberpunks and uh hard libertarians and you know people who are really deeply into cryptography into decentralization it was such a new field back then and i'm not a technologist so i definitely you know enjoy talking with them but i was completely out of out of my depth because i don't know those things on a native basis and uh i remember you know after about five clicks you would be through all the information about bitcoin uh when you first started you had like the white paper you had like you know three websites and you had like one chat board and that was about it and uh to now get to the point where you know the torrent of um interest and the many many different types of communities that are evolving so rapidly you can't even keep up with it i mean it's uh bewildering almost and um that's awesome to see because the reason we got involved so early was because we thought it could get this big and um that wasn't obvious but it was something we really believed had the potential yeah and you know i was just trying to think back i think the price around then was am i right that it was either in the single digits or the low double digits that sounds definitely right like um i think it was probably somewhere around 10 or 20 dollars when we started wanting to work on the trust you know it was really kind of surprising you know how much the price started to move in in very um unusual ways and the technology itself was less of a focus and so you went through a number of these stages where it would be about the technology or be about bitcoin or be about the technology or be about bitcoin and so at that time it really was still a lot about bitcoin starting to move up and so when we were applying for the trust um a lot of people were like why are you so focused on on this bitcoin thing you know it seems like it's just for money launderers or for you know the dark web you know we kept trying to point out that actually the technology and bitcoin while they might be separate are allowing the same thing which is more financial freedom and more financial access and that they're going to play a common part together and it just wasn't so obvious for people who are familiar with financial markets that bitcoin could make sense and then people were really familiar with technology said oh yes i understand bitcoin but you know i don't understand how the plumbing works and why this technology could be so fundamental and that's what we've actually bridged at paxos for so long is on one sense traditional markets and the problems they have what this technology can solve versus the insurgent nature of bitcoin which we also believed in in terms of how it can really fundamentally alter a lot of the financial um uh services market as well so there's so much to go on between both of them yeah yeah something that's really interesting is i i'm pretty sure that right around that time that you started that process of trying to get the trust charter is right around when brian armstrong of coinbase was starting his y combinator program and so it's just interesting so paxos and coinbase i think kind of got their start roughly around the same time and yeah and i think what's also so fascinating is that you know with your traditional financial services background you know goldman and everything that you like saw the potential and could see where this was going at a time when i just feel like a lot of people with your background really did not so you know because i feel like 2012 era was when you started seeing more of the entrepreneurs like the once casauruses of the world kind of start to get into it although you know it's it's yeah he did actually convince some people on on wall street so yeah so yeah and i would also say like um what really fascinated us was because i had spent so long as an investor you know there's lots of different ways to invest but one of the fundamental ways we invested was being contrarians which is you know trying to find non-consensus ways of looking at problems and what could be very um huge optionality out of them so we looked for that a number of different times in our career i think we caught some of them some of them we were wrong on but you're never going to be right on all of those but we caught a number of them investing in exchanges and clearing corps when they're really trading below the value of the buildings that they were housed in you know i mean and then they suddenly are trading at 15 times revenues huge opportunity uh we were short subprime mortgages and commercial real estate mortgages then we were long distressed mortgages coming out of the crisis we had a number of other positions those are some of the more notable ones and then coming across bitcoin at three or four cents and like kind of you know really having fun with it and looking at the technology but constantly trying to think of what is the problem and what is the best way to potentially have real upside in that problem being solved that's what really kind of lent lent us to understanding this opportunity but also why it was actually important for us to be in financial services in order to see that you know if we hadn't gone through the crisis if we hadn't seen the problem and the plumbing of the system if we hadn't understood all of those things i think it have been really hard for us to get it and because we lived there which is still different than most people on wall street you know living in those types of uh areas of the markets it made us really understand i think on a native basis what the problem was and why this was able to solve it and have conviction around it to continue to hold it and not just be like oh it's hit 200 it's time to sell or it's hit you know a thousand it's time to sell because otherwise you would i think from our backgrounds right right no for sure i feel like the more tradery type of people you know tend to um not have that conviction and want to sell when they think the price is high um so one other thing that i wanted to ask about just because you do have such a long history in this space and i feel like you know during that time you were kind of gathering all these different elements that have now come together to form what we think of as paxos which obviously probably is most well known for its relationship with paypal but you know you know before that you had a bit which obviously you still do um but it's definitely one of the smaller exchanges and so were there times when you in and obviously you know i think we discussed this the last time you were on my other show unconfirmed we were talking about how in 2015 when you did get the trust charter i recognized that that was significant but i sort of still didn't understand exactly why like how it was going to be used or you know like i couldn't really see what was where things were going or what was going to be created and so i kind of want to hear about your journey over that seven-year time period where you were building paxos and maybe you know you tried certain things and you know did you kind of always know where you were going to end up which right now is i think you're kind of more in this b2b play or earlier you know were you trying other things and then did you feel like you know you tried to pivot well i think there's a number of components of that when you're in the early adopter stage which i think is clear a way of describing where the market was five or six or seven years ago and real early adopter i mean like bear no no adopter stage right at that point and um you know i mean know you could tell the whole community like you know in one reddit room uh or one email thread um and so when you're in that stage you kind of need to have the aol strategy i describe it as which you need to do everything from soup to nuts from the front end all the way to the back end it's a small world and you know the only way you can capture value is by doing a lot of different things because your customers need all those things done but there's nowhere else for them to go get it and that aol strategy makes a lot of sense and if you're going to end up in a mainstream adoption point the aol strategy starts to make less and less sense and it becomes much more about specialization over time and enabling a wider swath of users and businesses b to b to c and it's not just around having the entire stack yourself because we had this belief that this technology could fundamentally change financial services we thought about what types of strategies what types of businesses can be very valuable and very important when you get to a more mature state and what should we start to build in order for that to happen now i didn't i would have never imagined it was going to take what in some sense seems like a short period of time but in some sense it feels like a long period of time which is seven eight years nine years whatever it is uh to get to this you know really uh fantastic moment that the space is having now i thought it would have happened maybe three years ago where we'd get to something that looked more like this and um i guess things always take longer than you think and then they have happen faster than you thought i think that's the saying and so that happened for us and so when we built the business it was always with the intention of let's be for many different types of institutions that want to eventually come in on a turnkey basis and be able to access crypto be able to access tokenized assets because i still believe that this is about a lot more than bitcoin it's hugely important element is bitcoin but just the power of re-platforming the financial system onto a blockchain is beyond transformative across the board in so many different ways and we can talk about that and building that in the early days definitely felt like we were wandering in some sense through the desert because we weren't building a b2c platform and that was mainly who the earliest adopters were and then it was mainly for traders trading with those early adopter retail and that's still very much still almost retail in some sense and here we are not building a retail platform but i think that over the horizon viewpoint of where things are going to go is what is really paying off for us right now because we've made sure we kept our business i think a lot more focused on that infrastructural layer and so the point of ipad our exchange was this is for institutions to be able to use who are holding their assets want it to be a safe liquidity pool wanting to be a safe place to be able to execute um but of course that only has so much utility if you don't have lots of retail players in there now you can go acquire those retail players or you could go acquire businesses that have retail players and so that's the point here is add firms like paypal ad firms like revolut and a whole number of other firms where they want to power their end user experiences and have a safe reliable compliant turnkey solution and you can't get that anywhere else because there wasn't maybe the uh an obvious thing to build when you're in the early adopter stages it's interesting also because i could imagine and and you tell me if i'm wrong but it sort of seems like when you're trying to make that type of sales pitch what happens is that maybe getting the first kind of big client would take a while but that once that happens then there would be kind of like a flood of them do you know what i mean it's just like whoever wants to be first like nobody wants me first but then once somebody goes and everybody's like uh we all have to catch up so am i right that that's kind of how those conversations went well there's some elements of uh these firms just really coming into a space that you know they have to be careful about that you know has a little bit of a risk to it uh people fear the reputational risk or they fear just doing something new if you're being first uh lots of regulation and so all of those things certainly i think held back this mainstream phase a little bit more than we would have thought and so i think all of those are contributing factors and not just to them coming to paxos but to them coming into the space in general and so really playing that through with our strategy of we're going to focus on creating turnkey solutions for these types of businesses banks brokers payment companies technology firms remittance companies i think that's now really clear that that was the right right way to approach things but you know it felt again you know like hey why why didn't you just go out and acquire you know millions of retail customers you know and i think you know that's you know you know that is just the nature of shifting from early adopter to mainstream having the right moment in time and um and we were able to get there because we had the right investors i think we had the right vision yeah you know uh all of us really believed in where this was going to go over time even when it was not obvious yeah it is so similar to your initial contrarian bets in the traditional financial services space um in in the markets where you could kind of see that something was going to happen but you just needed to wait long enough for it which i know that can be a challenge um but obviously it paid off for you you know when investing there's a saying there's no difference between being early and being wrong um and so and that's because you know you have to be able to um have the position you have to be able to continue to make it and there's so many firms in crypto and in general where that time just was too hard or maybe they focused too much on just the blockchain technology uh private blockchains being such a huge fad for a moment in time not that it's gone away but there was a huge moment where everyone was just about it's only about private blockchains about private blockchains not public blockchains you know you could get um really deterred and pulled away so lots of chapters in this book uh when you kind of drill in and it kind of looks smooth when you zoom out but it definitely has been a wild ride yeah yeah you've kind of actually straddled the two trends um pretty well especially given that one of them hasn't really panned out in the same way that uh you know the hype kind of uh seemed to indicate it would back in 2015 2016. so um you know speaking of the paypal relationship i did ask on twitter what i should ask you and a number of people wanted to know this so paypal empowers corporations to provide a crypto experience for their customers so they can buy sell and hold crypto it also does enable those customers or not custom but your customers the firms to send and receive crypto and so i know obviously you don't represent paypal but can you give us into insight into why paypal users cannot withdraw the crypto that they purchase there you know directly to their own wallets or to other crypto addresses well you know i think there's a couple components to this the first is i think everyone should appreciate that paypal coming to space is probably the biggest thing that's happened to the space uh you know notwithstanding you know elon musk and uh tesla you know creating some like huge hoopla around it at the end of the day that's 300 million consumers that paypal uh either has enabled or will plan to enable they're rolling this out over time including international and venmo um and so there's a lot that paypal is doing here and just getting that into place was a big deal for them they've never had a possibility of owning something aside from dollars holding something aside from dollars in their app so this is a big deal and i think them making the commitment which is very big to the crypto space and decentralized finance space is just an important moment for all of us and if you go and read their two-page press release they've laid out what are some you know really expansive goals that they want to achieve over the next 12 to 24 months now you know i don't think that i can tell you exactly what their plans are but i would say that this was just the first step you know this is let's get going you know you can't launch everything on day one and so they have a lot more plans and you know when those actually come out you know we'll see but it's not um i don't think this was as far as they want to go this was how do we get going and you know launch something as fast as we can and build on that and so i if you approach it from that perspective i think it looks less like uh you know you're buying crypto but you don't really own it two it's more like i now have access to crypto in a way i never did before and there's gonna be a lot more coming down the pike and that's going to be really great um you know if you're a paypal customer and of course paypal and paxos we're sitting here trying our best to make sure uh they have as much functionality as they want to be able to offer to their customers and you know i think you're going to see a lot more exciting things from them in pretty short order so my theory around why people can't send the crypto directly to their own wallet or other crypto addresses is because when you're switching from a service that runs on traditional on the traditional financial rails where you can like claw back funds if you need to and then you're you know moving to a system where you cannot claw back funds if you need to that this creates an opportunity for fraudsters and so they maybe need to kind of like up their fraud protection is that a good theory well i think this is an important component and by the way we saw this with the rules out of treasury they're thinking about different ways of being able to track movements of funds to non-customer wallets in blockchain and uh and crypto um so there is you know clearly like a compliance component to making sure that you understand what's going on when funds leave your platform whether it's paxos or coinbase or paypal and so but again i think i would really focus on uh wow this is a huge effort for paypal to get to where they're at and this is about you know adding in functionality over time and so so are you working with paypal on adding those functionalities well i can't really speak for paypal here but i would say that we're clearly excited to be an infrastructure provider for them and uh as they continue to roll out more services where i think we're going to be there with them in a lot of ways and you know uh i know that uh people really want you know as much uh as you can possibly have today uh but sometimes you gotta be patient and um you know i think you'll see some really good things out of um out of what paxos is doing and what a paypal is going to do in the next 12 months and i also noticed in the paypal q4 earnings call that ceo daniel shulman said that paypal will be creating a new business unit dedicated to crypto i wondered what does that mean for paxos's partnership with paypal well uh firstly i think that gets to the point we were just making uh before which is they're putting a lot of resources behind this they have a group that's just focused on it um we work with them all the time it's great to see them now have dedicated uh more dedicated resources in that way you know at the end of the day uh paxos is an infrastructure provider we're not going to be the only infrastructure that paypal relies on i think it'd be probably nutty if they only use paxos uh you know given the size that they are it would just make sense that they're gonna do things themselves they're gonna use other providers but on the other hand there's just a number of things that we can uniquely enable and not just now but over what they want to do over the next several years and so we're going to be there i think like as a really important partner for them and we're excited to be that best possible partner for them and others too you know i mean there's just so many players now who are saying wow paypal blaze the path they're doing it why can't we do it a lot of people are saying oh man you know look what's going on you know we have to get off our hands and get in the game and um they're trying to figure out a way to do it and here we are as uh paxos purely dedicated to that we're not gonna compete with anybody we're here to help you we're here to do it fast we're here to do it in the most trustworthy way that you could uh possibly want and you know we're really thankful for the the partnership we've had with paypal so far and shortly before recording this show you were the final speaker at the bitcoin for corporations event held by microstrategy and your parting message to the audience was that bitcoin as a reserve asset for corporations would be a trend in the future or pretty much has arrived and they should not be the last to get in but to be early and i was curious you know it's only been a few days but what kind of interest has paxo seen since that event yeah i mean i i think it's uh really another exciting moment here in bitcoin it's just uh chapters and sometimes are unpredictable um i wouldn't have imagined that uh late 2020 and early 2021 was going to be about corporate treasury adoption of crypto i honestly i would have never imagined that um on the other hand it's very exciting to see because like i was mentioning at that conference microstrategy which was so exciting to be a part of because it's opening up all kinds of new vistas here you know people are seeing this as a reserve asset and a monetary network and in some ways it's like gold was uh before we went off the gold standard i think and that's what um digital gold allows is now a capacity to hold something where you know you can participate in a monetary network in the future and so you get involved you own some now uh it's still a small market cap overall versus where it can be there's a lot to tailwinds they're not going to stop printing money anytime soon we have another 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus bill coming through i was looking at the amount of um government spending as a percentage gdp we're just about where we were during world war ii and that's crazy right this is where we're at world war ii i mean kovid's like a real crisis but this is not world war ii crisis and so we're printing money and spending it at a pace we've never ever seen before and um with that type of tailwind uh unfortunate as it might be for the value of the dollar it's for it's very uh very fortunate for the value of bitcoin and its emergence as a monetary network that can be used in the future as a means to connect everybody on a global basis and uh you know it's exciting to see corporations want to be a part of that because that really is mainstream adoption i mean that is as mainstream as it gets and then i mean this obviously is just a few days after that event but also with the tesla news did that uh create any extra spike well it's definitely created uh even more interest i mean you know you have micro strategy which was you know almost like a revival uh in some ways around like uh how fantastic uh bitcoin uh and the bitcoin monetary network can be for society on a broad basis um i think steven ross did an awesome job of explaining that uh when he was talking with uh michael saylor but also now you have elon musk who you know the richest man in the world he has a huge platform you know he's put some real dollars behind it a billion and a half dollars is is is not a small amount uh clearly he's thought about this as a public company and that i think starts to really open up this possibility for a lot of other companies you know someone's got to go first you people need air cover people need someone to be able to point to and say someone else could do it why can't we do it and um he's been the first in a lot of things uh from you know electric cars to you know going trying to go to mars and so why wouldn't it make sense for him to be one of the first uh to own what could be you know really the new monetary asset and i think everyone's going to look at that and say well you know he's been really prescient you know we should take a really hard look at this and that's definitely what we're seeing all right so in a moment we're going to talk about all kinds of other current events that involve this technology such as the gamestop robin hood situation but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible there's a lot to think about when building a commerce web application integrating with squares apis to take

with chad cascarilla so let's also talk about some other current affairs that touch on all these issues we've been discussing how would you characterize the main issues that occurred with the game stop slash robin hood situation well you know i think this is a really um a really important uh warning sign for all of us in financial markets and um i wrote a blog post about this and you know my point is lehman brothers gamestop and the next financial crisis all have something in common which is that uh if we're relying and continue to rely on the infrastructure we have it's inevitable that you're going to see more of this and the real problem is in financial markets we built them 50 years ago because we were switching from paper to electronic you know there was a lot of good reasons why you had to get out of paper and get onto electronic but you gave up something when you did it so when your paper you're sitting here having to settle trades giving a paper certificate and getting dollars for it you're actually moving the real asset that certificate is the ownership of ibm and if i give it to you laura you own the ibm shares that's a bearer asset and when you happen is you try to electronify that it's not easy to do it's you know it's really hard to use the right technology 50 years ago to make sure that there's an electronic certificate that's moving from myself directly to you specifically and so they put everything into a giant pool and so this is what people don't really understand is that actually all the shares of all stocks in the country sit in a giant pool at the dtc and it's actually held in a street name called cd and co no one's even heard of it but they hold all of the stocks in the entire us are basically sitting there unless you would draw them into your name which some you know people do you know you know certain preppers and conspiracy theorists are like i want to own my own stock and rightfully so because what happened we saw on lima brothers is that you can't let someone fail because everything is in a sense mutually owned together and so everything becomes too big to fail because it's all sitting in a giant pool and so 50 years ago that made sense because you needed to solve this problem of paper to create more liquidity because they were having to shut the stock market every wednesday and limit hours you just couldn't keep up with the amount of trading so they're like okay let's start dtc and put everything in a big big pool account the problem is 50 years have gone by and we've completely outgrown that mode of doing things it's running on cobalt mainframes from the 70s you know you're it's taking two days to settle which doesn't make any sense you know you can order toilet paper your house faster than you can settle a share a stock that doesn't make how why does that make sense um so all of these things are a real problem and you know you basically get something like gamestop and it really underscores it i mean we haven't even had a real crisis in in essence and the plumbing came unglued again uh imagine you know we almost had it with kovid we almost had it with gamestop where things almost locked up and if we don't re-architect the system in the right way you know we're going to have this again and um it's shocking that we're using like the equivalent of latin you know cobalt mainframes to manage things when we could now be using technology like blockchain and you could be actually tracking each share moving through the system and know the end owner at all times and that gets back to what does a blockchain do it says who owns what when so that's the backdrop to like this gamestop issue and so what happened is you have 140 of the share of short everyone's like well why did that happen and they think oh maybe it's you know the reddit army or maybe it's uh hedge funds or maybe it's the broker dealers who's the problem here and actually the problem is the infrastructure because everything's sitting in a pooled account you can't tell where the shares are so i'll give an example really simple here so i buy a share i take that share and i lend it to you you take that share that you've borrowed from me and you sell it and then someone else buys it and then they can lend it out again and the same share keeps getting lent out again and again and there's nothing nefarious per se happening except for the fact that we don't have a way of being able to track the shares that keep moving through the system and so now you end up with 140 of the share short and then the next problem is you're settling in two days why are you settling in two days i mean it's just it doesn't make sense but you are and so between the day you trade the share and the day you settle well someone guarantees it and all trades are actually guaranteed by the dtc now they've never used this guarantee fund in 50 years it didn't use it in the 87 crash they use it during the asian crisis or the dot-com bubble or when lehman brothers failed it's never been used before but what they do is they draw they make huge capital calls right at the moment when everyone needs their own capital so they normally have seven billion dollars of capital in the fund i can tell you i know three brokers including robin hood where there's over seven billion dollars of capital calls that were made just from three brokers i mean there are tens of billions of dollars most likely of capital calls that were being made right at the moment when all those brokers need money so they're actually drawing in all this capital and making more systemic risk because it's too big to fail and so why do you have a too big to fail intermediary scene in the middle well because 50 years ago we decided that was the best way we could do things and it was but now it isn't you could be moving the shares around in near real time maybe same day you could start at and that would really collapse all of the risk of your fear that someone would fail so you need a guarantee and so taking from t0 to t2 to saddle is a big problem and then here's another nuance which people won't believe on the day of settlement all the shares and all the cash go in they only come out at the end of the day in between there's a lien on it from the dtc so you have a guarantee that's happening for two days and then on settlement day you have all this cash that's and shares that are trapped crazy that you would do this and um really an anachronism uh that it's still done this way and so you can imagine now gamestop is just a small example of how this could unravel too much shares are short because the technology is old and can't track it it takes a long time for there to be settlement it takes a long time for there to be a trade guarantee um you have a too big to fail intermediary in the middle and suddenly like things really just become the plumbing just gums it all up i think um it just like from a like a pure narrative perspective what i also love about this story about how all of this kind of um nasty and outdated underbelly of finance got exposed was it was from a really crass and vulgar subreddit where some of the people had you know names like deep effing value and a youtube personality is like the name roaring kitty and um then on the other hand you know a lot of it was driven by anger at um a firm that like came out with a little uh note about why gamestop would stock would would go and it was like a famed short seller and so like all when you put all that together and then you just see how this all this house of cards um tipped over just from all that like it's to me it's um it was it was kindling you know just there dry kindling and it's because like the plumbing just doesn't like exist and there there is a much better way to do this and you could have like a system where actually you free up capital and have more safety and more fairness you would know where all the shares are that are short you can track everything you can you know shrink settlement times and that can open up access and it can you know allow there to be a lot more people participating in the markets so i think it's like in some sense it feels mundane oh wow it's the plumbing you know that doesn't sound like somebody that you want to like turn into a bad guy the plumbing's the bad guy but it really in this case is you know something that's actually holding back the whole financial system because everywhere you go whether it's payments equities corporate bonds the whole thing is all 19th century sewer systems um you know like in new york city and like it just looks fine and a storm comes and it doesn't even have to be a bad one this is just like you know you know a simple summer thunderstorm and the streets started to flood you know just wait if we had another superstorm come through it's really funny you made that analogy because i wrote my um grad school master's thesis on that issue on super systems that's amazing well yeah kind of it's like it was about you know environmental et cetera et cetera but anyway um okay so paxos has built something that kind of maybe could be you know the beginnings of the kind of solution that you were describing in the fall of 2019 you announced that paxos had received no action letter from the sec to settle stock trades on a blockchain based platform in near real time and that is something that really could threaten the dominance of dtc as you mentioned so can you describe for me what your private permissioned blockchain the paxo settlement service looks like and what problems it solves and whether it could actually resolve uh the issues we saw with robin hood and gamestop yes uh so we're really proud we have a no action letter from the sec to settle tokenized equities we're the only firm that has that now the no action letter limits us in terms of number of stocks and amount of volume so we're doing it in you know a handful of stocks and a certain amount of volume i think we've done 1.7 million trades now since uh last february when we started we got approved uh to begin and and what is the number of institutions on on it so right now it's sock gen uh credit suisse and instant nomura we have another participant that'll be joining shortly and another one that's signed on so we have you know another couple uh that are coming on and then we have some more uh that are um really engaging with us and certainly uh the gamestop news has accelerated interest in how people can move settlement and how they can really um remove these impediments to their business this is now a a real focus uh because it's become in some sense an existential issue for many firms and that's good because it's you know you want to address this when you can not when you have to and you know uh and when you have to being a crisis it'd be a real problem um so now is a good moment you know times are still good you know it's not going to be you know a different type of issue like if you had a lehman brothers again and so we've started with those firms this is really working well um we're applying for a clearing agency registration license which is fairly rarefied piece of infrastructure there's two that are really functioning right now the dtc and the options clearing corp the occ uh we would be the third would be the second one that's settling equities trades with the dtc and ourselves being those two and that would allow us to really start to do um unlimited volume in a whole variety almost unlimited q-sips here and so i think we're going to we've been working on this application now for years uh believe it or not so i think we're very close to being able to submit it and go through public comment and get approved hopefully um we're optimistic in the middle part of this year certainly i think uh the latest um uh news i think is you know underscores the need for this um and so we're really excited to get this thing going and believe it or not only 10 firms are 80 of the us equities market so i know it's like you know you think the equities market seems like it's a lot of players but actually it starts to really uh narrow down in terms of who is actually uh trading with who you know one broker trading with a broker 80 is uh 10 brokers and so i think we can be at five six eight when we launch which gets us most of the way there and um and we'll continue to add more and what the advantage of this is you can set on any time frame you want you can know exactly how many shares are short you can track it where it's moving you can be in a position where you have much lower expenses we cut 70 of the expenses out since you're settling potentially on the same day that you do the trade you actually be able to release capital while being safer because most of the capital is tied up because you have to you're afraid someone might fail over two days from when you do the trade now imagine if you're actually settling on the same day this is like you know real big improvement and potentially you could even do intraday like every couple hours you could you could uh settle up all the trades really make a big big difference in terms of allowing there to be more access allowing there to be more safety and fairness in the markets and there'll be transparency for the regulators to see what risks are building up every single day at in real time uh whereas right now you don't have that and instead you have a too big to fail intermediary that's facing every single trade in the market and that's how the dtc operates so we're really excited about what we have this is modern technology using blockchain tokenizing shares and i think the key shift is paper allowed you uh going from paper to digital allowed you to create more liquidity going from digital to token allows you to keep that liquidity but to also have chain of ownership so you really know who's owning the shares at all time and that actually creates safer and fairer markets and you know famously a lot of blockchains have issues with throughput when you compare them to legacy systems so for the paxo settlement service what is the current number of transactions per second it can handle so there's a this is a good point and there's a couple of components to this clearly blockchains uh can't handle in real time so what i would call real-time gross settlement every time there's a trade you settle blockchains could not handle that level of volume um it's just very very hard to do because you're potentially trading in microseconds and then you have to settle and resettle and that'll be very cumbersome to do you don't need to settle that fast even if you want to trade that quickly and so you can set up a system where you're settling every couple hours so the trades come through you're batching them you could net the trades down and then you settled out and then you continue on for the you know the next period and you can pick whatever settlement time period you want and that actually is something a blockchain can do very reliably that does not stress them now you could not put that on a public blockchain also to be clear initially i think you have trouble because regulators want to make sure they understand who's securing the network and that's harder to understand in a public blockchain at the moment people are coming more comfortable with it but also the throughput on ethereum if for instance at 17 uh transactions per second that wouldn't be able to handle even batched settlements in the equities markets because you have about 120 million settlements a day on the other hand being able to 120 settlements at the end of a trading day over the say the course of 30 minutes or 45 minutes is really not that complicated uh maybe 20 years it was or 30 years ago it was that was probably a confounding problem 30 years ago but now it's not you know the advances in hardware and the advances in software um mean that you can actually manage that type of volume relatively uh in a straightforward way so i think you know you have to think about what exactly problem do you want to solve do you want real-time growth settlement that technology for blockchain is not going to do that right now maybe it will in the future if you want to be able to settle at the end of the day or in batches and be able to handle even the all the amount of settlements in the market that is completely achievable with today's technology okay yeah batching maybe at the end of the day would still introduce some of the risk that we were discussing with robin hood and gamestop but if you did it multiple times throughout the day uh it could mitigate that um and one other thing so just so i understand um with all the companies whose stocks then trade on the paxo settlement service all the shares are now digitized and only tradable there and then so now the entire like all the shares for that company then are transparent in the trading and all of them as transparent and so if any of them were to be become the new darling of wall street bets then um we wouldn't see the same kind of kind of like issues that we saw with gamestop is that the theory so there's two components to what you said just to uh unpack it a little bit even if you settled by the way at the end of the day of t zero you would still be uh fairly safe versus intraday batches uh because what happens is you see the risks building up all day long and you could have limits and you could say oh okay you've hit a limit you need to pay down the level of risk that you have and so you'd have transparency on all of your counterparty risks in real time and that means if something got out of whack you don't have to wait to the end of the day you could do it earlier so even if you said normal process as end of day during exceptional times you'd be able to address it earlier so i think that um that's the component here is is creating flexibility so that you can reduce risk when it's appropriate uh you don't have to necessarily force it at all times and then the next component is we're backward compatible we have a full dtc participant account when we uh hopefully uh you know knock on wood here uh receive our clearing agency license it's a mandate that we are backward compatible uh into the dtc and so that means that uh when shares trade if the two participants are paxos customers the shares will settle at paxos if uh one of them is it can settle the dtc um and if none of them are definitely settled with the dtc and so that means that shares can move over into the paxos environment and get tokenized and if they need to go back into the old environment they can't so there's some moment of time where uh we're backward compatible uh into the old environment and that allows somebody and doesn't uh create a requirement that every single person switch over to paxos uh but i suspect what will happen is you're gonna get um a certain amount that come through and then you hit a tipping point and that's when you start to get all kinds of additional benefits around tracking every single share at all times uh because if it goes back into the old environment you can't track it we can only track stuff that stays on paxos oh wow okay that's really interesting yeah so maybe you're right that there might be kind of like a messy period where it's sort of in and out you know kind of uh somewhat transparent and somewhat not transparent and then at a certain point there probably would be a tipping point when um yeah it's just obviously superior and everybody moves that way but and and the advantage of that is we wanted to make it backward compatible so that it made it really easy for participants uh because ultimately you have to think about how do you get people to adopt this well you get them to adopt it because it costs less it you know it's solving operational problems it's you know safer it's fair um it allows them to mobilize their assets in a different way but also um part of that is how do we solve your operational problems means we can't create new operational problems so you know if you have two places that don't talk to each other uh that would be a real difficulty and so we deliberately set up where that wouldn't be the case and that just means that uh benefits will scale over time uh you know we're not gonna port the whole market over tomorrow uh but if your broker spent all of their time in the paxos environment uh you would be able to track all the shares you know so if someone said i'm going to spend i only want to settle on paxos uh you can only trade me if you settle on paxos you'd be able to see that so this comes down to partly like you know how do you want to get the benefits and when all right and for the sec clearing agency registration when you get that that's the registration that will enable you to move on from stocks to other types of assets but allow us to move on from uh stocks in the no action letter so that we can then operate you know really in all stocks and in uh unrestricted volume but also by the way it can allow us to do a lot more than stocks bonds etc other things so there's so much opportunity here because you know the stock market alone is 45 or 50 trillion dollars of assets uh you know the single largest um asset uh class in the world is u.s equities uh you can imagine getting the point where that's tokenized is a huge step forward in basically re-platforming the financial system and creating a much safer a much more dynamic way of being able to allow companies to raise capital and for participants to be active in the equity markets i mean it's a huge deal to get that to go because then it becomes a lot easier to get subsequent asset classes most participants will already be on if you got the u.s equities market to go and that's part of our point of let's do the u.s equities markets because it's very liquid it needs it it's a big problem and it'll then be the um product journey to get the whole rest of the asset class uh moving on this uh on this journey too you know part of your journey to um tokenize other assets has started with a tokenized gold product that you guys offer and um i was wondering you know why was that one of your choices for a different type of role real world asset that you would offer and how do you plan to move on from uh securities and from from the one gold offering yeah so uh we're really excited about where the gold product is it's grown a lot um in the last year it's gone from maybe 15 million of tokenized gold to about a hundred and almost 30 million dollars of tokenized gold and so it's growing quite a bit you know gold was a very logical asset to start to tokenize firstly because it is a bearer asset but you can't own it in a bare asset way in the digital world people have been owning gold by owning an etf for a future and so this is a problem how do you get better assets uh that are physical to operate like bearer assets in a digital way and um and not just be you know an account based asset but be a token based asset and so in the case of gold first of all it's been money before uh people want to be able to use it like money in many places it's still the the foremost store of value even though bitcoin is clearly showing so much promise and there's 10 trillion dollars of gold in the world and gold is mainly traded around and moved it's not uh consumed so you know you wouldn't want to go do iron ore uh you know you basically pull iron on the ground and then you consume it so there's not as much need to tokenize it as it would be for something that's highly tradable u.s equities is an example gold is an example um i think we're going to definitely do other uh types of assets silver platinum and palladium are logical other ones to do they trade not nearly as much as gold and you know there's a lot of other things to add besides equities there's bonds um there's private company shares uh which is something uh we'll be doing shortly um and um you know you kind of go on from there real estate uh collectibles but there's an adoption curve in my mind around how assets become tokenized and that adoption curve is driven by what are the benefits that you get by being tokenized and so there's really kind of three ish benefits as i think about it one is it just saves you uh money and it might save you capital it might save you expenses you know some way it's saving you money uh by going from what is either a digital um account based asset or a physical asset into a tokenized asset the other benefit you get is uh liquidity and liquidity means that you've now made the asset easier to move around and trade and so that can be a significant benefit because a lot of times you know your frictional costs when you're trying to move assets around that and then the last benefit is access when you create a digitized version of the asset on a public blockchain it's open access now you have to have the right controls in place from a compliance perspective but it's open access you can really create an ability for someone to have assets that they couldn't before uh you know example being dollars an example could be gold now some people get scared about open access because they think oh my god it's gonna go to money launderers and you know uh you know terrorists now of course there's some risk with that but on the other hand you also get the capacity to create universal ability to access financial assets which is really hard for people there's so many people who don't have bank accounts or don't have ability to access and participate in the financial system and so access is a really key thing and maybe you could say the fourth thing is it allows her to be more innovation because you can now program assets and change them around and do different things with them that's the advantage of basically going to going tokenized and so if that's the benefit uh you want to think who's which assets get the most benefits from going this route and that's where you want to start and so obviously crypto uh is a new asset class and uh that's pulling people in it's pulled dollars in and you needed to have dollars in there because it helps to create all kinds of operational savings to have money moving 24 hours seven days a week 365 days a year there's lower expenses you have freed up capital because the money is moving fast you don't have it just sitting there moving slowly through the banking system over many days and then you have an ability to program it and create more accessibility you know people can hold dollars without a bank account that's a huge benefit cash is a logical thing to get pulled in and got pulled in by crypto but it's going to be now used in buying goods and services and eventually for wholesale asset settlements so no dollar is the next thing and then you say oh gold could make sense and equities can make sense when do you get to like real estate that's probably a little bit later in my opinion quickly before we move to stable coins which you know you were just mentioning i did want to ask earlier when you said collectibles did you mean physical collectibles and if so like what like art or corn like coins or stamps or i didn't even know what you meant it could be any of those could be there's examples of cars uh art i know of a number of projects that are working on art like digital or physical art um physical art and so let me give you an example of one that could be interesting as well there's a lot of museums that are having troubles and time tough times now well what they could do is sell some of their collection maybe pieces of it to people who can own some of it but the museum continues to be the depository they hold it uh people can go see it but you can now raise money where you could sell fractions of pieces of art like that's one example of uh something that you could do with art another one could be that you just use it for whole pieces of artwork you know you don't you want to trade fractions of it or whole pieces you know how do you make sure you track the providence of artwork it's an enormous problem and it's an enormous asset class and so art is an example we've seen people trying to do collectible cars i think there's really no end to the way you could use the blockchain to track who owns what when but what you need to do is you know figure out some of the operational logistical hurdles to it to have it make sense to do it at what time and so you're going to see more of it real estate is another example people's houses imagine if you could track the mortgage title moving through the house you never have to use title insurance again uh you know you you know you kind of go on and on like there's just there's so many exciting things to do there's 600 trillion dollars of assets in the world where do you like how do you start with a problem that big uh there's gonna be lots of nuance when you get into individual assets and individual countries yeah i could imagine custody would be a big question for things like physical art and and stuff but okay let's move on to the stable coin question because you know you did talk about obviously how stable coins have become a big part of the crypto ecosystem but you know i just wondered i know it is one of your business lines you have your own stable coin and you also provide the back end for other uh providers to have their own stable coins how do the different stablecoin providers compete with each other they're ultimately competing on a number of different propositions one is what is the utility of this coin you know what can i do with it uh can i go buy things with it on different exchanges can i go make a loan could i borrow in it can i just hold my money in it is it available in lots of different types of wallets so there are some that are much more widely usable than others usdc tether packs the usd husd are coins or the you know i think we have three of the top uh five uh dollar stable coins and um you know they're you know very accessible and very usable and that distinguishes it from some smaller stable coins where they might not be available in lots of different types of wallets or on lots of different exchanges so that's one thing that distinguishes the next thing is well what's the regulatory oversight and i think particularly for paxos we have a primary regulator which is the new york department of financial services that oversees our stable coins and that's different from anyone else's so tether has no regulator usdc doesn't have a primary regulator they have money transmission licenses but they don't have a primary regulator that oversees it we actually have uh both our set both us as a trust company has a primary regulator and our products have a primary regulator and that's exactly what if you looked at what fafa guidance the fatf or you look at treasury guidance and others they really talk about you should have a primary regulator that oversees it because otherwise you open yourself up to all kinds of possible misuse of it and so we're i think uh really tried to always make sure in everything we do at paxos that we're looking at what the regulators are saying making sure that we're following best practice because we're not just trying to hamstring ourselves we're doing this because ultimately how do you get to mainstream adoption you're never going to get the mainstream adoption without a primary regulator overseeing the coin you know banks are going to accept it i don't think corporations are going to accept it they're going to want to use something that they can trust and that part of that trust is having someone else who's overseeing it that's what you always have in financial services because you can get to issues where an issuer without a primary regulator overseeing it could very well be faking the assets that are backing the token and of course you can use auditors and other people to help but some are unaudited and unregulated and that could start to create systemic risks and maybe consumers wouldn't realize it or less sophisticated users wouldn't realize it and that's what we're proud of how we separate ourselves from others and so it sounds like you're talking about tether primarily which is unregulated and uh what was the other thing unregulated oh and and or unaudited rather it's we don't know if it's unbacked um there are a lot of allegations about that although now recently there's news that um a loan that tether gave out to bitfinex has now been paid back so yeah um however that's what i was gonna say is we do know it's unbacked actually so they actually said we're on back meaning they said we have a loan yes and they have bitcoin and other things like it's not if you look at the terms and service it doesn't say it's backed just by dollars sitting in a bank account you know if you look at like um the bahamian banks they have like maybe 700 million dollars in all the bahamian banks but the primary tether bank is supposedly in the bahamas where is the 25 billion dollar sitting uh everyone would like to know the answer to that no one knows but they have said that they're not fully backed one for one with dollars um and you know that may be fine but that means it's not a dollar stable point right right although i did have gregory pepin i think was his name the deputy ceo at deltek who said that that 700 million dollar figure uh for for the bahamian banks was some portion of the assets like like just just the bahamian dollar reserves or something like that and that um us dollar reserves would not be counted in that i think that was this excellent i'm gonna have to link to this in the show notes um because i don't remember the exact specifics but he did have an explanation um but something that was interesting was you discussed this with frank chapparo on the scoop podcast back in september 2019 and you were talking about tether and at that time you said this is the best it's ever going to be for them because it's unregulated and institutions won't touch it and uh hello at that time tether was about 3.5 billion and i was ballooned to 28.5 billion so do you believe that now is the best it will ever be for tether um and just in general you know how how do you think this whole thing with the kind of regulated unregulated stable coins is going to play out well i'd say uh maybe two or three things here first yes i still think this is the best it's ever gonna be and what i meant by that is it's never gonna get used outside of the crypto ecosystem right so it's never gonna it's never gonna get mainstream adoption and so maybe it grows to 50 billion dollars but it's only gonna happen because people in the crypto space are using it not because you know i can tell you maybe i'm wrong here but i i would be shocked if tesla or microstrategy goes oh i'm gonna start using tether to move dollars around but i don't think that it'll be shocking for tesla or microstrategy to move tokenized dollars around they're just not gonna move tether dollars around and so when you think about there's 60 trillion dollars of m2 in the world you know is tether gonna be the number one dollar stable coin in a world where you get to huge amounts of tokenized dollars no shot it's impossible um you know it's unbacked they've already told us you know i mean you know we'll see what happens with the new york attorney general i just think it's very unlikely that you could be unregulated unbacked and unaudited uh we can throw an extra on there i don't think we know enough to say whether or not it's unbacked but clearly i thought that they went on a podcast and clearly said you know we yes and in terms of service say it may not be backed if you go on the tether website it says it's not fully backed yeah it will or that it holds a mix of other assets including the decline that's not being a dollar backed so maybe we could say it more be more precise and say it's not fully us dollar backed you know there's other assets that are backing it right i mean that's a big deal that's you know it's supposed to be a dollar stable coin you know you're really not then you're a security actually you're a security when you start to have other assets in there that aren't short-term us dollars in there i know because we spent a lot of time examining this uh you know um we'll see obviously what happens here over time but um you know i i think there's a uh i think they're whistling past the graveyard um that yeah i mean it could be a security yeah no it it is it is interesting to see um how that's going to play out and also i think something that fascinates me too about this is that you know a huge percentage of tether usage comes from asia so um in the end it may be fine for tether but um but yeah here in the us things may go in a different direction all right so um i have so many questions about regulation um obviously we talked about how paxos initiated the process to obtain that new york trust charter even before the bit license existed if it had existed at that time that you started that process would you opt for that instead like do you you know what do you think of kind of going the trust charter out versus the bid license well for us it's just crucial to have been a trust company and that's why we did it in the very beginning um we thought about getting a money transmission license and there was a conversation about what a bit license might look like and for us getting the trust license made all the sense in the world because we wanted to be infrastructure and it'd be very hard to be infrastructure if you just have a bit license it'd be very hard to have a primary regulator that oversees the tokens that we've issued our gold tokens our dollar tokens additional tokens that we launch in the future without having to trust and so to me it's a linchpin of our strategy um you know getting it you know meant that we were gonna operate a little bit more slowly than firms that were just using money transmission licenses uh or the bit license because they could operate in other states um in a much different way than we could as a trust but um again it kind of go back goes back to our strategy of did you want to be the uh early adopter winner or do you want to be the mainstream adoption winner do you want to be infrastructure for you know the b2b and the b2b to c players when you know this goes into being about billions of users or did you want to you know get the scale at 40 or 50 million users and so we just tried to have that long-term viewpoint from the very beginning and you know really wasn't over the horizon viewpoint like our conversation earlier but it's one that i think is really clearly bearing fruit now and has put us in a different place with all of these firms that are now coming in and looking for turnkey solutions yeah we'll see how this plays out over the long term because obviously i mean if we go back to that comparison point about how coinbase started around the same time and it has gone that route with the money transmission licenses and and i i just think in general operating from california um you know versus new york which has had these pretty onerous uh regulations um you know coinbase now they you know in january they did 117 billion dollars of volume it bit you know saw a little over two billion so you know i understand that now you're you're going after a different um route but you know coinbase clearly has been successful they're going to ipo it's it's gonna be what looks to be a successful idea so absolutely i think homebase has like it's been fantastic i mean they have you know huge retail user base and so in that way it's where i'd say uh the money transmission licensing route makes a lot of sense because you know you can acquire the retail consumers for them it's about the service that you're offering uh and then when you look at institutions they're expecting just a different level of oversight and so that meant that in the early adopter phase you're going to be moving slower but in the mainstream phase you're in a different position and so that's and so it's not bad or good it's just a different thing right well so your firm has been so buttoned up when it comes to compliance and regulation and so it seems like you have a pretty pragmatic approach to it and yet i do imagine that you maybe have thoughts about how regulation in the us could be improved particularly since you do operate in other jurisdictions so what would be on your regulatory wish list for us regulators and we can talk both federal and state level well you know they kind of interplay together there's just an alphabet soup of different regulators you know kind of across the board the treasury and different departments within the treasury and then the occ and fincen and that's part of treasury uh cftc sec um you know you look at all the different state regulators uh you know kind of it's almost bewildering in some sense um i think there are some simple things that can be done which is states coming up with a a way of being able to create reciprocity if you hit certain benchmarks with other states right now the only way to get explicit reciprocity is essentially you have fdic insurance uh that's the most green you know uh green line way of getting so to speak full reciprocity across states or having a federal oversight and of course that would be you know becoming either a federal uh bank or federal trust and so i think you know it's important for there to be some competition amongst regulators uh because you can be innovative then uh you know we don't we want competition in the markets we want competition everywhere and you want to be able to have different places where people can try different things so i think that's valuable but on the other hand you know you can have too much competition and then you don't get reciprocity and it becomes really hard to move around so i don't think you should have one regulator but i also don't think that having a lack of reciprocity works either that would be one easy way to solve things now of course there's also something i mentioned which is the federal reserve is also another regulator uh so the fed the occ this sec the cft now they're doing different things uh but even the irs is a regulator and so where does this come into play it gets a little confusing the irs says bitcoin is property treasury and fincen is saying this is a monetary instrument how you being treated for tax reasons is different from how you're being treated for regulatory reasons that is a problem i think there needs to be some way of creating some clear understanding of what an asset is amongst these different regulators um and sometimes it might blur the line but like for instance bitcoin doesn't feel like we're blurring the line here there should be a common way but there isn't and so there has to be a common way of saying let's look at an asset class or look at a token let's have some of these federal regulators come together who might be overseeing it is a security is it a derivative is a property and being able to have a common viewpoint that would actually really promote without having to make any kind of adjustments to all these different regulatory umbrellas that would actually have a really clear way of giving entrepreneurs an understanding and then the last thing i would say is regulation tends to be one size fits all and that is really difficult because businesses aren't one size fits all if you have to carry the burdens of being a fully regulated entity but say you only have a million or two million dollars in revenues uh you're not really taking a risk-based approach to which what applies when can you be in a sandbox when can you have a period of time to get up to speed you know will give you a grace period of one year or two years or a revenue threshold when you need to get to some place could really help entrepreneurs a lot and that wouldn't that's not necessarily good for paxos because we've already done all this but i think it's good public policy which is how do we how do we allow there to be more innovation and more competition you know i think that's what you need and so you you um have to make it so it's possible for people to be entrepreneurs and not get tied down in oversight that makes sense if you're a large company but doesn't make sense if you have almost no customers you're trying to get a product out into the market and so i think those three things uh state oversight clear understanding of where an asset sits and um you know some types of sandbox and grace periods can make a huge huge difference for financial services we've seen it in other areas and one other thing i was so curious about was in the u.s what percentage of your operating costs do you estimate you spend on compliance oh well that's a good question i don't know the answer to that off the top of my head you know we were looking at this a couple months ago but it's very very significant and now some of those are fixed costs so it changes over time as we scale you know those costs can scale um but i can tell you we've spent tens of millions of dollars getting ourselves into the position that we are right now from a regulatory perspective that's an enormous amount of capital um you know you look at just creating the trust company uh millions and millions and millions of dollars of capital you can't be a startup uh who's you know raised a seed round of 1.2 million dollars and said i'm going to become a trust company it's just not going to work now there's a reason why you know you probably shouldn't don't need to be a trust company but could you operate in a sandbox uh to be able to do things could you have a grace period to be able to offer certain things um you know maybe there's a you know a minimum amount of uh revenues that could get you um a chance to explore product market fit i think that would be really huge for you know breaking open competition in financial services which is going to be good for everybody and it doesn't mean you don't need regulation but it's when do you need it all right so i've kept you long enough but last quick well we'll see whether or not a quick question you've applied to via trust bank nationally and in december paxos also recently raised its series c fundraising round of 142 million dollars and so i just wondered you know what was next for paxos well look we're going to keep pushing our regulatory uh stack uh to be able to handle more assets and to be able to handle them in broader ways having the trust on a national basis does create explicit federal preemption so you know you can operate in all the states in a really clear way that's valuable it also gives you potential access directly to the federal federal reserve where you can now hold dollars and bonds directly with them that will be important for us i'm getting a clearing agency registration from the sec as i mentioned before is another big approval and we're doing a bunch of these outside the united states as well so you know you're going to have to keep building on a regulatory stack there's no kind of sitting on your laurels because as this becomes more and more mainstream it needs to be able to operate in different ways than maybe where you did you know five years ago or even where you did today and so we're constantly looking down field at other things that we can do to be able to expand the geographies we're in the assets that we're in and the way those assets are being used all right well this has been super fun where can people learn more about
