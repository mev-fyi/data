I think that this is one of the reasons that bitcoiners behave like a shitcoin community these days is because they follow the same type of leaders that only tell them about you know the gospel they only teach the gospel whereas we used to have normal people that were very into the technology and into the like they weren't trying to like push a gospel on you they were trying to educate you on how this technology Works what the drawbacks are and the community was more like I don't know I don't know I don't know if I would say that you know the community chooses its leaders or the leaders it changes the community I don't know like which one of those it is but it is a symptom of where we are today with the community that we don't have leaders that speak about like the the quirks and sort of the negative size and the things that we need to fix
