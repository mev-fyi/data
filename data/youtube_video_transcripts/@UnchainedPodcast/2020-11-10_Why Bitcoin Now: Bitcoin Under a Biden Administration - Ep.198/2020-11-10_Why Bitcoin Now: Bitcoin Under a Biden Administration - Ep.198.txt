of macroeconomic forces including the pandemic and the economic response the most recent episode in the series came out the day of the election and now here we are recording this on friday afternoon and at this moment in time it looks like joe biden will become the 46th president of the united states here to discuss how this could affect bitcoin are dan tapiero co-founder of 10t holdings and gold bullion international and kathy wood ceo and cio at arc invest welcome dan and kathy thank you laura thank you for having us there's so much to discuss about this crazy groundhog day week we're all basically still going through hopefully by the time this comes out we won't still be going through it but first let's discuss the elephant or in this case donkey in the room the presidential election at this moment the most likely scenario we're looking at is that we'll have former vice president joe biden as our next president how do you think a changeover from a trump administration to abide in one will affect bitcoin well you know it's interesting uh this is what i love about our political system i don't think a lot is going to change because this is really a regulatory question and i don't think uh i i don't i don't see a lot of changes on the regulatory front although uh the the head of the occ uh we i really love the direction he's going in as long as he stays in that yeah brian brooks uh as as long as he stays in that position i think we're going to have a force for good if jay clayton is chosen chosen for a different position away from the chair of the sec we might get someone more friendly i think uh to crypto uh i i think uh given all of the uh stable coins and you know the the uh currency-backed uh coins that each country is starting to issue i think there's a certain acceptance of this now and you know if you want to move into the modern age you kind of have to be with it and i think this administration would like uh to to be a part of that movement but again on the regulatory side if there's some displacement at the sec uh we might see things moving what i find interesting is i have been used to watching all of these financial regulators compete with each other over the years and i feel and i for power that is and i've been waiting for jay to respond to brian but i haven't seen much movement uh so i think we could get someone more friendly and maybe some competition from a regulatory point of view and a positive point of view and when you say you've been waiting for jay clayton the chairman of the sec to respond to brian you mean in what way like in a way where he would be more friendly to crypto kind of you know in a competitive way or yeah well and you know basically this is my turf and it's a turf thing it's a turf thing in uh 2006 i think uh was the first time i ever saw regulators work together and that was when they all wrote a letter and said we don't like these exotic home equity loans they were united now you back then i was saying wait a minute this is really bad because they never get together this is going to cause a lot of problems which of course it did this time i would expect not that i would expect someone to be looking at what brian is doing and saying wait a minute uh you know i should be weighing in on this it's a little bit of a competitive regulatory dynamic that i've witnessed over the years interesting yeah i'll i have a little bit more to add to that but why don't we dan why don't you say what you think sure i i don't think the election is going to be determined for quite some time so uh you know i think you know could run easily into late december i think the supreme court eventually probably has to weigh in the votes are just too close and trump uh is just not going to you know he's just not going to sit down and say okay i've lost uh because he's lost by 5 000 votes in one state so i think you're going to have recounts in multiple states i don't think they can start the recounts until after december 3rd though that's when the official i guess vote gets handed in by each of the states and then again each of the states has a different view about when you know when does vote counting stop so i think this is almost as complex an issue as as bitcoin maybe not quite as complex but it's very complex i think it's going to take a while and every time i think that we've tried to count out trump and again you could have started doing this in early 2016 uh he he's defied the consensus so i'm not really willing to bet against him even though it does look it's leaning one way or another i really i just don't know i think that uncertainty actually has been helping uh the bitcoin price action uh you know helping gold as well but look the big relief is that uh this from my perspective why is the market up so much last few days because the 20 percentage point gain uh increase in the long-term capital gains tax that biden had outlined seems to be off the table and so that is basically it right like that that's why we're doing what we're doing uh in the markets because you know maybe they raise it some amount but that 20 was uh you know was was going to be uh destructive completely destructive um now that the senate and the house have picked up a little bit of a republican bias clearly the socialist or i would just okay left leaning uh well let's say extreme left agenda that some people had feared um that would come along with a blue wave that that's not gonna happen so the more uncertainty also if it drags on pia pasta december into january i think they'll be more of a reliance then on monetary policy that's another reason i think for the sort of this 50 move in bitcoin in the last few weeks or 30 40 um is that they won't they won't get fiscal together and so if things do soften or if they are nervous about things you're going to get more on the monetary and you know that was confirmed a little bit by the ecb in the bank of england uh this week that you know they're thinking about additional bond buying etc so yeah i was i was going to add working in the equity markets it was very interesting for me to watch the equity markets move up into the election this has been a decent year certainly for the nasdaq and uh and so the market in its wisdom i think saw saw effectively gridlock which is what we have now you know with a republican senate and a democrat house so i was i was even though uh biden's numbers were going up in the polls the market was going up and i've i've watched many elections over the years and i've been surprised at the market and its wisdom i think also one other thing is going on there are flash points in the world and i think it emanates from you know from all of these unhinged monetary policies uh you know you're i guess argentina's uh uh peso is down 30 this year the turkish lira is now down 30 and i do uh believe that people especially in emerging markets and asia especially remember when the thai bot devalued in i think it was 1997. nobody thought nobody thought anything of it who cares ty bhatt who cares it was the beginning of a domino effect and i'm wondering if what might be getting into bitcoin now is a little bit of a sense of a domino effect here oh yeah yeah there's so much to unpack in what you guys just said so i actually want to go back to the initial comments about the different appointments because i do um you know kathy when you mention brian brooks um by the way people should listen to the episode um i did with him where i you know i asked him all kinds of questions about what he's doing at the occ and yes he has been so extremely friendly to the crypto industry he you know did come from coinbase previously um and he really understands the problems that the crypto industry faces and um understands the levers of government um however i will say also actually there are uh some good signs in that you know even though a lot of these positive moves that the occ made for the crypto industry after he was appointed as acting controller of the currency um actually news came out afterward that they had been in the works for quite some time so i do think there are you know other people um in these agencies that sort of understand what's going on and you know are working to make things better um however what i will say is because he's acting controller and he hasn't been confirmed i i don't know if he will survive um you know uh through abide in administration i mean he might but just from what i heard i i think that this is the kind of appointment where a democratic president would want kind of like someone that they you know somebody from their party to uh to have in that position so um you know that that may that may switch over however i have heard um you know people who are steeped in the dc world saying that they think that a switch over to a wide administration will will basically um also potentially remove some other people who tend to be quite problematic for the crypto industry and so they view it as a positive in other respects um and so yeah you know dan went right into a question i was gonna um ask a little later but we might as well just go there now because um obviously the counting has been very slow um you know at the moment as i started uh i said it was trending in a direction that's positive for biden however um as we know trump has previously refused to say whether or not he would accept the outcome of the election if he loses and so now that it does appear that he will probably lose in his campaign is already mounting these legal challenges in the different states how do you think the prospect of these legal challenges that drag on and put into doubt this transition of power in the u.s how do you think all that will affect bitcoin if it happens dan do you want to start this well you know i mean i think it is happening um you know as i said he's not going to concede and i don't think that's connected to his previous comments uh i think if i were running for president and i lost the whole thing in 5 000 votes i would want to recount so this is completely i think within the realm of what is reasonable uh maybe foreigners don't understand this i'm getting messages from people around the world like why is trump not stepping down well because it's part of our process in 2000 we had the recount uh that was normal and i suspect four or five states are close enough uh that there will be recounts so look it's positive for bitcoin in the same way in a sense that it's positive for gold there's a little bit of uncertainty premium but as i said i think the key driver here is that we're just not going to see those uh those ex more extreme left policies that i think some of the markets were uh we're worried about so and i guess i i might have a little uh more of a different take on that if we had thought that socialist policies were going to start permeating the u.s i would i would definitely uh think that that would be a reason to take an insurance policy out with bitcoin so uh i'm i'm taking my cues more from the equity market and and uh and and i do think as i said that bitcoin is is going up there's a tremendous amount of liquidity in the world so that's the monetary policy uh but also these flash points in terms of uh uh devaluation you see when i see scrolling on bloomberg in one day one day after the other turkish lira does this turkish there's you know there's something going on out there and usually uh mistakes uh are made when mistakes are made the emerging markets are the most vulnerable so that's why i keep my eye on them yeah i mean i think there's something to that um but you know what i think the greatest mistake people in this space make and look i've been i guess i'm saying this coming from 30 years of trading in the macro uh markets is that you know i actually i think bitcoin is just doing its own thing and i think people's attempts at trying to figure out why it's up this week or why it's down that week aren't really relevant i mean i can make the case that you've got enough independent bitcoin positive news you know between what sailors doing between paypal square um just you know the fact that uh barry's uh his uh grayscale thing is eating up all the bitcoin outstanding you know we're in a position where supply is getting really tight um you know regardless we could have any outcome for the presidential election uh any outcome uh you know for secretary of treasury again i think that the concern before was about warren getting in and now i think that's less less of an issue um so like i i just i think there there's there is some applicability of the macro to a bitcoin but i actually i think bitcoin's bigger than all of this stuff and i agree with you on what's happening on the corporate front uh where square just reported last night just a boom in in bitcoin trading uh and paypal embracing it as well there's a competitive dynamic that's very interesting and paypal what's interesting paypal has a uh a relationship where with mercado libre in um in latin america and that's where one of these flash points is right uh so i i do think that and then also the idea that um a micro strategy and a square itself would put you know put some of its cash into bitcoin some or all of its cash you know when microstrategy did it i i looked at the management team and i said okay wow well you know this is a this is interesting and i saw that the cfo had had a lot of experience in latin america uh probably used to the hyperinflations and the roller coaster there um but i i did think what they did was extreme square following on i think we're going to see more and then this notion of 21 million units we're at 18 and a half it's going to start resonating a little bit more well but one thing so i totally understand your point that right now there are just so many forces uh that are boosting the bitcoin price but you know in particular this week there was like a very um sharp movement in bitcoin that maybe was tied to the presidential election i wanted to ask you guys about that because you know at this moment that we're recording on friday afternoon yesterday bitcoin hit 15 000 for the first time since the early days of january 2018 and not only that but within the last 24 hours it had risen so precipitously that there was a point where it almost reached 16 000. so i wondered what you guys thought of that like why that was the case i mean it has since pulled back but i just wondered you know if you thought it had to do with a presidential election or something else i i think uh one source of demand after another is starting to impact it and if you look at uh yasin el mandra our crypto analyst uh just wrote uh actually two a two-part bitcoin paper uh trying to figure out okay the question was are institutions ready for bitcoin and he turned that on its head and said wait a minute is bitcoin ready for institutions and and uh looked at all of the ways to get access exposure to bitcoin from an institutional point of view and uh you know the the easy way to just dimension it is it trades like just one of the mega cap stocks just one you know in our market now that's pretty big and as the price increases there's more quote-unquote market cap uh but you know if institutions are beginning to leg in here and there certainly is a lot of support uh for that you know from a fidelity uh the cambridge research associates uh you know reports saying hey you should at least check this out uh we have backed we have square you know we have a lot of uh infrastructure moving into place which is legitimizing it from an institutional point of view it's still not really easy to do but i do think there are some adventurous if not it would probably be more on the alternative side of course but more more of the fast adopting institutions are they might be just you know dipping their toes in do you have an opinion yeah no i i think that's right i'm uh i i'm a head of an investment committee for an endowment uh a relatively significant size and um you know that's sort of my uh my you know charitably i'm not i i don't i i don't receive any compensation for that but um and so and and i've done that for 10 years and so i'm plugged in a little bit to how other endowments are thinking and acting uh and i will say in q one q two of nineteen last year we put one percent of the entire endowment into bitcoin uh a touch into ethereum very small percent and a little bit into what i would call some other digital asset fund exposure but you know and and at the time i think we were the first endowment of this type to do that um the investment committee is sort of very forward thinking um and you know and our advisors and the people we spoke with you know who help us you know manage that uh portfolio you know they really kind of caught on i think they really they got it and you know when they see guys who are sort of more from a traditional background um being able to explain to them why you know at least one percent i think we probably should have had three to five percent but you know one percent is that whence this casaurus thing get off zero just put one percent that's very helpful with institutions and and for ten t holdings we've been speaking with lots of institutions there are more people who are getting it and who are sort of getting ready and warmed up so i think that just i think the infrastructure is there to handle the the the flood but you know the price will go up so you know it'll double or triple or whatever it is in whatever time period you know that's what bitcoin is is meant to do it's gonna you know it's a it on unlike these you know currency pegs in a way um or the opposite of the currency pegs the one thing that uh there's no control of is is the upside the price will will go to wherever the price needs to go so yeah so uh yasin just wrote i think another blog if it's not out now it will be soon and uh it may have been part of our second paper and uh basically uh took a look at 10 years worth of data all of the assets that uh you know are available to institutions uh and the managed assets uh at that so those that are actually managed by third parties and that's about 110 trillion in the world so a 10-year study um in order and and using correlations of returns and all of the the usual uh uh metrics um determined that the um in order to minimize the volatility of putting uh bitcoin in the portfolio and still enjoy the return i think that was a two and a half percent a two percent position uh if you wanted to maximize the return and were willing to accept more volatility that would have been a six and a half percent position and uh the punch line and this is this is going to be years away but if that's six and a half if institutions were to um hue to that six and a half percent uh in bitcoin uh that would uh you know all other things equal knowing what we know about the supply out here and and the fact that more than 50 of all the bitcoin holders right now uh have held the bitcoin for more than a year uh and many for more than five years uh just so you have to take that out as a you know a supply constraint uh the number he came up with as a price target and i don't want this plastered all over headlines and so forth because this is just if if lots of ifs there is five hundred thousand dollars oh wow by what and did he have like us by a certain time period or just if these things happen this will happen gradually and and believe me we're talking about the institutional world uh these sorts of things happen quite gradually yeah but i think that's about that's around the right number i've quoted i've been quoted at least 10 or 15 times in the past year with that kind of 300 to 500 000 number it's not it's just not too crazy i mean the market cap of bitcoin now is call it 300 billion uh if you understand what the you know the security apparatus is that is the bitcoin network and you sort of contemplate what that kind of network is actually worth to the world i mean you could easily say it's worth two three four trillion it's certainly worth more than one company in the nasdaq and so that can get you to that number it's just that look it's it's a complex thing most people don't even realize you know that it is a network they think it's a they think it's a price bobbing up and down or flashing on their bloomberg uh or that it's magic money or whatever it is so magic internet money yeah i mean i think there's still a lot of residual you'd think that would go away by now but i still you know meet people who are definitively hard no it's fraudulent i'll have nothing to do with it um wow yeah dan you have a a a lot of credibility in this call because you came out of the physical gold world and there's i'm sure there are a lot of your former colleagues or maybe they are still your colleagues who wouldn't touch bitcoin so you've it's been very interesting to to watch what watch your evolution yeah well dan actually do you want to talk about that a little bit like um either your uh conversion or or um you know watching somebody else's like what does it take to you know take someone like that and have them finally understand what bitcoin's about so i mean i think the most natural uh the first adopters really in theory should be gold people because we're from this hard money school and so you know people out there in the bitcoin world who are attacking gold they don't really unders i mean they don't really understand all the nuances that come along with owning physical gold and no need to get into it here um but the philosophy behind owning gold just generically is very very similar and so i think you know in a way and i've said this before the gold guys are kind of like cousins to the bitcoin uh crowd and it's really sort of the the long only equity crowd in america that sort of needs to be converted and the reason they aren't is because they never think about currency right they just if the dollar goes down if fiat is going down it's good because it generally has been supportive of the equity market so for most american investors fiat is the nasdaq for them meaning fiat going down makes sense because the devaluation of the dollar over time uh always has shown up in the s p or or in the nasdaq so americans aren't as natural let's say you know as the argentines or other people who have grown up with trying to understand currency amer americans are not as advanced and so being a gold guy and being a hard money uh you know someone who understands hard money the jump to bitcoin is easy um what's difficult is to understand what exactly bitcoin is and so you have to go and you read the satoshi white paper and you say okay that solves the byzantine generals problem okay and why is that important and then you say oh my gosh he turns electricity into security bitcoin is a security network right that's the genius of this thing that it's you know so it's actually bitcoin is actually a lot more than just gold gold is a store of value but it's not programmable there's no lightning network on bitcoin there's no you know digital asset ecosystem i mean i think that the real opportunity of bitcoin is much much greater than just digital gold um you know so and as kathy mentioned before there's a whole world of companies that are growing up in what i would call the digital asset ecosystem that are enabling uh you know uh enabling the uh usage and transaction of cryptocurrencies uh there are you know early stage sort of applications of blockchain technology that are relevant um you know the bitcoiners hate that hate that word um you know i just think that the bitcoin or and the bitcoin and the technology that's behind it or the invention you know of satoshi's and what it actually is it's just much bigger and so i look i mean a very bullish gold i think we're in the early stages of a bull market i think the gold price will double um but as paul tudor jones says bitcoin will be the fastest horse i think bitcoin can go up 20 to 30 x as gold doubles um you know it's just at an earlier stage um you know of its development but i mean there's a lot there i said and i should stop yeah yeah well so why don't we um you know what we're gonna regroup a little bit about election stuff because i still feel like there are certain questions there we should discuss but first let's take a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible crypto.com the crypto super app that lets you buy earn and spend crypto all in one place earn up to 8.5 per year on your btc download the krypto.com app now to

reserve yours now in the crypto.com app back to my conversation with dan and kathy so so far um we've been you know mainly just discussing the presidential election and we have been talking about having a new administration that has a a legislature that's controlled by the other party however there are um two elections that look like they'll be going to a runoff in january in georgia which would potentially control um determine the control of the senate and i just wondered what you thought um things would look like if we ended up with an administration with a legislature that was controlled by the same party for instance if it was a biden administration with a democratic one would that change your remarks in any way about how this could affect bitcoin it would change my remarks about how it would affect everything um if because what you're talking about there is the so-called blue wave uh and i do think we'd see tax rates going up pretty uh precipitously and uh i think the equity markets would go down uh i think bitcoin could serve as a place of safety or a refuge of some sort so um it's been interesting to watch the equities and bonds going up to the election what we've seen is if you look from january of 18 just say people started thinking about the election way back then what you've seen is there's been an inflow into the bond market of more than 800 billion dollars and there's been an outflow of equities uh and this excludes share of purchases to the tune of more than 400 billion dollars so investors in the equity market have been somewhat uh somewhat concerned about how investments will be treated here uh so i i think uh i think what you're seeing in the market with the odds going up that the republicans will control the senate notwithstanding what you're saying about those two uh the odds have gone up uh i think the the equity market is levitating and it is interesting that uh bitcoin is going with all assets are levitating it's like okay the money is out there let's let's see how many places we could put it uh so i find that very interesting and housing housing as well screaming so i think we're beginning to see the very early days of the reserves that have been sitting on the central bank's balance sheet for a long time they're being activated there's k that has been kindling for a long while and we just put another dollop on it with the coronavirus so we went the peak last time after 0-809 was 4.5 trillion dollars now if estimates are correct this could be nine trillion dollars just in the us by the end of the year uh and it seems like risk-taking has stepping up a bit that the memory of 0809 and the fact that the equity market's been going up consistently since which has left a lot of people on the sidelines it seems like they're stepping out and taking more risk and i think that uh gridlock if that's what we end up with republican senate and democrat house i think the risk-taking will continue to increase our risk seeking will continue to increase and that will include uh bitcoin um it seems uh it seems like a risky animal because it's volatile uh maybe not as volatile as it used to be um but uh it it is a hedge of uh it's an insurance policy so you know i can see diversification of portfolios into many many asset classes dan yeah no i would broadly agree with that you know i would broadly agree with that i i just think you know as long as the tale of the extreme uh left and the you know liz warren type possibilities are gone i mean i don't think the democrats even if they win both they don't really have a mandate to completely change everything in the country i mean this was you know the whole thing was basically toss-up so i don't think they have that you know they don't have the that mandate so but no but broadly i i think kathy's right um well then so let's also you know kathy mentioned this briefly but we really should discuss this more in depth because obviously with all this stuff going on there's also the pandemic um which in the u.s looks like it's going into the third wave there were 121 500 new cases yesterday 1100 deaths yesterday um in the us we're reaching almost a quarter million deaths um total and france germany and england at this point are all entering new lockdowns there's india and russia which are seeing high numbers so you know it's only fall here um we still got fall and winter to go through and i wondered how you expected this new wave of infections and the subsequent lockdowns to affect the economy and in turn how they would affect bitcoin i think it's look increased uncertainty the u.s economic data has been relatively strong the chinese data has been good europe is still floundering a bit um you know so i i think it just it sort of takes the edge off of or the fear that things are coming back too quickly um in fact i think jay powell has sort of been very cautious and look that's all good because rates at zero are very supportive uh for you know all sorts of assets and um you know importantly look i think the most important decision investors have to make in the next 10 years so like the key thing during the 20s will be what to do with that that that part of the portfolio that the traditional portfolios that are 70 30 or 60 40 what to do about that 30 or 40 because they're in government bonds or in bonds that are yielding very low yields and they're not going to protect if we have a slowdown they've sort of become neutered as a hedge component of the portfolio their upside will be limited by the zero bound and so as people realize uh pensions and insurance companies and we're already seeing this in europe with negative yields they're going to have to go out and find some real alpha and you know i think the academic work certainly has been done on what uh what what happens to your portfolio when you add one percent uh to bitcoin or three percent to bitcoin the results are so dramatic that i think uh it's hard for investors to ignore um so you know that's that's with the caveat that if you buy at the right time because i'm sure there are definitely people who bought no laura i don't so i don't think that's right i think that that's the greatest misconception you know if you're a if you're a long-term if you're um you know an endowment or a pension as i said you know you've got a 10-year horizon there is no 10-year horizon that if you could buy today and you could buy for the next three years you're going to be fine on a 10-year horizon i agree with that really you know so those big pools of capital that 100 trillion plus that kathy's talking about um i think they're gonna make their you know they're starting to see this and it's it's partly as a result of the bond yield staying low and that's also partially a result of kovid hanging over everybody because everyone is still cautious and uncertain even though my personal opinion is that it's sort of beyond the worst of it march was the worst april that we're gonna see but that you know people can remain cautious for another year or two so again that keeps yields low that keeps you know that and that makes the institutional investors start to question like you know what 30 of his portfolio is doing it at 40 basis points right and uh i would i would uh say that this latest surge i think in the us will probably respond differently than europe is i mean because uh i think we're asking the question wait a minute this is a virus the first lockdown did not work really so what do we think why are we doing that again so i think there's more of that attitude in the us and i think that actually impacted the election to be honest i think uh you know there was a clear difference i mean looking at the election results if i didn't know anything if i didn't know anything except the the numbers uh of uh in the in congress senate and the house the democrats lost seats in the house uh republicans kept kept the senate despite the polls saying otherwise i would have said that wow uh president trump's coattails brought a lot of these people along it did not seem like or at least the the the uh uh i don't know how the vote will end as dan says that it will be contested but um i would have said wow those are some coattails because that was a big change and and and was not predicted by any of the polls uh and i think part of it it was one party wanted to shut the country down and the other party did not i mean that's a little too black and white but uh and so i do think that's why we are back in gridlock in congress i really do all right well i mean we this has been um sprinkled throughout the conversation but let's just tackle this directly in late august federal reserve chairman jerome powell introduced a new interest rate policy that will target an average two percent inflation even if that means allowing for higher inflation for longer periods of time so i wondered how you thought this policy would affect bitcoin well i don't i don't think you know there's not a lot out of the central banks that's really relevant i mean two percent inflation you know i i think uh i mean look if obviously they're not going to care about two or three it's it's bullish for a bitcoin it just means there's more liquidity available out there um they're going to let things run hot but i just don't think we're in that old framework anymore um you know the old you know let's try to interpret monetary policy to mean something it's just it's just not you know that's old school macro you know that's what you did in the 90s uh and the 2000s i think it's all rates everywhere are basically real rates everywhere basically zero around the whole world and and nominal rates are zero in a big chunk of the world so if we get some what you want to call inflation and the rate goes up one percent i mean it doesn't matter i think we're in a post central bank world in a way not post post-modern monetary policy world i would say i don't think they have much impact to you know ability to impact things so so i i think uh what dan says uh you know a lot of a lot of people after 0-809 seeing the monetary base go up so dramatically we're worried about inflation and uh so here we are again uh in this in the second big stage here and i i see fewer people worried now which makes me worry a little bit more in other words i think complacency is where we could get into trouble here so when i saw that two percent and we'll let it go go above two percent uh you know not saying how far above because of how far below and how long it has been below two percent i said now so that i'm going to be looking at a few things one um and and they have to do with the velocity of money which has been plummeting and that's why it hasn't caused any inflation when consumer confidence increases uh i have associated that in the past with all all we need to see is a cessation of the fall in velocity you know and and we're already seeing for example um in the housing market we're seeing shortages of lumber and materials which is kind of an inflationary psychology and we're seeing uh you know the minimum wage if you look at amazon and a number of other companies they're talking about yes we're going to have a a 15 minimum wage and and so you get people thinking oh okay well you just if they if we change the mindset from this you know i have to hold my money i have to hold precautionary balances i can't spend it because something could go wrong then if they just stop acting like that just a cessation of the decline in velocity would change the momentum here in terms of inflation we've got m2 at 25 on a year-over-year basis it might be even higher than that right now so while i don't think there's an inflation problem right away i think uh uh we're focused at arc exclusively on disruptive innovation bitcoin blockchain technology being that but they're all deflationary in nature you know so i think there are these huge undercurrents of deflation and productivity gains that are going to hold inflation at bay uh so i just i i listen and i and i do hear the people not worrying about it anymore and i'm not worried about it because of what i just told you however i don't like the complacency and i think because i think that's why mistakes are going to be made so for that reason i have upped my own insurance policy on on bitcoin and i already owned a lot huh okay well yeah let's actually dive a little bit more into bitcoin because you know here we've discussed politics we've discussed the pandemic um and amidst all this we also had this having last spring which cut the new supply of bitcoin being produced in half to 6.25 bitcoins every 10 minutes down from 12.5 and so i wondered as you're looking at these larger forces and then in the middle of all that you see the clock-like ticking of the bitcoin software how do you expect bitcoin to perform over this next year i know we did talk you know just generally um without putting a time frame on it but i'm kind of curious over this next year as we you know continue to kind of ride out the pandemic and we just had a having well the last time we had a having it took a little while uh for for i don't know if it took a while for the knowledge to hit in or the actual impact to uh to make its way into the marketplace but it was a setup for a very nice run and i do think that's part of what's going on at this time as well as people do the arithmetic uh yasin uh in his paper put out or it may be the next paper but this uh chart where you can track because the network is so transparent uh how much bitcoin has been held for five years and more three years or more one year and more you know 30 days and the loyalty is pretty uh startling i mean 60 more than a year you know so a lot of people think it's this wild crazy trading mentality at work uh um but it's 60 more than a year you know equity portfolios even even our own equity portfolios um we might hold our names we may have very little name turnover but we'll be trading in you know around volatility we're not seeing that in bitcoin i mean at the margins of course we are but in terms of the vast uh majority of the holders i'm i know some of it's lost but uh and we don't know how much of uh that 60 but you know they're they're holders so that's that's quite significant dan what do you think i mean look uh i think it's too hard to trade uh bitcoin uh i think the certainty of a price projection over one year is dramatically less than over three years so look i would say can bitcoin go to 30 40 000 by the end of next year sure but i would have a higher degree of confidence that it could get to 70 000 in three years so i just i think again i think there's too much of this uh historical traditional uh or attempts at historical analysis or traditional analysis from other markets like you know to say if x happens x plus y will then equal z i think as i said bitcoin is just doing its own thing it's an early stage technology uh you know early stage monetary standard i mean it's so many different things so uh i could see it at almost any number honestly and i think trying to finesse it uh is just gonna be heartache i mean this is one of the few times in life where you're really just given an opportunity to just sit back if you have that luxury you don't have to do any more you can spend an hour to reading about bitcoin you know you've got your position uh people always want to run around and do things and move around and like be productive you know i if you're long enough bitcoin in the right percentage that you know that that's going to be enough i just want to say one thing about kathy's point i've been you know i've admired her business and her focus uh and how she set that up i mean i think it's sort of a new wave of companies uh and also um you know do she's doing something better than the legacy system um and and and the deflationary pressure that she's talking about that's coming from her industries is just so massive and it's in a way never been measured before and so you're looking at these old things like the cpi which were constructed who knows when 1948 i mean it's like the swift it's like the swift system it's like pre-internet um so you know just as an example zoom for instance i was supposed to go to australia and meet investors for two weeks i was going to have 20 meetings uh covet hits i don't have to go to australia i don't have to spend two weeks 50 000 on hotels and flights and this and that i do one call with 20 investors one hour one call finito so tell me is that measured in the cpi no way i just saved 50 grand just to not so i just think that this is the most interesting time i can ever recall in my career um because the change that's going on underneath this the system or underneath uh underneath the market like the the changes there you know yes there's there are people who are suffering now um but you know there's been so much that's been pulled forward uh especially in kathy's world um so much that's been pulled forward that's sort of gone into hyperspeed i mean and again zoom is the perfect a perfect example um i don't think those things have been calculated and uh normally i i'm worried about the complacency aspect as well um but uh on inflation but no i i'm not and i actually really like sailors um the way that he's looking at inflation which is that um you know i've got to keep up with my you know the 15 a year that the nasdaq's gonna do or i you know so he's looking at his allocations based upon what relative assets do that that he's involved with i like that and and also you know the point that yes i mean your cash is zero uh with a one percent inflation rate you're losing one percent a year and so you know there are a bunch of powerful forces right now uh that are interacting and i don't think there's any analysis that's been done on that yet they'll do it in three or four years um and and this confusion leads to opportunity and you know that's why each of us in our own way are prospering uh having focused on this new digital world well i imagine kathy actually probably has done some analysis and i was going to ask you about that but why don't we jump to that question now because i know that one area that you've called out as right for disruption is banking and obviously you've made like you know prescient investments in square and such so how do you see banking changing over the next few years and um obviously how do you think that will affect bitcoin [Laughter] yes so we believe that i think the numbers there are about roughly 250 billion dollars in bank branches and those are going to be stranded assets we're going to walk around with bank branches in our pockets or our pocketbooks honestly we're shocked that this year jp morgan after shrinking its bank branch base has has uh decided to move it up and the only thing we can conclude because at least they're thinking about crypto and digital wallets and so forth is that uh jp morgan is aiming to become the all the walmart or costco of banking which is very different from what they perceive right now they want to roll up the industry because we think the industry's in real trouble and one of the reasons we think it is in real trouble is the yield curve is while it's gone positive here we think it's going to flatten and go negative longer term again because if you look at periods of very rapid inflation and you go back to i mean innovation you go back to telephone electricity automobile in in the late 1800s early uh 1900s the yield curve was inverted more than half of the time there back then over that 50-year period to into the roaring 20s with the average inversion being 100 basis points and that's and that was primarily because of the burst of deflation that was occurring associated with these new technologies so we think banks are going to be commoditized there's no way they can that they cannot jump into this new dna that's one thing i've learned over my career there's old dna and they usually say to the newbies when they uh surface like square and then mo either they dismiss them entirely or they basically say we're gonna wipe them off the face of the earth that's our installed base we can do that we're spending this much on technology wrong dna you and i are old you and i are old dna and we've we've been making the transition well you know but i don't think organizational i don't think organizational structures can you know when you think about i mean everything we do whether it's autonomous electric you know the auto manufacturers are not even that's not how transportation is going to be going forward you have to be you have to be battery you have to know batteries you have to know software you have to know artificial intelligence you know it's just a new ballgame new ballgame you and i as investors i mean i'm charged up by innovation so i'm always seeking it out yeah um and i certainly i think one of the biggest mistakes that our industry has made i think it's led to the most massive misallocation of capital in history and that is the move to indexation passive especially after the tech and telecom bust and the 0809 meltdown more than half of all equities in the united states today are held in passive portfolios that is really sad massive misallocation of capital uh that's why i want us to stay ahead as much as we can in the blockchain world bitcoin world i know this is a global phenomenon but i don't want the innovation associated with it to migrate because the capital markets aren't financing it right that's one of the reasons i started the company financing it no they're not financing i know i know and in fact a lot of the innovation is moving uh abroad a lot of the funds are moving abroad and they don't even want american investors in them because of our regulatory system so we risk being left out in the cold in some way so like i'm out there like beating the drum saying hey you want to win in this race you've got to make uh the regulatory environment much more friendly to innovation otherwise we lose it to other countries and especially now with china on the march on the march right literally on the march to become number one in innovation the one thing we do very well here in the united states though is open source uh the movement started primarily here uh i think linus was from norway but uh the the the movement started here and i do think more and more industries are going open sources of course block tape blockchain bitcoin blockchain that's open source china's not going to allow that they're not going to allow that so they could be left out in the cold for that reason i've been thinking a lot about this but we in the united states have got to get our capital allocation straight and move away from the dinosaurs that that that world is going to be really destroyed in many ways and i think that you asked about banks and here i'm off on a completely world view but i really think banks are in harm's way that's why they're underperforming uh i think they're going to lose they're going to lose their business to digital yeah they'll be able to participate in some of it and it will be a roll-up industry it'll be a roll-up there will be some very few but some very big strong banks uh but more digital will run circles around the rest of it laura i think we've got to get kathy down to d.c one of those committees to tell them that you know we really are uh you know there really is a possibility that we lose our edge here i couldn't agree more yeah yeah so i i don't get involved in that however i will say i do know a number of regulators do listen to this show um however they're probably already the ones that are interested in this stuff anyway so yeah maybe they're not the ones that uh need to hear it um but yeah i there was a funny thing that happened to me um i think it was last winter and i did mention it on the show but i was walking down the street and i think i like i don't remember what it was like i you know had i don't know let's say like a dentist appointment or something and i was like leaving so and i just was thinking about nothing and i passed by a bank and a little voice in my head was like that won't be there in five years like i remember when that like that thought just popped in my head i was like what and then i thought oh yeah that'll probably be the case but it'll be more like you know within the next 10. um but anyway since you mentioned china i was also going to ask about the whole issue around central bank digital currencies because you know here we've got like great momentum around bitcoin you know which you can think of as this non-state money and yet on the other hand we have all these governments that are working in these central bank digital currencies and china obviously is already in this pilot phase of rolling one out um the european central bank is actually soliciting feedback on a potential digital euro at the moment the federal reserve has said that it is exploring a cbdc and obviously we know there are you know smart and influential people like the former cft cftc chairman chris john carlo who's advocating for a digital dollar so at this point i'm sure it's just you know a matter of when not if and i wondered as we start to see more central bank digital currencies become issued how do you think that would affect bitcoin and you know kind of what are you looking for in that movement especially if china kind of comes out first like do you think they could leverage that in any way i you know i i actually think that movement to cbdc's is going to it's in a way it's an indirect way it's validating the space even though it has bears no resemblance to bitcoin right nothing night and day in fact this is just a way for china to continue its surveillance and verification procedures and as more people learn that that you know you've got big brother watching everything now i think the demand for uh bitcoin stateless bitcoin will go up so i uh that yeah and and this will probably serve as like an easier on-ramp because it will you know their money will already be digital and yes that's what i was going to say that i mean i agree with kathy that it puts the the this also the scarcity uh aspect of bitcoin and stark relief right i mean the the central banks just push a button and it's created but more importantly i think it just it gets people more comfortable with the concept of abstract money or digital money and we're going to be on those new rails and so once you're on those new rails you're like well what else can we put on these rails oh there's bitcoin there's ethereum i mean i i just think that it opens up people's uh minds and i think that's the big challenge in this space with bitcoin and and broadly the digital asset ecosystem is just getting people comfortable with how it works and why it is the future all right so we're kind of coming up on the hour here and we haven't even i mean there's just been so much activity in bitcoin and there's just so much going on in the world that it could that could affect bitcoin so there's like kind of too many things to discuss but i will throw out some other things around um just to see i'm kind of curious to know what you're looking for um you know in the next let's say a year um in terms of like how you think this could affect bitcoin but you know we didn't go into the whole microstrategy or square thing very much we did not even touch paypal integrating bitcoin which is you know obviously huge or the jpmorgan chase investment note which you know was kind of bullish on bitcoin which is pretty remarkable given that the ceo jamie dimon has been famously pretty dismissive of bitcoin so just with everything going on in the world the you know political stuff the election the um pandemic etc what are you looking for when you're thinking about what could happen with bitcoin over the next year well i think uh i i think the the the rush you're seeing here is there's this there's been this aha moment and i think the coronavirus uh caused it you know uh innovation always takes off during tough times always it because it solves a lot of problems uh and that has certainly been true here and i believe you know that that uh executives are looking at the accelerated shifts taking place in retail if you listen to sheryl sandberg on facebook's call last week she made the uh just simple observation um that online retail has gained a hundred basis points of share every year for the last four years in the second quarter it gained 400 uh basis points so four percent so it took four years prior and in one quarter we got uh four percentage points up to sixteen percent and only sixteen percent in the us re online retail as a percent of total most of us think uh and behave as though it's much more than that that is the beginning point of the the sweet spot for the s-curve just the exponential growth many people think amazon's already done it uh but there's so much more to come and i think i i think executives were awakened to did a lot of digital realities and how far behind they were if you look in the gdp report that came out this uh last week i have never seen a bigger surge i think it was a 70 surge that's an annualized rate in one quarter i've never seen that before there is an absolute you know rush to get into the modern digital age and part of that is all digital assets including cryptocurrencies that's why i did i do think you saw the microstrategy announcement and uh square integrating it into its digital wallet it saw the use cases and now stocks and everything so if you if you this digital wallet that square has this cash app is going to trample so many uh traditional financial uh institutions that they have to face the reality what is my digital future so they have to learn more about crypto assets cryptocurrencies and you know digital uh digital assets broadly so um i think it's a wake-up call and that the movement uh gained acceleration you know this this okay i have to think about this it's not this is not a five-year phenomenon it's now that's what i think is happening dan what about you i mean you know that's that's very well said um look i've been uh i've sort of had the same view on bitcoin uh in terms of price and in my head it's sort of on autopilot so i don't you know there's no trading of it i'm holding i think i have a price in my head years down the line so i've actually been focused more on what i would call the mid to late stage businesses companies that are in the digital asset ecosystem not the vc early stuff um you know you say who built that paypal functionality well it was paxos right paxos is a d what i call a dae you know company um you know coinbase is going to have it potentially an ipo next year um there are some really good companies they're all private that are growing up in the space my attention is squarely focused on them and you know i will be incorporating uh equity in those companies into my own uh portfolio and uh 10t is is going to make a business um a business of that so i think that that's a whole other world we haven't even discussed uh there are some phenomenal companies you know you look at block fi that's come out of nowhere um you know i could you know go on and on about you know and and and and the growth rates are are astronomical so um i think that will also bring a whole new level of attention to uh bitcoin because you asked the question about bitcoin but as and as these companies you know grow and hire more people and people start to know you know what kraken is or you know just people outside of our world don't even know that there are companies in this space they don't know that you can you can earn five percent on your bitcoin if you know if you want they don't so that that's that's something that is easy for people to understand uh equity companies uh leadership income statement balance sheet they don't have to figure out you know token economics or you know which protocol is gonna you know beat you know the other protocol so i think investors increasingly become focused on this world right right and the whole the whole the whole defy movement uh and and to your point dan you know the interest rates that you can get out there in the crypto asset world those are attracting a lot of interest uh relative to the competition in the the old world uh and i think the best thing that happened to that ecosystem was march the coronavirus also because you know there was there were you know uh masters of the universe involved you know evolving and they thought they could do no wrong and now their businesses are shut down really good in terms of getting the right governance structures put in place in this very young uh emerging uh technology world so um we're pretty excited about that as well all right well we will get to see where all this takes us and what the future holds amidst all these shifting forces in the meantime where can people learn more about each of you and your work so arc dash invest is our research site so we we put all of our research up there it's uh we give it away and and we're on twitter as well we all if you look on our site you'll see our analysts each one of them has a handle yasin elmandra's handle if you're interested in bitcoin is probably the one uh you want to to follow uh but we're we're the the research uh we're doing more and more research on bitcoin because we do believe the institutional world should be and is getting ready to move into the space oh yeah actually kathy i'm glad you mentioned the open source thing because or your research because i did mean to mention that when you talked about open source that you open source your research which i think you know is definitely obviously something quite different in your world but it shows that you really um follow the philosophy and um and you know your investment philosophy aligns with how you run your business and dan yeah and and and thanks uh kathy for doing that because i certainly have benefited from meeting some of those research pieces oh great thank you absolutely absol absolutely i mean it's uh three to five five years ago there was no research in the space that was part of the reason it took me a while to to get into it um but i think you're doing great work and you're you're helping tons of people out there um thank you so um so i would recommend that to people uh i'm i'm on twitter uh i'm not uh i put something out every once in a while on bitcoin gold macro uh etc uh tenty holdings is a private equity fund it's private you know you can google uh you can google me there are all kinds of interviews and other things that we've done um you know gold bullion international is the gold company i founded uh 10 years ago we we are still booming and this year was a record year and uh you know we do sell physical gold and uh sell in store and we think we are sort of the the institutional quality high caliber provider in the space we are now the third largest vulture of gold in the world outside of the uh banking system uh over 300 000 clients we've done over a million trades on the platform i mean so it's it's very robust um but i'm not i'm not involved in the day-to-day there i'm just watching it it grow especially this year so um but it's really twitter and of course you know everything is on google now i mean i used to remember when you could google you know and before google i would spend you know two weeks in a research library looking for one book and now you know i i did that when i studied history in college and now it's like everything is there it's almost you know where can they not find you is really the question [Laughter] yes yes i um i totally agree i just feel like even um yeah just you know in the two decades since i've graduated from college just the way that i research things has completely changed all right well this has been such a fun conversation thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you thank you laura thanks so much for joining us today to learn more
