Raph dot-com my guest today is Richard Craven founder of New Marais welcome Richard good to be here your trajectory in crypto is a bit atypical and it goes in stages I'd like to start at the very beginning but also moose and what quickly so we can get to your new your most recent announcement about your new data marketplace are we sure but to start describe what you were doing before crypto and how you got into crypto before crypto I was studying pure mathematics and I then went to work for a asset management firm and I was a quant and my job was to basically try to apply machine learning algorithms to the data sets that they had to try to make a new fund product for them and it worked very well but around this time I was also reading about aetherium and investing in auger and aetherium and I was sort of thinking about blockchain as well and thinking that maybe machine learning plus blockchain could kind of allow you to make a new kind of hedge fund altogether Oh interesting so that I think leads us to a new Mirai why don't you describe what new Mirai is and especially and also how it worked at the time we launched it yeah número is the first hedge fund to give away all of its data and allow anybody around the world to model it with machine learning and submit predictions back to our to us which we then trade in our fund it's not a crypto fund it's a global equity fund but the way that the Alpha is created is unusual so usually it's a really bad idea to give away your data because it's like you're giving away your edge and so the way that new Mirai the trick with numeral was that we gave away our data but in this totally obfuscated form so people could do machine learning on it but they had no idea what it represented so if you download the new Mirai data it's just 50 features this is feature one feature two feature three you have no idea what feature one means or feature two means and you're just modeling a binary target one or a zero so it's this huge grid of numbers between 1 and 0 and you and it turns out if you you can still do machine learning on that you can still find patterns even though you don't know what what you're modeling and so this is kind of aligns incentives like the problem is with sharing data is that people could run off and start their own hedge funds by doing it this way you're not only making it impossible to steal the data but you're making this incentive to once you build a model you should submit it submit the predictions to número interesting and just so I understand essentially they don't really understand what they're looking at it's really more just this sort of abstract it's like when you look at one of those quizzes where it's just like the numbers and you're looking for a pattern and the numbers and you want to guess what the next number in the pattern is is that kind of what they're doing exactly and one way to think about it is if you have a scatter plot of points you can easily find a line that's the best the line of best fit across the those points even if you don't know what the X and y-axis is you can still find this line and numr I it's it's like you're finding this line but in 50 dimensions and so the patterns are all there and a machine learning algorithm can pick up pick up on them even though you don't know what the data is interesting and I know that there are other hedge funds that have turned in like crowdsourcing information so how does anymore.i differ from some of those well the big the big difference is is the way that we share data and what's important about doing it the way numr I does it is we are not trying to get our users to build an institutional grade long/short equity strategy from the ground up using raw data I think that's a task that's too - big - to crowdsource so you I don't really think you can crowdsource a whole bunch of trading strategies but you can crowdsource the kind of like machine learning optimization of a particular strategy so to give you an example like if we were to let users do anything they could say make a model that's really good at Japanese tech stocks but maybe we don't even trade those stocks and maybe we don't like very short-term trading by giving away the data and the way we do it we're deciding what the universe of socks is which stocks we want to include in the universe which features we want to allow and the time horizon that we want to hold for so in a way we're we're really shaping the strategy and our users are just coming up with the best possible model for that strategy Oh interesting in it but then do you shape it via the type of data that you're giving them or yeah so yeah we only give them certain data that that's sort of like features we want to use so it limits them to to model only our data set which has its advantages in that they're not going to produce anything we don't like and also it's like a little bit more scientific because if we just said send us any strategy it's not as as good as saying here's a data set you have no idea what it is it's completely blind it's like a blind a blind test of whether you're good so it's much you can make much better claims about whether the models are going to generalize if the people haven't overfit okay and what kind of data were you giving the data scientists and where were you obtaining this data well we don't say what it is and that's why it's obfuscated but it is quant style data so it's the kind of data that other hedge funds might use it's nothing too obscure it's not like image data or satellite images or anything strange like that it's really like very high quality multi multiple decades of equity data Oh interesting okay and just for people who aren't familiar with the hedge fund world or just to find the word quat quanta it's sort of short for quantitative financial analysts and it just means like someone who's who's looking at finance really without a business mindset and more looking at data and statistics ok interesting so then let's talk about the way you were encrypting the data how were you able to encrypt it in a way that they were able to make use of it so one of the first things that really inspired me was reading about fully homomorphic encryption back in 2015 and I since then you've seen a lot of people talking about it it's basically like a neat way of encrypting data where you can still do operations on the data but you have no idea what it is but it's very very slow so it's basically impractical and it's not like two times to slow it's like a million times to slow and it's not really getting much faster so the first idea what were for numero was that we might use fully homomorphic encryption but then we ended up releasing a data set that was much more manageable for for the average data scientist because you have this thing with número where you might have data scientists that are very very good at machine learning but have no idea about crypto and we wanted to be accessible for people like that so the data set we release uses different kinds of obfuscation techniques to basically make it very difficult to to know what the data is and then at that time you know before you launch your token and everything how are you paying the data scientists for their contributions the very first week of new Mirai I think we we paid people with PayPal and we only had three people at the company and we're all pretty busy and I was just like we should just use Bitcoin and at that time I think Bitcoin is on $400 it was 2015 it wasn't like particularly good year for Bitcoin and many of our users maybe hadn't even heard of it like I said their daily scientists they're not necessarily into crypto but it just was much easier for us to use Bitcoin and it had this weird effect like the minute we switched over to Bitcoin suddenly were much cooler company and suddenly it was like oh you know what I'd it's much more interesting to win $1 in Bitcoin than to win $1 sent over PayPal and delayed by 2 weeks and blah blah blah and so it also allowed our data scientist to be anonymous which also was a very compelling feature and and numr I kind of had this early momentum of being it's sort of like didn't look like a hedge fund it looked a lot more like a crypto cypherpunk kind of thing and that ended up being kind of part of the early story of new moriah so essentially just walk through the whole process you essentially were giving them this data you were releasing it what like on a monday and then like by friday they were submitting models and then you and then how would you who would get paid yeah um yeah we gave away the data and we had these at that time it was monthly tournaments and people would download the data run all kinds of different machine learning algorithms and submit predictions back to us and we paid them based on how well they did on the out-of-sample test data so is this pretty rigorous way of checking checking how good they would be what happened though is people end up making lots of accounts and so you'd make like a thousand accounts and just hope that one of them got lucky and that's in a way the broadest problem with crowdsourcing it's it's sort of it's sort of not immune to two simple attacks and you might have someone make thousand accounts try to get lucky and not really be submitting the model they really believe in and that's when we started thinking about creating our own cryptocurrency because if you can make people stake even if I have a thousand accounts they're going to want to stake the one that's the best and it ends up being this awesome filter to to make people to make people state cryptocurrency and enables you to to create a crowd-sourced hedge fund where in the past you would always have these problems of of people overfitting and not having models that generalize to real data so talk about that you launched anywhere 2017 in June 2017 what was it and how did it work yeah we announced numeraire on February 20th I think theorem then was on about $5 you wrote about us actually world's first hedge fund to create a cryptocurrency and we were really we trying to make an application we were trying to make aetherium application that people actually used and and that actually solved a very specific business problem which was not knowing which users to trust and and then in June 2017 that's when we launched and we decided not to do an ICO we gave away the tokens to our users we gave a million of them away and with and yeah within the very first day people were people were using it to stake and since then it's been staked almost I think it's over eighteen thousand times different stakes so it's making it one of the most used at theorem application tokens by far any other utility token might have a lot of transfers which is hope to do with trading of the token but very few tokens have actual use where the functions that are not transfer are being called in those contracts so it's pretty cool that it became this really well used token even though it's quite a niche user base and so describe that staking mechanism they were essentially instead of doing the simple attacks now they actually wanted all their models to be identified with their with them is that what okay all right bye-bye asking them to stake even a small amount thus taking the deal is if you stake your predictions then we can destroy your stake if your predictions turn out badly or if they turn out well we'll return your stake and pay you more 'if pay more money so it had this effect of you know no one's gonna risk a stake on something they think mites might get burned unless they really believed in it and so suddenly all the people who were staking had much higher Sharpe ratios on their back tests much higher returns than the people who who once taking so it's kind of amazing to just like use a new technology and you just like flip a switch and suddenly the whole company made sense it was like now you really can crowdsource predictions Oh interesting so I want to learn more about that like what were all the behavior changes that you saw it like did you see a reduction in the Sibyl I you know accounts and stuff or yeah so we saw about half of the users ended up staking I think of something like yeah all the people who participated the no participation went down because you now had to had to stake so the only way to make money was with staking and then of the participants the ones who did stake had better performance so it was really quite instantly exactly as we'd had we'd hoped for and a lot of that is to do with the fact that we gave it to our users and we gave it to the users who had done who'd earn the most Bitcoin in the previous kind of version of the website so we were giving it to the people who are most likely to use it and the most likely to perform well Oh interesting yeah and just to give us a picture where time so initially you started with PayPal then you smudge typically how much were you paying out to people and US dollars based on were you paying very little at first something like $10,000 a month and that would be split amongst how many users I think we're paying the top 20 or something like that okay and then by the time you launch numeraire how much were you paying people well numeraire ended up being put on exchanges so like metrics put us on the exchange and started trading at these at these very high prices so for a short time you know we'd given out a million tokens as an airdrop and in the early days of trading of NMR it was trading at a hundred and sixty dollars this was like an airdrop of 160 million dollars to that very small user base so that created some distortions that we couldn't couldn't really have predicted but like doing they staked only very little because it was worth so much in dollar well just just yeah we didn't really know didn't know how much the token was gonna be worth or whether it would be traded at all on an exchange but it was ya training at treating at these very high prices which made some of our users like overnight millionaires it made número most well-paying data science tournament ever at one point we're paying like 10 million dollars per week oh my god like really really crazy but that only lasted a short period yeah it it's sort of like cooled down a bit and we also had a lot we adjusted the number of NMR we paid out so it's sort of strange like it did make me think like I on the one hand it's it's a really good idea to not do an IC o---- but on the other hand it sort of sets a price so if we you know other projects had done if you do a nice you had one dollar then maybe the token would only be worth three dollars or something and people would have some kind of rational expectation of what the price should be but with numeraire was like we're giving away there's no possible way you can buy it it's only for our users and then there's just so many people who are interested in the project that they they also decided to buy it on the market and make a market for it and so essentially what happened was you you did this airdrop and there was no value it was just used this in our tournament but then because bit trucks opened a market and all these non data scientists that couldn't access the token wanted it that's what drove the price up is that I think so it's always odd to say and so it was at that point when it went on bit trucks that it got a dollar value yes yeah oh so you didn't send a dollar value no because we never sell this so we know what oh yeah what would be Wow fascinating and so after you introduced new murder that effect the rate at which data scientists were joining the site or no yeah we definitely got a lot of new people joining a lot of crypto speculators joined our slack a lot of like scammers joined us and we had to shut down on slack that's our thing it was very like felt like wow we've been like overrun by a different a different group of people but well I think the whole crypto community thinks yeah but I think yeah they also again it was like we're just making this this very simple simple application that we wanted people to use and we didn't have any the sort of marketing of it was wasn't big so a lot of people like why don't you why don't you you know why don't you have telegram group we didn't even have a telegram why don't you do this blind you do all these different kinds of activities to get to get more people to to buy the token or something like that and so that was kind of peculiar to have this this new group of people that felt they had sort of try to exert pressure on the on the overall project and I think what the choices we have made have have had much more like durability and long term focus which is now paying off as the other crypto projects you know either get sued or or get zero usage and so I think we're looking looking relatively good now and how is the performance of your hedge fund changed from before it numeraire to after it knew where are you like getting better performance well we don't talk about the performance of a hedge fund can't you just say performance is up after introducing the new mare or can't say but what we can talk about is is the back tested performance and so on the three years of holdout data which the users can't see the answers to we can show that the accuracy and the returns and are better on the back test is not only with the staked models because you there are still people submitting exactly ok so there's about yeah about a thousand four hundred submit seven hundred stake something something like that and the stakes are much better and are the are you getting more models submitted now with the new Mara no more since like the there's just the sheer number of models that are being submitted well by we've definitely taken away out a lot of the bots because they were you know so it's hard to know but they're definitely a lot more genuine users who are much better than ever so it's all been really good and what about assets under management how much do you have now and how much did you have before we also don't talk about that but there's a way to check whether we have more than 150 million and if you were to check you'd see that we haven't filed filed for that so we have less than hundred fifty million okay I should just think of more questions where you're gonna be like we can't talk about that but hey you having two returns although any things we don't talk about it okay so I'll ask you I know that Howard Morgan of Renaissance Technologies was an early investor in numeron and you know they're a big pioneer in quantitative and algorithmic trading so how was that influenced you know the development of Neriah well how'd morgan is an incredible investor to have he's not only extremely knowledgeable about quantitative finance but also VC broadly he's a seed investor in uber as well and partner first a first round so he was a really amazing person to meet and then he also has used to be a professor in computer science so he kind of knows about crypto has very like very very high raw intelligence and so it was very flexible in his in his thinking about you know like learning about aetherium and so he was a amazing investor to have all right so we're gonna discuss their new decentralized data marketplace erasure but first I'd like to show you a quick break for our fabulous sponsors on-ramp is a full-service creative and design agency that has helped numerous companies including many in the blockchain and crypto space maximize their brand awareness game traction and accelerate growth whether you're a startup company launching a new brand or an established brand exploring a new campaign on-ramp has you covered on ramp has a passion for boosting business results and can help with everything from logo and website design to full creative execution focus on your core technology and leave the rest to on-ramp to learn more and see how they've helped passionate entrepreneurs achieve their dreams go to think on rap comm I was speaking with Richard crepe of New Marais you recently announced a new protocol called erasure describe it yeah well the thing about número is that all of the modeling is happening on the data set that we give out and so there's a the question is you know New Marais has really been able to solve the problem of crowdsourcing machine learning models on a given data sets but what if we could crowdsource data as well and what if people could use their own data to generate predictions and submit those and I have been thinking along those lines for a while and you know they are there are really two pieces of having a good hedge fund and number one is having good data number two is having good talent and numr I has you know hundred times more data scientists who have signed up to it than any any real world hedge fund in the world but there's a but maybe we have way less data than Renaissance have today and way less than to Sigma so could you could you do something creative on the crowdsourcing of data and so I wrote this white paper actually over a year ago about erasure and it's like it's acknowledging the fact the same the same problem is if you tried to crowdsource data you'd get a bunch of really bad data if we had a part of our website that said upload data and we'll pay you people would upload pictures of Pepe and Trump and it wouldn't be financial data at all or even if they did upload financial data it wouldn't would be really badly formatted so you you need to have some kind of stick carrot and a stick so you get paid for submitting data but you also you know you also could get your stake burned and so the idea is could you have could you have a decentralized data marketplace where anybody could upload data and stake it as a way to put skin in the game and to show that you really believe in the quality of that data and and if you did in a decentralized way then anyone could buy it so right now new Muraya doesn't do any crypto trading but what if someone had predictions on crypto they staked a whole bunch of predictions on Bitcoin and aetherium and then poly chain came to aresia and bought those predictions to trade in their crypto fund and there's no reason why we should limit that why it should just be a data marketplace for número so we started thinking about it as being a whole new protocol that anybody could build on and anybody can submit data to and anybody can buy data from so I think it'll be like it'll become like this place where all hedge funds buy some portion of their data and and get connected with amazing data sources of all of all kinds so it's definitely a whole new future for número because the numeraire token is the token that erasure is going to be it's its native token will be numeraire so something I didn't understand was in your medium post we announced erasure you wrote your hedge fund manager you get an email that says over the last two years I predicted Google's daily stock price with 70% accuracy and I'm willing to sell you my next prediction for $10,000 you calculate that this next prediction if it's right can make your fund an expected 1 million dollars in one month so first of all it's do people really send emails like that in a way yeah sometimes I'll get emails like that where it's like but it's a little bit more elaborate where it's like we have the special data other hedge funds buy it it works really well for them you should buy it as well it's very high quality if you integrated with your systems you'll make more money and we're like yeah but how do we know it's gonna really work and if it really works why are you even selling it to us and so there are all these questions when someone is pitching you to buy data you always have to have to be very doubtful right like why wouldn't they just use that data go trade or aren't you being or you're part of civil attack where they're only selling you the best one that they have and all the other ones that they that haven't worked they're not selling you so they have nothing at stake ok so that was the first thing I wanted to know and then the second thing is so in this marketplace is all the data labels because so número the way that it's been running so far is like people don't know what the data is but in this case people are saying this is what this data is yes exactly so what they're doing it's typically going to be used for prediction feeds so people are going to submit data that else you know it'll be like a CSV file and I'll say Bitcoin is going to go up with a fifty five percent probability aetherium is going to go up with a 0.49 probability and so everything will be formatted in that way almost like as a prediction but there's nothing to stop you from making a data feed of anything else as well but I think the main use case will be financial predictions okay and so what are all the different types of things that you can imagine people using a racer for well I think there are people who who are very good at making models but they're not really in a position to to trade them so you might you might be like a student at MIT or something and you have you've downloaded the block blockchain data and you've connected that data set with Twitter data and now you have like a sentiment a sentiment indicator that also uses blockchain data and actually can make really good predictions on on the theory am surprised and but the problem is you only have say five thousand dollars of savings and so you could get on coin base and trade that five thousand dollars up to five thousand five hundred but there's but it's sort of like not worth it so there the case for ratio is that there are a number of people in this position where they actually are very good at at making models for things that that are quite good but not good enough to want to start their own hedge fund and instead of of starting their own hedge fund the much wiser thing for them to do would be to sell the data the problem is if they come to us and say we want to sell you that data or they go to paly chain we want to say no one will no one will even respond to them but if they say instead of trading the five thousand dollars they have they put the five thousand dollars if by NMR they stake it on their predictions then suddenly I might buy those predictions because look the guy who's who's created them doesn't is is saying I don't mind if you burn the steak if it doesn't work out so you have much more yeah much more sense of like the fact that that these predictions are actually gonna work if you have someone staking on them and so what format does the prediction come in it's literally saying the price will hit this this number by this date or what yeah it's just this like a CSV file that says BTC null point five one and maybe some metadata on the fact that that's a weekly prediction or month like by January 1st or okay okay and then to go back to so just you keep referencing this example of like crypto prices but what are some other you know is it really crypto funds that you think will use this or crypto funds will definitely be early users we talked to some that are very interested but número I would be the other major user for for equities data and again like there are a number of ways you might you might think of making a model to predict the price of Netflix or the price of any US equity based on any data sets and if if you create an erasure feed out of your predictions new Mirai in particular will be one of the first funds to look at them and and consider buying them and so it's pretty much all financial markets data whether it's crypto markets or yeah equities it's definitely the focus and that's what numerous good at and our users are good at doing but I do think it will be more widely used than people think I think there's a lot of examples where you have this this position that a seller of information is in if you're trying to sell information the person's gonna be like what is the information before I buys things back well I don't I can't tell you because you won't buy it if I tell you and so instead if you stake it then then it's like you're giving some some evidence that some economic putting some economic risk to say that the informations good so a good example of this could be with journalism or with like whistleblowing or something be like I have this very valuable data something to do with some some kind of secret or something and you encrypt the data stick a big steak on it and only the buyer with the key can can look at what the data is Oh interesting wait and in that scenario so journalism it's extremely competitive is there something where like it's a one-time purchase like I buy it and no one else can get it or how does that work yeah most of the feeds on a ratio will be like exclusive so the only the buyer can look at can look at it but that'll also be extended so it could be it could be other other use cases as well I mean you also might not want to submit a prediction you might just want to create the price feed like what's the price of of ether and you could just create a you say hey I'm hosting a feed which is the price and if the price is ever wrong you're welcome to slash my steak and now you have maybe a more reliable price feed than you otherwise would have yeah and so okay so you're saying most of the data that sold well will only be sold at one buyer because because what I was when I read about it I thought to myself oh if we have a lot of hedge funds that are making trades based on certain predictions then one of those trades affect the price which would then keep the prediction from being as accurate as it would have otherwise yeah well you definitely if you are buying a prediction and then you subsequently trade in the direction of that prediction then you are going to move the price toward where that prediction is saying but but you're profiting all the way along so it's definitely good to have the edge where you're the only one who can see it right okay okay yeah and so who decides whether to sell only to one cuz why wouldn't somebody who's selling it just say I'm not gonna limit it to one in the case of for hedge funds in particular they're gonna prefer if it's exclusive so on a ratio both this isn't discussed as much in the white paper but both the buyer and the seller as a stake and this is yeah the the one thing that people don't understand is it's kind of like how block chains don't have internet connections so you can't say something like the stake will get destroyed if the predictions turn out badly it's like how do you know whether the predictions turned out badly where what data source are you going to check so everything on erasure is is discretionary so if you create a stake and I buy your prediction feed I get the right to slash your stake for whatever discretionary reason I want so if I'm unhappy for whatever reason maybe I did make money on the prediction but I didn't make enough or maybe there was some other piece of what I expect that I didn't get and giving the buyer the right to slash the stake for discretionary reasons actually gets around all of the problems of you know having validator nodes and decentralized Oracle's and all these things that don't really exist today and may never never quite quite work so having a discretionary relationship with with the buyer is much better well yeah so this is that concept griefing that you described like I don't understand why would somebody paid to destroy their own money like even even if it means that they can do this you know sort of revenge move against somebody else I don't get yeah well it's not really rational to do to do to do in a setting where you're not in a repeated game so if you if you've ever heard of the ultimatum game it's like this game where imagine I get $100 I have to decide how much to share with you and if maybe I'll say I only give you $10 and if you reject it then neither of us get any money so I'm like thinking I wonder how much I should give you okay maybe I'll give you 30 and I'll keep 70 just to make sure that you you know don't get angry but really rationally if I give you $1 you should accept because you get one more than zero but in practice when you have these games repeated people tend to grief people burn both people's money until it gets to a level that sort of somehow seems fair and it tends to to kind of converge on like 70/30 or something like that and so a ratio is a bit like that you're not just saying I'm upset I'm in a grief I'm gonna grief the person by destroying some of my tokens to destroy a lot more of theirs you're actually you're and then the game's over it's actually I'm gonna destroy a little bit now to make them notice that I'm watching them and I'm upset and that in the repeated game it'll tend to it'll tend to you know keep everything it keep everything in line another way to think about this is it's similar to like a lawsuits or something typically in a lawsuit if you don't kind of go to court you end up settling in some way or even you're just doing it to kind of scare the other party to know that you really want their compliance to the contract so it's some kind of like stick in the relationship so even say with Bloomberg like número buys data from Bloomberg - for some of our hedge fund operations we need Bloomberg now the one threat we always have with Bloomberg is if we're upset with the service we can just start paying for it the other threat is maybe we'll sue them if their service is really bad and it might cost us a lot to sue them upfront we might never settle for more than it cost us but it's the fact that that option is there it's not that that option gets used it the fact that that option is there keeps the alignment much nicer than it would would ordinarily be if there were no legal system and I see the griefing on a ratio as like the legal system it's like now many people are gonna do it but the fact that it's there it's like it's like a little bit of a incentive to do the right thing okay and so are these relationships between buyers and sellers do they extend over time because if you're saying it only works in a repeated game like if I buy data from you for one month but you know and I'm unhappy and then I grief you and then it's over like did you really learn a lesson or yeah well definitely definitely in the prediction setting it's definitely a repeated game you're not really gonna be buying one off one of things because for say a quantitative strategy if you have a if you build a model on the price of a visa you can keep running that model and keep generating a new prediction every single day so every single day you're gonna have this prediction and if you're engaged with a buyer and they decide to start trading that signal in their fund they're gonna want to keep getting that same signal because they're gonna build systems to that rely on that signal so you're always engaged in a kind of feed relationship and that's what's also interesting about erasure versus other decentralized data marketplaces because if you do have any situation where imagine I'm buying like a whole book from you the minute you give me the book I have it I'm not looking for the next page it's so I've got the completed book or if you give me a photo I have the photo there's something about feeds where all of the value is in the future I don't care about your predictions from last week I care about what you're predicting now so you always want to maintain the commercial relationship with the person you're buying from okay okay so now I think I have a better understanding so basically when I enter into a relationship with the seller it's like over some period of time and during that time I can grieve them multiple times within within that time period is that yes yes okay and you can choose any amount to grief and buy okay but but actually the griefing I I thought the amounts were sent by the seller the grieving factor is so it could be like one dollar could destroy ten dollars of of the seller but you could choose you know I have anyone a grief I'm gonna agree $400 to destroy a thousand of yours or much less all right so let's walk through the whole thing from end to end okay just so I fully understand so from the beginning both the buyer and the seller need to own numeraire in order to do this to do to it anything is that correct yes because both the stakes are in that okay and then and then what this seller posts something on the your marketplace what does that look like yeah so I'll explain the first kind of problem if you if you the first piece that the protocol solves is the idea that you can't trust someone's track record if I say oh yeah I've I've predicted the future perfectly over the last two years there's a sense which you just don't trust me so the first thing is if you're a seller of predictions you submit all of them to the blockchain so every time you make is submission of a prediction you submit it to the blockchain so you get a timestamp and it's timestamp that's completely reliable and that everybody will trust for the rest of time so at least when you start building a reputation of being good at predicting something everybody agrees that you are because everybody can go back and see that's what your track record is so that's the first very important point about a ratio all right and then keep walking through the steps okay and then imagine you see someone then they have got this totally verifiable track record of being good at predicting something and they've also put a stake on it so you know that they care enough to to at least do that and they're saying that they're gonna charge you 100 NMR per week to buy their feed so the buyer comes in and says okay I want to buy this feed what the buyer gets is a special right is everybody can see the historical prediction performance but no one can see the most recent prediction unless you're the buyer so the buyer comes in and says I like this guy's performance I like how much he's got at stake I like that he doesn't mind if I grief him this seems like a decent thing to buy sends the first payment for the first set of predictions gets a key can decrypt the most recent prediction so that only he can see you can see those and then from then on is kind of engaged with the seller to continuously buy every prediction that's subsequently submitted and with those predictions takes takes them to do whatever he wants with them including trade them in his own hedge fund okay and then every single day or at any given moment the purchaser can greif the yes okay and then it's based on the ratio that the seller sets yes and that's important to me the people say well what's how do you model this or like how do you know for sure that that the griefing factor is is right or that it's going to work and the important point is that people have freedom to choose whatever griefing factor they want you might create a fee to say I don't want anybody to greet this I just want to I don't want to do it that way but then you might not get as much buyers of your feet or as much interest so it'll be up to you to to decide that and I think market forces will will get the griefing factors to be to be something that seems sensible to to both the buyers and sellers yeah I imagine it will like converge on some sort of standardized yeah yeah exactly so if you've got a really good feed you probably stake a lot and allow a high griefing factor right right this is interesting and then like let's say that I enter in a relationship with a purchaser I'm I'm a seller and I've sent my griefing factor you know it I don't know like one to ten or whatever but then I realized like do you ever read like reviews and then you just sort of said like I notice sometimes you see a really scathing one-star review and then you click through and realize that that person gives only one-star reviews everywhere like so what if you're a seller and then you suddenly realize oh this person I'm in a relationship with or in this marketplace is like one of those types of people then can you change the yes yeah you're gonna be I think you should be able to to not engage with certain people maybe and I do think it's going to be quite nice to have your reputation follow you around so it's pretty clear that oh this person is grief those other people I better be careful where with with him and then the same for sellers if if they have some prediction feeds on crypto that are very good and now they've started a feed using the same aetherium address for global equities maybe you're gonna trust them a little bit more so there are a lot of these sort of software factors that will come into play where people will start to develop a kind of trust and maybe it'll be it'll certainly be known that this is New Marais who's buying your feet from you well this is to sigmah who's buying your feed from you so I don't think people will mind trusting that to sigmah isn't gonna be just totally malicious an aggressively griefing for no reason and you know right now people trust new mirai with a griefing factor of 0 to infinity because on número people are staking and we we can destroy the whole stakes without destroying anything of our own and there they're happy with that relationship so it's kind of like a matter of preference and over time the right people will get paid full price and the griefing factors will kind of stabilize and okay but also once I'm in the relationship can I change the griefing factor or is it set right at the beginning can I change all of these are kind of like parameters that it's the question of maybe on day one we don't we don't allow that but yeah everything will be I'm sure there'll be many more settings ice the way I see it is if you make it if you make a stake and you're and engage with a buyer they kind of have 30 days to grief you and that will be the first like setting okay yeah you probably don't know all the details yet um how does this differ from other prediction markets like auger yeah it's kind of interesting like erasure is a predictions market place and all gives like a prediction market and it's like how they related the thing about Olga is it's similar to markets so like if you had predictions on if you had some insight into into Apple and there was an apple market on augur you would buy the Apple market and and thereby have your private information kind of be expressed in the price of of that market on Olga so both of them in a way get information into the market but erasure is a little bit more direct for people who maybe have some information but it's they don't really want to trade on it themselves so they'd much prefer to sell the information let hedge-fund who's much more experienced at the other parts of trading to do with say risk neutralization or diversification and other things yeah like you can imagine having some very keen insight into say like Apple's Hardware knowing apples trends in hard way and you kind of want to sell that information directly and you don't want to if you just bought Apple Apple on augur you kind of exposing yourself to all kinds of market risks and things going wrong with the software things going wrong with the currency things going wrong in China and you're kind of like exposing yourself to all those risks but if you were just selling the information and the information was good then the hedge fund who bought that data would kind of be able to to manage those risks themselves that's what their that's what they're good at so I think in many cases you're gonna want to directly sell your information not trade it and what are the sorts of prices you're imagining this kind of data will sell for well what's good about it is that these historical track records of their razor feeds will all be publicly verifiable so I kind of like idea of a future where it's like say it's 2022 okay and there's one feed on an erasure which is predicting the S&P 500 and it's just got this incredible track record a sharp of three it makes thirty percent a year and two sigma comes to finds out about it razor comes to the website and sees that there's this feed that's just incredibly good if we wanted to Sigma could hate Bitcoin everyone they could all be skeptical about I cos they could all hate the blockchain but there is no way that they don't believe that the track record of that that prediction is real and that's what I really like about it it's like they'll have no choice but to start participating in the marketplace if over a period of a few years people actually submit really good predictions so is there a problem with people putting proprietary information on a racer like could somebody get in trouble for kind of like insider trading via the erasure marketplace yeah that's an similar you raise a similar concern with auger or or even any technology where you know part of the most used technology for insider trading is probably like text messaging or email or something so because this razor will be decentralized there's none of the data that's being put onto it will ever be on like numerous servers it'll be on ipfs and and aetherium so it could be used for for anything tend to think people will be using it much more for quantities where you're predicting on 5,000 stocks versus you know you're actually like you actually work for Apple and you've stolen some company secrets and you're selling them on a ratio well you did mention that thing about knowing what was it something about Apple's hardware so yeah yeah I mean that's a I think that is an example that could be legitimate but I think most likely people are going to be using it for quant predictions just because if you imagine you did submit predictions to erasure and you were right about one stock in particular it's actually hard to know if you're going to be good next time all the time after that but with quant what's pretty cool is you can make 5,000 simultaneous predictions and if you're right on 2,700 of them that's actually pretty good statistical evidence so in a shorter time period you can develop as good reputation and what's your sense of whether or not hedge funds will actually want to buy this data you mentioned some crypto funds is that pretty much it or like you know you keep talking about to sigma2 do you know if the more traditional my friends are interested they always they always kind of have to respond to to the new new things so in the past very skeptical on new kinds of alternative data sources like sentiment analysis data or or even skeptical about new tools like machine learning but once other hedge funds start doing it there's like a huge pressure for everybody to catch up so to start with numerous going to be a huge buyer of these feet and we're gonna be on the buy side of this marketplace giving our users time to develop their track records but at anytime another hedge fund could come in and outbid us and over time as it gets better there I think it'll be like the best place to buy to buy high-quality data because no one else is giving you the same kind of guarantees first that all of the historical predictions are accurate and and second that if anything goes wrong in the data is intact good you have something to do about it which is like destroy the guy's stake and so you have not talked to anyone other than said no we just announced erasure very recently and we've spoken to crypto funds who are interested but we haven't spoken to other hedge funds and frankly we prefer there to be a lot of crypto interest and allow us to be the major buyer for the equity stuff so I think that's how it will play out initially because you don't want the competition so how willing do you think hedge funds will be to transact in a cryptocurrency that was launched by a different hedge fund yeah it's kind of a strange proposition in a way it's like you can use this market place anybody can use it but it's sort of sort of need to use our cryptocurrency like how much numeraire do you guys hold well we can mint numeraire so we that's something that is a little bit problematic like right now numeraire the way it's used on our website it's very centralized it's like it's it's a token for número it's a token for our users and we can mint it and we the ones who can destroy it but as we shift to erasure being a protocol that uses numeraire you don't really want any central power over the system so numr I will have no special rights over any other hedge fund entering the marketplace except you can mention numerix yeah even that we're gonna have to we're gonna have to stop and so when a razor launches new mirai is not going to be able to have any special powers oh oh then who will be minting the numr we will have a finite supply like rep Oh okay okay yeah and knit so do you guys how will new mirai make money from erasure or will you not well we definitely will benefit from giving more use to our already well used utility token and more things for our users to do and then again it's a data marketplace we wish existed I wish all the data was time-stamped on aetherium so we didn't have to trust that Bloomberg's keeping the right time stamped on their data so I can definitely see it having really large benefits for us as a user and then it would be pretty cool to have the whole hedge fund industry basically using our protocol cool for you so I did see I mean you keep talking about the volume in numeraire um and I saw in the medium post announcing a ratio that you said that it was I think the most it had the more and more stakes and dollar volume and transactions in June than any other ERC 20 token but I was looking on DAP radar and right now it's like range in 97th and over the last seven days there's there's only been like 2,500 transactions with 11 users over the last 24 hours so why is it dropped so much yeah tell me about tap right off basically they don't calculate the numbers right because the way that people interact with numeraire is in a very unique way and so because we gave it away to our users all of the stakes they're making are coming from our website and they're very few people using like custom aetherium addresses to make the stakes so in what way of thinking about it there's very few stakes being made from Mehta mosque there are many stakes being made from numerous website itself so it's not on chain so it is on chain it's all coming from one address which is the address interest even though the stakes are coming from individual user and theorem accounts so if they calculated it correctly you'd be able to see this but the DAP radar on state of DAPs I think state of dap says we're number two the number two token for storage I was like I don't know what that means I don't know why we're in the storage category maybe it's a store of ow something but I think over time when erasure launches more of the interactions with numeraire will be with Mehta mosque and these numbers will start to be much more clear but right now you'll have to you have to be a little bit more sophisticated and actually look at the blockchain yourself to see to see all the usage of yeah so essentially when I said there's only 11 users over the last 24 hours one of them is like multiple data scientists you're on número yeah yeah like yeah they were just this lost like yesterday last week so they've been 750 stakes of and some of those of quite large stakes of NMR okay well wait but what I said was that Deb radar over lost somebody says there's been 2,500 transactions and you're saying 750 there thinks 2,500 in the last twenty in the last seven days maybe they're calculating it correctly or differently but I don't know yeah every time I check them it's like it's completely off okay because again it's coming from one address most the stakes Oh interesting okay apparently I guess on that radar it showed that in ephemeral you guys had 419 users but then now it's showing ten to fifteen so why was it a big number I really don't know I don't have no idea I think it's yeah they're they were having a couple of users who've like again a lot of those users could also just be traders like they could be people trading NMR on decentralized exchanges or something like that where it's coming from a special address but that weren't even that has nothing to do with staking which is the mate which is the actual use so try to discount anything that's to do with just the transfer function right taking is not on chain it is on chain but it's not represented on sites like that right off okay and same with 0x like you might see oh there's people using 0x but they're not really using the token and they're not using it except to transfer it to each other so there's a question about you know whether it's being used at all or so the price of numerator has fallen over time as we mentioned but even after a ratio was announced I noticed it's just it I mean it doubles but you know from a little over three dollars to about six and then now it's back down to like below four so how do you expect erasure will affect the price of numeraire I've never understood cryptocurrency evaluations there's so many strange distortions in the market there are certain projects that are doing very sketchy things like wash trading and trading against yourself so we don't really pay much attention to to the the price and I think that's the right thing to do and I think a lot of a lot of people it's strange how kind of well-known it is that there are certain projects that are that are like completely overvalued and just sort of continue to stay overvalued but connect this new universal acceptance that it was that it was a fraud and it took a very long time somehow for it to reflect in the price and then in the crypto community near universal acceptance that what Nomura is doing is really really cool and it's a premium project with top backers and it's really being used and the sort that has no impact on the price I don't know it's always hard to to know yeah well I agree and I also don't pay too much attention to price but just happen to notice and then I wanted to ask about this previous prediction market in trade it was I guess based in Ireland but eventually US customers were banned from using it and that led to its demise so is this legal in the US what what you're trying to do with it erasure yeah definitely selling data is legal and you know in the same way that numerous buying from multiple data providers and every hedge fund buys from multiple data providers and there's multiple centralized data market places like kondal where you can buy all sorts of different data so there's a lot of precedent for that and that's not a regulated industry but there's definitely there definitely other regulations to do with being an investment advisor and so one of the ways I kind of see kind of see it developing is you might have have people using erasure for in ways that are not legal just like you can have people use email or HTTP or anything for illegal means but then I think all the big hedge funds or all the big data buyers will not use things that aren't kind of like stamped in some way so that's sort of how I've been thinking about it lately like you might you might have some kind of concept in the distant future of like a verified seller where they really you know they're really honest people and they they're a real business and they maybe provide some proof or metadata that they that they're that they're actually Bloomberg and they should be trusted something like that but in the time being it's you know it's very early days and you previously said that your master plan is just too centralized at least parts of Newmar I what does that look like and how do you get there well definitely erasure is is a part of that plan we want to decentralize in a very like pragmatic way and have everything that we create be extremely non-speculative like it's it's kind of cool that I can explain the whole protocol to you in a podcast in this no no math or things that kind of kind of make it difficult or no speculative technology like a decentralized oracle that you have to rely on before it could even be created so with the Razr it's really something that none of the technology is speculative everything can be done today we've already done a private data which had hundreds of users so we've already got the smart contracts so I think it's going to almost like yeah it'll almost certainly work we know it's already working for New Marais but in terms of decentralization this again by by us first being ok let's let's make a kind of centralized thing with new moriah numeraire let's get our users to really use it let's give it to them and then let's really build to build a proof that this this can work and then ok maybe now let's throw away our key to be able to mint and let's let's take deep let's decentralize further with the hedge fund itself you know all of our trades or equities all of our trades are in a centralized hedge fund structure with you know real prime brokers like UBS and Goldman Sachs and you know there's no there's no way that that part of the business can be decentralized right now but everything to do with data and the modeling and I think it's going in that direction very nicely all right well this has been a great discussion where can people learn more about you new Mirai
