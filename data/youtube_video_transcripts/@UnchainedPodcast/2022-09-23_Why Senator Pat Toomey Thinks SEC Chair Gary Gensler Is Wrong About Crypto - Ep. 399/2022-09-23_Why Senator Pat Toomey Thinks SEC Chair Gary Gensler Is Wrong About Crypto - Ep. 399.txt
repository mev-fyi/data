you the biggest question regarding crypto regulation in the US has been for quite some time what it is that makes a crypto token a security I've heard you say that you disagree with SEC chair Gary Gensler when he says that he seems to believe that all tokens accept Bitcoin are securities and I've also reduced that you believe that existing regulations created in the 1930s and 40s don't fit with crypto so what regulatory regime do you think makes sense for crypto well there's a lot to unpack there Laura uh as you as you know very well um so first of all there are such important differences between all the crypto or most of the crypto tokens certainly those that I'm at least somewhat familiar with as compared to Conventional Securities most crypto tokens do not for instance have a direct claim on an issuer most do not have an explicit return built into them well stocks and bonds do have a direct claim on issuers they do tend to have a direct built-in integral return and then of course Very fundamentally all conventional Securities that I can think of are in fact issued by some entity and that is a centralization that is at the heart of Securities Law but crypto tokens are often issued in a decentralized fashion or at least they become decentralized so these are really in my view very very important distinctions between the crypto world and the conventional security World um it's not very helpful to Simply declare that they're all Securities I think that ignores these these important differences uh and even if you think that they are sufficiently like Securities that we ought to call them that it's I think impossible to deny that much of Securities Law and regulation couldn't possibly apply and and so for instance a simple example is is the all the regulatory regime developed around t plus two settlement for securities okay I get that for securities but what how does that apply to crypto which has like immediate real-time settlement so to speak are you supposed to pause it for two days I mean you know it it obviously doesn't make sense and so this is part of my ongoing argument with chairman Gensler first of all you should acknowledge that there are these very important structural differences and secondly even if you believe that despite the differences cryptos have to be considered Securities then you owe it to America to lay out for us how you would resolve the fact that existing Securities regulation clearly doesn't apply in many aspects in many circumstances and he won't do that he doesn't do he doesn't provide that so that's why I think we need legislation frankly with the legislation you know I guess you could you could say it's almost it gets to be semantics about whether it's a security or not what matters is it is different and it needs to be regulated differently and Congress ought to set up the uh the guidelines for how we go about that in the absence of congressional action and the absence of chairman Gensler going through a formal rulemaking process where we would be able to have a debate about exactly how this ought to work in the absence what we have is regulation by enforcement one day you wake up and find out the SEC is going after someone for something and okay so that's supposed to put everyone on notice but what if your thing is a little different than their right it's no way to regulate this really really exciting new and very different technology and that's why we need legislation so a previous SEC director Bill Hinman famously said that he felt ether was sufficiently decentralized to be considered a commodity and SEC commissioner Hester purse also has focused on a token being considered decentralized to not be considered a security you just pointed to the same line but that's not well defined to a lot of people and I think there are a lot of tokens that sort of straddle that so do you have certain kind of factors that you would be looking at or certain thresholds that you would consider you know to be definitive in terms of whether or not something's decentralized yeah so that's that's one of the questions that we've got to figure out right certainly centralization seems to me a necessary element in defining something as a security but it may not be sufficient it it could be one of several criteria We could decide to go down the road of deciding what constitutes sufficient decentralization that you can avoid being classified as a security we could go down that road or we might say that there are other elements of of crypto that is sufficiently different that we're simply going to treat it in a different way we'll have a separate regime for it and not have to go through an exercise of deciding when you have crossed the threshold into uh sufficient decentralization because I think it could be hard to do that I'm not saying it's impossible but but that could be tricky and that's part of why I'm kind of leaning towards a separate regime for crypto so I'm sure you're well aware that last week on the day that ethereum merged to a proof of stake chain chairman Gensler also said that he felt that proof of State coins could be considered Securities I wondered what you thought of that opinion yeah so yeah I uh I'd like to hear him explain how and why that is by the way I think you could construct transactions with crypto tokens that uh the transaction is is essentially a security right it's like uh like gold is a commodity obviously we all agree on that but if you enter into an arrangement with someone whereby they lend you gold and you pay them periodic payments in gold with a promise at the end to give them still more gold yeah that's a security it doesn't turn the gold into a security by the way but the transaction is so if that's what he's getting at then then he should say so and he should spell that out it's not obvious to me that a proof-of-stake mechanism by itself turns something into a security you referenced this earlier um but I'm sure you're well aware that a lot of people in the industry have been up in arms about what they consider to be the SEC trying to assert jurisdiction over the industry in a sort of sideline way through these enforcement actions some examples are the coin-based insider trading case where obviously this was just against the coinbase employee and his associates but through that the SEC said that nine of the tokens on coinbase were Securities and then recently in an enforcement action against YouTube personality Ian bellina the government said that since the preponderance of ethereum nodes were in the US therefore the SEC had jurisdiction over ethereum so I wondered what you thought the SEC was doing there if you agree with the industry that this is a sort of sideline way of asserting jurisdiction I I do think it's very problematic and this goes back to my earlier Point what I think is we are seeing an ongoing pattern of Regulation by enforcement they declare they're going to enforce something against someone they go and and have their proceeding and the rest of the world is supposed to infer from that what is acceptable and what is not acceptable well this is a very very badly flawed process for a lot of reasons one is it it essentially means regulation that is not subject to the ordinary vetting and public input process of the administrative procedures act there's a reason that we have a process for developing regulation we don't leave it to the enforcement arm of a particular regulator to devise this and then another problem is what I alluded to a moment ago even if you can see what the SEC has chosen to pursue for an enforcement action maybe your project is just a little bit different in ways that leave a complete uncertainty as to whether you are also likely to be subject to that SEC enforcement this is why Clarity and bright sunshine and a fair process that takes public input and allows us to develop a rational system that would be the right way if you can see that these are all Securities right which which this is what chairman Gensler and says Uh there's a there's an author who had a line and I'll have to paraphrase it but the gist of it is that Mr Gensler insists that he should be the one to write the rules and he refuses to write the rules this this is the problem that and I'm not sure he should be the one writing the rules but but at a minimum if he's going to insist this is all his jurisdiction I think he needs to provide a lot more clarity than he has all right so and I mean there's just so much we could talk about with the SEC but there's plenty of other moment we're going to turn to stable coins but first a quick word for the sponsors to make this show possible to swap crypto a user has to choose among

back to my conversation with Senator to me so the night before a recording Bloomberg reported that there is a draft bill in the house that would put a two-year ban on what the bill called endogenously collateralized stable coins or whether crypto Community might call algorithmic stable coins or perhaps even crypto collateralized stable coins what do you think of this potential bill well um I'm glad that there is a serious discussion underway with my my house colleagues and it's bipartisan and I'm I am very much hopeful that we would be able to reach an agreement on providing a framework for stable coin regulation because I think it's a very very exciting technology I think it does make sense to kind of segregate this piece of the crypto ecosystem and have a regulatory regime for stable coins so all of that I think is great we don't have an actual agreement yet right we haven't seen the press release from Maxine Waters and Patrick McHenry announcing their agreement on a piece of legislation so at this point it's still a work in progress there's a few things that are important to me and I would hope that any final agreement should there be one would reflect that I don't think it's necessary or appropriate to ban algorithmic stable coins for several reasons one is frankly if we have a sensible rational regulatory regime for asset-backed stable coins I think an awful lot of the world is going to naturally gravitate to that part of the market and and so what's the problem secondly algorithmic stable coins by their nature are not part of the conventional financing system they are by definition not backed by cash or Securities and so it's hard for me to see the threat to the overall Financial system to see a systemic threat that would justify certainly a Prohibition thirdly I would say how do we know this can't be done in a sensible fashion sure Tara and Luna that that was a debacle that collapse that was obviously flawed in its design but I don't know that it's impossible to come up with an algorithmic mechanism where there's a token that backs up another token and I would not want to preclude that possibility so I'm not a fan of any kind of prohibition I haven't I haven't studied the language in this idea this proposed I'm not sure there actually is a specific language so I'm not sure how broadly it sort of suspends the issuance of new algorithmic stable coins but as somebody who was always skeptical about the ability of Terror to hold its value when I learned the the design of of uh of the interaction I nevertheless think it's a bad idea for government to just prohibit it that doesn't seem right to me there's other things that are really important to me as well one is that we make sure that stable coin issuers have multiple possible paths to follow I'd be concerned for instance if the only path to being an issuer of a stable coin or to be regulated by the FED that might be a sensible that in fact I think it is sensible for that to be a path but not for it to be the only path and one of the reasons is let's be honest institutionally it's not clear to me that the FED is very enthusiastic about this this whole invention right uh I think the as an Institute I'm not referring to any particular individual but sort of institutionally and culturally the fed's probably not wildly enthusiastic about stablecoin so that that would be one factor the other factor is the Fed might very well at some point have a conflict of interest in the sense that they may decide to pursue a cbdc and if they do they might see stable coins as a competitor to their own product how are they gonna how are they gonna treat that so my Approach uh and you know we've released draft legislation that would uh would show how we could codify this would be to allow issuers who wish to to be regulated by and supervised by the FED but not to make that the only possible Arrangement earlier in your remarks and I don't know the exact wording that you used but you talked about how you felt that you know there shouldn't be a ban on experimentation with things like algorithmic stable coins however I'm sure you're well aware that the Terra Luna collapsed wiped out 60 billion dollars in value and there was sort of contagion that happened that really did affect a lot of everyday people you know you can read their Celsius or you know even yeah on different forums you know had their life savings wiped out different things like that and so when it comes to kind of consumer protection you know I imagine that people that want to regulate it that's the angle they are taking so what would you propose to sort of prevent that kind of experimentation from having those types of effects if anything yeah um I I really think that uh the sensible uh approach to take is is to require disclosure right make sure that people people are able to understand what they're getting themselves into I don't think it's the role of government to protect people from themselves to ban uh Investments That might be sensible Investments even if the government or a particular official doesn't like them I think we do too much of that already for instance the way we limit all kinds of investment opportunities in things like private equity and hedge funds and Venture Capital only to wealthy individuals because the assumption is if you're not wealthy you're not sophisticated you don't understand this and so you're going to be forbidden that's terrible idea in my view and and I don't want to impose that in the crypto space so I I'm I'd be perfectly open to a discussion about how do we make sure that people understand that if they're buying Terra it is not backed by cash and U.S treasury Securities it is backed by another crypto currency I think I think we want to make sure people are able to make an accurately informed judgment but I don't like the idea of forbidding them from doing what they want to do with their own money my guess is that the bill that was reported on by Bloomberg last night you know potentially proposing this ban might have kind of come out of the collapses of Terra but also the contagion of three arrows capitals Celsius and Voyager and I just wondered if you could talk generally about how these major collapses and events in crypto have affected the perception of crypto by lawmakers yeah it's a great question I will say I think one effect has been to heighten the awareness and the sense of urgency maybe overstating it a little bit but but to some degree an urgency for setting up a regulatory framework I think that's true among some of my colleagues in the Senate some in the house also some in the administration I think there's um probably fair to say that for some folks who are certainly aware of this space but not paying a whole lot of attention the collapse of a really a very large stable coin caught their attention and probably also a little bit of a sigh relief that it wasn't an asset back a stable coin because of the concerns of contagion so I think it it did catch people's attention uh there's look we've got a lot of colleagues who take a more a much more protective view of consumer protection than I do and this I think it's more paternalistic I think they would uh clearly like to ban in this whole category I just I've got colleagues on the Senate Bank committee who ban all things crypto I'm pretty sure it pretty much said so I think that's a really amazingly terrible idea but these uh failures uh has definitely underscored the vulnerability and given some impetus to uh getting something done now let's talk about the sanctions tornado cash I'm sure you're aware that this was the first time that the government has sanctioned a series of smart contracts rather than a person or an organization it's certainly in the crypto industry it caused you know just a lot of consternation a lot of unexpected consequences do you think that the government got this wrong yeah honestly this is something I'm still wrestling with because I think there's a real challenge here I think the the crypto Universe has uh an understandable concern if the government is deciding now that we can sanction code uh where does that end and what's the limiting principle here and that's you know that that feels a lot like an infringement on the First Amendment even right so so that's that's problematic that is worrisome I get that but it's also true that really bad actors like the North Koreans were probably using tornado cash as a way to launder money for breaking in and stealing crypto I think is is part of their business model especially from from Bridges among platforms and then going to tornado cash to kind of sterilize it so they could then you know find a way to keep their illegotten gains so there are real problems I'm not sure this was the right solution I I'm also a little concerned that it was ofac that did it but uh it's it this is a dilemma that we're going to have to work out together so now let's talk about the White House reports that came out on crypto um I mean they've been kind of trickling out but there were a few that came out last week there was one that suggested that the Federal Reserve continued to research Central Bank digital currencies and based on our discussion so stable coins I was curious for whether or not you thought the government should pursue a cbdc so I'm not reflexively totally opposed to any pursuit of a of a cbdc I'm skeptical though I do have certain sort of uh thresholds that are really important to me for instance I would strenuously oppose any pursuit of a central bank digital dollar that gave the fed or any central government entity the ability to surveil individual transactions right that that should be a complete non-starter that to me absolutely precludes Universal retail Accounts at the FED which many of my colleagues that's the most attractive thing to them about a digital dollar is everybody having an account at that I think that's a terrible idea I'd be completely opposed to that I also think that operationally I'm not sure the FED can pull this off right I mean it should be an either an open source code or at least something that developers can build on uh it's Gotta there's all kinds of big security concerns about something that that can withstand the continuous hacking attempts that would be there so I I don't know How likely it is that the FED can do this can get it right can do it in anything like a timely fashion and can do it without infringing on the privacy of the American people so if someone came along and convinced me there's a way to do all of those things and have a central bank digital dollar then I I'd be open to that conversation but here's the other thing if we've got a well-regulated well-functioning robust stablecoin industry with private issuers issuing stable coins at work then how much do we need at Central Bank digital currency okay so I mean I guess what I'm saying is I want the technology to be built into our currency I want the dollar to have the most sophisticated technological capabilities on the planet I want to be able to have Smart contracts running on our money but I'm not sure the FED has to do that and I know that stable coins can do that so I I guess I I'm not absolutely dug in opposed but I'm a skeptic yeah what you were saying reminds me of former cftc chair Chris Giancarlo uh his view that it's better to do something yeah more like public private Partnerships not a true cbdc but make it more competitive so you know circling back to this SEC question one kind of like side commentary on that is that the sec's actions here have led the US to be less competitive when it comes to crypto and that they're entrepreneurs who are leaving to go to other jurisdictions they're not offering their entrepreneurial efforts to American consumers between you know what you read in the White House reports on crypto last week and this idea that the US might be falling behind in this area after being a leader in technology for so many decades I was kind of curious whether or not you thought the White House reports sort of sort of show that we are now going ahead in the right direction or if it's maybe this continuation of perhaps entrepreneurship leaving the US yeah honestly I don't think these White House reports are terribly helpful for this underlying problem that we have I think what you've identified it's a very real problem I think there are I've spoken directly with a number of developers who are very concerned that the legal uncertainty under which they're operating is very unhealthy and that that there are people leaving the country and this ecosystem which should be thriving and growing here is migrating to other places that's terrible uh for the United States these White House papers they're pretty vague they were like studies I didn't see and and by the way to some degree I think in tone anyway they reflect at least the skepticism if not a hostility for this whole Space which I think is not terribly healthy so I'm not very impressed frankly uh with with that work I I think we if you need to move in a different direction okay last quick question there's been a number of bills proposing crypto legislation there's been dilemma's jailbrand bills Domino boozman I just wondered what you thought of the odds of something being passed and if so which Bill maybe had the highest likelihood yeah um I I still think there's a uh the the best chance of getting something passed is I think a stable coin bill I think that it is the simplest there are the fewest issues to have to wrestle with for a variety of reasons the stable coin legislation I think still has the best chance it is also true that there are significant negotiations actually underway in the stablecoin space I know the administration would actually like to get something done so I think the chances of something Broad and sweeping like the Jilla brand lummus Bill are is not likely that that'll get passed that's not to say it's not an important contribution to this whole discussion and to the momentum that we need but I think it's unlikely to get past my focus is to try to help get a stable coin Bill across the goal line if we got a good stable coin Bill and by that I mean sensibly regulated it allows for the Innovation allows for multiple competing models and allows them to thrive I think that would be extremely constructive for the whole ecosystem and it would demonstrate that we are capable of you know laying out these Frameworks and maybe next year we could do something that would uh that would go beyond that all right well Senator it has been such a pleasure having you thank you so much for coming

recap wintermute a crypto Market maker was hacked for 160 million dollars worth of crypto according to CEO and founder of getting guy boy the exploit was related to the firm's defy operations but the over-the-counter and C5 functions are safe guy voy assured that the company remained solvent with twice over that amount in equity left and said he is treating it as a white hat attack the wintermute team has contacted the hacker and offered 10 percent of the stolen funds as a bug bounty it also warned if the stolen funds are not returned by the deadline you will force us to remove our Bounty offer and white hat label we will then proceed accordingly with the appropriate authorities and avenues this is the seventh largest exploit in crypto the top of the list is still led by the Ronin attack followed by Paulie Network and wormhole the hack was related to a vanity address vulnerability which was recently discovered by the one-inch team in fact earlier this week someone drained over three million dollars from one of these addresses this is not the first mishap suffered by wintermute this year as it also lost 20 million op tokens worth 27 million dollars at that time due to a mistake tarun chitra managing partner at robot Ventures called the wintermute team incompetent on this week's show of The Chopping Block official video out Saturday in related news a hacker called Xerox Riptide identified a bug within arbitrum Nitro the latest upgrade to the ethereum layer 2. the flaw was related to the bridge between the ethereum mainnet and arbitrim and would have allowed anyone to replace the destination address with their own the white hat hacker was rewarded with 400 East or around five hundred thousand dollars dokwan not in Singapore but denies being on the Run the financial times reported that authorities in South Korea have asked Interpol to issue a red notice for dokwon four months after the collapse of the Terra blockchain a red notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition surrender or similar legal action South Korean investigators have been looking into the implosion of the Terra Network and analyzing whether Quan violated the country's capital markets law last week a court issued an arrest warrant for Quan but his whereabouts are still unknown after the police confirmed that he was not in Singapore authorities have decided to ask the worldwide enforcement Organization for some help however Juan tweeted I am not on the run or anything similar for any government agency that has shown interest to communicate we are in full cooperation and we don't have anything to hide last week the Ministry of Finance of South Korea stated its intent to void Quan's passport to force him to return to the country to date Interpol has not yet added Quan to the red notice list Giants battle over voyager's assets show exchanges FTX and binance are leading the auction for troubled crypto lender Voyager according to the Wall Street Journal Voyager is going through bankruptcy proceedings and is one of the many crypto firms that collapsed this winter the auction for its distrust assets started last week Finance has reportedly offered 50 million dollars a slightly better proposal than its competitor FTX at the company's Peak Voyager was worth 3.9 billion dollars since the bankruptcy it has lost more than 95 percent of its value Voyager had provided loans to bankrupt crypto fund three arrows capital and this exposure was the main catalyst for the collapse of the company in

video of celsius's Revival plan was leaked this week apparently the firm is considering issuing wrapped tokens to give back some customer funds coinflex a crypto exchange based on Singapore which halted its operations in June announced an official restructuring proposal that would give creditors the rights to 65 percent of the company meanwhile FTX is still showing strength during these tumultuous times the firm is reportedly raising up to 1 billion dollars at a valuation of 32 billion dollars according to CNBC FTX would use the funds for additional deal making coinbase reportedly had a trading business unit coinbase the largest cryptocurrency Exchange in the United States set up an internal crypto trading desk last year according to the Wall Street Journal also last year Executives of the company testified before Congress and stated that they were not running proprietary trading business however the Wall Street Journal says that the company hired senior Wall Street Traders to create a new business unit called coinbase Risk Solutions the report claims that the business unit was dissolved five months after its creation coinbase published a blog post stating that the report was inaccurate coinbase does not operate a proprietary trading business or act as a market maker The Exchange also said from time to time coinbase purchases cryptocurrency as principal including for our corporate Treasury and operational purposes but it doesn't view it as proprietary trading the weak post merge the highly awaited merge happened a little over a week ago but even though the upgrade went as smoothly as it could have the markets have seen quite a bit of volatility before the merge eth was trading at around sixteen hundred dollars however it took a downturn and it hit a low of 1 229 after the Federal Reserve announced a 75 basis points hike in the interest rate on Wednesday that caused a bloodbath in the crypto and stock market following the merge the
