so there's no question that the FTX situation this fall has changed the trajectory of regulation in 2023. I think the focus on crypto regulation is going to be higher than it's ever been before 2021 was the year of nfts while 2022 ushered in the crypto winter as well as the downfall of big companies in the industry well 2023 be the year of regulation in the crypto world at certain point governments were going to say hey guys we need to regulate this a little bit further regulations and safeguards you think need to be put in place this Bitcoin business which has basically been used and abused by the worst actors uh in in society as the conversation heats up what could be the outcome is this the Lehman moment for crypto so what more can be done to protect consumers the bankruptcy of Terra Celsius and especially FTX further complicated an already difficult year for the crypto ecosystem and set off all kinds of regulatory alarms what will be the role of government in preventing such disasters is mass adoption possible without State backing and regulation our governments around the world even prepared to regulate crypto and the most difficult question how could this all affect decentralization I think across the board whether it be Congress or policymakers or Regulatory Agencies I think there is a huge interest in preventing what happened with the FTX forever happening again particularly here in the United States however there are so many new policy makers that are now thinking about crypto policy for the first time that I actually think would happen with the FTX has the effect of slowing down new regulation and legislation as opposed to speeding it up prior to the collapse of FTX there was a very kind of small defined group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill that were interested in coming up with legislation that number of policy makers has expanded quite significantly and I think that given that we have all of these new voices that are participating they don't know a whole lot about a crypto it's going to take time to get them up to speed in order for consensus to be reached and new legislation and therefore regulation to be enacted in the United States the SEC is evaluating how to start regulating a market that chair Gary Gensler called a wild west so we have publicly been saying to these crypto intermediaries they might call themselves crypto lending they might call them crypto exchanges these crypto intermediaries in essence the casinos if I might say it again to come into compliance with the law the first big question is what will happen to the companies that left behind millions of victims in 2022 Kim Kardashian for promoting ethereum Max during the 2021 bull market but has come under criticism for missing the alleged fraud at FTX I think the focus on crypto regulation is going to be higher than it's ever been before but I think the the general course of that of the government's approach to regulating cryptos isn't going to change much given the fact that the FDX debacle was not a failure of crypto or the or the underlying technology so I think the you know the rest of the debate will remain the same it'll just be more urgent and Universal meanwhile in Europe the situation is not entirely clear legislators have been discussing the Mika law for more than two years and it will be challenging to implement implementation is a few months if not a couple of years away unfortunately but be it as it may this can in an event only be a first step The Proposal will be voted on in April and among other things it includes requiring stablecoin issuers to have enough funds to prevent a repeat of what happened with projects like Tara among other measures if approved the 27 states of the European Union will have a unified law on crypto I think we're going to see a lot of activity move not only to the other two branches of government the Judiciary and the executive branch but also to the states so we're expecting to see a lot of activity at the state level while we have potential Federal gridlock at end Congress it's clear that the lawmakers and Regulators won't look kindly on more failures and collapses similar to what the crypto industry experienced in 2022 it's a new and rapidly developing sector and governments around the world are closely watching the question remains what will crypto regulation look like in 2023 share your thoughts in the comments [Music]
