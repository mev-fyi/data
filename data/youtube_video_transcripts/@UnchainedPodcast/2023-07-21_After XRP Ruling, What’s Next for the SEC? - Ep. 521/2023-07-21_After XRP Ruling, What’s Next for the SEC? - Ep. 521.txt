director of global regulatory matters at consensus welcome bill thanks for having me we're going to talk about some recent regulatory developments that are important to crypto but let's start with one that continues to reverberate in the crypto world and be discussed which is the xrp ruling and I've already done a few shows about this but one aspect that we really haven't touched on which you dissected in a long tweet is that the SEC has you know a few different options of what it could do here and you kind of talk through you know which strategy it might choose or you know how the different strategies look so walk us through that you know How likely is it to appeal or not so I think it's very likely that they'll appeal they're probably looking at this decision and thinking it's flawed in certain ways that led the court to Grant Ripple summary judgment motion with respect to the programmatic sales and the other distributions the real question is and and they're running that analysis now right when chairman Gensler is saying oh we're continuing to assess the opinion I mean they've clearly read it and they read it immediately when it came out what they're trying to do is see how basically assessing the judge's reasoning looking at the case law she cited in considering her conclusions in that regard and then looking and trying to guess what the second circuit would do with this case I expect that they're going to come to the conclusion that the important parts of the case where the judge said programmatic sales were not a Securities transaction other distributions were not a Securities transaction they'll just say she got it wrong and so we should appeal then the question is when as other guests have told you on previous uh shows they don't have the right to appeal now because the case isn't final what they'd have to do if they wanted to appeal now is basically very soon either by the end of this week or early next week because I think they have to do it within 10 days they have to tell the district court your honor we'd like to appeal your summary judgment decision and we're going to ask you for permission to do that and then they have to essentially present an argument to the judge why she should allow the case to basically be put on hold while uh they go to the second circuit and ask the second circuit to review her decision there's going to be some briefing papers on that they may even argue it in court all the while on a parallel track you know the judge and her and the Magistrate Judge assigned to the case are going to be preparing for trial and doing all the administrative and evidentiary things that are attended to that but let's say the judge says okay it is important enough an issue it would be efficient more efficient to decide this issue now at the second circuit rather than waiting to the end of the case and uh I think you sort of see the judge anticipating this issue by saying are the parties going to settle now that my summary judgment ruling is out because a lot of parties when summary judgment's over like they don't want to go to trial on some side collateral issue basically the case has been decided and so rather than the labor things they just settle the rest of the case out and then they tell the judge they're settled the judge writes a final order and then you can go to the second circuit if you want to about the summer judgment motion assuming they can't settle and assuming the judge says yes it's important enough I'll let you appeal that they will then have to go to the second circuit so just clarify for listeners what parts still remain that they either could settle on or would go to trial on yeah so summary judgment is a part of the whole pre-trial process where you're trying to narrow issues to reduce them down to really only questions of fact that go on to a trial because the trial is all about determining what the facts are in summary summary judgment motion basically or both sides saying these are the established facts and all these facts are material to the claims and there's no disagreement as the facts the judge can just apply the law and in the case here the judge said there's a question of fact as to what the executives at Ripple what was in their heads when these institutional sales were going along and so because the parties don't agree as to what the fact is there whether they intended to do these whether they knew about these sales we got to send that to a trial where you're either trying to present evidence to a judge and convince a judge or a jury about these things so that is the loan issue whether the executives knew or intended the institutional sales and thus aided and embedded them in some fashion okay so what do you think is the likelihood that judge Torres would approve the appeal and what is the likelihood you think the second circuit would accept one it's very hard to say very hard to say I could see it going either way honestly I I think if I was a betting person I'd expected her to certify the case for appeal and then if it goes to the second circuit again very hard to handicap what they think about it it's a pretty important issue the SEC would feel very strongly about them taking it maybe that persuades them to take it but at the second circuit level you know you have to ask permission and once you get permission that's when the substantive briefing comes in so this could take a very long time your conclusion was that the SEC would probably not like the odds it would have if this were to go to the Supreme Court yeah so if you're saying that they probably will appeal it sounds like they probably only wanted to go you know just a certain distance but not all the way to the Supreme Court so what do you kind of think would be the most expected choices they would make so as everyone knows or should know Supreme Court gets to choose its own cases just because the case is really important doesn't mean the Supreme Court is going to take it up generally when there's a single case that's really important it's important because it involves some fundamental question about you know the scope or the meaning of the Constitution if it's just a question of like how to interpret federal law they generally only take them when a number of these appellate courts around the country all reach different conclusions on basically the same issue so if this goes to the second circuit and the second circuit comes down one way or another really the only way that the Supreme Court would want to take this case without there being other appellate courts around the country reaching a different conclusion as if it raised basically a fundamental question about the scope of the authority of the SEC and it does raise that so look if it gets to the second circuit and the SEC loses I don't think that they would appeal maybe that's wrong if they get to the second circuit and ripple loses they're certainly at filing a Circ petition basically asking the Supreme Court to take their case and what they would basically say is along the lines of all the cases that you've issued in recent history and actually over for the course of you know a couple decades now that says administrative agencies have to follow the instructions that Congress gave them and can't play jazz to their hearts content with the authorities they've been granted either to redefine their the scope of their Authority in an established field or redefine it for purposes of taking on a new field like this is that case that you've been deciding again and again but decided in this context with respect to the the sec's authorities under the Securities laws would that be something that the Supreme Court is interested in taking up there's certainly a chance that it would or the Supreme Court could say it's not big enough issue yet let's see what some other circuits say on this issue and then we'll take it up but it's a big risk the SEC runs by taking it to the second circuit on their own accord because ultimately the crypto ecosystem you know and ripple included views this these issues ultimately being decided by the Supreme Court at some juncture barring the legislature actually changing the game completely and then why is it that you were concluding that the SEC probably wouldn't like its chances at the Supreme Court what is it about this the Supreme Court that you feel would be unfriendly to the SEC they have been taking a much more conservative and discipline small C conservative and disciplined view as to the authority of administrative agencies to view their originating statutes and then Define for itself what the its job jar is what are the areas of the economy that we are able to regulate and you know how can we regulate those areas in a recent case involving the EPA the court said EPA what you were trying to do Congress never gave you authority to do and it's not your place to take that Authority on for yourself that's effectively what it said now that similar issue has been a refrain in the crypto Community about the role of the SEC in regulating digital assets there are certainly digital assets which are explicitly Securities and there are certainly digital assets that might be based on how they're issued what they do but to just broad brush everything in this space with the exception of Bitcoin and maybe some other proof of work tokens everything either is a security token or a Securities transaction that envisions an overly expansive view of your own authority to regulate this new area that Congress never gave you and certainly couldn't have contemplated back in the 1930s when these laws were originally enacted the sec's counter to that is like those laws were incredibly Broad and we're given the authority to interpret them in ways so that mitigate investor risks and Market risks in ways where we don't constantly have to go back to Congress to ask for for new Authority in a new area it's you know you've heard the chairman say this it's very flexible we're given a lot of discretion and we've determined all of this fits within our box forgetting the fact in 2021 he said you know we don't really have enough Authority here and you guys need to act you Congress need to act memory holding those statements and never recognizing again their position now is we have the interpretive Authority everything's in the box and crypto's like nope this is too broad of you are too broad in your interpretation of your own authority and so you look at the Supreme Court and how it's been reigning in administrative State overreach and Caprice generally and you look and you see that this is like the next logical progression of that line of jurisprudence all right so in a moment we're going to look at some new bills that could definitely impact crypto and attempt to address some National Security issues with them but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this

those of you who are interested in the horse race issues here there's two Democrats and two Republicans they proposed a bill called the crypto asset National Security enhancement Act of 2023 and it attempts to address National Security issues in D5 at the same time there's a similar bill in the Senate that's been proposed by Senators Elizabeth Warren Roger Marshall Cynthia lemus and Carson gillibrin again two Republicans and two Democrats and theirs would be a crypto focused amendment to National Security legislation breakdown for us what these two bills attempt to do and what problems they're trying to address all right so starting with read in rounds and Warner and Romney this bill is about trying to solve the problems that at least three of those Senators hear about apparently frequently in their closed-door classified briefings as members of the Senate select committee on intelligence Senator Reid is also the chairman of the armed services committee so they just happen to be on the Senate Banking Committee too which is chaired by Sherrod Brown in which you know is is the committee in the Senate which crypto pays attention to mostly with you know second place going to the agriculture committee that oversees the cftc but Senate armed services send select committee on intelligence are very focused on obviously National Security issues they are told from some reports frequently that groups like The Lazarus group are leveraging defy drug cartels potentially terrorists are using D5 or could use D5 to enrich themselves through cyber warfare cyber theft they could use it for money laundering to whether whether that's money that they've stolen online and they're now absconding with it or they're just using it to separate how they stole the money from how they're actually going to get it into their hands and they don't from the reports out about Senator Reid and these other Senators they don't really see uh defy as having any sort of meaningful purpose at the moment they just know that it's a way to trade pseudo-anonymously or anonymously one token for another and that there's no permission structure there there's no supervision there of the activity other than just being able to watch it on the blockchain and they think that this is a big problem and what they want to do is essentially make somebody accountable for these trading protocols basically like a uniswap or other sort of decks or amm that's sort of clearly at the core of their build somebody needs to be responsible for them and in charge of ensuring people aren't violating U.S sanctions provisions when using them and that people aren't using them for money laundering purposes so that's that bill the lamas gillibran Warren Marshall Bill is different it requires the SEC Treasury and the fincen office and Treasury and the cftc to create a process where they can assess how well entities regulated by those entities Money Services businesses broker dealers Etc are ensuring AML have an AML compliance program designed for crypto assets so that's let's better regulate existing regulated entities as they move into crypto assets or as they're exposed to crypto assets that's the lemus gildebrand Warren Marshall Bill amendment I should say and then the reads rounds bill has to do with directly regulating and bringing defy into a regulatory Perimeter at least in the United States in a tweet that you had about the Senate Amendment you said it wasn't all that unreasonable but I am noticing a lot more concern about the house bill so this it definitely looks like it could impact D5 protocols in a big way across multiple different groups uh developers Governor token holders users so so can you break down for us you know how you think it might impact all the different groups yeah well the posture of these two bills are very different the lummus gillibran Warren Marshall Bill is currently proposed as an amendment to a must pass legislation that is basically before Congress right now it's basically a bill which gives the military the money they need for 2024 to be the U.S military that's getting passed and every year there's hundreds of amendments that are added to that and then the people in charge of the military Bill military Appropriations Bill have to decide what's Adam what's not there's really no indication that the Warren the lumus uh the first bill the the military appropriation related bill is going to actually be tacked to that legislation and even if it was and it went into law the implications of that law would not come into effect for two years because that's how long these different agencies have to come up with these new you know supervisory functions for them the read rounds bill in the Senate it has been made clear by their staff that this is not something that they seek to attach to this year's military Appropriations bill which they very much could do because Senator Reid is the chairman of the Senate are armed services committee they're not going to do that they want this to be and express this they want this to be the start of a conversation about how to address this problem and really expect movement on it next year at some point maybe attaching it to the same legislation next year because these are our yearly Appropriations bills what they made clear is that if the community comes to them and says what you should do is absolutely nothing that that's not going to be that's not going to fly with them they're not going to find that persuasive at all so I think what you're dealing with here is a bill that basically says if you're an interface and you allow people to interact with these protocols and you're us-based the bill likely requires you to then at least with respect to your users monitor their use of it and you'll probably need to kyc them and do suspicious activity reporting there is a question as to whether one of these interfaces would be responsible for basically all activity on the decks which seems facially impossible for them to be because anybody can interact with it but but if that is the case then it's a de facto ban on any us-based interface from being able to allow its users of that interface to connect with a protocol uh it would have serious impacts on investment in these protocols uh I saw some commentary about how this really impacts VCS who want to inject Capital to support the development of these protocols perhaps the early days of these protocols by investing in tokens trying to create a little natural little economy around the protocol if it's above a certain threshold which is not a very high threshold it's 25 million dollars 25 million dollars and your I love this part your governance token will be the value of it will be assessed according to evaluation methodologies set forth by the SEC which I thought was special so so the point is backing this would be very difficult and the Curious thing about all this of course is this only would restrict U.S persons doing the backing or the facilitating role and so if you weren't us if you weren't a citizen if you weren't located in the United States you basically were in another part of the world and didn't have very strong connections with the United States at all this law has no authority over you whatsoever you can create an interface and you can back a protocol it's all it really would mean is that there would be a substantial reduction if not outright elimination of the involvement of United States entities and people with defy and that's the real rub of it but what you mean is you mean the entrepreneurs it's different because like so for instance what we've seen with you know binance or bitmex or whatever the SEC will say we have jurisdiction because you have users that are U.S persons but you're saying in this case would only apply to the builders Or the critical backers such as the VCS so meaning it would just open up defined to be the entrepreneurial fruits of D5 AI to go to just anybody on the planet who's not American essentially basically yeah and but they could serve U.S persons and it would be fine yes as long as so this is the first draft and this is supposed to be a discussion draft there's plenty of things in here which they probably don't realize this says alternatively they're probably gaps which they didn't realize were included in this language like for one instance I was just literally before we got on to talk to each other I was on with a number of other lawyers and my question was did they intend for there to be like a de minimis exception here that for there to be the possibility that a protocol a decks could be so diffusely backed and not specifically linked to by any one facilitator interface whereas it doesn't fall within this supervisory regime so there's a type of if you get to like sufficiently decentralized and this wouldn't apply does anyone have a sense that that's what they're trying to accomplish and people didn't have that sense and in fact if you pointed that out they'd probably be like well okay that's a gap and we're gonna like we're not we want all of these things regulated not just the ones that are sufficiently centralized so there's going to be a lot here that needs to be worked out over the coming months yeah and I also get kind of like ukidao vibes from this where you know this issue about if you're a governance token holder I think I can't remember the language but it was saying that you controlled the protocol and so it just gets like really tricky the concept of control in this is loose there is you know you can change the code you have administrative privileges there's some like a a very broad catch-all at the end of it and so the concept of like who these people are who actually have regulatory obligations and Regulatory risk here will under the current language remain very vague unless they agree to strengthen tighten that language make it more specific but they very often when writing these laws don't want to do that because what they're concerned about is writing it narrowly is to create a big gap on the side where the market doesn't end around the legislation so the community has many very smart very hard working lawyers and lobbyists who like their job is to look at legislation like this figure out how it's not workable where it's problematic how it could be improved and the sponsors of this bill have expressed and and really this bill is in the hands of Senator Reid like he really he and his staff really have the pen here like they're open to having like productive conversations but from what I understand they've made it clear just saying how this is bad and shouldn't go forward and with it with the alternative being do nothing that's a non-starter with them so this is a serious list of sponsors this is not some other bills this gets Senators attention and members of house like the members of uh the House of Representatives their attention when individuals on the Senate Select Committee for intelligence and armed services and um Senate banking all agree that something needs to be done and are pushing it so this is a different animal but we have time to engage with their staff to try to steer it in the right direction make it as productive and as possible and when you say that for the infrastructure Bill what was that two or three years ago I'm now blinking on the year you know so many people called and wrote letters to their Congress people so you know would you Advocate that kind of thing or or sort of yeah what would be the ways for the community to engage right now I think what the community should really focus on right now are the Bills in front of the house pertaining to stable coins and Market structure these are the bills that both the house finance committee and the house agriculture committee McHenry Thompson Bill McHenry Thompson and then the McHenry Waters stable coin bill these bills are going to be marked up by the end of the month they are Forefront on the docket this bill the senator uh read and rounds Bill we have a much longer timeline I think it's worth keeping an eye on it but there's nothing sort of imminent about this if we're gonna if if folks in the ecosystem want to reach out to the their member of Congress or to their Senator to say anything about crypto policy they should be focusing their members attention on the stablecoin bill and the market structure bill I will say and that will be a very important because if I was a betting man I'd bet the SEC is going to sue someone else right before those bills are marked up why is that what you're betting on uh because that's what they've done in every other instance when the Congress has take had a meaningful opportunity to discuss a change in crypto policy away from the SEC basically determining the place of of crypto in the broader economy and wait so what is the strategy it's just like oh you're about to take power away from us so we're going to assert our power or uh part of it is political messaging to take all the attention of the media away from what they're doing on Capitol Hill and focus it on what the SEC is doing to and it's also to demonstrate to people on Capitol Hill that they don't need to look further into the crypto problem because the SEC is taking care of it that's essentially it but if you look there was a great graphic that someone tweeted out showing every single major event on the schedule in Congress particularly at a house financial services this year and when the SEC has dropped major news about crypto and it's in the preceding one or two days if not the Friday before something happening on a Monday it's uncanny and people on Capitol Hill notes precisely what's happening it's not like it's going to change what the Bill's sponsors are doing but the the idea is that it is it signals to people on the fence or who are skeptical or who just simply don't care that this isn't really worth your time it's not worth supporting so don't be surprised if before the 26th 27th of this month when they may be marking up these bills which is a step prior to introducing them to the broader Congress that the SEC reminds everybody that notwithstanding the Ripple decision they have a plan and they're going to move forward with it which is again something going back to the Ripple I think it's probable that the SEC if anything will double down on enforcement as their strategy rather than look at the Ripple decision and have any sort of introspection or change the plan whatsoever well hearing all this makes me so glad that I'm not a political reporter but anyway this has been such a fascinating conversation thank you just so much for all your insights on all of these well on the case and then on both uh proposed bills my pleasure it's nice to be with you don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around for this week in crypto after this short break

description thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap Capital crypto lawmakers and presidential hopefuls weigh in this week apart from the new D5 Bill we just discussed the US political landscape buzzed with crypto related discussions during an event at the Atlantic Council senior house Republican french hill and Democrat Jim Himes both members of the financial services committee emphasized the need for comprehensive stablecoin legislation hinting at a potential bipartisan agreement Hill stated quote we do want to facilitate a state pathway but we don't want any race to the bottom suggesting that stable coins could fall under Federal Reserve review during the episode Bill Hughes clearly said that the crypto Community should focus on the stablecoin bill as well as the market structure one meanwhile presidential candidates have been vocal about their crypto stances Democratic hopeful Robert F Kennedy Jr proposed exempting Bitcoin from capital gains tax and backing the dollar with hard assets like gold silver platinum and Bitcoin on the other hand Republican candidate and current Florida Governor Ron DeSantis pledged that if he is elected he would ban Central Bank digital currencies citing concerns over quote government-sanctioned surveillance SEC and ripple Clash Guns are disappointed Ripple CEO optimistic SEC chair Gary Gensler said he was quote disappointed over the recent Court ruling that declared that sales of xrp on public exchanges were not Securities transactions but that institutional sales in which the buyer and ripple Labs had established a legal relationship were Securities transactions Gensler speaking at a national Press Club event emphasized that sec's commitment to Bringing non-compliant firms into compliance and protecting investors meanwhile Ripple CEO Brad garlinghouse expressed optimism stating that the ruling clarified xrp's status and that an SEC appeal would further solidify the judge's decision the ruling has sparked debate in Washington with some U.S lawmakers advocating for clearer congressional oversight of crypto the full court process over xrp could take years according to recent Unchained guest Lewis Cohen SEC clock ticks for spot Bitcoin ETFs six applications under review on Tuesday and Wednesday the SEC began the formal review process for six spot Bitcoin ETF applications including those from industry Giants BlackRock and bitwise the review process which officially starts when applications are published in the Federal Register sets an initial deadline of 45 days extendable to 240 days the sec's acceptance of these applications marks a significant step in the agency's decision-making process however there's no guarantee of approval as the SEC has previously rejected numerous spot Bitcoin ETF applications citing investor protection and anti-fraud standards despite this the involvement of BlackRock has sparked optimism among crypto investors an SEC approval of these applications could open the floodgates for institutional investments in Bitcoin marking the end of a long wait by crypto investors binance lays off 1 000 employees Wall Street Journal binance the world's largest
