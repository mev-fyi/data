a platform that will assess fairness for its ai models the first of its kind initiative will advance fairness measurement in ai models which will positively impact the lives of individuals and benefit society as a whole today's guest is lane haber co-founder of connext network welcome lane hi great to be here last monday hackers stole almost 200 million dollars from nomad a cross-chain bridge before we get into the details can you start just by explaining what nomad is yeah sure so nomad is an optimistic messaging system um that me basically means uh they send messages between two different domains or chains and the way that they do that in a trust minimized way is by using the same optimistic fraud proofs that are common in arbitrary and optimism and all the other optimistic roll-ups uh what that means is messages are passed from one domain to the other and then there's a 30-minute delay where watchers or anybody in the system can submit a fraud proof and an updater who is responsible for propagating the roots gets slashed okay so explain how this hack occurred what was the vulnerability that was exploited yeah so the nomad protocol at its base layer is just this message passing protocol and it allows you to build cross chain applications on top so one of the applications that they built as a flagship application is a token bridge the token bridge had a bug in it where it would process messages that weren't proven in this route so they hadn't gone through the optimistic fraud window and that allowed you know any arbitrary message to be processed by this contract as if it were certified and verified and so attackers were able to put in messages that said i've withdrawn funds to mainnet and please let me take those and unlock those from the contracts and they were able to drain the funds that existed in the bridge router and that was even if they hadn't actually done that they were just able to it was like kind of pretending like you were owed this money but instead you're just literally stealing exactly yeah exactly like that yeah and how much tvl was in nomad at the time so i believe that the total tvl was around 190 million which is also the amount that was drained from the contracts wow yeah okay wow so pretty much a mass looting as it was described people were also calling it a free-for-all why were they using that term yeah so this hack was actually really interesting uh in the sen in in terms of who was able to participate like most hacks that you see of smart contracts you know they generally have a very sophisticated attacker who's able to drain the contracts really quickly but it's just one maybe two people and what was unique about the nomad hack is that while that the vulnerability could have been exploited in that way it wasn't and so people were able to instead of draining all the money at once they were draining it a little bit at a time and there were a large number of bots and white hats and opportunists just the whole gamut of people watching etherscan who copy pasted the you know transaction data and were able to take some of the funds so i think there were you know over 50 addresses that participated in this and some people just running mev bots who didn't know that they were participating in a hack that were able to withdraw withdraw some of the funds from the contract so in that sense it was really unique in in how it was exploited and yeah people have called it a looting yeah i saw people saying it was the first mass looting of a cross-chain bridge and i also heard people who thought that it was the first mass looting in crypto ever but i should say if you followed what happened during the dao back in 2016 it was the same mechanism you can read about it in my book where essentially once people figured out what the vulnerability was in the dao then anyone who could copy that attack was doing so and so there were multiple instances where there were a number of copycat attackers who were um also stealing funds from the dow so i wouldn't say this was the first mass leading in crypto but definitely of a bridge yeah definitely so how did this vulnerability get introduced to nomad's code yeah so um they had submitted this code for audit with quant stamp i'm not sure about the details of when it was audited by kwan stamp and when it was submitted by nomad all i know is that in the i know that that's debated between nomad and quant stamp nomad put in their rca their root cause analysis that this commit hash was included in the audit but i know that quant stamp has said that those changes were introduced in a commit that was not included in the audit so that bit is a little bit unclear but you know audits don't necessarily always catch everything so it's always good when you're developing these systems to put in other safeguards like you know making it possible or what have you okay so basically um nomad is blaming the auditor for like making a fix that introduced this vulnerability and kwan stamp is saying this was introduced after the audit oh i i don't think that they're blaming the auditor for not catching this but yeah i think that just whether or not the specific commit that was that introduced the vulnerability was included in the audit is the main point of debate oh oh i see whether or not they caught it right yeah oh okay okay so afterward nomad asked hackers to return the funds what was the offer that they made and then how did the hackers respond yeah so the offer that they made and this is still ongoing is that if you return up to 90 of the funds you can get up to 10 of uh the total value back as a bounty they launched wallet to accept the funds and collaborate collaboration with anchorage so that's kind of where you can go to find more about that how hackers have responded i think that there's been a lot of positive response they've already gotten about 35 million back from white hats and various hackers and why do you think that law enforcement is getting involved here where normally they wouldn't i mean i don't want to speculate too much but i would imagine that it has to do with the nature of how many different people participated and also because the the hack itself was so frenzied like you could just see all of these people sending in transactions to withdraw funds i think a lot of people may not have used the best opsec in preparation for this hack or for taking some of the funds out so they could have used doxxed wallets or things that it while it said it interact with exchanges so i think that also makes a little bit more appealing to law enforcement oh because of the time pressure right but if they didn't write if they didn't get to the funds before other people then there wouldn't be any left to steal right yeah i i doubt all 50 people woke up today thinking oh i'm going to participate in a hack and exploit this vulnerability i think it was a little bit more chaotic than that and then for the hackers that have returned some of the funds do you know what number of those 50 accounts have done so uh no that i don't know i don't know the percentage of tracked accounts that have actually returned funds okay all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about this law enforcement issue but first a quick word from our sponsors join over 10 million people using

as you mentioned nomed said it was working with trm labs which is one of the blockchain analytics companies along with law enforcement to track down the hackers so is your sense that this is something that we'll see more often in the kind of d5 hackspace or do you feel that this is truly just a one-off as you described it i'm not so sure it'll be a one-off i think you're seeing a lot more regulation and involvement from governments kind of at all levels in the crypto space and i think that's a trend that you'll see continue i think that because there's so many more people who participated in this one with perhaps not the best opsec a good opportunity for law enforcement to kind of stake their ground and and set precedent so that could be a reason why they're more willing to get involved but i do think that the trend of government getting more and more involved in crypto will continue across all levels of government but are there other kind of features of different types of blockchain smart contracts or d5 smart contracts that would make it harder for law enforcement to get involved in hacks of other types of protocols yeah i mean i think we see a lot of privacy tech kind of emerging now and i think that as those systems grow and mature they will become more difficult for law enforcement to get involved with just because of the nature of the systems i think with d5 as it stands there's you know a lot of space for law enforcement to get involved but it's not necessarily the easiest and i think it will continue to get more difficult oh interesting because we'll see more privacy exactly so in general as i'm sure you're well aware there's been quite a number of hacks of cross chain bridges in general why do you think we see so many of those uh yeah that's a really good question i think that it's very difficult to build interoperability tech and while that is true i think you've seen very few cases where the core model of the bridge itself is what comes under attack including nomad right like this is not an indictment of the security model of optimistic verification this is an indictment of like smart contract the diff the difficulties of like producing secure smart contracts and secure code i think that only the axi infinity one was truly an indictment of smart con or like the security model of the system but poly network was a giant hack that was also an implementation issue same with wormhole these implementation issues keep coming up because you have to deal with a lot of different execution models like if you're building a bridge that should connect to multiple chains then there's very you have to use the right kind of abstractions and just holding all of that in your head at the same time can embed itself in complexity in the system which makes it more difficult to build which makes it easier to hack so in in a way what you're saying is it's more like human error that's being introduced would you expect then that over time once these systems kind of have been around for a while and that people sort of understand what the various pitfalls could be that then we'll see less of them or is it just that the tech will continue to you know be pushing the cutting edge and so therefore we'll always see a kind of a certain area of the tech that is more prone to vulnerable vulnerabilities and hacks i think we'll see the implementations get stronger and stronger but i do think that as the implementation gets stronger there will still be a risk associated with bridging between different domains like for example if i'm going from mainnet to evmos and there's a huge consensus failure on evmos how exactly should the bridge handle that on the main net side so those types of things will come up and those aren't really going you're not going to get around it being difficult and there being security issues there but i think the implementations themselves will get stronger and stronger so in general uh at the moment what do you what would your tips be for improving bridge security well i mentioned one like adding in safeguards like making sure that things are possible that's pretty common practice in a lot of d5 projects when it's very possible possible possible so like in the rarify hack you can just stop freeze everything happening with your contracts while you kind of take a second to figure it out i think that also there's some really common sense circuit breakers that you can put in place those circuit breakers have a unique position in interoperability because you're dealing with an asynchronous environment like you have time to stop things from contagion from spreading from one domain to many because it's it's not default composable like it's not like these chains are directly talking to each other you do have some time there so one like really common sense circuit breaker could be okay are netted funds out equal to netted funds in and if that breaks in any point then you just pause everything on the bridge but then when you introduce plot possibility does that also then mean that the system will be more centralized yeah there would be i think that's an okay trade-off to make especially as you're figuring out like the potential pitfalls in your implementation like you should be security minded by default and that includes like having a slow phase rollout so while i do think that everybody should move to kind of get these possible modifiers out get admin functionality out i think it's important to be mindful of how you're rolling it out and that you don't know all the unknowns unknowns when you put something out there that could potentially hold hundreds of millions of dollars and then are there any a kind of systems that smart contract designers can put in place that would prevent these sort of mass looting type situations there are several like the circuit breakers that i brought up would have prevented it as soon as the vulnerability was discovered for example like just because you know the nature of this vulnerability you would have been able to withdraw it all in a few transactions had you really understand how the vulnerability works it kind of indicates that whoever discovered this and exploited it originally didn't have a strong understanding of what they were actually doing um which you know would have given time for people to pause things or just halt actions on the bridge another great thing that you could do is like build in rate limiting for withdrawals so if you notice that withdrawals on a bridge are increasing precipitously and the value in the bridge is dropping you could kind of rate limit that so say okay we'll honor your withdrawal in 60 minutes instead of right now because we want to just slow things down so those are some mechanisms that you can introduce into your system to make it more secure and make it more security-minded but but i'm sure there are a lot of others that could be explored so going forward you know as you mentioned the kind of story of the nomad hack isn't exactly over what are you going to be looking for to happen in the next few weeks on that front yeah well i'm interested obviously to see how much of the funds get returned through this bounty program um i also think that i'll be looking to see you know how in the event that they don't get all returned how they handle this partial backing of assets or kind of what their plan looks like for moving forward because on chains like melgomeda or evmos or moonbeam but they're holding a lot of mad assets or those assets are deeply embedded within the ecosystem and it's not clear if you don't have a hundred percent of the backing how you go about uh redistributing those funds in a fair way so i think that that well an unfortunate exercise to have to go through will be an interesting one and what are some of the options that are on the table i think it's still really early to kind of say what the exact options are and i think a lot of it depends on how likely it is they think they'll get the funds back over a longer period because you know if you think oh we'll get a hundred percent of the funds back through our work with analysis or whatever or law enforcement or whatever but that's not gonna happen for five ten years then the realm of possible solutions looks a little bit different than if you're writing those funds off completely like maybe you could take out a loan or maybe you could like commit to buying them back and open up a bond market of sorts i'm not sure but i think that there's still some unknown unknowns that go into uh the mechanisms there or would have a strong voice in the mechanisms there and if you were in charge of these decisions do you have a way that you would lean initially initially i would probably the simplest answer i could give is like a snapshot like whoever's holding mad assets gets reimbursed to the portion of liquidity that we have come in i think though that that's that's a dumb workable solution but there's probably more elegant ones that are out there and a lot of it again depends just on the amount of funds that get returned okay all right well we'll have to see how it all pans out thank you so much for explaining this all on unchained thanks for having me don't forget next up is the weekly news recap stick around for this week in

in to this week's news recap michael saylor is no longer microstrategy ceo bitcoin maximalist michael saylor stepped down as microstrategy's ceo after leading the company for over three decades the news was dropped last tuesday as the company released its q2 earnings report at that time microstrategy reported a 918 million dollar unrealized loss in q2 from its bitcoin holdings the firm holds 129 699 btc which were bought at an average price of 30 664 mr saylor will be serving as executive chairman and will be replaced by fong li the previous president of the company it looks like sailor wants to go full time on bitcoin as executive chairman i will be able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives while fong will be empowered as ceo to manage overall corporate operations said sailor even though some people were concerned that microstrategy would dump its btc when sailor was no longer ceo it seems that's hardly the case since sailor has 68 voting ownership and his bitcoin conviction remains unchanged it appears that the market took sailor's resignation as positive news microstrategy stock has risen almost 15 percent since since the time of the announcement followed by an increase in btc and crypto prices in general the solana ecosystem suffered another hack aside from the nomad exploit discussed earlier in the show there was another important attack within the solana ecosystem which affected more than 10 000 users and drained more than six million dollars worth of crypto tokens thursday morning users in solana started to report that their accounts were being drained with their balances going to zero the funds from these wallets were being sent to four different accounts allegedly ones belonging to the hackers the vulnerability appears to have been in slope a mobile wallet application after an investigation by developers ecosystem teams and security auditors it appears affected addresses were at one point created imported or used in slope tweeted the solana status account adding private key information was inadvertently transmitted to an application monitoring service there is no evidence the solana protocol or its cryptography was compromised the incident prompted criticism of solana all the problems with tara 1 and solana should really be a wake-up call defy has drifted away from cypherpunk principles everyone is just trying to get rich fast with no conscience unpublished code security by obscurity centralized interventions to prop up bad designs etc wrote gabriel shapiro of delphi digital slope has also launched a bounty program to recuperate the stolen assets they asked the hackers to return 90 of the funds after stating that the team was working with blockchain analytics firm trm and law enforcement it continued upon the receipts of these funds we will not make additional efforts to investigate this matter or pursue any legal action institutions are coming will this be good or bad news for crypto coinbase the largest crypto exchange in the united states had two big announcements this week first it is now offering ethereum staking to institutional investors in the us through coinbase prime the firm's institution-focused arm using our industry-leading cold storage clients can now generate yield by sticking eth said aaron schnark vice president of product whether this is good or bad for eth is an open question on the one hand there's a threat that ethereum becomes more centralized as coinbase will act as a custodian for all these institutions this means that it will own the private keys to all the staked tokens after seeing the ripple effects that could arise from centralized companies not being responsible enough with other people's holdings it shouldn't come as a surprise that there are some concerns about coinbase owning such a large amount of assets the second announcement could have an even larger impact blackrock will begin offering crypto investments to its institutional clients through coinbase prime blackrock is the world's largest asset manager with 10 trillion dollars in assets under management and this marks its first move into crypto clients of blackrock's investment platform aladdin will have direct access to crypto after the news broke coinbase stock rose as much as 35 and trading had to be temporarily halted coin stock is now trading at around 100 accounting for a 20 increase since the announcement as was the case with eth staking through coinbase whether blackrock's move is beneficial for crypto is a matter of debate coinbase is obviously one of the biggest winners in addition it could potentially be positive for crypto investors as it creates a path for big money to enter crypto which could push up prices based on ark's simulated portfolios institutional allocations between 2.5 percent and 6.5 percent could impact bitcoin's price by 200 000 and 500 000 respectively however the centralization issue arises again soon blackrock will control crypto just like they already control the stock market said someone on twitter considering the fact that blackrock manages 10 trillion dollars in assets under management the danger is that it becomes a major holder of btc and other crypto assets making them much more centralized which is not the cypherpunk way tornado cash addresses sanctioned by ofac the u.s treasury department's office of foreign assets control or ofac decided to sanction virtual currency mixer tornado cache for being used to launder more than 7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019 in addition the us treasury claims that tornado cash has been used by north korean group lazarus which has been behind many of the latest crypto hacks including the 600 million dollar ronin exploit the addresses of tornado cache were added to a blacklist by ofac as a consequence all americans are now prohibited from interacting with tornado cash or any of the addresses on the blacklist coincenter released a statement saying today's action does not seem so much a sanction against a person or entity with agency it appears instead to be the sanctioning of a tool that is neutral in character and that can be put to good or bad uses like any other technology in other regulatory news last wednesday a bipartisan bill was introduced by the senate agricultural committee with the intention to make the cftc the primary regulator of the cryptocurrency industry the digital commodities consumer protection act of 2022 would grant the cftc exclusive jurisdiction over crypto importantly it would consider some cryptos like btc and eth as commodities not securities which would put an end to a long debate on that topic there were other enforcement actions this week borsig founders were charged for an alleged 300 million dollar pyramid and ponzi scheme by the securities and exchange commission and they allege that it had been running for more than two years rounding out regulation news new york regulators find robin hood's crypto division with a 30 million penalty for violating anti-money laundering rules and failing to provide cyber security measures on his platform time for fun bits a dow is sending people to the moon a decentralized autonomous organization called moon dao send someone to space last thursday moonda's mission is to create a self-sustaining self-governing colony on the moon to act as a launch point for humanity to explore the cosmos as if earth wasn't close enough the person chosen by the dao to go to the moon was kobe
