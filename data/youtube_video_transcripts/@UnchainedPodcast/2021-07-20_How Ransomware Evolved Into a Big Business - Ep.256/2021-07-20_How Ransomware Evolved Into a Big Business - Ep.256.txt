chanalysis and gervis grigg public sector cto at chainalysis welcome kim and gervis hi hello so ransomware has become quite the phenomenon this year with hackers extorting 412 million dollars from victims last year and then in the first five months of this year obtaining 127 million dollars and then at the beginning of july a group called rival i i believe it's pronounced perpetrated the largest ransomware attack so far infecting more than one million computers and for that they demanded a 70 million dollar ransom before we dive into all the particulars on the topic for today why don't you each tell us a bit about yourself and your background and how you came to learn about this topic and uh actually why don't we start with garvis okay sure thanks laura well my name is gerris greg as you said i'm a 23-year veteran retired from the fbi before that was a stock and bond broker but started my career in the fbi working violent crime and then moved into white collar and advanced financial fraud and money laundering then 911 happened and i pivoted to counterterrorism and in particular counter-terrorism of terrorist financing spent a good bit of my career working counterterrorism and matters associated to that and then moved into the intersection of technology with that and spent the latter half of my career working advanced technology issues for the fbi but i knew when it came time to retire that i wanted to try to keep that passion with technology and my love of advanced financial analysis and and i um and supporting public sector and so when this opportunity with chain analysis came along it was sort of the trifecta of all of those passions right and kim what about you i have been a chain analysis for uh about four years now and i have been always just trying to figure out what is going on with our data and oftentimes that comes that looks like thinking about crime and what types of criminal activity are really surging in certain time periods and trying to figure out why that might be i have a background in economics i worked for the city of new york at the before before i made the jump into crypto and worked with them on a few initial blockchain initiatives and i was happy to see that they have continued those efforts since then and i am right now we are we just finished updating some ransomware data and are working on a few other interesting research topics that are going to come out over the summer great so let's talk about ransomware and let's just make sure i think most people know but let's just define it just to make sure everyone's on the same page and describe what happens to an organization that becomes a victim of one of these attacks sure so you know ransomware has gone through an evolution over the years from the most original um instances that to some of the sophisticated instances that you see and and the one you referenced just recently with this getting more and more complicated and larger and larger in scope but basically is an individual or group of individuals using uh technology and code will infect or enter into a person's system and then hold hostage their data encrypt it or even seize it steal it and then they will demand payment back from the company to unlock that data or to return it or in this case in some other cases now as they've evolved extort payments to not release or make publicly available that data so you can see this evolution of extortion from first just trying to lock up your data so you can't access it to all the way stealing it and then threatening to release it or extort you if you don't pay them in the timely fashion they do to then ddos your system and do other damage and so what happens when you become a victim like is it just that whoever shows up for work first that day realizes they can't get in the system and there's like a pop-up or well you know obviously many companies have their operations center who are monitoring the health and maintenance of their networks and so sometimes it may begin where certain users in the company are saying wait a minute i can't get access the data that i that i need or the system is sloggy or it's not running it at optimum performance and or they a pop-up comes up and says your system has been infected and we're now holding you hostage and sort of that equivalent of the old days ransom note you know you the person that you love and care about has been kidnapped and we demand payment uh and so it can take various forms but the bottom line is it's that uh oh moment for the company to realize oh my goodness we don't have access to our data what's happened to our customer records and then they get the extortion and what types of organizations in industry do they typically attack you know it has run the gamut last year during the height of the pandemic we saw health care providers hospitals and the like being attacked you've seen in the news government institutions and organizations of that we've seen financial institutions food service providers energy critical infrastructure it's really beginning to spread uh and not just those boutique entities that most people have never heard about and that's one of the pernicious aspects of the ransomware campaigns as they're evolving is it's beginning to infect and impact large-scale services that we critically depend on to run our everyday lives i don't know if either of you saw this but the new york times reported that um it got a glimpse of a dashboard on the dark side uh ransomware site and apparently darkseid was forbidding its affiliates from attacking any educational medical or government targets i found that kind of curious um what do you make of that well you know if you look back at the comparison that some have begun to draw between ransomware and counterterrorism it is an established pattern for some terrorist group to be careful about who they attack right i mean you you there's certain dragons you don't want to poke and wake up also there are certain entities that uh maybe you call off and you say we don't want to go there i mean that's not even uncommon for mafiosos and drug gangs where they will identify areas where they don't want to impact or they don't want to raise attention by certain groups so it's not surprising to me that groups would create carve-outs in areas where they either want to target or want to avoid targeting and kim do you have anything to add on that i've i've heard of ransomware strains for example last year saying that they're not going to attack hospitals and i think that that because of how distributed some of these affiliate networks can be i think that we saw that people didn't follow that so they said that and then there actually were some hospitals that were attacked by said strain so you know how what does it mean when a ransomware strain comes out and says i'm not going to be attacking this can you just trust them i mean is this like do you take them at their word we've seen them go back on what they've said to do in the past especially when they said they were not going to be attacking hospitals so potentially you know echoing what garva said potentially there is some there is some desire to not really sound all the alarm bells to get everyone kind of hunting the the the trails of these ransomware criminals but i don't really know what else to make of it other than it's just kind of signaling that hey maybe don't don't pay too much attention to us we're not going to attack these terrible things but in reality i think they have and would if they if they thought they could get away with it yeah at the end of the day it's all about money laura and you know in using as i mentioned there on counterterrorism you can see groups over the years that say hey we don't attack citizens we just detect the military and law enforcement or we just attack government buildings the problem is is that you can't put a bomb outside this you know outside of government building and not impact the public right and and so you get that spillover and and these people um don't always care about those collateral consequences yeah i guess um you know earlier when you were saying you felt that they didn't want to poke the bear i could see that making sense for government and and for medical as well in the sense that that might you know catch the government's attention but educational i kind of was just like hmm so maybe some kids don't get to go to school one day i don't know i was kind of like huh i wonder what that's about but maybe it's because once you affect children then um then yeah i don't know then that also catches the government's attention i wasn't sure well so tell tell us a little bit more about who is behind the attacks are they people who are criminals in other ways or are they more like people who just are looking for a quick buck or kind of like teenagers who don't have a legitimate way to earn money with their computer skills or is it something else well i know kim can add to this but let me just set up a part of that you know the environment is really evolving if we were to go back a number of years ago many of the actors and players in this mission space had advanced technical skills right they would both design their solutions they would identify their targets they would infiltrate their targets ex-fill the data and do that but what has emerged over the last several years and and i think you alluded to it is this really ransomware as a service that has come out where there's this whole ecosystem that's been built up around it kim has some powerful data about that that we help analyze for our for our customers where you don't have to do all of those things yourself in fact you don't have to be particularly sophisticated and and what that means is that is lowered the barrier to entry so that more players who perhaps in previous years could not have done what they can do now are able to buy those services and get in the game that's both scary and profound because it broadens the aperture of players and targets that these companies governments and entities have to defend against it really raises the the amplitude yeah and i wouldn't i would say that we're getting really good at starting to try to create more elaborate profiles of who some of these ransomware criminal gangs really are through a variety of of methods that mostly involve data analysis but bringing a lot of different stakeholders together to look at the same data with different and different means and what i mean is we're getting good at this is because not only are we kind of a data platform where we can see all these different ransomware strains and how active they are but we can also see what types of services are they using what types of dark net marketplaces are they using to potentially purchase access are there certain languages that are used on the off-ramps that they're choosing to send the stolen funds to and so we're getting really good at profiling these criminal gangs let's look at the actual malware there's been some research on uh strains that say hey don't attack certain regions and we put out some research recently saying a majority of the top strains active today have a code baked into the actual attack malware that says don't attack cis um country so don't attack russian speaking countries mostly so we can put all these things together to start to profile who they might be get a lot of good leads for law enforcement in terms of why do people turn to ransomware you know i'll echo a lot of what gerva said it's probably a more complicated answer that has a regional dimension as well and kind of depends on which gang you're looking at and which context they're coming out in but we have um we have we have the tools to kind of profile each of these strains in a better way going forward at least for us all right so before we get a little bit more into the ransomware as a surface which is just so fascinating to me i i do want to know a little bit more about reville the group behind the largest ransomware attack so far and i did i actually think it is our evil it's our okay because yeah i heard a i heard a security researcher i think it was from cisco or somewhere say our evil and i used that in the last show but then i heard terry gross calling it revel and i was like hmm so okay okay so our evil so to but also they go by another name so so do you know can't you know no kiwi is that a russian word or i don't know i'm not sure okay so yeah tell tell some more about this group obviously they're they're the ones behind the headlines in recent weeks well what we do what i can tell you about our evil is that since it is an ongoing investigation of course we can't get into too many details of what what is going on but we can look at how has revel or our evil how has our evil changed over time how have they evolved what services are they using and one thing that struck us when we were looking at the data the whole time series of data surrounding our evil is the almost exponential growth in the size of payments that are being demanded of this organization and so to me that typically signifies a growing sophistication of a certain bad actor because they're probably targeting have a more sophisticated target they probably have more resources to carry out this attack and so we're we're seeing that with this particular strain there's also our evil is a prolific user of mixers and more advanced technologies to move funds as well and so we have been able to triangulate and see all the different kind of methods that our evil are using and how they're changing over time to to i don't like we don't know who i i personally don't know you know who they are but all this data is actually really helpful to paint this bigger picture of what's going on with this with this strain and is your sense that they originate in russia our evil is is one of the many they are one of the many groups that are affiliated with russia and they have that code that i had mentioned before around the do not attack cis countries so you know that is leading you know interpret that how you will but to me it is kind of established that if there's not a definite connection then it's like a strongly assumed connection yeah and i'm just blinking a cis is for commonwealth something but it's independent states russian speaking okay okay and and why is it that so many of these cyber criminal gangs do originate in in that region yeah that's a good question um you know what we can see is where you have lacks jurisdictional control or where the authorities either lack the ability or lack the willpower to do something about it that creates an opportunity for those types of environments to flourish that's not uncommon in the money laundering sector and other types of frauds and scams where you have weak infrastructure or a governmental position that either takes no position or chooses not to take a position then that can breed an environment where those kinds of actors feel safe to operate with impunity or above or outside the law and we see that in some of those kinds of cis environments as well as other places around the world where some of this ransomware strain infrastructure is choosing to position itself okay so now let's dive into this full-on business model which is so fascinating because it seems like it's plucked straight out of a silicon valley playbook um so as you talked about they follow this ransomware is a service model which is similar to any other software as a service or sas model such as corporate email that's powered by gmail or something and then there are affiliates so just describe what this whole structure is and how it works and how the different groups uh within this business model each make their money sure so it is kind of an interesting evolution from from a technology perspective to see how criminals have adapted to this sas model that comes as no surprise given that criminal organizations and criminals themselves are oftentimes very innovative and they operate in a brutally competitive market where the advantages um have to be pursued they also don't have some of the constraints that legitimate actors have to worry about privacy legality and and you know and so forth and so on so they're somewhat freed and unfettered additionally because they have proceeds derived from their illicit activities they're able to quickly pivot and buy things you know we used to see that when i was working on the southern border where the drug cartels would quickly pivot into new technologies that sometimes it took you know a while for the government institutions to adopt and get their arms around so they quickly will gravitate to new capabilities and when you look at this if you're a purveyor of malware and ransomware you want as many people as possible using your stuff so that you get your cut right uh and if you are want to get into the space and be able to make some money but you lack the technical sophistication or and you don't know how to do that entirely this provides you a way through the dark market to find those vendors who can sell you those services so this is sort of what it looks like so you want to conduct a ransomware attack uh obviously you go out there and you find a vendor who can provide you that technical service right the tools and and data and software techniques then you've got to look and say well who can provide me cloud hosting services so when i steal all this data i've got to put it somewhere so you find an illicit cloud provider who will allow you to host the stolen data then you also as kim said you've got to find someone who can maybe help you with the mixing and the obfuscation and the laundering of those funds to try to obfuscate where they came from and then you also of course and most importantly you need somebody to help you ex-fill that and turn that back into fiat so you need someone who can help you offload that and offer grant that money and so you're doing this across this ransomware service and one of the unique things that is both a strength but a vulnerability is how are they paying all these people along that ransomware supply chain they're paying them with cryptocurrencies so cryptocurrency and the blockchain become one of those unifying data sets that allow authorities and those attempting to blunt the impact of ransomware the ability to identify that strain and that's where kim and her team really shines because they can pull together that data and give us a better picture of the crypto and ransomware ecosystem in fact you'll probably get into it later in our broadcast about how a lot of those things consolidate to a surprisingly few number of addresses i won't steal our thunder on that but i was taken aback when i learned about it so yeah kim do you want to tell us tell us more about that yeah well just a a few kind of the the cool thing about this is i think garvis covered a lot of really interesting grounds the first is that yeah there is no kind of central data source with the us dollars where you can see where all the illicit money is going there's just no there's just no data set like that you can't it's very siloed each investigation is very specific and takes into account many different cross-jurisdictional pieces of information you have to coordinate with different especially when it comes to cross-border investigations and so this data set does allow us to have a really strong sense of what is going on overall and when it comes to the ransomware as a service business model yeah we see this happening a lot you hear about this in the news and the cool thing is we can put data to this these this phenomenon so we can see the amount of volume the amount of cryptocurrency that is moving from ransomware strains to other kind of illicit cyber networks that allow the the activity to to continue and to go on so to darknet marketplaces or to purchasing infrastructure as a service and what we noticed and it didn't actually make it into our crime report but what we did notice is that the share of overall ransomware proceeds going to these other this infrastructure has been growing pretty fast and to me that means that there are more of the actual kind of supply chain of crime is coming on the blockchain so you have less need to cash out to go pay your web hosting provider you're doing it on the blockchain so that means there are maybe fewer opportunities to catch these people because that fiat conversion is a really good opportunity to sweep in and and get the identity but we're modeling out the business model the business infrastructure in a way that you just can't do without this data set so we're seeing more money flowing between ransomware strains to these off-ramps and then we can look at the money laundering as well and what garvis was pointing out is that we said where are all these ransom funds winding up what services because that's the key getting them at that off-ramp that's when maybe you'll be able to freeze the funds maybe you'll be able to catch the person and if you're kind of a researcher like me i'm like then i can see what's going on and how many bad guys there are so ransomware of all the types of criminal activity was the most concentrated on the fewest number of off-ramps both in terms of services and deposit addresses receiving those funds it was by far the most concentrated so of all the other types of illicit activity which were a little bit more dispersed among different services ransomware went to the fewest services and the fewest deposit addresses on those services and to us that echoes this kind of the concentration definitely but the money laundering infrastructure that criminals will use who carry out many different ransomware attracts attacks will then use the same laundering infrastructure to move their funds and to us that shows that hey these these groups are connected and there's this is them purchasing almost the money laundering portion of their of their um attack and this whole it ran somewhere as a business infrastructure process and laura why that is significant from an investigator's perspective i remember with my time in the fbi when we were looking to dismantle a criminal organization one of that was to look at their hierarchy how they operate how they communicate how they move money and if you could find those central nodes that were critical to maintaining their network infrastructure of how they do a business and you could isolate and eliminate those by arresting or seizing funds or denying them the ability to perform those actions you could really impact the viability of that whole network and in some cases completely dismantle it or really set them back and they would have to go to extraordinary means to route around that just like you know if you're on an island there's only one highway to get to either side of the island and there's a rock slide nobody's going anywhere until you can build a new road or get rid of the rocks and that's where the this kind of information can become so powerful for investigators to understand and map that ecosystem so they can identify those network nodes and those operators to take them down to dismantle the ability for these campaigns to continue and propagate um kim earlier when you were talking about kind of the small number of uh places where these payments are being made what you're saying is or you tell me if this interpretation is correct that even though there are different strains of ransomware that are going around um based on the movement of those payments it appears that multiple of them are actually perpetrated by the same groups or or or that the same service providers are you know working with like many or not many but you know with with multiple groups and so even then at certain points like certain payments will always end up in the same places is that kind of where you were going with that yeah those both could be true depending on the strain but i'll give you an example we've identified a really large laundering service we know this is a laundering service and they're receiving funds from multiple disconnected strains that are not considered to be written by the same operator and so how did they all wind up at the same using the same laundering infrastructure potentially there's an affiliate an affiliate is someone who is associated with a ransomware strain and they're really behind the attack an affiliate might be migrating between multiple strains and then using their kind of contacts to send the money to the lawn to the money laundering person i mean we know in in money laundering rings using us dollars or fiat there there are many different people who are responsible for different parts of the of moving the money and so there's not one person who's the money launderer there's you know runners around around the world and whatnot and so there are people who are connected connecting multiple strains together and so the takeaway for me is that this ecosystem is maybe a little bit smaller than than you would have thought otherwise and thereby potentially more vulnerable yeah we're going to talk about that in a second um but first i wanted to ask and maybe i'm not sure if there is a figure on this but um do you have a sense of what percentage of victim organizations do pay the ransom my answer to that is that we there's a data problem with ransomware that we're working really hard right now to overcome with initiatives like being participating in the ransomware task force which are bringing lots of different stakeholders together to say how can we all work together to comp to combat this problem there's a data problem because people are not there's an under reporting problem people are attacked and maybe they just want to pay the ransom and have this be done with or they have or they just ignore it there's a lot of reasons why people don't report their ransomware attack and so we are only having we only have um data on the people who who actually reported their ransomware attack so we we can't actually probably give you a good estimate not to mention the number of people who maybe were there was a phishing attack that could have led to a a ransomware infection but the the infosec weeded that out so does that count as like how does that count so we were really trying to navigate this to get better data to figure out how big this problem is and that's why having like a central data source and putting out these numbers where you know over 100 million dollars in ransomware payments year-to-date is really important so we can size the problem up but there's a long way of saying that uh i'm not quite sure but do you guys have a recommendation on whether or not victim organization should pay the ransom or or just in general what what would you say is the best protocol for them you know we don't really have a a position that where we advocate whether pay or don't pay i can tell you what the authorities say and recommend is to not to pay but if you do please let us know as soon as possible and uh and that's kind of the message that you hear repeated oftentimes out of the authorities is they recommend not paying because it further funds the next attack because the money received from this attack only propagates into the next one and so the exploitation cycle continues and you want to break the chain no pun intended but they do say if you do and you make that business decision then please let us know because time is not your friend by delaying all right so in a moment we're gonna dive more into the cryptocurrency aspects of this whole situation but first a quick word from the sponsors who

developers and artists from around the world are building creating and using tazos every day discover how people are reimagining the world around you on tazos back to my conversation with gervis grigg and kim grower so let's talk more about the cryptocurrency aspect of this phenomenon um the perpetrators are demanding cryptocurrency as their ransom why is it that this is their preferred way of being paid my i think it's the preferred way of getting paid because to some degree it's there is it's easier to tell victims to go to a certain known exchange and it's easier to onboard people onto bitcoin so there's a lot of really user-friendly ways for people to acquire cryptocurrency so you can imagine your regular victim of a ransomware attack might have never really heard of bitcoin so what you're going to teach them how to download all these um to to use a monero or something so there's a little bit of the fact that it's it's easier there's also these criminals are asking for millions and millions of dollars what the most recent one was asking for 70 million dollars and using some privacy coins you might have a little bit of a liquidity problem how do you offload that money increasingly exchanges are thinking of those uh currencies as being as being riskier so those are two reasons why people might uh prefer bitcoin i don't know gervis do you have other other ideas well but even also to just take a step back like why would they prefer cryptocurrency rather than you know just normal us dollars yeah so so at the end of the day they want to get paid they want to get paid as quick as possible in a in a manner that is as fungible as possible and to the degree that it allows them a level of anonymity or perceived anonymity they're going to pursue that right drop the cash in a brown paper bag in at the corner walk and don't walk you know near the dark alley and and drive away right they they don't want to be detected so there is and this is one of um things we've we've written about is this perception that cryptocurrencies are anonymous and at best they're pseudo anonymous but there is that perceived anonymity associated with it and to kim's point the ease of using this speed because cryptocurrency can move across jurisdictionals in a moment right and then they can quickly move it from there to another into another back in the day when some of the romance scams and other things were happening you know and and the little old lady had to go into the bank to pay this money you know she had to interact with the bank manager the bank manager was asking her well mrs jones why are you withdrawing ten thousand dollars and wanted to wire it to you know country x and and so there were a lot of barriers to entry whereas here in this mrs jones never has to leave her home now that was in a in a fraud example but the same thing is true here for the company there's that lowered barrier to entry without some of the the perceived checks and balances that help protect our financial institutions and systems and so many of these criminals are opting to cryptocurrency because of that both perceived anonymity and speed and ease of access we even see them uh demanding them to go to a local uh cryptocurrency atms right and do it right through there so oh wow so they're they're directing people just to go directly to bitcoin in some cases right now these large-scale things you're not going to go and do 70 million dollar transaction in the cryptocurrency atm near near your local convenience store but you can see the availability of these and they're you know over 15 000 in the united states alone and they're growing by the day and so that offers opportunities for individuals to engage in the cryptocurrency market space but it also facilitates you know some of these types of actors because it's you know ease of access for them and so kim was implying that they tend to gravitate toward bitcoin but why is that over a privacy coin just because of the liquidity aspect or you know i would think you know obviously we all know that bitcoin is pretty well traceable so um are we seeing them gravitate more toward privacy coins we have seen some um using privacy coins but there are there are the limitations that that we suggested and at the end of the day it really is just what's the fastest way to get me paid now so i can cash that out into a usable currency and i think bitcoin is at least perceived to be the most effective way to get there fungibility speed ease of abuse big factors interesting so you don't foresee because i would imagine that if they do turn the privacy coins in a large scale way then that would make it much more difficult for people like you to follow the funds well you can see and i think we've seen an impact a positive impact in certain jurisdictions around the world where they have taken um hard looks at privacy coins and exchanges for example south korea recently required that these privacy points be moved off of their exchanges in their country and so you can see some of that regulatory pressure happening to um free up and make uh available a safer transaction space and so a lot of these privacy coins are are looked upon in a negative light from a regulatory stance and many of those countries have implemented or are implementing uh safeguards for that interesting so are we finding that for a lot of these victim organizations that they have an easy time following the instructions to pay and their crypto because you know i'm sure we're all quite well aware that most everyday people do not really know how to transact with with this stuff so um how how do they ensure that they actually do get paid the the criminals i've seen detailed instructions of how to make an account on local or like an exchange i've seen it on various i think i saw one on local bitcoins i've seen them pointing you to certain exchanges and giving you step-by-step instructions on on what to do detailed instructions on exactly how to acquire bitcoin and where to send it to so there's also the flip side i think these really the bigger ransomware payments they tend to contract out someone to actually handle the whole process of the ransomware payment so they'll hire someone to negotiate and to pay ultimately pay the ransomware so they of course have more expertise but those tend to be at the uh for the really large attacks where there's lots of money up to multimillions of dollars that are asked for in cryptocurrency but other than that i mean maybe there are some times where people just couldn't figure it out and didn't pay it and then rolled the dice and hoped they got their funds back but we can only kind of guess on what's happening with them you mean they got their files back their data yeah yeah we can only guess like if they didn't if they couldn't figure it out and didn't pay did they get their files back we don't we don't know unless they reported it well yeah i mean i i don't know i would imagine they probably don't right if they don't pay i would imagine that they really just don't get them back but then out of curiosity when when people actually do pay the ransom to the criminals then actually decrypt the files for them i've seen both happen i've heard of both happening i've heard people paid and they didn't get their files decrypted i've heard people pay and they did i've heard i've even heard of people finding universal decryptors not paying and getting out of it that way i think it really um depends on on your circumstances and who was attacking you okay so once the attackers do have the ransomware payment assuming that they do get paid how do they cash out you've kind of alluded to these money laundering as a service providers um so how many are they where are there where are they located et cetera so the first thing we do to answer that question is we look at all of the wallets that are controlled by different strains and then we we just look at where they go after they leave the wallet and that's where we're going to see them going to the infrastructure as a service that we that we mentioned the darknet market places to support further attacks but also services where they can convert those funds to either other cryptocurrencies or to fiat and what we're what we're seeing there is the funds moving through sometimes sometimes one wallet sometimes thousands of wallets to potentially obfuscate detection and then winding up on a few services where where they we can only since we kind of our eyes we stop when we see uh with blockchain transactions in many exchanges a lot of the trades that happen are on order books and they kind of manage those order books we can only kind of guess what happened after that but at least we know where to look where to direct law enforcement so this exchange this deposit address this and then from there you would you would get the next step would be a subpoena where you could say hey what do i know about the person managing this deposit address it looks like it's actually a service or an otc broker or an individual and and piece together all of those other pieces with that off chain intelligence that we um that we don't personally have and is your sense that there are many such services like these and if so you know is that why they are still able to proliferate because you know like like you said if it's something where you can identify an account and get a subpoena to get more information on that i would imagine that that would be a very natural vector for law enforcement to go after there aren't very many there are not very many deposit addresses that are receiving the illicit funds it's surprisingly concentrated on a few very large deposit addresses that mostly do criminal activity um sometimes you can one of the cool things you can do is you can say okay let's these look at the services that are or the deposit addresses on exchanges that we're receiving elicit funds what other types of things are they doing are they doing five percent ransomware 95 derivatives trading you know and that can get you a a profile of who these deposit addresses are and then from there you could say oh it looks like this deposit address receives 50 funds from these three different strains and they're the rest of their funds is really large transfers rounded amounts of of cryptocurrency that looks like uh maybe a poorly regulated otc broker that's operating off of these few services and yeah there there's opportunities for disruption there there's things that can be done i mean this is an ongoing thing that we're that we're dealing with as an industry what do we do about this and um profiling these deposit addresses has been um something that has been proven to be really extremely interesting because we can get into the the weeds of who who these organizations are is it one ransomware transfer and then they shut down or consistently ransomware transfers over the past five years and those types of questions you can start to situate the deposit addresses into different categories which helps you profile them even more and to kim's point on that it shows the ability that it takes a multi-faceted solution approach you need your not only your law enforcement uh agencies working but you've got your regulators as well right so that whole of government solution to dismantle these ransomware capabilities yeah when one thing i was thinking about was kim's earlier comment in the episode where she said that it kind of increasingly they're not actually cashing out to fiat and kind of transacting more in cryptocurrency it frankly makes me think so not only does that mean that then there are fewer points at which law enforcement maybe could get more insight into these groups but then you know have ways to kind of intercede but um it also makes me think that as the wider world adopts crypto then there will be more opportunities for them to perpetrate these attacks and get paid um without you know having to worry so much about law enforcement but who knows maybe by then law enforcement will have new tools um so one thing in terms of tools that girvis you mentioned earlier was that um you said in a blog post that the ransomware phenomenon has parallels to terrorism and um what are those parallels yeah you heard national leaders draw that comparison and i think part of that came from that sense of urgency and need for national unity to pull together a whole of government solution for it it clearly is a threat because it's impacting people's daily lives when you disrupt uh fuel supply for a major portion of a large country like the united states or you impact food production or you disrupt major health care providers and their or banking and your ability to access your funds you're affecting people's lives and that's creating terror uh and fear and sowing that kind of uh distrust in the system so the analogy is clearly there to to draw between counterterrorism and and grandson aware what i was expanding on that article was is well what are some of the solutions that we've implemented successfully over the past several decades to counter the terrorism threat and what are their potential analogies to the ransomware clearly of course it's um you know you've got to do a good bit on awareness and communication to sort of bring people up to speed on what is this threat we talked about the whole of government solutions that you need both integrated coordination between national policy makers law enforcement intel regulatory entities um there's also a resourcing to the problem right i mean this problem takes resources to address and that resources are not just from the government if you look into the private industry when you look at the cyber hygiene of some of these companies and some of those that became victims to it there were perhaps some of the cyber advisors would say there were things they can do to prevent that from happening next time so it's a real um complicated but understandable problem so when you were talking about um kind of the whole ecosystem this ransomware as a service and then all the other actors involved and um you mentioned that it's sort of creating this like little industry with these players and there's um you know consolidation happening and you said that that actually represents ransomware's biggest vulnerability so how can that be exploited to prevent further attacks right building on what kim was talking about there is understanding who are the key players what are those nodes in this ransomware supply chain where maybe the the key mixing services the key offloading and money laundering services who are the big purveyors of some of these exploits and tools that they're leveraging or their web hosting or cloud providers and and then going after those you know i recently um i shared this analogy with a friend about a vehicle there's a current backlog on a number of vehicles here in the u.s why because the chips that go into those vehicles are on backlog so you have this complex machine that's got lots of thousands of moving parts is enormous waste 2 000 pounds and yet the whole production is dismantled and delayed for a small little chip right and and that's analogous to i mean uh it to even to the ransomware so if you can understand how all those parts fit together in the ransomware and then be strategic about your targeting and going after those nodes you can really affect the whole network and so what i mean by that and that's some of the counter-terrorism strategies that have been applied successfully is identifying the leadership the funding how they travel how they radicalize and recruit well those same kind of analogies can look at here at ransomware and some of the things that kim talked about and i think that's a framework that government agencies across the world can pursue to reduce the impact ransomware is having on us but i think you're right we are going to see continue to grow because currently there's nothing to de-incentivize um this activity and so many of them are moving forward it seems like the same playbook that our evil used but in reverse because they attacked caseya which had you know all of these companies that were relying on its information and so if you do the reverse to them it would have the same effect um so now let's actually talk a little bit about colonial pipeline in may hackers ransom the systems of that company which is one of the largest pipeline operators in the us and they requested 75 bitcoins as ransom and 63.7 of those were paid to the hacker the rest presumably went to darkseid which was the ransomware as a service provider as a commission and the us department of justice was able to seize those 63.7 btc and it's not known exactly how they did so so what do you think are the most likely theories well i hate to disappoint but i'm really not in a position to talk about that particular uh instance or case what i can say is i think it illustrates though the need for raising the crypto literacy and capabilities of government agencies because it's not enough just to defend against an attack nor to push it back or to find the people responsible but you also want to return the money back to the victims and of course potentially never let them become a victim in the first place by some of the proactive things we talked about earlier in the broadcast and i think that is one of the takeaways from that type of an incident okay i i will mention that there was an analysis by galaxy digital's research arm and um there a couple theories were first that maybe doj was able to serve a warrant to an onshore exchange or otc desk who then complied uh with law enforcement um the second theory could be that doj got access to a compromised computer that had access to that wallet and darkside had said previously that its servers had been compromised and then another theory was that maybe the fbi had apprehended someone who was affiliated with the hackers who had access to that private key so that's just for listeners who are wondering how that was able to happen it's not necessarily that bitcoin itself is compromised um all right so you know at the moment we are seeing quite a lot of movement or at least talk about the government um so what would you say are the best tools that the government can use now to prevent and combat ransomware yeah well this is going to lead quickly into kim's strength but let me just set the stage you really first it begins with data you've got to have the right data to both understand the ecosystem that you're dealing with as well as who the players and actors are and what those transactions are moving across the blockchain of course is a publicly available ledger and anyone can look at it but having the right tools to interpret that data really becomes important and be able to do that at the speed crypto moves at and i think that's where you're going to see a lot of growth in this market space of both making the the right data available and the tools to help quickly reduce the time to insight and to follow it kim i would echo first and foremost data is the most important at least if you're thinking about if you're a victim who has paid a ransom your what's your best shot of you know getting your funds back and then you have the bigger question of okay ransomware is picking up we called 2020 the year of the ransomware because there was over 300 growth and probably more now and 2021 right now on the track that we're on right now is going to just far exceed 2020 in terms of the funds going to ransomware this is something that's growing really fast and so i think the industry solution is probably multi-pronged around education info security but also awareness of how we can see every player you know that we that we have data on we can see what they're doing we can see their operations and we can see where they're cashing out and the fact that the fact that it's smaller than the the money laundering infrastructure is smaller than we had originally anticipated i think it's actually makes it feel a little bit more manageable to me at least then then oh my gosh there's ransomware happening every single day millions of attacks but actually like this is the size of it these are how many different groups we're tracking and these are the off ramps that they use and so kind of that that level of transparency makes a really scary problem feel more manageable but other than that i think just it's going to be a multi-pronged approach to tackling this this problem yeah and maybe the fact that it's very much an international problem will also help because when you have so many different countries and industries that are affected um i i imagine that maybe that will be more motivating to people to to kind of band together and act or do you get a sense that that helps oh yeah so international cooperation public private partnerships there's probably some legislative changes that are needed to strengthen the consequences and legislation around ransomware and those that perpetrate those type of cyber events that increase focus on asset recovery and sanctions um work that can be done to raise the fences the cyber fences if you will among critical industry and infrastructure providers to make them less vulnerable for exploitation and then as we talked about literally going after with a focus dismantlement campaign to identify those key players actors and nodes on that network and go after them regular from a regulatory perspective from a law enforcement perspective and the like all right well i guess we'll have to see how the rest of this year plays out hopefully it won't um you know snowball into something even bigger but it sort of looks that way at the moment all right well where can people learn more about each of you and chain analysis you can find our research on our blog we have a section that details all of the research we've put out and you can you can subscribe to our our newsletters so you can get insights into what types of new research we're putting out and what we're paying attention to and yeah we're always doing new research topics right now we're focusing on the geography of cryptocurrency which is you know the other 99 of activity that isn't illicit you know what's going on there so yeah yeah yeah okay as kim said you can go to our website and kim and i are routinely publish information there and updates along with others from the company and we'd welcome you give us a visit okay great all right well thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you so much
