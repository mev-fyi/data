not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so uh we've got a special guest today but let me quick do intros first we've got Tom the defy Maven and master of memes next we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet today we've got a special guest Paul Grewal the chief legalese officer at coinbase and then I've got myself on the seed the head high Mana dragonfly so we aren't really stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is legal advice life advice or invested advice please see chop and block that XYZ for more disclosures Paul it's great to have you here in person thanks for having me on guys appreciate it this today I mean we were planning this obviously but uh today's a very special day because today was just the day that it was announced that um the grayscale Bitcoin spot ETF lawsuit uh basically graceful one and a judge kind of smacked the SEC and said hey no this is uh I believe the term was arbitrary and capricious Market is up uh coinbase is up 14 uh Bitcoin is up eight six percent there's Jubilation in the markets like oh my God the people the courts are finally pushing back on the SEC let me just get a quick reaction from you what do you think about this whole uh situation that we've seen today with the grayscale win well I think today's win for grayscale is nothing short of monumental and it wasn't actually just one judge there were three judges on the Circuit Court panel that basically held Not only was the sec's uh denial of grayscale's application arbitrary and capricious the Court held that it was uh incoherent and lacking in recent those are very harsh assessments by a circuit court uh in reference to an agency that's in usually receiving all kinds of deference when it comes to its decisions on administrative law issues big day yeah so there's been a lot of Jubilation you asked me earlier okay you're a legal guy all the lawyers are like up in ours they're having a field day with this uh and you ask me okay what does a normal person think um so what does a normal person actually so I was just listening to uh a Bloomberg podcast where they you know I feel like the financial media doesn't really has this feeling of like Bitcoin so easy to buy why do you need an ETF and they spent half an hour talking about that they were like it makes no sense that these crazy crypto people are so excited about an ETF given that you can just buy Bitcoin and so I thought that was a funny reaction but that that is like a non-interesting uh Tom what's your what was your reaction to an extent I feel sort of on gaslit because I think you know in in sort of the um of course opinion it talked about the fact that uh the Bitcoin Futures EU ETF has been out for a while but the spot ETF is not approved because obviously the future trades on on CME uh there's surveillance issues with spot but obviously Futures track the price of spots so if there's Market manipulation on spot it should affect the Futures and they talk about this in the findings that you know the Futures track spot the price of spot 99.9 of the time and so you know me as a relatively person I'm like yeah of course that's true like there's always been true why would you not approve to spot and so it's interesting to see and they sort of think about it similarly yeah there's been there's been a lot of enthusiasm about this idea that an ETF is going to unlock massive amounts of retail participation into crypto I've always been somewhat skeptical of the story because of the because basically what what I think what the people in the Bloomberg podcast were saying which is that I mean yeah like anybody who wanted to buy crypto or not literally anybody but most people they figured out a way to do it and that that was kind of the theme of every bull market in crypto is that people will jump through incredible Hoops in order to get access to this stuff if they really are excited about it and you know the amount of people who learn how to use metamask off of tick tock just belies the fact that yeah people will people do all sorts of stuff if they if they really want the thing that that is being propounded to them um and so is it that hard for someone to go on coindes and buy some Bitcoin or even to go buy gbtc obviously that's why gbtc was trading at sort of premium for the years that it was um now all that being said I do think that a Bitcoin spot ETF in in my estimation it probably matters more actually for institutions than it matters for retail because I can tell you interact having interact with a lot of Institutions uh they really get scared when it comes to we have to onboard onto a new counterparty right so we have to we have to get a relationship now with coinbase and obviously coinbase is the most trusted party in the space and there's the fidelities and the other people who are also doing this um but it's just it's just like a conversation you have to go have with your CIO we got to go and underwrite this thing and decide how we're going to do it and blah blah blah and if you're going to say like okay there's an ETF and we just like you know we already have the relationships that we need we have the Brokers we have the custodians all that stuff we don't need to add anything more in terms of infrastructure in order to get exposure to bitcoin that feels to me like the bigger unlock and just the fact that like you said about being gaslit like everybody in this industry is like what are you talking about of course the future is resolved to the spot price that is the point of Futures so if the spot price is manipulable then the Futures price is manipulable QED end of story so the the idea that like a judge is going to come in there saying yeah yeah no this is crazy town of course the thing you think is happening is the thing that's happening which is the SEC is being unfair and it's it feels the biggest thing that's happening is that there's a Vindication that the SEC does not just arbitrarily get to decide I like this I don't like that they have to be fair and and neutral well there's no question I mean look we we had again three judges of the second most powerful court in the land saying you got to be kidding me sec I mean that's to put it into layperson's terms that's literally what it means to be um uh acting arbitrarily capriciously as the SEC was found today the court looked at evidence that there was a 99.9 percent correlation between the two markets the court looked at the fact that um the surveillance sharing agreements that were apparently perfectly well and good when it comes to futures um were um you know providing no greater security than the Securities provided by uh the supervision of the spot market and the thing that I think is most striking about this opinion put aside the fact that you had a an appointee of President Obama on a point to your president Trump and even an appointee of President Jimmy Carter if you can believe that um all agreeing that the the SEC um acted uh arbitrary capriciously offered an incoherent explanation even beyond all that the thing that's most striking about this is that the court was unequivocal in sending this decision back it did not offer the usual well the SEC has some decent arguments over here but for other reasons we have to hold in favor of grayscale if you read judge Rao's opinion she goes through every single issue one by one and rejects the sec's position out of hand it's it's an extraordinary decision yeah usually you do see a lot more difference like the SEC and for good reason after a good reason the agency that's charged with being you know the responsible for police in these markets well the other thing was uh the ax that was violated I guess the agency detection is it agency protection act well it's the administrator prison Majors act yeah how often is that actually uh an issue like does that does that get parties challenge agency decisions all the time under the administrative procedure Act lots of parties often are disappointed when the EPA or the um Treasury Department or other agencies including the SEC reject you know that the proposal that they make and and many of them try to argue that the decision was arbitrary occupation but the bar is extraordinarily High when you're bringing that kind of challenge because our law does recognize us as he points out that agencies should get difference they are the experts in the room they are the ones who have seen these issues over and over again and so this is not a question or a situation where a court simply disagreed with what the SEC did the court fundamentally rejected the entire process that the SEC followed in reaching the decision and then a called out over and over again all the ways in which when it looked at this record it couldn't believe what it found so I do think this was highly unusual and I do think it speaks to a broader issue at the SEC Beyond just was this the right call in this particular so what what baffles me about this is like what exactly is the psychology at the SEC that like a Bitcoin Futures ETF is okay but Bitcoin spot is not because like if you're like look I don't want anything I don't want retail touching Bitcoin right if that's your view why why like why this why the Futures but not the spot like I don't know if anybody has a mental model of why they would care about the distinction between Futures a spot in my mind like once you let the thing in okay that's exposure to bitcoin that anybody can get in a Schwab account I don't know do you guys have any intuition why this is the hill that the FC wants to die on well I hesitate to jump into the mind of any commissioner let alone the chair of the SEC on this issue or frankly any other issue but since you asked the question I can't help but but but engage in or indulge in a little bit of speculation look the fact of the matter is this type of product will unleash an entirely new wave of interest and adoption by all kinds of Market participants especially the institutions who for all kinds of reasons aren't in a position or just are not comfortable yet uponing the underlying digital assets and I think I think that the SEC looked at this and saw that if we allow this line to be crossed if we suddenly find ourselves in a world where you have mainstream institutions able to fully participate in the digital asset Market at least with respect to bitcoin for now um you're going to see all sorts of follow-on effects that undermine their strategy of trying to contain and constrain digital assets before they become widely adopted so I do think that there were considerations here that went far beyond just concerns about Market manipulation and fraud which are of course the only basis upon which they were supposed to review this application in the first place yeah it's and it's striking too it just makes the last point is that you know the the particular case that they they were adjudicating so I think there's been applications for ETFs going back since like 2013 I want to say I think the Winklevoss Twins were the first to file and then I was the first I'm not mistake that's right that's right and then there's been pretty much every single year there have been other attempts to file bitcoin's body chafs they've always been rejected um what's notable of course about grayscale is that it is really the one example where you can point to actual investor harm by not approving the conversion of you can modify exactly exactly like this thing is trading at a massive discount that means people who bought this thinking that they were getting exposure to Bitcoin now they are in the hole they're bleeding fees out to grayscale um and there's nothing they can do but wait until the SEC kind of changes its mind or decides suddenly oh no never mind now the spot Market looks like it's not that manipulable anymore or whatever it is that they're gonna eventually uh concede on so it feels um strikingly just the opposite Bizarro World interpretation of what their job is is okay for for some of the other applications like okay maybe like whatever blah blah blah but grayscale is kind of special in that there are real it's not a theoretical thing there are real investors being harmed right now who are mostly retail investors so I think you know we've been talking more about the retrospective but the one thing the ruling didn't do is it didn't say hey today you can open the ETF today right it just said you have to go back and so I'm more curious what you think the likelihood that the SEC will sort of try to find some other excuse for assuming the language was so unequivocal it was like look we agree like basically I believe the statement was uh you know grayscale says that it was unfairly capricious and that their ETF should be approved if the Futures are approved and the judge said we agree go bucket try try again the judge didn't didn't force the that's right right and so they're they're still and they is that even a move available to the joke it's not it's not and the SEC does have some other options even before it has to reconsider the application it could for example ask the full Circuit Court of Appeals the complete complement of judges on the DC circuit to review this decision it could even ask the Supreme Court to take up the issue now I think both of those moves would be losers for all kinds of reasons and I think that the message from this panel again consisting of ideologically diverse judges was go back and do your homework now once it um once it uh gets the Mandate from the court and has to formally uh return to that process it's entirely possible you're absolutely right that that this SEC could come up with new excuses new bogus explanations or reasons why this uh application should be rejected but there's no there there they've never offered any other explanation other than this stated concern about fraud and Market manipulation that has now been firmly rejected for the SEC at this point to now come up with entirely new um causes to reject uh the conversion I think would just further undermine its credibility in ways that would create lasting damage for the commission they go far beyond just the ETF Market or or this particular application I mean we do love indulging the speculation on the show obviously uh not investment speculation but this is a new speculation and uh one of the theories that was propounded earlier why BlackRock filed their ETF at the time and they did one of the conspiracy theories is that the SEC basically saw the writing on the wall from the questioning they were getting from the judges that this was not going to go well for them and that okay they were they're probably going to force our hand to approve an ETF and if that's true we'd much rather have BlackRock on this Market than grayscale on this market and so yo someone calls up you know they call it BlackRock they're like hey I think we're going to have to approve Bitcoin ETF soon you guys should get in here and what do you know there's like seven or eight Bitcoin ETFs ready to go such that by the time they you know the the hope I think from the SEC side very very I I would curiosity is it legal for that to happen or is that just kind of like a very unreal about that there's nothing in principle illegal about it it just seems a little weird that you're sort of playing favorites yeah it's weird and kind of a shitty thing to do but I mean for grayscale obviously but well I think that um look uh I I certainly have no evidence that this um alleged you know plot was hatched or carried out um well plot is a strong word I don't want to be clear I'm not accusing of plot I am recounting speculation fair enough fair enough but I think that you know in in most cases uh the simplest explanation is the best explanation I think here the simplest explanation for blackrock's sudden uh move in into this Market was that they too like everybody else study the situation carefully if I remember correctly the application BlackRock file came right around or just after the time that this case was argued to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and anyone reviewing that transcript could see for themselves that each of these judges again with very different world views on the law all were sort of scratching their heads at how on Earth can you justify this this decision when you've approved these two other applications for futures ETFs you haven't offered a coherent explanation as to why this spot Market is uniquely susceptible to fraud or manipulation nor have you offered any stated reasons why that same concern wouldn't impact the futures of Marcus that you just signed off on so I think speaking for myself BlackRock was just doing its homework and saying okay this doesn't make any sense of course courts can always do strange things but are the smart money here is that this is going to be rejected and that the applications are going to be are going to come piling in and of course that's exactly what we saw after BlackRock made its move I'm more Curious from a speculative lens since you you want you want to indulge in more speculation who do you think will get the first approval because there's so many applications like BlackRock Valkyrie I would suspect it happened simultaneously you think they're they're going to approve multiple ones they're all Fowler on the same time yeah it must be it must be I think they want to avoid the appearance of you know out of curiosity what is the gpdc discount at now because it's been closing for throughout the past six months or so yeah actually I did not check that did anyone they don't know what it was a very interesting question is that one last Point program Yvonne which is on the delay Point yeah I know that a lot of us in crypto sometimes get impatient with the courts this was certainly the case with with judge Torres in the xrp um lawsuit but I hope that in each of these cases whether to judge Torres in the xrp case or here with the DC circuit and grayskill we've all seen it sometimes sometimes just a little bit of deliberation a little bit of care can go a long way and so I hope we hope we can all at least give the courts their due uh when they when they when they deserve it okay well it was at 25 yesterday up to 17 today so on to gather okay pretty good pretty good okay interesting all right so speaking of giving the courts that are due um we should talk about the the big elephant court case in the room which is of course coinbase versus the SEC I will actually I'll actually hand off the mic to you to give a little bit of a backdrop and Exposition of coinbase's relationship with the SEC if you could start at maybe you know going back to uh the the uh what's called filing US1 and going public to that eventually to get receiving the lawsuit from the SEC and where you guys are at now currently in your battle with the SEC let's gather around the campfire okay here we go look as you point out we have been engaged with the SEC not just for many months but for many years and of course um in April 2021 after nearly six months of back and forth on our S1 application the SEC approved coinbase to list as a public company watershed moment for the company certainly but for crypto as a whole and at that point in time when it reviewed the application by law the SEC made a specific determination that coinbase listing on the public markets was in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors all right mind you this was after six months of review of every element every facet of our business including an exhaustive examination of our listings process the process by which we review individual assets and so having been permitted to uh list as a public company we found ourselves feeling pretty good in fact very good that the rigorous process we put into vet assets to make sure that we were not listing Securities or other uh assets that may pose an undue risk to our customers we thought look this has been a tough road but um we now have the sec's permission to list as a public company well a month after that in fact in just just a few weeks after that the new chair of the SEC Mr Gensler testified before Congress on a whole range of topics but even in that even on the question of Regulation was unequivocal and clear at that point in time that there are quote no regulatory authorities that apply to cryptocurrency exchanges like coinbase and so he asked for Congress to take action because Congress was in fact the only part of the government that was authorized to take action to put in place sensible rules um to make sure that investors and and consumers were adequately protected fast forward just a few months later after that suddenly the sec's tune changes and suddenly we now have Mr Gensler claiming that he has all the authority he needs to regulate this entire Market that with perhaps the exception of Bitcoin all of these assets qualified as Securities under the federal Securities laws enough therefore were subject to his jurisdiction and so before we knew it we suddenly found ourselves the subject of an SEC investigation a short time after that we received a formal Wells notice which put us on notice that the SEC believed we were violating the federal Securities laws even though in that notice and in the conversation surrounding it they wouldn't tell us what assets were potentially Securities what products and services gave them any specific concerns they simply said we now think you guys are violating the law and you know despite our best efforts after receiving that Wells notice a short time after that we were sued in federal district court and so that history alone I think would give any reasonable person pause as to why the SEC would suddenly change its tune after having exhaustively examined coinbase's business and made repeated public statements by the chair in front of Congress that there is no Authority that applies to coinbase or other cryptocurrency exchanges but it's even worse than that because even though we saw these dark storm clouds gathering on the horizon and the sudden change in mood in mind at the SEC we tried to get rules in place that would allow us to list digital asset Securities and that recognize that the current landscape was far too uncertain and far too unclear for anyone to tolerate and so as a result in July of 2021 in the middle of all this we filed a formal petition for rule making we asked the SEC something like 50 questions that we thought needed to be answered in order for there to be a way for coinbase and other cryptocurrency exchanges to register we wanted to register we wanted rules but there needed to be standards set out in a thoughtful methodical way so that everybody could understand what the landscape was that petition was followed by no less than 30 separate engagements that we had conversations in-person meetings I I was almost to the point of sending smoke signals you know any any way we could get in front of the SEC to lay out our ideas uh for a sensible path to registration and Regulation and more importantly get their ideas in return on what we needed to do nothing Instead at the end of that process the response was simply thank you very much Mr greywall for your time and a short while after that we were hit with the wells list so it's a very difficult timeline and sequence of events to understand and yeah I think what has been remarkable to me above all other things throughout this entire process is that at no point in time has the SEC ever say do you know what let's have a real conversation let's have a real dialogue and in fact things got so bad even before we were sued by the SEC that coinbase actually brought a case of its own this was a case we filed in the third Circuit Court of Appeals in which we asked the court to Simply order as the SEC to provide a yes or no answer to our very basic yes or no question that we posed in our rulemaking petition was can we get sensible rules for crypto or not and remarkably the SEC uh responded by saying we're working we'll get back to you judge in due course and the court said no no no no it doesn't work that way you may be able to play that way with companies like coinbase and others out in the marketplace but this is a United States Court you're going to answer our questions and so that that case remains pending it's a complicated uh legal landscape there are lots of losses playing around but the core issue across all of these is why won't the SEC just tell all of us what the rules are we want sensible rules we want to comply I work with people in crypto and all sorts of organizations in these every single day I have yet to meet someone who acting in good faith is trying to Skirt the Rules or avoid responsibility we just need to know what it is we are expected to do and I guarantee you this industry will do it but so far that hasn't happened well actually what what do you think the reason they have this change of heart was again now I have to just back into your mind of the of the SEC speculation yeah yeah I can tell a certain theme is emerging look I I I think we have to be a very um clear-eyed about what happened between the day we were allowed to list as a public company and the day we were sued FDX app number one and it wasn't just that there was this calamitous event for the industry or that investors and and consumers were harmed it was that the chair of the SEC himself was actively involved right how many meetings did Mr Gensler have with Mr bankman freed over this period of time when he refused an in-person meeting with our CEO how many times did he communicate back and forth with representatives of FTX when we were told sorry we have nothing to say to you even though for 30 it's 30 separate engagements you presented ideas on how to register so um I can't prove but I think it was there but so between Jay Clayton's SEC and Gary genzer's SEC was there also a change in Attitude for the SEC tour coinbase well look there's no question that as administrations change attitudes change priorities change and look elections have consequences I think we all have to recognize that you can make the argument that actually um very little actually changed specifically when the new Administration came in because of course it was Mr Clayton's SEC that approved the lawsuit against Ripple right that wasn't that wasn't Gary Gensler it was Mr Gensler who chose to pursue that case but there was at least that consistency I think what happened here was that FTX proved to be an embarrassment for the commission there there was a political reaction to that um Fraud and Abuse and unfortunately not just for coinbase but for many others in the industry the rest of us are paying the price for that in ways that continue to this day so one thing that's you know as a chief legal officer I think you said I was a chief legalese depending on where your where your station um one of the things that's unique about the way that you guys are approaching this case is in your approach to publicity and I imagine uh you sort of alluded this earlier that you guys are breaking a lot of the rules that uh what is generally advised to do when interacting with one's own regulator those are the only rules I'm willing to even consider breaking okay fair enough fair enough um so I'd love to get an understanding I mean you guys started this well I don't know I don't know interesting you guys Brian Armstrong I think started this very early with I believe it was the uh the earn product where he kind of you know went out on Twitter everybody said hey I think the SEC is up to something weird like well I don't know what's going on here and that attitude of uh let's say you kind of uh very public and transparent defiance I would say has continued to characterize a relationship with the SEC how do you think about that strategically because I will say that although I've seen a lot of public criticism especially from other lawyers saying that they think that this is stupid or ill-advised or whatever it does seem to be working well I I appreciate that and and I can understand why many lawyers May sort of shake their head at our approach because this is an approach that is exactly the opposite of what you are taught as a baby lawyer and and and as you confront situations like this look the typical legal response in any lawsuit let alone a lawsuit with your major regulator is to go close shut the door hide issue a bunch of no comment responses to questions and keep the public including your own customers entirely in the dark as to how things are going we decided very early on and I say we but I really mean Brian Armstrong our CEO that we were going to take a very different approach for the simple reason that it's just much more in line with who coinbase is as a company or values and frankly uh strategically what we thought was the most effective way to make sure that uh the public at large understood what its government was doing in its name right let's not forget the United States government works for the United States people it's not the other way around and so we thought it was very important for people whether they were pro-crypto anti-crypto or somewhere in between to understand what was going on in all of this the other thing I'll just say um I I certainly don't relish the opportunity or the need to defy the SEC or any other regulator in this country we have a tremendous respect for the rule of law here at coinbase and I would suggest that we actually aren't defying the SEC writ large even as we find ourselves in court with the commission we are actively engaged in conversations on a whole host of other issues that go beyond the issues of our lawsuit and that's because we want rules we want regulation I want standards in place to keep all American investors and consumers safe but it has become abundantly clear to us this really did a seed drive a strategy that um as unusual and frankly uncomfortable as it might be it would it is critical that we draw The Wider public into the conversation and not simply have this be a fight that takes place behind closed doors right I will say I am really glad that you mixed up our news because I do that all the time it's good to know the chief legal officer of coinbase he's just as bad as I am it's true actually one uh question kind of slightly related you know we we may have been talking about the SEC and you know their sort of Behavior but what about sort of other commissions I know you just got an fcm license if I remember correctly so how is how is how how would you compare and contrast those you know working with the cftc for instance if it's not night and day it's at least a dusk or Dawn and date I mean it's it is remarkable to me as someone who talks to regulators nearly every day across the United States government and in many states how much of an outlier the SEC is relative to other parts of our government you brought up the cftc the cftc is no slouch when it comes to regulation these are tough customers they are very very exacting in the standards they insist upon for any of the products and services that they regulate and yet and yet as you point out we've been able to have a relative leak and I would argue quite quite quite productive dialogue with them on our whole host of issues including our interest in offering Services as an fcm the legislation that is now pending in the house that would for the first time uh authorize the cftc to regulate the spot Market on four digital assets is legislation we support because again the the cftc has demonstrated it can be tough it can be strict but it can also be fair we have had our issues as a company at the state level for example with the New York DFS um and yet uh I have been personally impressed by um the quality of the conversations we've had with the New York DFS staff as well as with superintendent on a whole range of issues so to answer your question directly I really do believe the SEC is an outlier and I would even argue that among the five Commissioners because of course the SEC acts as a commission it's not just a a party of one there there is a range of approaches and a range of interest in having constructive conversations Mr Gensler I would suggest um is it is now even on his own commission true I thought the interesting thing related to that was yesterday there was syringe's nft related action settlement and they had it was the first time I saw crypto relating they had two dissents uh and like pretty public long written descends it is and I think that um you're of course referring to um commissioner Hester purse is I thought very articulate on dissent that she published with respect to that decision look coinbase I think most actors in crypto want the scammers the fraudsters the criminals pursued and prosecuted like I don't think there's any serious or credible um debate about that and I do think we all have to acknowledge it as as interested parties in this in this technology that there have been too many scammers fraudsters and criminals operating and so kudos to any agency that's taking action against that type of behavior but the priorities of the SEC have been curious to me given that um they have limited resources Mr Gensler is constantly asking the Congress for more funding more head count and perhaps he should get it but I would suggest perhaps there would be more of a willingness to authorize that additional funding if we saw the commission focusing on the Bad actors as opposed to just painting with this broad brush for some reason in ways that hurt real people in real ways so give a sense of um you know everybody in crypto is following this case obviously it's the sort of the Titanic case at the center of the industry right now in the U.S um where are we at right now you guys have been kind of going back filing sort of very well barbs the SEC you guys have been going back and forth where procedurally where are we at and what should we think of in terms of timeline uh to see movement so so in the enforcement case look the the case itself is a relatively narrow fight over the legal definition of something called an investment contract that's the type of security that um the SEC is claiming coinbase has listed in at least 12 instances that's a legal question we happen to think it's a good faith disagreement about about case law and how we tests and all that that will all get resolved in due course we are attempting haseeb to get that issue resolved sooner rather than later and that is one of the reasons why again um coinbase has taken as someone or an orthodox approach in not simply seeking to delay the proceedings or filing preliminary motions that put off you know the final Day of Reckoning we're actually pushing hard for an early resolution by the court as a matter of Law and and as quickly as the court is able to do it and we were quite pleased to see that the district judge presiding over our case agreed that these issues could be presented on early motions to answer your question directly we have now filed our motion for judgment in the case we were gratified to see incredible briefs filed by a number of other parties what are called Amicus or Friend of the Court briefs um just a short while after we filed the SEC is going to have his shot though too and the SEC will soon file its response we'll have a chance to reply and after that we may or may not have oral argument depending on what the judge wants all that tells me that no decision is going to come certainly before October we hope that a decision will come before the end of the year but that's ultimately in the trial judge dance Okay so uh I actually carry because I did it did not occur to me so I whenever I see amicus briefs filed they're always on the crypto side who is the Amicus of the SEC in this case like who's filing you're like yeah well it's not it's not as if we've seen for example in the grayscale case or in the xrp case or others a Groundswell of public support and in favor of what the SEC is doing now that said I fully expect there will be um parties that file in support of the sec's view there may be certain academics for example legal academics who may take a position on what it means to have an investment contract in the digital asset space um and you know the thing about Amicus parties is literally anybody can ask the court for permission to file a brief so perhaps there are some people out there that some crazy as a show out there well I thought I thought there are there are sort of some like consumer protection non-profits that seem to be like it's entirely possible yeah it's entirely possible um and you know from from my perspect effective and from a coinbase perspective look the more voices the better like I would rather have a process that says anybody who wants to have their say have their say than what we've seen from the SEC itself which is you know denial delay obfuscation and an insistence on a closed-door approach that keeps the public shutout you talk about um I think we're gonna get to some of the broker stuff a little bit but that was one such example where coinbase published this blog post talking about um these tax tokens and sort of potential solution to this if you could swap places with Gensler what do you think a set of rules that are fair and sort of compromising would would look like you know uh um in this scenario well with respect to a digital asset regulations yeah look I I think the number one thing we need to we need to see our rules and standards for issuer disclosures the fact of the matter is people are buying these assets and they deserve whether they're buying the assets for investment purposes consumption purposes or some other purpose altogether to understand what it is they're getting into they need to have a and deserve to understand the basic tokenomics of the project they need to understand uh who is uh sponsoring these projects what are the basic elements that will of security and compliance that will minimize the risk if not eliminate the risk of rug pulls and things of that nature we think those types of disclosures would be critically important another key element I think of any sensible regulation or or comprehensive scheme would Define for example standards for managing conflicts of interest um a coinbase happens to have already adopted these standards because we believe uh it's important for people to understand who they're trading with um who's on the other side of transactions but you know standards around that could be quite sensible um I think there could there could it should be um reasonable standards that limit or restrict um you know certain activities by different Market participants depending on the role that they're playing in a transaction you know coinbase for example doesn't have a prop trading shop I think we saw what happened in FTX when you do have prop trading going on and you don't disclose that um to your customer so these are the basic building blocks we think could go a long way towards um defining sensible regulation in crypto this isn't that complicated it's not that hard and we're not going to get everything we want I think this is the important thing for the digital asset Community to understand when you ask for rules it doesn't mean you get the rules you want you get rules and we may not like some of the standards but I think the responsible actors in this space are more than willing to comply with whatever the SEC or congress teams appropriate it's the lack of any rules to lack of standards that are that I think is discouraging Innovation and sending a lot of very promising projects countries outside of the United States we've seen it happen every day so I mean this this case I don't know how much you guys feel it but this case more or less has the industry riding on its back right this is probably the most Monumental case for how crypto is going to be treated in the U.S for the foreseeable future I guess my question to you is how do you guys think about what happens if you lose yeah well let me just say on on the significance of the case uh to to others that go beyond coinbase like we understand that we take that responsibility very seriously uh it's something that I think about each and every day this is not just about coinbase it's leaders our shareholders this is about all of us in the industry and that's one of the reasons why I've been so inspired uh by Brian Armstrong and our board in committing whatever the resources necessary to put on the absolute best case we can because so many people all over the world are counting on us to do our very best now you asked about winning and losing one of the things I think that often gets confused about how coindas is thinking about this case is that we somehow have to win it all or else we lose and certainly the SEC or at least the chair has suggested that oh if we just prove one token in one case was security it's game over that's just not true that's not true the reason it's not true is that you know our objective all along our definition of winning has been give us Clarity on what the standards are tell us what the rules are and we'll comply with them I happen to think we're going to win this case and I happen to think we're going to win across the board but if I'm wrong about that if we if we lose on a token or product or service here or there if the court does what I expect it will do and we should all expect it to do in laying out the standards and rules that underlie that decision we'll comply and others will be able to comply in a way that just isn't possible today so that's why we have been so insistent I prefer that word to defiant fair enough fair enough because we we do think that unless we are able to get clarity from the courts we're never going to be able to get it from any other part of the government right now and that's why we'd like to just see a decision rendered rather than cut some deal with the SEC in back room that doesn't provide Clarity for the industries all well I do I do have to say it's been inspiring to see you guys do this in such a public way in a way that also brings the rest of the industry and although it's happening you know a lot of these cases they do kind of happen behind closed doors there's a lot of opacity into what's really going on and uh just seeing you kind of give the play-by-play of every step in this case has been an education for for us who are following along and don't necessarily understand all the details but kind of get the get the idea of what's happening on stage I appreciate that and and you brought the fact that so many cases do seem to just resolve quietly the reality is that 90 plus percent of the cases the SEC brings I could be off by a decimal point but I don't think I am they settle there's no there's no there's no court hearing there's no public trial and so in the SEC and others like to point out that well you know in in a huge percentage of cases the agency is proven right no they're not well the only thing that's been proven is that a United States government agency with vast resources is able to drop the threat of years of litigation on a lot of parties that aren't in a coin-based uh position and have no choice but to settle on whatever terms are presented to them so um again Brian our board uh have been very clear uh because we have the resources here um to present a a anonymity credible but we think successful defense in many ways it's our responsibility to do that even though um I'll confess there are moments uh perhaps dark moments in the middle of night when I think you know what maybe we should think about cutting some deal and then I wake up and I realize that would be the terrible thing well I'm glad to do that because I enjoy if nothing else suspectable is maybe the industry collapses in on itself um so the other the other story that took place last week I'd love to get your take on share my new treasury proposed regulations for crypto so we kind of had inklings of this in the bill that was you know circulating a while back about this expansive definition especially of Brokers and the idea there's a big fight in the industry about this of like hey you got a crafting language to the bill to exclude a lot of the things that we think of as being wallets or decentralized interfaces that shouldn't necessarily have the kind of responsibilities that a normal broker would have like for example KY seeing all their users um so if you when you think about like a metamask or uniswap is it incumbent on the developers of metamask or the developers of uniswap to make sure that they know everybody who's training on there that they send tax forms to uh the IRS that they keep track of your cost basis they do all this sort of tracking that obviously would basically make defy and a lot of the kind of end wallet interfaces basically unusable for Americans because compliance would be insane so by the way I I maybe should have said this uh earlier in this episode I apologize to any non-american listeners to this episode of the podcast this show might not this show is like that's all red white and blue yes although that's it I mean at this point it is the thing that is moving the market the most so wherever you are in the world this is what you are paying attention I I agree I'm just pointing out to the uh you know sometimes it's one piece of feedback I've gotten from people who are who are listeners who are non-american is like anytime we get in regulatory bubbles they just don't listen well I will say I do not apologize I do not give one it's August right so the Europeans are still on vacation so they're probably not even listening and then actually to your point is even I think even more fair when you consider that all of this discussion just highlights what an anomaly we as a country are yeah unfair to the rest of the world true you're not seeing these same types of silly fights over jurisdiction and definitions in many other parts of the of the world right so these these Treasury regulations uh obviously they're not instantiating yet and there's still comment period and fighting or whatever so I guess the first question is help us understand are are we screwed uh do we have the ability to intercede here and like how to be like yo this is impossible how scared should we be I don't know if we're yet screwed but I think we all need to take uh these uh announced rules very very seriously look for those who haven't been paying his careful attention what we saw last week coming out of the treasury in the IRS was among other things a definition of what it means to be a broke and that that that qualification as a broker is what triggers a whole host of other reporting and and verification and validation requirements that are are quite serious and quite onerous I think there's no question that we want to see Full tax compliance when it comes to crypto again sensible rules are long overdue parties and participants that are in a reasonable position to report transaction activity should and so you know I don't think that's a principle that um I certainly take issue with the problem though is this definition that came out was so sweepy so expansive that many other many other parties involved in a crypto transaction that are no position whatsoever to even understand who who who the individuals or entities may be on on either side of a trade who have no resources in place to uh regularly update the IRS they could be impacted and implicated in ways that are very serious so um I do think that there's still time to turn this around again I don't want to I don't want to sound the alarm completely on this but we all need to do that we all need to lend our voice to this discussion and debate because it's very clear that what we're seeing with these rules is very much in line with what we're seeing with respect to other parts of the regulatory state in the United States which is an attempt to contain and constrain crypto in lots of different ways that ultimately make it unpalatable uh to to operate here in the United States that's the thing I think the concern that we all have above all others but how responsive is treasury right like what what exactly can one do yeah those are mine so well anytime there's an interim rule or a proposed rule um announced anyone literally anyone you you guys me uh other companies other projects anyone can submit comments um that I that explain why the proposal doesn't work or would be counterproductive or frankly it's just unfair and even Un-American you're allowed to make those points as a as a participant in this space and you may Wonder see like does does does a bureaucratic treasury care what any one of us says in some comment letter that we might file and the short answer answer is they actually do they actually have the reason for this is that by law they have to consider those comments before rendering a final rule or final decision and if they fail to do that if there are credible arguments made as to why the definition of broker is unworkable or inconsistent with the statutes that govern this area of the law if they fail to do any of that that failure can be challenged in court and in fact that's analogous to what coinbase has done in bringing its challenge against the SEC right we have basically said with all respect to the court this agency has not followed the standards um that had been set out by Congress when it reviews these types of applications or proposes these types of standards and they haven't considered the comments that have been made publicly through a formal process in a way that they are obligated to do so it can feel a bit process heavy and formalistic but there actually is I think an important role for the industry and individuals to play in getting these rules corrected one very dumb question as a non-policy maker but when say like treasury makes these rules do they ever have to prove any provenance like hey this is actually the source that we these sources we talk to to try to understand like why we chose this I only I feel like I I don't read the whole things I read like whatever Snippets that I understand and it sort of seems like they don't give any any provenance to like why they chose and I feel like the common system is like a post talk way to dot tape that on but like is there any sort of well there there there's no question that this is a political process and again elections have consequences the fact of the matter is that any Administration and any agency operating in an Administration has the right to consider um the priorities that have been handed to it um by the White House and and by ultimately by the president and um select those you know sources of input that it it believes are most credible or or most aligned with its values and Views that said what any what an agency cannot do is simply ignore the record that's been presented to it before it makes a final decision and that's why it is a bit post hoc I grant you that um it can feel a bit um it can feel a bit over stylized or over or or or over constructed to submit papers with letter you know in the form of comment letters and lay out why the proposed rule is wrong but it does make a difference but you actually mail them letters on their website yeah it is online as of a few years ago I will tell you I I was using the US mail and even a fax machine for these things not so long ago so we're making some progress it's good and it does feel a little bit like a very slow Steamroller where these proposed you know treasury changes are coming down for a while now people making comments saying this doesn't make sense and I feel like really the only change we got is sort of a carve out for like miners or validators where like yeah if you're a validator you probably can't kyc everyone who's submitting you a transaction it I don't know I mean how effective are the comments if like this is kind of the only progress we've made from this from this thing so far well it's true I mean I always try to see you know the small ray of sunshine on a very cloudy day at least for certain Miners and validators they were thrown up a bone but as you point out what what the treasury gave and the IRS gave with one hand they took away and now actually but this this is a very interesting loophole because a lot of wallets are effectively becoming light clients in some sense they're participating consensus yeah and if you're doing data availability sampling you're actually like participating in consensus technically so does that make can I make my wallet a validator no I mean that would be that is like a technical way around literally or not I think there's tons of ways around it though I like I think the definition like the broker was something about like actually transmitting user preferences about trading and so if you have a a node that's doing that or if you have a wallet that's doing that as far as I can tell the two are basically identical turning off are a very but here's my big problem with among many with this this proposal right for a project that may consist of only two guys sitting in an apartment trying to figure out you know how to stay on the right side of the rules why on Earth are we pushing them to have to sort of work through these workarounds and come up with these you know clever solves when what we should want is for them to follow the rule and then build great technology because other than that complicated in heart and so I actually think sometimes when it comes to these administrative rules or agency rules we Overlook the real costs the real tax that comes from them which isn't the rule itself it's the you know the cognitive energy that that gets wasted on workarounds and and solutions when you know a clear rule would solve this problem in the first instance it also just doesn't feel very effective I'm always reminded like gdpr and every time just clicking on a million cookie pop-ups every single day as if it is actually protecting my my privacy and it feels like even in in this scenario you know the industry can can find ways to work around this right oh I can't have my own front end cool we'll you know throw it on chain and you serve the blob locally or you run legal software or something like that or it just it feels like kind of the trend here is and even even with the keys you guys are facing is you know we have these these laws they're kind of old it turns out it's sort of like the meme it's like it's not the one thing it's not the second thing but it's actually a third different kind of thing um and we don't really have any like language or any any sort of laws around this sort of third thing as we try to wedge it into one of the other two buckets and like it just doesn't fit no I I couldn't agree more and look when I get perplexed or challenged right in Reading one of these proposals I often just ask myself like wait a minute how does this actually protect investors how does this actually keep consumers safe and if I can't answer that question then I think you have to ask a more fundamental question why are we doing this in the first place and I think in this particular instance there there has been such a poor job done explaining how this actually protects the market or at the very least leads to Greater compliance with the tax laws let's start with that right I haven't seen that I haven't worked my way through all several hundred pages of The Proposal yet but at least in those parts they have managed to get through I haven't seen any real disc discussion of how sweeping so broadly in this manner actually leads to Greater compliance I just don't think it will well actually this brings us to our last important topic which is tornado cash because I think a lot of these rules are made are sort of like you know they miss the whack-a-mole so they like tried to to put a big Band-Aid over the whole thing yeah so in some ways this sort of feels like it's a response to something like tornado cat maybe I I'm curious whether there was coordination but I I somewhat doubt it because this has been in the works for so long but the tornado cash update was so basically um uh Roman storm who was one of the co-founders tornado cash who was based in the U.S was arrested uh and basically he was brought in on money laundering and what was the other charge conspiracy you considered as a broad conspiracy conspiracy yeah um and so so I think this took the industry by surprise given that it's been I think all the year and a half now since the sanctions came down uh there was a second set of sanctions that also came down on one of the other co-founders as well as other contracts within the train of cash ecosystem but basically uh it was pretty squarely blamed on the trainer cash team for knowingly allowing North Korea to use tornado cash basically at the time of the rodent hack so we're running hacked was widely known it was hacked by the Lazarus Group which is backed by North Korea and they use trailer cash to launder some of their funds and so I think the the indictment itself didn't really reveal a whole lot that we didn't already know it was basically facts that I don't think would surprise anybody who was paying attention but it seems that this seems to be a very important case for the doj and they came out very forcefully saying that like yo we got the bad guys uh and the industry I think has been up in arms about not just the sanctioning now of tomato cache but also the criminalization of the people who built the protocol in the first place I'm curious to get your thoughts on again you guys back to the case that also recently saw a denial from a judge about this we have backed a civil case and I'm happy to talk a bit about that we continue to back that case look I want to start off by saying I have a tremendous amount of respect for the Department of Justice and I think every right thinking American recognizes that we have a serious problem with North Korea and its efforts to infiltrate our financial system period end stop my problem with this case is it just is dead wrong on the wall and let me explain why I think that is so look what was so unusual about this case is that it was an indictment that essentially charged the defendants with knowing about the risk of North Korean hacking and allowing software that they had already written to remain unaltered despite that risk from North Korean hackers that's an extraordinary extension of the law right and let's put aside for the moment the notion that um individuals who initially wrote software were in any kind of position to alter smart contracts you guys are more of the experts on this than I am at the last time I checked that's not entirely plausible a little scenario in particular there was it was impossible exactly let's call it for what it is so so you you now have a situation where having having a charged in a Federal Criminal Case individuals with essentially failing to intervene with soft or or interact with software that they had once written but could not interact with anymore it just doesn't make any sense and even if that weren't true just a common sense level um you have something else I think that's very um unsettling I don't want to scare anybody but this is another very um important case for all of us to pay attention to fin said the part of the Treasury Department that is responsible for our sanctions programs is a very um uh thoughtful expert part of the United States government we have great relationships with our friends at fincen I know that may be upsetting to some of your listeners but I have a lot of respect for for many of the of the people who work there again though um what happened here was quite disturbing several years ago they put out specific guidance on this very question of when can you hold accountable intermediaries or individuals and responsible for for writing and promulgating software and what did they say they said you can't you're fine and you should take comfort from our assurances said Vincent to the world that you will not be held responsible um uh if someone chooses to take this neutral tool and use it for illicit purposes now that was fincen several years ago speaking to civil liability that is the liability under our civil laws uh in ways that could lead to fines and punishments uh but not jail time so for the Department of Justice to now come and say forget about civil liability we're going to hold you criminally responsible and you're gonna go to jail and we're not talking about some country club Workforce we're talking about real federal prison if and when you are convicted is extremely unsettling I would say even disturbing and particularly when it misconstrues the fundamental question what it means to to transmit money right what role software developers play in the transmission of funds I think this is something that's going to be um very very important and at the same time I continue to have Hope and Faith in our court system no one's been convicted of anything yet these are simply charges um I'm heartened to see that at least one of the defendants is represented by very competent criminal defense counsel and so I'm hopeful that a very rigorous and vigorous defense is going to be mounted but nevertheless we all need to be paying attention yeah actually a slight tangent but related to your your uh kind of point about our listeners maybe not liking the fin something I have this very I have a funny anecdote because I was on uh uh I was at the Union Station in Washington DC waiting for an Amtrak train and this guy comes up to me is like hey I know you from this podcast uh and I was like okay cool uh what do you do what and he was like I work at the doj and so so maybe maybe uh maybe maybe our doj uh leaning listeners well I'd welcome an explanation uh from from from your listeners anyone else and of course we will eventually get that explanation because now that they're in front of a judge they're going to have to lay out exactly how uh it squares up the law and common sense to hold these individuals accountable look we don't know all the facts in this case I think that's also something to bear in mind documents may be revealed other evidence may come to light that suggest that there's more to this legal Theory than I can see at this point but for now it's it's impossible for me to square the dosa's decision to charge these individuals with what fincen said was perfectly fine just a few years ago is there is there any like National Security redaction that can happen in these indictments like if say because North Korea is involved I feel like I could imagine possibly some like possible yeah we could see that now there are very complicated rules that would apply in the event that the government invoked a national security exception to its General obligation to tell not just the defendant but the public at large what evidence it's relying upon but I think that for their part the defendants have a real case here to Mount and you know again the problem or challenge is that I cannot address to make the stress and burden of Defending yourself against the United States government in a criminal case and in many instances people plead out or take a deal simply to get it over with and get on with the rest of their life I don't know whether that will happen here or not but I do think that we would all benefit if the the government were put to its bases and forced to actually lay out some of these answers to these basic questions that we're all asking yeah the the saying goes uh the process is the punishment and this kind of thing is going to drag out for so many years good um it very well could yeah very well could yeah it's it's it's awful to see and it feels um you know the last time that we had a criminal prosecution with North Korea involved was Virgil Griffith which felt like a very different kind I was like okay that's somebody who did something very stupid the situation with the tornado cash team the idea that they could have interceded and shut off tornado cash I mean you know he was he was brought to jail cash is still running it's frontal today it's exactly exactly despite the sanctions despite you know criminalizing whoever was responsible for it obviously they're not doing anything now and it still goes which kind of goes to the heart of the the point and this also goes to the heart of the case that we're backing turn that you mentioned earlier um in a separate yeah true by the end of the show oh my gosh I'm gonna have to turn in my brown card so so the Paul is a little too easy I do easy you nailed it nailed it gotten lucky there no look I think in the civil case you've got um an equally concerning Theory being pushed by the government now the trial judge in the case that we are backing did agree with the treasury so we all have to acknowledge that at least one judge has said the treasury got got this right enough um the the issue in that case is the designation of tornado cash itself as a sanctioned entity and what the plaintiffs in that case have pointed out is that normally we don't think of code as an individual or entity that's subject to designation another under U.S sanctions lost normally if you have Bad actors doing bad things you're sanctioning and designate the Bad actors you don't label code or a project in a way that puts at risk not just the Bad actors but all sorts of other regular people including regular Americans who are using the software for perfectly legitimate reasons now that case uh will go on appeal the plaintiffs have indicated they intend to pursue an appeal to the fifth circuit we're getting a very good federal civil procedural lesson here in this podcast um in in short order um and I am confident that when a three-judge panel of that Court looks at these issues they're going to see that the trial court misconstrued the record and misapplied the law but again all of this is to say these are these are issues that impact real people we all need to be paying careful attention yeah as funny get Duncan sort of to leave leave you with thinking as a thought experiment is uh imagine that chat GPT was somewhat used to generate uh statements impersonating a government official and then a bank accepted that AML or some type of kyc request and then sent all the money of some entity to say North Korea say the Lazarus would you prosecute the the weights in chat to see it right like like are those because it's a very similar case right like it is actually you could argue that the the Gary Gensler pivoting AI is exactly to answer this I'm sure the one doj guy who's listening is loving that story there you go um next time you're on the sub on the train tracks please let me know okay all right good well so I know I know that you have a hard stop so we'll go ahead and end it here but I just want to say you're doing God's work Paul thank you um I'm glad you have such an easy name to pronounce and uh look that's it for today thanks for sharing this time with us and uh giving us thank you thank you all right thanks everybody all right
