welcome commissioners berkovitz and quintenz thanks lauren great to be working pleasure to be here let's start with each of you giving your background including your experience with and knowledge of crypto and commissioner berkovitz why don't we start with you thank you laura my involvement in commodity markets and things commodities started when i was counsel to the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations this was in the 2000s and at that time there was a lot of volatility and things going on in the energy markets uh energy commodity markets oil natural gas that senator i worked for senator carl levin was interested in getting to the bottom of there was a lot of price volatility and oil prices ended up peaking at 147 dollars a barrel in 2008. after i worked for the senate i had the privilege of being general counsel of the commodity futures trading commission during the dodd-frank years when the dodd-frank act was passed by the congress regulating the swaps markets and uh the next several years the cftc uh passed many regulations implementing that law i was in private practice uh for a number of years and in 2018 i had the privilege of uh being appointed by the president uh to one of the uh seats on the cftc uh i was appointed by president trump as one of the democratic commissioners on the cfdc a cryptocurrency has been um an increasing field uh since the well to early 2010s is when i think i i became first aware of it but in the last few years there's been a huge explosion of interest and breadth in these markets and eager to talk about those today thank you and commissioner quintens yeah thanks laura it's great to be with you always great to be with my fellow commissioners team colleague dan berkovitz i don't have nearly uh the distinguished background that dan does and i mean that very seriously he's a brilliant lawyer and uh and a wonderful addition to the commission since i've been there um uh and i'm not an attorney and uh that's actually i think um uh more rare uh than i would like it but certainly more rare than has been the case that you might expect for a markets regulator over the last number of years i started off my career on capitol hill and worked for a member of congress from columbus ohio where i'm from originally for about six and a half years and then decided to career switch and uh got an mba and decided to go into the markets uh where i joined an investment firm that was focused on the banking sector during the financial crisis so it was kind of trial by fire you know right off the bat uh but i i i learned how to to the best that i could and i think to the best that anyone can uh evaluate some of the largest and most complex financial institutions in the world um while that was going on i did uh see the evolution of cryptocurrencies um i saw them you know come into the marketplace and in the in the early 2010s i think it's um an important point to note that they did come into the marketplace uh on the heels of the financial crisis uh given the centralization uh you know of of that of the uh the stresses in the marketplace you know that led to that crisis um following my time at the investment firm i formed my own investment management company where i was involved in trading commodity derivatives on behalf of clients and i was uh interviewed and asked to join the commission in 2015 was nominated by both president obama and by president trump uh and ultimately joined the commission in august of 2017. the second part it was about cryptocurrencies i think from the commission's perspective when i was preparing for this role uh in 2015 2016 obviously i had a familiarity with with bitcoin and some of the developments in crypto but um it wasn't really front and center i think dodd-frank was front and center in terms of the how the cftc was addressing uh implementing rules to address the last crisis but very quickly after i joined the commission we were presented uh with uh two exchanges that wanted to list bitcoin futures contracts and i think that put the agency head first and front and center uh in the cryptocurrency environment yeah and to your point earlier about how bitcoin was born during the financial crisis famously the genesis block of the bitcoin blockchain does reference a headline from the times of london um about a third bank bailout so um clearly you know that was on satoshi's mind um so for the rest of the conversation let's just make sure that all the listeners um have the lay of the land here um can one of you describe what it is that the cftc's duties are when it comes to crypto or what its purview is and um maybe we'll start with you commissioner quintenz sure so so the cftc has a very broad authority uh over derivatives products um derivatives on uh on commodities uh on broad-based securities and you know the the evolution of the markets that we regulate really formed in the 1800s with and was formed without regulation and it was centered around uh hedging activity and risk transfer activity and the the core of those markets were the agricultural markets they were uh corn wheat soybeans uh and and as um uh risk management tools like futures contracts evolved to allow the participants in those markets the growers the producers the processors to trade off their risks so that they wouldn't go under if they had a bad crop or if the prices inflated way too much for them to afford and not risk manage their business now eventually the federal government decided to get more involved in regulating uh how those contracts were listed how uh who and how uh who could participate and how they could participate and ultimately in the 1970s the cftc was created to supervise derivatives markets activity as as our authorities relate more directly to uh crypto assets themselves we do have very broad-based anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority over commodity transactions uh generally i think we usually try to exercise that authority in very limited circumstances where we see overt fraud or where we see a um a significant amount of manipulation that is most that is very directly tied to the futures contracts and the derivatives markets that we regulate upon which risk managers really rely and commissioner fitz that thank you laura and i i would agree with uh everything that uh commissioner clinton's uh he's commissioner provided a an excellent summary of the evolution of the commodity markets and the reason for their existence so i just want to put up a finer point on on several of the uh things that commissioner contest mentioned first as the markets evolved from agricultural commodities uh which they were for for from the late 19th century until basically around the 1970s but in the 1970s with the the oil embargo and and coming off the gold standard they're developed financial commodities and so a commodity doesn't have to be a tangible commodity such as gold or oil or wheat or corn a commodity under the 1974 law which created the cftc can be an intangible it can be an interest rate it can be a stock index or it can be a cryptocurrency a commodity under the commodity exchange act is basically anything you can have a futures contract on currently or potentially in the future so we we've had several uh test cases recently about cryptocurrency and there's futures contracts on bitcoin uh so cryptocurrency therefore it is a commodity now excluded from our jurisdiction as commodities is securities so the sec has jurisdiction over securities and we have jurisdiction over commodities but commodities a very broad category could be tangible or intangible the instruments involving commodities that we specifically regulate uh our futures on uh contracts for future delivery their swaps and their options on commodities so all of those instruments have to be traded on regulated exchanges uh can be for a futures contract it has to be on what we call a designated contract market but that's basically a futures exchange swaps have to be traded either on a swap execution facility or a designated contract market if they reach a sufficient amount of liquidity in in in the market if you're a retail person you have to trade a swap on a futures exchange basically that's the that's the only place a retail person uh could could be able to trade a swap and as commissioner contents mentioned in addition to our regulatory authority we regulate these facilities for the trading of futures or we regulate the trading of swaps we regulated swaps intermediaries such as big banks who are swap dealers we also have anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority we can prosecute persons who commit fraud or manipulation in the spot or cash market on any exchange even if we don't regulate a spot exchange we can prosecute persons who manipulate those markets so we have both regulatory jurisdiction over derivative execution facilities um how they're executed but we also have this anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority over the commodity of transactions themselves and so i'm glad that you brought up the sec because i believe that in the crypto space that cc right now and for a while actually has been kind of the big regulator that everybody talks about um and as you mentioned kind of what tends to not fall in the sec's bucket will fall into the cftc's and there was a period uh when and this is just one example where for instance people were concerned that ether could be a security because of how it was sold in a crowd sale but eventually the sec said it was not later the cftc also said that it was a commodity and i think people are curious how that decision making happened at that time is that something that the two agencies discussed actively together to make the determination together and just in general how do the cftc and sec work when it comes to matters involving crypto yeah i'll take a first stab at that um dan you know i think yes there is a lot of interaction between the agencies when it comes to the legal status of any specific product i think we see that on the enforcement side if we see fraud of you know around a particular crypto asset the agencies have to make a determination about which agency has authority and then they look at the specifics of that asset to make that determination so that the right appropriate agency takes the lead i i do think i wasn't involved in any discussions between the agencies around the status of bitcoin or ether and whether or not they were securities but the the chair of the cftc at the time heath tarbert did come out and say it was a commodity uh i think that implied that ether was not a security and that was and that it was within the cftc's jurisdiction should futures contracts or drugs contracts be listed upon it but i do think that there should be more transparency around uh those kinds of decisions there should be more official analysis that's provided to the public i think that the um the limbo that a lot of the community finds themselves in is not productive to innovation and i think that there is a very clear path forward towards providing that clarity um and i would hope that our counterparts at the sec uh seriously consider that and and when you say that what would be that clear path forward well i think hester purse's safe harbor proposal is a brilliant proposal i think there is a there is an opinion within the cftc that products can evolve from an initial securities offering into into a commodity they can become commoditized through um you know widespread acceptance and utility that moves moves something beyond you know the ownership and control you know of a common enterprise and i think that a safe harbor like proposal can take advantage of that of that legal theory um and not unduly limit the ability of entrepreneurs and innovators uh to you know to take advantage of the blockchain space and the development in the crypto assets i think the the challenge is that if you you know rigidly applied securities laws to crypto assets that started off as securities you may prevent them from evolving into commodities so some level of a safe harbor i think makes a lot of sense uh and uh but besides commissioner purse i've i've yet to hear a lot of um a lot of additional support uh you know from the sec on that kind of concept but i think it's an important one and commissioner berkovitz what do you think of the safe harbor proposal well i think uh we we've we actually have an excellent working relationship with the the sec um and that's improved over the years and and and a large amount of improvements due to commissioner quintans i mean commissioner quintenz has been a a point person for us uh on our relations with the sec and and and uh helping um along with the chairman of the of the of the cftc and the chairman of the sec working together and so our relations are very good but fundamentally each agency in the end we will consult and we will discuss these issues but fundamentally each agency is charged by congress with protecting the markets under its jurisdiction so in terms of what is a security or what is a commodity uh our lawyers will discuss with their lawyers and and and we have we have discussions by the end of the day it's up to each agency to decide what's what's in its jurisdiction and and enforce the laws that it's that it's charged with enforcing so the sec will um determine what's a security at the at the end of the day and if it's a security it's in in in their jurisdiction i totally uh agree that uh with what uh commissioner clinton said about a a an instrument can change uh it's its nature depending on the use as as it evolves uh so in in terms of really whether the sec should grant a safe harbor or something in terms of securities law i mean i i would defer to the sec on that because they're really primarily uh charged with enforcing the securities laws i mean once it comes over on the commodity side you know we we have our we have our legal requirements and uh if people believe that there's a a way that the current regulations uh may or may not uh be suited to their particular structure um people come in and and uh as they typically do and say well here's why the cftc's regulations in our specific case should not apply and we'll we'll listen to their arguments and make a determination of potentially well we can do various things we can grant in some instances what we call no action relief on a trial basis say okay if you can't comply this way you can comply that way and we'll have a number of conditions and say okay if you if you can't meet the regulatory requirement or it's inappropriate for you to meet it by doing xyz we'll allow you to abc uh provided you do d e and f also and give us assurance that the intent of the regulation is being met and we you know we issue let's say 100 something no action letters a year uh with various uh entities coming in or potentially people can petition for a change in rule making which admittedly is harder so we we we do have some flexibility uh and we exercise that flexibility um you know numerous times each year so it's not it's not our regulatory structure is not so rigid that we demand everybody do everything in a cookie-cutter approach at this point maybe it's perhaps worthwhile to mention overarching our philos our regulatory philosophy is what we call principal space the statute says here are the principles and here's the standards that that we expect ucftc to hold the market participants to and it's called principles-based regulation the statute for example a future exchange there's i think it's about 20 what we call core principles the futures exchange it has to be able to uh ensure that there's not manipulation you have to post the prices you have to ensure the financial integrity of transactions you have to be able to operate your facility and have redundancy so if there's a storm and there's an outage or a disruption you can continue operations you have to be secure against cyber threats these general general objectives and we we fill in a lot of the details on that and say here's here's how to do it but fundamentally you know there's those 20 principles you have to meet and we give the exchanges considerable leeway and and how and how how they meet it um now there are some times we do get very specific it's we say thou must doubt do x in certain circumstances but it's really a principles-based approach so if if entities in the marketplace seeking additional flexibility as to different ways to meet the regulations our system and our regulatory structure can accommodate that um so earlier you talked about how the focus at the cftc has been on fraud and other kinds of obvious bad behavior there was a civil case that the cftc brought against bitmex and its owners and at the same time the department of justice also brought a criminal case against them for violating and conspiring to violate the bank secrecy act by willfully failing to establish implement and maintain an adequate anti-money laundering program and each count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and there are some legal observers who say that these charges are unprecedented since there aren't allegations of specific criminal activity such as fraud or credit card theft or terrorist financing and they compare this to some cases where banks admitted such as hsbc admitted to actual money laundering and the justice department did not indict the bankrupt officials so you know i think some crypto observers do believe that this case shows a double standard uh what is your take on that the the uh bitmex case uh is a is a is being prosecuted by several several agencies the cftc we have a complaint regarding violations of the commodity exchange act as well as the bank secrecy act civil violation so we we prosecute the civil violations and with respect to bit mix the complaint lays out a number of issues of selling swaps without registering as a swap execution facility selling uh providing leverage for transactions without registering as a futures commission merchant i believe trading futures contracts without registering as a designated contract market or a futures exchange and violations of the civil violations the bank secrecy act and so i we we laid out the facts in the in in the complaint and uh obviously as a stand by the complaint that that we issued is as a well-founded complaint uh in terms of the criminal prosecution that's up to that really the department of justice and and whether it meets the standards for criminal prosecution uh uh so i mean i i believe the department of justice has an extreme amount of integrity in there in their prosecutions and that it meets the the appropriate standards for bringing a a criminal prosecution so there's there's um i believe all the all the actions uh that the federal government this matter uh have brought are are well founded and commissioner quintons yeah i can't talk about the bitmas uh bitmex case specifically um but i think i think it's important to to to contrast what a centralized you know entity that is seeking to list products that are directly in the commission's jurisdiction uh and in doing that uh in a way that contravenes um or completely ignores our rules for you know entities engaged in that kind of behavior with what we're seeing in the d5 space where um where protocols you know through decentralization are offering um you know innovation and opportunities outside of an intermediated uh you know functional marketplace um that that is a that is a new paradigm of a market that our law and our rules were not designed to comprehend um and so i i i i view them uh as as somewhat different and uh maybe we'll you know explore some of this but um i i i think in cases like the one you mentioned there is a centralized entity that flaunted our rules benefited themselves in doing so and i think it's reasonable to expect that in doing in accessing us customers i think the agency has you know a lot of jurisdiction to bring a case there and so we will get into d5 there's so much to discuss there but um before we move on to that i do want to ask a little bit more about derivatives because uh that is what was offered on bit max and it's just one of the most popular areas of crypto and also uh it's a very popular financial instrument in the traditional financial world and um in the u.s derivatives are regulated by the cftc but there's no formal regulatory framework for crypto derivatives exchanges so when could we expect such rules and regulations from the cftc and what would that framework look like so i'm i uh i guess when you say there's no formal you know regime or regulation for crypto derivatives exchanges i don't think our rules necessarily uh look at the products as opposed to you know whether or not they are derivatives you know just like there's no you know agriculture derivative specific um you know exchange you know set of rules or or energy derivatives specific set of rules there are you know derivative exchange sets of rules that you know uh centralized entities looking to offer contracts derivatives contracts for trading uh you know are captured by you know i i would add we we do have we do have uh licensed facilities trading crypto products we we have um we have futures contracts on bitcoin trading uh on a number of licensed exchanges um and we have event contracts uh trading uh on on exchanges uh so we we do have um we do have crypto products trading on unlicensed licensed facilities okay so maybe it's just certain types of crypto derivatives are that are popular uh not in the us are maybe not uh ones that wouldn't be allowed in the current framework the derivatives if you want to list a type of contract or derivative if you want to list a particular derivative you have a license to trade derivatives you submit what we call a product certification saying we want to trade this product and there are standards for for products traded on our facilities um that the exchange will submit a product certification um to the cftc and they'll either they'll either quote what we call self-certify and say this meets all your regulatory requirements or they'll say you know this is a new different type of product we'd like you to actually approve this product before we list it so they can either self-certify or ask us to approve the product so if you're licensed to license futures exchange or swap execution facility and you want to trade a novel type of crypto product that nobody else is trading um you can you know you you apply for a product certification um now if if you're not approved as a licensed exchange and you want to trade that product in the u.s you have to get approval to be a licensed exchange so the first step is becoming an approved exchange but once you're an approved exchange uh there's uh and you want to do a new product uh it's it's a it's a product approval process and so let me give you one of the oh no i'm sorry i was just gonna i'm just gonna try to add to that and maybe take a step back which is that i think a lot of the conversation around crypto derivatives um overseas really involves leverage and leverage considerations and and how much leverage uh different exchanges and different you know different exchanges can offer and different clients can get um and i think we we saw recently uh in exchange talk about that and and decide to start to self-limit the amount of leverage it was going to going to provide you know as as we look back in the us at the evolution of the derivatives markets there was a reason why given the technology available at the time we had intermediaries develop which was because it made no sense from risk management perspective to um you know pre-purchase or or completely pre-sell a commodity because then it's just a pre-sale that's not a risk management feature risk management feature would you know allow for some limited amount of risk to be taken with the cash flows you know on top of that so you know a derivatives contract could have um you know a 10 amount of margin that you'd have to put up you know as uh as collateral basically um that that shows you're going to make good on the payments uh of that contract because of the involvement of leverage in risk management and in futures contracts we have you know clearing houses that develops to trade to take both sides you know of a trade so that if one party defaulted the clearinghouse could stand in the middle and make sure the other party was made good so that their risk management process wasn't impeded and then as you know futures contracts proliferated and expanded to you know more potential clients we have intermediaries that come in to service those clients and provide an extra layer of protection for the clearing houses so that uh you know there's extra margin put into the to the uh the what we call fcms but think of them as kind of commodity derivative brokers and then the fcms put an extra capital to the clearinghouses so that you know if there's a waterfall effect hopefully there's a set of resources there to ensure that contracts can continue to be made whole from the defaulting party so because of that the agency doesn't necessarily approve margin models but has a set of standards by which it looks at margin models for exchanges that needs to meet a certain set of mathematical criteria to try to prevent defaults from occurring and i think some of those rules would would probably preclude the extremes amount of leverage extreme amount of leverage that we see overseas that when offered to us clients would conflict with our regulations and if i if i could just just add again another point on this um historically we have seen with retail currency transactions the predecessor for the reason we're so concerned about it or one of the reasons we're so concerned about these leveraged transactions is with respect to foreign currency the leveraged foreign currency transactions now not preceding you know cryptocurrency is one of the highest most the most fraud prone areas in our jurisdiction it's it's a lot of fraud um has occurred in in the retail uh foreign currency space and because of that congress specifically gave the cftc jurisdiction over these leveraged retail foreign currency transactions and then added to that in the dodd-frank act this same jurisdiction over retail commodity transactions it's selling these retail products products to retail consumers with high amounts of leverage you put a thousand dollars down you can get a hundred thousand dollars worth of exposure at 101 leverage or something like that this was an area where a lot of a lot of retail people were not sophisticated and they're promised a great opportunity to get get rich very quickly so historically i'm not there's obviously many many upstanding actors in the space but historically it's been an area of rife with fraud so as we see the see it move into the cryptocurrency space that that's of concern to us yeah and just to be clear for listeners the two exchanges that did limit their leverage recently were ftx and binance um but both said that very very very few customers ever used more than 20x leverage so the max now is 20x on both exchanges um okay so in a moment we're going to talk about d5 and how that relates to the cftc's purview but first a

with cftc commissioners dan berkovitz and brian quintenz so the cftc regulations are almost based on a policy of mandatory intermediation in a way and um what that means is that for certain transactions falling into certain categories they're required to take place only on a cfdc regulated exchange which you know basically forces this intermediation which is obviously antithetical to d5 so d5 transactions can kind of get similar results to some commodities transactions for instance you can create a collateralized debt position on maker dow and use that to mint die which is a stable coin pegged to the us dollar which you can then use to buy more ether which is basically providing yourself more leverage um but this happens through these peer-to-peer protocols and um so there's no kind of like traditional counterparty that you know as as you would traditionally define it and so some of these cftc regulations in a way are you know they're they're made for a different world than than defy and i wanted to get your thoughts on how the cotc would regulate this type of activity if at all let me let me start off on on this one um so our regulations i think it's it's fair to say and it's accurate to say that our regulations really are based on an intermediation model they don't necessarily mandate it in every instance but when all these regulations were being written they were based on exchange-traded models or broker intermediate models and so many of the regulations are are centered around and assume the presence of of intermediaries ultimately many of these defy applications um they're very innovative uh they uh approach the market in a different way say maybe we we we don't need the intermediaries for everything that they're doing and there there's additional friction and and cost and we could be more efficient and speedier without the intermediaries and and they accomplished that in in a number of respects so the difficulty and the challenge is when you take out an intermediary from some of the functions in a regulatory system that presupposes their existence how how do those two systems mesh and that's that's that's that's a question um that really defy poses to the regulators into the marketplace that doesn't mean that there that uh you could totally do without all intermediation or the functions that the intermediaries do in terms of in terms of what they do for example intermediaries the the the exchanges not only um match up parties which in a d5 protocol you can do without the exchange but they also have a surveillance obligation and an affirmative obligation to to make sure that the markets are free from fraud or or manipulation they also uh basically a clearinghouse and a futures model a clearinghouse standby stands behind the trade so if one party somehow defaults then um the clearinghouse will make it up now you could say in the d5 protocol well there's an automatic liquidity provider that will liquidate the contracts before you get to default and that that may be and and if you don't need a clearinghouse um that that's an interesting uh development that you know we certainly could look at so there's some functions i think you could do uh a better uh uh without an intermediary but some an intermediate intermediary may be necessary and the question is can you do it totally without intermediaries many of the uh ensuring the integrity of the code uh explaining to the retail persons how this system works uh there's it's not everybody can go on and and and all of a sudden analyze the code and figure out that the code is appropriate and we have presumably if there's retail people on there they'll need somebody to say yeah this is a good code yes you can trust the system so i think we do we do have a challenge with defy in in terms of how to how to fit this new technology within our within the regulatory structure but as currently exists the regulatory structure does impose obligations not just on the intermediaries but on the market participants certain obligations on the market participants themselves so taking out the intermediaries doesn't necessarily take out all the regulations that might apply to a trade in in in a derivative uh so persons operating platforms have to consider or is they even the terminology operating platforms uh persons developing platforms over developing technologies may want to consider we'll need to consider all of that and at the moment with the way that many of these d5 projects are set up who do you think is a natural entity for you to regulate for the cftc in general to regulate well that's a great that's a great question um and so when one one has to look at a number of factors and to see whether there is actual the sufficient indicia of control or intermediation of fine who's financing it who's making the decisions um is somebody benefiting by it by financial financially is there really an organization behind this uh how decentralized or centralized is it and it can be very factual specific and it's an evolving area so we're looking carefully at a number of these things it's it's different different facilities uh and different protocols seem to have different degrees of centralization or decentralization and i think it's a it's uh some of these present very interesting questions for us and earlier when you said that you're you you also regulate the market participants does that mean that the cftc would consider enforcement actions against market participants traditionally and this is one benefit of intermediation traditionally um in and if you've seen this in our enforcement actions uh to date in in the space where we have gone after uh uh we have filed complaints and then taken enforcement actions against if somebody is operating in exchange and it's not registered or basically as a broker as a futures commission merchant without being registered our enforcement actions have been directed against those persons not against the transactions that have taken place on an unregistered facility but a transaction taken a futures transaction that's not taken place not does not take place on a futures exchange is unlawful under the commodity exchange act but we haven't gone after the end users we haven't gone after the market participants traditionally so our focus traditionally has been on the the entities uh who should have been intermediaries in those circumstances but if for example let's take oil oil market um if one were to trade on a d5 platform an oil contract and you might have a market participant who decides i'd rather trade on an unregulated platform then on a regulated platform you know that that would present a more difficult question for us whether you know if somebody consciously decides to trade in an unregulated environment to avoid our regulations then somebody who may a retail person who who who may uh you know betrayed on something that somebody's offered them and they shouldn't have offered them without being unregistered so uh that's traditionally how we we've we've approached enforcement but um it doesn't you know we'll we'll would approach each case under the facts and circumstances fundamentally whether or not we take an enforcement action the contract still is is not a lawful contract under the commodity exchange act so there's a question about the basic enforceability of a contract let alone whether we take enforcement action against the parties who entered into it so you're saying like a contra just a smart contract could be illegal just on its own right correct correct so that that that's that that raises an interesting that that that's that's the the commodity exchange acts uh that for future contract to be legal it has to be traded through a regulated exchange this question about the legality of essentially futures contracts that are not traded on exchange was it was a great uh source of of debate and uh basically it led to the commodity futures modernization act when the one that going back history a little ways but history's instructive when the swaps market developed in the 1980s the question became well are swaps what's the difference between a swap contract and a futures contract i don't want to go too far down the rabbit hole here but i do want to point out the history on this and the argument that swaps contracts were no different or really futures contracts really troubled the troubled the industry in the 1990s and it really was one of the motivating factors behind the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 which provided legal certainty that swaps were would not have to be traded on futures exchanges so we had a statute passed by congress told the cftc and the sec you can't regulate swaps they're legal if they're not illegal futures contracts basically and then that caused a whole bunch of problems in the 2000s with the leading to the financial crisis and so the swaps markets where we were regulated they're not futures contract swaps are not futures but the legal uncertainty over a contract that's essentially a futures contract that's not traded on a futures exchange was was very very significant financial institutions were very very concerned about what what do i have then if i have a futures contract that's not not traded on the futures exchange so at best at best there's legal uncertainty but i also think there's a strong argument the commodity exchange act says it shall be unlawful to enter into a contract unless it's on a futures contract unless it's on a registered uh futures exchange well then how does this square and and you know maybe this is just an opinion but i think there is a view that software development is like an expression of free speech and so is that something that you would say can be regulated by the cotc simply creating a smart contract well the the it's not the creation it's it's the the development of the software is is is one issue but somebody who enters into a a transaction purporting to be a futures transaction what is it is that a contract if you're going to call it a smart contract the question is if it's if it's purporting to be a futures contract is it an enforceable contract what rights do you have if you enter into that to get the money you're promised it might be just a bunch of code that that says here's how this code is going to execute but if it doesn't execute as it promised if there's some electrical problem or or or it's misrepresented or it has some trick in it or there if somehow you don't get the money that you think you're going to get what can you do now in in our in our futures world in in the regulated world you have a a very very high degree of certainty because there's multiple intermediaries in the regulatory system and there's a legal system backing you up that you are going to get your money uh if you provided you know you're you're entitled to it because it's a legal contract if you don't have a legal contract you don't you don't have a legal contract now does that mean we're going to prosecute the drafters of the contract those are two separate those are two separate questions prosecuting the drafters of the contract or the basic legality of the instrument that somebody's purporting to enter into so apart whether we prosecute people the contract itself may be you know not not a contract that would be recognized in any court of law as something that could be enforced which i think would be a problem for people who think that you know you may have a high degree of confidence in the code and it may work a lot but when it doesn't that's when you need the legal system that's when you need that assurance and if somebody you know somebody takes it from you steals it from you you know what what do you have you have a if it's not a legal contract if it's not binding so now i think there's issues both for enforceability and there's issues both in there's other issues in the legality of the instrument so but you said whether or not to prosecute the developer is a separate issue but is that something that you think is possible well i think we we we have this is a again this is the facts and circumstances uh a situation where it depends on on on the facts and the circumstances of what people are doing when they're developing the code and and uh it's a highly highly factual depe factually dependent okay but the way you answer that makes it sound then like again you know as you said earlier it would be more likely you would go after something more like a fraud type situation is that what you were trying to imply tradition traditionally yes traditionally that's that's what we have done correct so commissioner berkowitz we've been having this uh very interesting exchange about what the cftc does cover in d5 and um you know you did say recently in a speech that you felt d5 does not offer the benefits and protections of traditional markets because of this lack of intermediaries and then you actually said that you thought d5 from a d5 markets for derivatives are a bad idea so does that mean that you think the cftc should bring enforcement actions to shut down these many different d5 projects that exist or is there some way that participants who would like to register with cvdc could try to do so if for instance the commodity exchange act were modified in some fashion actually thank you for uh asking that lauren i just i just do want want to clarify unlicensed d5 is a bad idea i didn't say that all d5 is a bad idea but unlicensed d5 particularly without intermediaries is is a bad idea in my opinion of course if uh defy proponents operators or entities uh uh who want d5 platforms to exist want to come in to the cftc and say you know we understand that it's you have to trade futures contracts and swaps on registered facilities and we we would like our facilities to be in compliance with the atomic excuse me the commodity exchange act um uh how how can we do that uh certainly part of our mission is to support uh responsible innovation and fair competition we have other missions to uh prevent systemic risk and to ensure market integrity but we actually have a statutory responsibility to promote what responsible innovation and fair competition so innovation such as defy um as long as it's done responsibly which i i mean regulated um we we have a statutory obligation uh to to work uh to see that that can happen fair competition as well we we want we promote competition amongst not just market participants but amongst different ways of trading the instruments but it should be fair competition and by fair the regulatory playing field is level we don't have a one regulated mark in another unregulated market so absolutely uh we should work there there's advantages to d5 as i mentioned before uh if if you can conduct if you have a protocol that ensures uh some particular uh event won't happen that uh the the contract operates in such a way that uh the person's margin has to stay at a certain level that they have to have certain amount of collateral and you can show that this is hardwired into the protocol and you don't need five people in some surveillance department or five people in some back office somewhere you can do it by code fantastic great you know we we can um we can uh work to accommodate that now as we also talked about the way the regulations are written it it really was written uh in in terms of a fully intermediated a market so there may be things that we would have to work on to to accomplish that within the current regulatory structure but i believe the way to do it is to engage with us in the dialogue say how can we come into compliance we want to operate a facility uh we we have all this great innovation how can we make it work within the regulatory uh arena and uh we we'd be we'd be uh you know welcoming of that effort and that initiative and devote resources to to make it happen um we've uh very much encouraged innovation in the space and commissioner quintin's we commissioner berkovitz and i have covered a lot of material here but i did want to also get your opinion you know for the way that the the rules and regulations of the cftc are structured currently who do you think is the natural entity to regulate when it comes to many of these d5 projects well i don't think there is one and i think that's i think that's the challenge um and i think let me say that i agree with commissioner berkovitz in terms of what the law says and what our regulations say but i also want to take a step back from my own perspective and my own philosophical perspective and look at first principles which is you know how defy and the properties you know that it has and the um the the the freedom and liberty uh to transact uh in the financial marketplace how how defy encourages that and supports that how that really directly relates to an open and free and transparent financial system and i think you know we talked about how how the markets evolved over time and how our rules evolved over time to match those in order to ensure the integrity of a transaction so that you know leverage defaults didn't cascade through the system you know that is a challenge that defy is addressing uh it's doing it though in an unintermediated way through very transparent code and if if we look at you know what an ultimate free market uh you know should be it should be in it should be an environment where there are very low or zero zero barriers to entry where there is uh fierce competition for innovation and to create efficiencies and where there is open access to be able to either build or take advantage of that value those are all the things that we see in the d5 space and so you know i i i think i'm a little reluctant to put the you know the regulations as we have them today onto the d5 space and impede what i believe is a very remarkable amount of innovation that has attracted the best and brightest minds and a lot of capital and intellectual property when you know most of it is occurring uh through very transparent code that any individual can audit and that promotes an enormous amount of personal responsibility when we really start seeing um the the the significant intersection of d phi and the financial system or d phi and our legacy you know futures and derivative space and i think we're starting to see some of that but i think a lot of the innovation is occurring within its own ecosystem in d5 right now that's when i think you know the cftc hopefully we don't wait until then but that's when we really need to take a look at our rule set again and and congress needs to take a look at the law and say is that you know products are products and the legal standard for products applies to anything but we've created a law and a set of regulations around one financial system paradigm this is a completely new financial system paradigm that does have some risks but tries to solve in my view tries to solve for those risks in a transparent open way that provides a lot of access and whose principles i think match with the foundational principles of this country the thing that's going to i think that's also going to pose a challenge for the space is exactly what commissioner berkovitz had said which is that it is under our law unlawful to enter into not just offer but to enter into an off exchange derivatives contract and taking the cftc completely out of this perspe out of this out of this for a second even if the agency did nothing with regards to that kind of activity i don't think large financial institutions are going to come into the space and engage with those kinds of products because of a fear of potential liability so you know if if the d5 space really wants to um attract institutional activity that's going to be a problem that we have to kind of work to to solve to solve for if if it wants to um if it doesn't care or if certain projects don't care about institutional money or institutional um have an institutional focus then then you know maybe we'll see at what point given all of the cftc's responsibilities and given the legacy you know hundreds of trillions of dollars of derivative market activity that we do supervise and where to put d5 in that priority list in my opinion should be fairly low given what we already oversee and how interconnected that is directly to the food that we eat and the gas that we put in our cars um you know we'll we'll see at what point the cftc ends up taking action okay so it sounds like you're kind of on the side of maybe having congress update the commodity exchange act or or just somehow creating some sort of new regulatory regime that makes sense for d5 i think that's going to take a long time i think uh congress by design works very slowly unless there is a significant crisis for which it needs to respond and in that case you know i think um you know who knows what what the what the success is of the ultimate product that's produced uh but my hope would be as we see the innovation as we see the access as we see the transparency um you know take place in d5 and realize that a lot of the risks that we are solving for as regulators in the immediate intermediated space are being solved for in the d5 space already that there is a rethink of uh the of the commodity exchange act to allow for that activity to either continue to occur uh on its own or to be brought into the regulated system but to me it feels a little early to you know to engage in an overly negative way across the space given the innovation that we see in the principles that apply there so recently uniswap labs announced that it was removing certain tokens from the interface that this company this centralized company has created to access the decentralized protocol and those types of tokens were for instance tokenized stocks mirror stocks options and derivatives and of course this caused a little effort on crypto twitter and i wondered do you think that this kind of compliance and um you know uh basically these types of regulations that you know i think you're you're both kind of saying in certain regards can be outdated obviously for this new model do you think that that could drive more d5 creators and founders to either go the anonymous route or to locate in other jurisdictions thus taking those jobs to these other economies i i think we want to capture as much innovation within the united states as we can and i think that uh hopefully how we apply the law and how we apply our rules allow that innovation to expand at a rapid pace without endangering um you know the participants in it but to your point in your example i think that gets to some of my questions as i think about this space about what's the decentralized part versus the centralized part and while i think you said uniswap labs de-listed certain products the uniswap protocol as a decentralized you know uh piece of infrastructure i guess uh is still offering those because it's decentralized to me that goes to the centralized aspect versus the decentralized aspect and um the challenge that it's going to be for the the cftc to apply its rules to the decentralized area in the first place but yeah let me let me just add a couple of things one is as as both brian and i were saying that the threshold question regarding the legality of the contracts themselves as brian's noted and i totally agree it's going to be a barrier to institutional participation in these markets so whatever level of activity there may or may not be the purpose of the financial system is not just to trade crypto assets the purpose of the financial system is to provide methods for raising capital for american businesses and for risk management for american businesses and consumers so so that businesses can manage the risks of of their their uh their commercial activities so americans can have retirement and and protect their you know their assets or grow their assets and protect them in retirement and really to have a a if for defy to be a part of the mainstream uh financial system um and say mainstreaming fulfill those functions institutional participation the liquidity that institutions the large financial institutions is going to be critical and for american businesses it's going to be absolutely critical to enter in a contract so they're certain are are legal or not there's not legal question to so i think the the legality question um until that's addressed somehow it's going to be extraordinarily difficult for this industry to grow my belief is that the ones who are successful at addressing the legal issues and bringing defa into the regulatory sphere rather than the ones who are trying to figure out which best offshore jurisdiction to go to to make the most money are going to be the ones that succeed in the united states with the largest financial system and the largest market in the world we have the strongest capital formation markets we have the strongest derivative markets and a large degree it's because it's a regulatory system and people have confidence that when they put their money into it they're not going to get cheated is there cheating is there are there bernie madoff's yes okay but that's rare and people still have confidence our markets just survived the the pandemic the disruption and the volatility caused by worldwide shutdown and people have confidence in the u.s market in the u.s system and it's because of our regulations and our regulations are designed to protect investors they're not designed to protect the intermediaries they're designed to protect investors if you look at the entities in our markets today the largest entities exchanges centralized exchanges on our market cme and intercontinental cme was a disrupter cme go back 30 years ago cme was a was it was a market that was trading hogs okay and what did they do they innovated they traded financial products and they they demanded regulation they were one of the entities that supported the expansion of the cfdc's jurisdiction into financial commodities in 74 because they wanted the imperimeter and they wanted the stamp of regulation and confidence that that brings uh intercontinental exchange jeff sprecker started that as a as an unregulated exchange to trading natural gas swaps uh in in the manner that i was describing in an unregulated market and because of the concerns about the the uh integrity and and the acceptance of an unrelated market they decided they would go the regulated route and they supported the regulation of their markets they were operating an unregulated market and ice under leadership of just sprecker said we want to do regulation and look look where they are now they own the new york stock exchange so they and cme were both disruptors in their days but they want the regulated route i really believe that the entities in this market who want to succeed and who will succeed in being in adopting all these wonderful innovations and bringing it to american consumers and american businesses are the ones who are going to do it and figure out how to do it the regulated way not the ones who are going to run to the most accommodating offshore jurisdiction that has no regulatory system so i i i think that is the way to go and that's the path to success and it also sounds like you think going the anonymous route won't work because uh institutions will want to uh trade on something that has clear legality absolutely the other the other factor is that that we the interaction between these platforms and the traditional platforms we need to know the cftc needs to know who is trading on these platforms the there's cert there is transparency the blockchain is wonderful on transparency but it's but it's pseudonymous it's not you don't know who is doing it you just know which string of bits there is okay so the interaction with our regulated markets we're going to have we need to know who's doing that type of trading crypto trading uh whether somebody has a large position you can't have like in in our markets there's position limits on oil there's position limits on a lot of hard commodities we we need to know who is in these markets so for both the legal certainty reason the institutions aren't going to come in i believe until legal certainty is solved plus there's going to be have to be some acceptance of some degree of of a cftc market ability to know the identities of the traders in in these markets that affect that have could have an impact on key commodities we have to know who's trading oil we have to know who's trading cotton or wheat to ensure the integrity of these markets for american businesses all right so um we could spend so much more time talking about d5 because i did have additional questions but um before we go we do have to also cover the bitcoin etf the bitcoin community and the wider crypto community have been waiting for a bitcoin etf for some time sec commissioner hester purse recently said that a bitcoin etf should have been approved a long time ago and that its rejection uh previously shows a double standard being applied to crypto and additionally former cftc chairman timothy mossad said that he believed a bitcoin etf would be good for investors and regulators because it could improve the trading integrity on crypto exchanges what do you think about commissioner purses and former chairman mossad's remarks well i would just say we made the determination the cftc made a determination back in 2000 and maybe brian correct me if i'm wrong on the year 2016 i think to permit the bitcoin futures contract um with a number of conditions regarding um the uh integrity of the spot market in which those those prices were based so we made a determination that under our regulations under the standard in the commodity exchange act that the contract was not susceptible to manipulation i fully defer to the sec on whether the standard that they're using for whether there's sufficient integrity under the the spot price to support um an exchange-traded fund um is their independent view at this date and time um i'm sure they you know they they're considering all the appropriate factors so i would just defer to the sec on on that on their determination under their statute mr clinton thanks i i um i mean i agree with with commissioner berkovitz that this is something that is squarely within um you know the sec's purview um i think you know talking about the decisions that the cftc has made with regard to bitcoin futures may shed some light on how i view about view this generally but uh dan's right and i think it was december of 2017 the cftc allowed or did not um did not uh object to uh exchanges uh listing bitcoin futures contracts under a standard that the indexes to which they settled were not readily susceptible to manipulation um we in doing so we didn't place any value judgments on whether or not it was appropriate for market participants to be purchasing bitcoin futures we were concerned with is the index readily susceptible to manipulation that this product is going to settle to and our determination was that it was that it was that it did meet that standard because at least one of those indexes um was a mathematical formula that took the volume weighted average price across multiple crypto exchanges over five minute periods over an hour and then averaged them which means that you know could you manipulate that kind of you know index in that construction maybe if you had enough capital i think with enough time and enough money anything's manipulable i think we all know that but i think we'd also be able to tell exactly who did it and and where and and find them and hold them accountable for it so you know from my own perspective i'm proud to have been involved with the listing of bitcoin futures in a process that did not put a uh value judgment one way or another was technology neutral and met the standards of our act which said uh the index to which it settles is not readily susceptible to manipulation um how that applies to the sec uh and whether or not value judgments are part of their process or not or whether or not you know their concerns um about a product reflecting you know the entire ecosystem you know in which a product you know the underlying the underlying contract or product is traded you know th those i i don't have a lot of familiarity with that but i do think that an etf product on a crypto asset solves for a lot of institutional hesitancy where there is probably demand and it gets to the accounting treatment of this which kind of reflects back to my days as an investment manager because i think in your conversation with um congressman emmer you talked about uh these sitting on balance sheets as intangible assets which means they can never be written up and they are usually and they are regularly tested for impairment which means that if they trade below the purchase price they are they they are negatively impaired so there's no upside from an income statement or balance sheet perspective in um maintaining you know uh a crypto asset itself on your balance sheet but if you gain that exposure through an etf it becomes a security which is marked to market in real time and you don't have to worry about the custody issues so there is there are broad implications for this and i hear about demand all the time and given that it is a commodity on which future contracts are already listed um you know i i can't understand but also nor speak to the the hesitancy at our sister agency that's interesting yeah i uh have raised that issue about the accounting a few times and this has affected obviously companies like tesla when they're reporting their earnings uh because they do hold bitcoin on their balance sheet and um i do find it fascinating because uh you know i'm just speaking as a journalist but to me it doesn't really make sense um so i do yeah find that interesting and i like that idea that a bitcoin etf could resolve those accounting issues for corporations that are interested in getting exposure to bitcoin in their treasuries um all right well this has been such a fascinating discussion i didn't even get to i don't know some huge percentage of my questions so we'll have to have you um back um in the meantime where can people learn more about each of you and the cftc uh cftc.gov right dan i think both of our both of our biographies are up there all of our speeches um statements uh you know uh um testimony to the extent we've given it um articles uh you know the the press office um uh does does press releases um but uh but that's a great resource if you want to learn more about us and our philosophies and how we think about the space and why don't you each give your twitter handles as well uh it's uh it's cftc quintins i think i'm the same yeah uh uh that's right right right same thing and d berkofits at cftc.gov no i really i do want to engage in the dialogue i really believe in openness and public participation and feel free to contact me or my office i'm happy to discuss these issues with the folks out there they're important issues great all right well thank you both so much for coming on unchained thank you laura appreciate it thank you laura thanks a lot thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about commissioners dan berkovitz and brian quintenz check out the show notes for this episode unchained is produced by me laura shin with help from anthony yoon daniel
