[Music] heads up everyone this episode was recorded before the recent meltdown and relaunch of tara so if you hear us talking about ust as if it's still a thing that's why also this is the last episode with a long time producer on the show dan nuss who actually began working in unchanged because he reached out as a fan he's been here through a long period of change and growth and supported me in numerous ways it's terribly ironic that i have to record this with my apple earbuds since dan always did a lot to make me and the guests sound amazing it's also ironic that i can't make a video because the airbnb where i'm staying has such terrible wi-fi because dan is at heart a video person however i and everyone at unchained wish him the best and now on to the show hi everyone welcome to unchained your no-hive resource for all things crypto i'm your host laura shin author of the cryptopians i started covering crypto seven years ago and as the senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time this is the may 31st 2022 episode of unchained this episode of unchained is brought to you by beefy finance the multi-chain yield optimizer

sonny hey laura nice to have you all uh i should be on sorry i'm using on the other side of these podcast things where uh so i usually invite you guys on yeah nice to be on one so we're turning the tables on you today um but you're you've been working on what people are calling the most user-friendly ecosystem in crypto which is osmosis among other things previously you've also been a podcast host a research scientist at cosmos and more so why don't we fill people in on your background tell us how it is that you got into crypto and what you've been up to until this point yeah sure you know there's i guess there's different stages of one getting into crypto you know first time you hear about it first time you buy your first bitcoin first time you actually understand what it is you just bought but you know first time i ever heard about crypto was probably when a friend came up to me senior year of high school and he just said dogecoin just sponsored the jamaican bobsled team and i was like none of that sentence made any sense what did you just say so i had to go home that night and look up what dogecoin is that i like obviously from there you look up what bitcoin is and you're like oh that's kind of interesting and so from there i when i got to college my freshman year there was this like i went to uc berkeley and there was this like small bitcoin club and so i'm like oh i remember this like interesting thing i looked up near the end of last year let me go check it out and so it's like 2015. i went to join this bitcoin club it was like pretty interesting i i think most of it was very much over my head but what i did was me and two of other friends we started teaching a course on it because for me the best for me the best way to like learn stuff is to sign up to teach it because if you have to learn something or teach something next week you better learn it this week also why i do a podcast so yeah so you know started doing that from there you know on our first really understood bitcoin around then we had this like class of like about 50 students we started this new club called blockchain at berkeley and basically took a lot of the students from that original club and used it to start this club and just remind us what year was this this was all happening in like 2016 uh late late 2016 basically and then yeah i you know back then we were all very bitcoin maximalists i would say you know i remember i looked back at some of the uh old lectures from that class all on youtube and some of them a little bit cringy just how a little bit bitcoin maxi we were in my defense i kind of learned about ethereum during the dow attack like i was like on a hackathon summer 2016 and i was like with a friend i was like hey i heard about this like ethereum thing if we can go build stuff on it let's check it out we open our slash ethereum on reddit and the entire front page is just like about how like the dow is getting attacked and you know we gotta fork the chain the world is burning and i was like yeah these people are a little bit insane let me uh not pay attention to this so i ended up not paying attention to it for another like nine months and then at blockchain berkeley we had this meet up this guy from digix came and he just sort of gave us the pitch on ethereum and i'm like okay this i i i see what you guys are going for so now summer of 2017 i wanted to just learn more about ethereum so i interned at consensus where i was working on a couple of different things um i didn't wasn't super interested i wasn't super into it mostly because consensus was really working at more like application layer stuff and i kind of really wanted to work more at like core protocol layer stuff and so what happened was that summer i got really really interested in proof steak and so i what i did was i like read every single proof of steak white paper i could and out of all of them i think uh the tender the tendermint one just like stood out to me because it was just the simplest and i'm like wow this is so simple and elegant and you know we could probably go implement this and like by the end of the year and ship it and so i've reached out to the tendermint team and i'm kind of like dropped my consensus internship halfway through the summer and i reached out to the penderman team i'm like hey can i like help you guys like any way and then they told so i did not realize actually at the time that it was the cosmos team that was building the tendermint consensus and so you know can get into like how these two things relate to each other uh but yeah so you know they so i returned through the team that i thought was the timing team but then they told me about this like larger cosmos vision that they were working on and i'm like oh this this this is perfect this like solves all of like the issues i was seeing with ethereum and so i sort of started working with them that summer and and can you briefly describe what that vision was and what the problems were that you felt that it would solve yeah so well what is the cosmos vision the cosmos vision is one of an ecosystem of app chains application specific blockchains they're all interoperating with each other so how i usually explain this is like i see like the evolution of blockchains and this like three generational thing which i know is a little bit of an overused term but this here's how what i i see this mean so you have like the generation one of blockchains i put it in terms of like political economy so like in political economy you have these like generation one of civilization you have independent kingdoms and villages where they're all very sovereign and this is sort of like the v1 of blockchains where you had all these independent blockchains but that didn't really interoperate with each other you had like bitcoin for payments you had namecoin for dns names you had saya for storage but you couldn't use your bitcoin to buy a name on namecoin and use it to point to something stored on scio these are all like separated so in human civilization what we did to solve this problem we created these things called empires and we realized hey through like large-scale political integration we can achieve like really great economic integration so you know through like standards and like set standards and measures and like through force you can like create these like large-scale economic systems and so this is what ethereum kind of did where it said hey if we put everything in one system we can get all this amazing composability with each other and and it worked really well you can have all this amazing like new innovation that you get from putting everything in these systems and ever since then you know people have been iterating on that so people are trying to build better empires basically better better change that can scale so the problems i saw was one a lack of scalability so that means both like from a technical perspective like you know just tps and stuff but also like social scalability so i saw that like you know different applications are gonna have want to have sovereignty over their own stacks uh we saw things like um you know after the dow fork i was like wait if this that if if the chain forks for like this we're lucky that when it happened there wasn't enough enough going on but if something like that happened today all of d5 would break if there was a fork or like you know i saw like you know the parody multi-sync one where like funds were lost i was like well you know it'll be i feel if they have their own chain they could you know they could have voted to like fix that and it's like the sovereignty and customizability that you really lose out so the cosmos vision was hey we can can we achieve the best of both worlds can we have the like application specificness of generation one of blockchains but with like the economic composability of generation two and this is like what we've accomplished in the world in the last you know the last the greatest accomplishment of humanity in the last like hundred ish years is that we we learned how to do mass scale economic integration without mass scale political integration and we've done this through like things like you know free trade zones and technology like the internet and institutions like the un and imf and and one that people massively don't think about enough but containerization and i don't mean docker what i mean is if you ever go to like a naval yard you'll see that they all have like there's this like shipping container that like it's the same it's like a copy-pasted shipping container and there's tens of thousands of them in your in your naval yard and because what we've done is ev we've created the standard that every single ship in the world cargo ship in the world knows how to transport this one container type and every single port in the world knows how to load and unload this one container type and this basically allows any port in the world to trade with any other port in the world and that just opens up like a world of globalization so uh that's an analogy that will come into play later when we talk about ibc but yeah so this has sort of been the cosmos division how can we enable sovereignty scalability customizability uh through app chains but still allow um you know this high level of composability that we get that we're used to in blockchains today so it sounds like that's the vision for cosmos where you could have all these different ports or naval yards um but they can all function together because the container is standardized okay correct so at the moment obviously you're this co-founder of osmosis labs which is the company that has built osmosis the decentralized exchange why don't you tell us about that transition and what the vision is there and uh you know what it is that you've been building with osmosis yeah sure so with cosmos i was we were on the core team and we saw that there was basically you know to make this vision a reality there was like three main pieces of technology that we saw we needed so the first was that tendermint consensus basically how many proof of work change should there be in the world there's two plausible answers and it's either zero or one i tend to lean on the side of one but you know multiple proof of work chains coexisting is actually just like sort of fundamentally insecure what we saw was hey what you really want is a world of many proof stake chains all checkpointing into one proof of work chain and so we needed to go invent proof of stake and like today everything is using proof of stake but like at the time like 10 minutes most most proof of stake systems today are like usually running some derivative of like the tendermint consensus protocol that wait and but why would you say there would only be one proof of work chain because uh hash power you know if you're on a minority hash powered chain you're always like vulnerable to these attacks and basically i think that if you have like one proof of work chain that has like all the hash power dedicated to it it's the most secure chain so you have this like interesting property where proof of stake is very secure in short time frames and insecure in long time frames but meanwhile proof of work is insecure in short time frames and very secure in long time frames and so there's actually the best of you what you really want to do is get the best of both worlds where you use fast finality proof of stake chains and checkpoint them into a proof of work chain so that way you know that will solve your like nothing at uh you know long-range attacks and stuff that you get in proof of stake so that's like the long-term goal there's a couple people building this actually right now like checkpointing tendermint into bitcoin but um that's a side point side thing so osmosis yeah so the technology is right so second was the cosmos sdk which we said okay we need to if we want this world of application chains we need to make it easy for people to build them and so the sdk was a framework to do that and ibc was the protocol to have these all communicate so but it took us about two about three years to get all of these technologies built so i started in summer 2017 the first two were ready by the end of by stuff by like spring 2019 ibc finally became ready in spring of 20 spring of 2021 so it took us four years yeah that sounds right you know for me i o my vision was i wanted to get this ecosystem built and so once these three technologies were ready it was like okay time to go build applications using these and i was like okay what is the thing that needs to be built well obviously dexes are like a big piece you know if you look at every other device ecosystem so the decks is the first building block you need and then everything else sort of sprouts from there so we didn't actually originally start with the decks actually funny enough we actually started more on some like front running resistance and privacy related things but then we're like okay how do we apply this and we started to so dex is the way of of doing this so we started build you know building osmosis in the january of 2021 launched in about june and uh from took it from there and osmosis is different from other dexes because of the level of customizability that it has there are a lot of functions that are variable and up to the market makers why did you decide to build it that way and now that you know you have seen how people are using what are some of the unique types of liquidity pools that you're seeing being built what was the purpose of osmosis was to kind of show how app chains like can win right i just like show off like hey this is what app chains are really good at what you know the benefit of osmosis is it's sort of this like bet on vertical integration you know other dexes built on other existing blockchains right what they can do is they have their smart contracts and they have their front end and they can like kind of use those but osmosis we have our application our front end we also have the control over the blockchain itself and we have our team also builds the kepler wallet and so by having this sort of like full stack control from the wallet all the way down to the blockchain we're basically able to like ship certain features and ux flows that other dexes just can't do and so i can go into some of them so i think what you're referring to about the customizable pools that was actually sort of a little bit of an earlier vision of osmosis so i know if you go on our blog you can see that hey we talk a lot about these like customizable pools i think the thesis is still right which is amms are massively underexplored and one of the things that we're working on is really exploring the design space of amms properly but what we did learn from experimentation is that too much customizability can also be a little bit of a problem where what you'll end up doing is you'll often end up fragmenting markets and so for now what we do is we started by using the balancer amm model with the multi-asset pools and we did that because we're like oh wow balancer out of all the existing emm's is the most customizable you can you know set multi multiple multiple assets in a pool you can add weights and all this kind of cool stuff and we're like oh that's so cool so so you know uh dan robinson who's uh one of our investors or paradigms one of our investors but you know he often says that like when you in amm design you have like complexity points to spend and i think balancer actually spends them in the on the wrong things where you know i think weights are cool i'm not sure what they're useful for uh same with uh like multi-asset pools they're very cool you know other than stable swaps i'm not really sure what they're that useful for and so basically what we're kind of doing right now is like bringing it back bringing our amm design work back a step and then so we can explore other directions of the design space yeah i mean in general it feels like user experience is such a big focus for osmosis so why did you make that price a priority and what were some of the major user experience problems you were trying to resolve for us centralized you know if dexa's want to meaningfully compete with centralized exchanges which is our goal i don't think any deaths today like offers the [Music] experience that like centralized exchanges do and you know to be honest centralized exchanges are still to be honest leave like quite a lot to be desired i had to teach like my mom how to use coinbase the other day and it was you know still not as user-friendly as you'd hope but we're you know still a load better than teaching her how to use like metamask and ethereum and stuff so you know we and i think also the other thing is where dexa's like the moat for dexes is their user experience because the user experience is what brings retail volume to your decks and then everything follows from there if you have retail volume liquidity follows a retail volume and then you know institutional and arbitrage volume follows the liquidity so if you can bring those like what you know what we call natural order flow to your to your decks then i think everything else will like fall into place and so to do this we had to like take advantage of some of the things we do with like the app change that we talked about so an example would be one of the biggest issues i've had with like every blockchain up until today is how you have to pay fees in like the native token of of that chain and i always thought this was just like terrible ux i a couple years ago i had to teach one of my i was showing one of my friends how to use die for payments and this is back when gas costs were reasonable and we could foreseeably use die as payments but what i did was i sent him i made him open a wallet and stuff and i sent him some dye and i'm like cool try sending it back to me and then he tries sending it back and it's like it's not working it's like wait what's wrong and it's like oh you don't have eth for the transaction fee and it's like this is a very silly ux and especially for something like osmosis where like you'll notice that our our native token osmo is not on any centralized exchanges that's very purposeful uh you know we don't want listings of our token we are a decks and we have conviction in our own product so you know we're not gonna we don't want our token to be listed on our competitors but so but if you can't go get osmo from a centralized exchange how would someone use the osmosis chain in the first place and so what we actually did was we were able to make it so you can pay transaction fees in any token you want and we do that because unlike other chains where ethereum doesn't know about the existence of uniswap right there's like this abstraction barrier there in osmosis because it's a fully vertically integrated system the chain knows about the decks on top of it and so if you try to pay a transaction fee in usdc for example it will say oh it'll take the transaction fee and automatically route it through the decks and say oh okay look this is actually worth this much osmo and it will like do all the normal work like normal fee does and so you know this i think was just like such a big unlock on the ux that pay fees and whatever you want as long as it has economic value that the dex the change shouldn't really care so that's like one example of like ux things that we can achieve with like the vertically integrated system and does that have to do with how as far as i can tell from some posts i read it seems that tokens can be added by anybody but then for the front end for kind of like the nice ux that the osmosis uh dex you know shows that there when you add a token it has to be done via the governance system is that is that a correct description of how that works and if so like why did you guys do it that way yeah so this also sort of arose from this like desire for a good ux as well so what happened was you know you'll notice that there's like a number of bridges out there like in being developed right now to varying levels of success but anyway yes to varying levels of success and you know as much as possible we prefer to use ibc just because it is the most secure design for a bridge that's available right now which like fully trustless no intermediaries yada yada but you know ibc doesn't exist between every chain today and like you know it works very well for tendermint based chains or other tendermint based chains but and there's work on integrating ibc into other frameworks like substrate and solana and other other things as well but you know at the moment there's no ibc integration for ethereum and so we need to use an existing bridge and a lot of people wanted to be that brit to build bridges between ethereum and cosmos there's like at least i know six existing implementations of like different bridges between the that could have that can connect ethereum to osmosis right now and but the problem is let's say eath that flows over each of these different bridges is not fungible with each other they all would have different they're all different tokens on the osmosis side and you know other ecosystems will often like deal with that with like these like prefixes so you'll have like wormhole e it's like wet wet so then you'll have like nomadi if that then axle are you access and it's like you know you go on coinbase you don't have all these like ugly prefixes and it's like that's not the ux that people want and so what you need is you want a sort of a canonical version of an asset but at the same time we want to remain permissionless so what we actually did right now as a temporary fix is we actually created two websites we have the main osmosis site at app.osmosis.zone and we have a second site called frontier at frontier.osmosistown and the frontier site has basically permissionless listening and you know you go on and it has this like wild west like theme and stuff to it and it's like supposed to be like okay look this is like a permissionless listing but like you know be wary it's dangerous some of these assets you know are not audited and like you know you have all these like prefixes and like good luck i hope you know what you're doing and then the main site is it's a little bit more curated where it's like okay let's have like one canonical bridge as the primary asset and so we actually have this whole governance process to decide what that canonical bridge would be for osmosis and so it took like two or three months to go through the whole process where there was like all the brick providers submitted proposals and we had these like town halls with all of them and this voting process but yeah so in the end we base uh governance basically ended up picking uh this bridge called axelr as the primary bridge based off of like technical merits and stuff and stuff so on there you know you'll only have only the axler version of e or the actual version of usdc will be shown on that and that's sort of just to provide that better ux and a little bit more and you know the assets that are on the main site are sort of you know ones that you know we know are like okay these are actual teams behind this and things like that so that that's sort of there to provide this like duality you alluded to the governance process on osmosis can you describe how that works yeah so governance on osmosis it happens by uh token holder voting basically of staked osmo holders so osmo token holders are osmo is the staking token of the chain and you have to basically be staked in order to to vote and when you stake you normally delegate you to a validator or you run a validator yourself and the governance system of this is a sort of the general government the default governance system that most cosmos sdk chains use is when you stake you it's kind of like a liquid kind of like a mini liquid democracy where you by default inherit the vote of your validator but you can always override them by voting yourself if your validator voted yes on something and you're fine with that you don't have to do anything but if you disagree with your validator you can always just submit a vote yourself and you know your validator won't inherit your voting power and all the votes are done basically fully on chain there's no admin key or multi-sig or you know that executes and stuff it's all all on chain there's like three main governance types so there's what we call text proposals which are basically it's just a string of text and like so for example like what's the canonical bridge those are a series of text proposals then there's parameter change proposals so parameter change is like things that can be like in the protocol that can be edited on the fly so a big example of that is the incentives so osmosis you know has a lot of liquidity incentives or different pools and every week governance sort of re-votes on like okay what percentage of this week's incentives should go to the adam osmo pool versus the luna osmo pool versus the uh ust osmo pool for example um and then so that's a parameter change and then the third one is a software upgrade proposal so basically this what it does by default is if it gets voted in valid is all it'll like shut down the nodes at that time and then it basically makes it so we can coordinate on-chain software upgrades via on-chain governance so in a moment we'll talk a little bit more about how this also affects security but first quick word from

cosmos is this multi-chain system osmosis can't bootstrap security from like the underlying blockchain as it would you know if it were like part of ethereum or something like that so how is security provided in osmosis yeah so security is provided via osmo staking so you know osmo has a reasonably high market cap to support the assets that are currently on the chain and one of the things that we did was we sort of invented this thing called super fluid staking as a way of improving security so how it works is osmo while being the staking token of the chain is also the primary liquidity pair of the chain so you can create pools for other pairs so you could create like atom usdc pool directly but osmo is by default sort of like the most popular base pair and but this kind of like leads to this thing of like hey a lot of osmo is sitting in liquidity pools not being staked and it's like that economic value could have been contributing to stake to like help secure the chain and so what we did was we like well why isn't it right like this has economic value so like you know in in crypto indeed there's like then there's a huge movement towards like staking derivatives as a way of solving this like capital efficiency problem where they're saying like okay hey we can take a token like eath for example we'll stake it get back a staking derivative token like steeth or ste and then we use that ste in d5 problem is this has a lot of security implications to it because i don't want to go too much into it but what ends up happening is like because that's teeth is liquid if you are a validator and do something malicious it's very easy for you to get rid of that teeth and basically have someone else absorb the risk or the slashing uh punishment so we said hey is there a way to do this in the other direction and there is because once again we are an app chain what we do is we can take the we do this in the other direction so what we do is we take staking tokens use them and defy get back defy assets and stake the defy assets and so in our in this case specifically anytime osmo is in an amm pool you get back these lp shares but these lp shares have osmo underlying them and so what we allow you to stake the lp share and because the chain understands the d5 protocol built on top you know it basically repolls every regular interval and says okay this lp share is worth this much osmo treat it as worth this much osmo for the purposes of staking and still these lp shares are slashable and so basically awesome was able to osmosis is able to secure itself because it's allowing all the osmo in d5 to be used in staking to secure the chain and so we'll be able to do this with more device primitives as well so we just started with lp shares but we'll be able to do you know we're building a lending protocol right now called isotonic so we'll be able to do that with like you know the equivalent of c tokens but in isotonic and we'll be able to do this with more and more sort of d5 primitives wow that's actually that's super fascinating in early march osmosis announced that i had integrated qasim wasm's inter blockchain smart contract engine into osmosis what is cosmosome and how does this benefit osmosis yeah so going back to the cosmos sdk today all of the logic of osmosis is in the sdk which means it's written in go yeah and by the way for people who aren't technical it's software developer kit yes sdk center software development kit but what it means is our dex isn't written as smart contracts smart contracts is basically like code you write and you can deploy live to like a running chain the cosmos sdk wasn't built for that the costly sdk was built for you know similar to bitcoin it has its core logic but that exists in the bitcoin node software so in the same way the osmosis dex exists in the node software and so you know for a long time we were kind of resistant to like smart contracts because we're like oh we want to just be this app chain just focus on what we're doing but as we go we realized hey okay what we always want to realize was we're trying to compete with centralized exchanges and centralized exchanges are more than just their spot markets what they are is this like suite of products that is packaged into one unified experience and so along with their spot markets they include you know margining and perps and you know launch pads and custody services and fiat on ramps and stuff like that so you know and so if osmosis as a platform as a chain wants to compete with centralized exchanges it needs to offer that suite of products in one unified experience and to do that we need to enable external teams to come in and help build parts of this uh stack and so to do this what we did was we added cosmosome which is a smart contracting system built for the cosmos sdk and it's one of the most popular smart contracting systems today it's used uh you know the biggest user is the terra blockchain so everything that's built on top of terra is you know other than the actual stable coin itself ever like you know anchor and mirror and all this stuff on top is all built in cosmosome and then there's a number of chains that use it like secret network and stargaze and a bunch more um so we added this uh module to osmosis but what we did actually something a little bit different what than everyone else was we made it permissioned deployment so you know most smart contracting chains you can just anyone can just go start deploying contracts for osmosis you actually have to make a governance proposal in order to deploy a contract and the goal here is we want to make sure it still remains an app chain and you know we want to be able to make sure the things that are being deployed to osmosis are like high quality and you know well integrated with each other we want to we would rather have like 20 amazing apps on it rather than 200 mediocre ones and and it kind of look once again you know i i apple's like a big inspiration of like how i think about like product design but it's like you know similar to vertical integration but it's also like you know apple's ios app store it has to go through like an approval process to list an app on the app store and so you know it's a similar sort of idea here but the idea here is we can build now a sort of chain that has a bunch of like super well integrated d5 protocols sort of all working together yeah and you know this comparison that you make to apple like it's it's pretty evident in how you know you have this focus on user experience and how in a way by having all these different app chains it sort of gives you control over the quality of kind of like each of like the decks or the landing protocol or whatever these different apps are that are going to be but how do you kind of manage that goal against you know the community's goal to have these blockchains be decentralized do you feel that you've had a compromise in terms of centralization or or rather decentralization i think that basically you know the the osmosis community is like bought in be into and like you know participating in this protocol because they sort of believe in this app chain vision and so like i said it's not like we go around and give uh access to like deploy on osmosis it's a on-chain governance proposal that like the community votes things in and obviously you know the dev teams can you know give suggestions and stuff at the end of the day i think that like the community is pretty well aligned with the vision of like what osmosis should become and like the direction to take to go there that's just kind of like the benefit of sovereignty right like this is in in a system like ethereum right where there's just so many stakeholders and they all have differing interests and needs out of the protocol they it kind of what ends up happening is the protocol gets tugged in so many directions that it ends up just stagnating and it can't really go anywhere like if you want to do some sort of like breaking change it like i remember like not the recent ethereum upgrade but the previous one i think they changed how some of the op codes were priced and it broke a bunch of people's smart contracts it like broke aragon's dow contracts i believe and so it's like oh right this is like not great that like things can break up from under you and that's why ethereum has to be like neces necessarily slow moving and so like that with the app train thing so you know like i said like i said earlier we started with this goal of wanting to build this like front running resistant dex that like uses privacy technology to make that work and we're still developing this right now but whenever we're ready to launch this this will require like it's probably gonna be like the biggest change to how blockchains have worked since like you know maybe the development of proof of stake but to do this we have to go change how like the chain works you have to change out the front end works you have to go change how the wallet works and if there's like a thousand applications built on top of osmosis we wouldn't be able to do that because we you know i don't know how we would go coordinate with all of these apps that like hey let's uh all sort of upgrade at the same time it's a you end up grinding to a halt meanwhile if there's like okay hey here's these like 10 daps that are built on top of osmosis we can all go we can go coordinate with them and be like hey you know let's all make sure our front ends are all ready to like change to this new cryptography to make the privacy system work and so and so yeah my point is you know the osmosis community is in the osmosis community because they believe in this vision and so it's like osmosis is permissioned but cosmos is permissionless so it's like if the osmosis chain is very opinionated while cosmos is unopinionated so if you we still interoperate with this whole permissionless world while still remaining opinionated you know kind of like a same thing with the duality between our you know two front ends as well you know i think there's this balance that always has to be struck so as you mentioned osmosis is tackling front running or mev talk a little bit about how it is that you are all doing that yeah so you know i got really interested in mev summer like summer of 2020 working with the flashbots team sort of before flash watch existed and i was like okay i want to figure out how to solve this problem like you know instead of just like auctioning off rights to it or whatever i want to like how do we minimize the mev at the protocol and mev is a very broad term the type of mev the toxic mev i would say that we were really interested in was front running and so i'll just explain it just in case any of the listeners are not familiar what front running is is let's say you were going to go buy a million dollars worth of a stock and i knew you were gonna do that what would i do i would go buy that stock right before you let you buy it so it pushes up the price and i'll sell right after you but by doing that i gave you worse pricing so this is very rampant in blockchains today so because today everyone just broadcast their transaction out in the open everyone's watching the mempool and basically looking at like okay here's all the trades let me sandwich these and let that's that's what we call them in blockchain land this front running is called sandwiching because you put your buy but thereby and then you put yourself so you sandwich their uh transaction and this mev has gotten like very toxic especially on chains like you know with a lot of volume like ethereum and solana and stuff where there are like major dexes so our solution was how we saw it was we're like this is fundamentally a privacy problem actually like the problem is that everyone is leaking their intent before it's actually executed so what we did was we created this system called threshold encryption which what what it basically means is we have a way of making it so you your transaction is encrypted when you broadcast it to the network and when a block proposer or a validator when they make a block it consists of encrypted transactions they don't actually know what's in the block and then how tendermint works is all the validators sort of like vote on a block final commit and finalize a block only once a block is finalized only then does it get decrypted and executed and we use this you do using like threshold cryptography so you know you might be it's similar to like threshold signing if you're familiar with like a multi-sig you can imagine it's kind of like a multi-sig but for decrypting information so you know what what we'll have is so two-thirds of validators have to sort of share their secret in order to decrypt uh the transactions but we also require two-thirds of values to vote on a block in order to finalize a block and so what we do is every time evaluated votes on a block they also share their decryption share and so once you have two thirds of vote on a block it's finalized that's also when you can decrypt and execute and so by doing this you know we help solve you know most basically any of the toxic mep that happens via the front running and when are you rolling this out sometime this year uh so you know so what happened was we actually started with this and we started sort of started architecting this system and then we realized this is a feature not a product and that's sort of how osmosis started was we're like okay let's go build a product around this let's go build this dex and then you know the pulls of the market took us in different directions you know we're like okay we gotta go build the super fluid staking and things like that and so you know other other sort of features took a little bit higher priority but like the the special encryption is definitely like one of our top priorities for this year well that that's uh really funny that that was how that happened you mentioned isotonic the lending protocol that you are all working on obviously recently we have seen how lending has definitely attracted a lot of people to the tarot terra eco ecosystem but uh as we're recording it's unclear how things will work out for that ecosystem but the point is that a lot of people were kind of talking about the risks of having such a high interest rate on that system and what would happen when they start to drop it i was curious if you have any thoughts on kind of how isotonic should sort of thread that needle of like wanting to attract users and you know i'm sure you've heard these terms of people kind of having an issue of attracting mercenary capital but wanting to have missionary capital so what are your thoughts on that yeah so you know the mercenary versus missionary capital i think this is like something we cared a lot about like so one of the things we did on osmosis just the debts itself which i i don't think i'd seen anyone else do before was we sort of only put token in like liquidity incentives on bonded lp share so we didn't want this sort of like mercenary capital that like comes in and out on like you know there's actually some like mev you can do by doing that actually so what we do is we say hey if you want token incentives you have to choose to bond your lp shares either one day seven days or 14 days and the longer you bond them you sort of earn more uh awesome incentives to kind of like bring in this more missionary liquidity and so the similar thing we would do the same similar thing for isotonic where we want to make sure token you know assets that are put into isotonic are committed long term okay so now about the question about anchor you know so anchor was kind of really what it was doing was bootstrapping the stablecoin right like what happened was there was a lot of stablecoin deposited into it with very little actual amount being borrowed from it because that's not really what anchor was really going for and the the yields were a little bit artificial right they were kind of propped up by tfl because their goal was not really to build a lending market as much as it was to build a supply sync for ust yeah terraform labs tfl dfl yeah terraform labs and the problem is actually kind of weirdly enough anker kind of makes building stuff with ust slightly annoying because so we're trying to build this like isotonic system and ust is still a major stable coin in osmosis we'll see what happens at you know end of the week um but the to attract ust deposits into isotonic we sort of have to beat the anchor rate of return which is artificially propped up and so it actually the anchor artificial yield i actually think is a little bit harmful to the ecosystem long term because it makes it harder for people to build natural uses of ust and i think that was one of the issues that happened in the terra ecosystem that all the ust got put into this chasing this artificial yield instead of being used in more natural adoption not to say that there isn't natural adoption in the terra ecosystem but it just you know a large large large majority of the ust was chasing the artificial yield so for isotonic you know i mean we will we will support ust but we're also going to support other stable coins as well we're working a lot with usdc as well as then you know also figuring out how like capital efficiency things of how to make these things use like useful so for example like we're actually launching a stable swap pretty soon as well as a lending protocol and so it's like well these two things are kind of competing for stable coin deposits how can we make it so like a deposit in one is actually being used in both of them and so you know there's some design stuff that we're we're doing here and like making it so it's more capital efficient and stuff and as you mentioned osmosis also recently selected a bridge and there have been so many recent cross-chain bridge hacks so what was the thinking behind choosing that particular bridge and in general how do you and the osmosis community think about bridge security a number of things went into choosing the bridge i think a couple of them one is the axillar axler is built on the cosmos sdk which has sort of been a big piece for us because what that meant is we didn't have to integrate a custom bridge protocol to talk to axillars rather the what axelr does is it will like use their bridge protocol to bring assets from ethereum or avalanche and then it will but we only have to use ibc in order to talk to axelr which is a big sort of selling point for us and so that sort of more cosmos native is one the second is i think the team is just amazing i think that so you know uh sergey and georgios like they were like sort of the lead engineers for algorand didn't really like the direction of that product project and so they kind of wanted to build leave and go build something a little bit more open and stuff so started axillary and i think that i mean to be completely honest i don't think their team is the greatest at like marketing themselves i don't think they're the most well-known bridge as like you know some of the others but i don't i don't think that matters i think that bridges are not really end user facing they're not customer facing products bridges are service providers to applications and as long as you know kind of this arbitrage we're like oh we saw that they actually have this amazing product but not well no not as well known so we can actually integrate that and you know we are their go to to go to market for it but you know we can use their amazing product and so the amazing product that we saw was once again i just thought they had this like really good ux flows that they had built so an example so the the one that like kind of wowed me and like sold me on it was they have this thing called deposit addresses so how what that means is so you go on a centralized exchange today right and you click uh deposit eth and it doesn't pop up your meta mask and like say oh send this and it'll like have this pre-filled transaction what it does is it says say hey here's this e address or qr code and just send eth to this address and then the the exchange will like you know link that to your account once it receives it and there's two types of wallets i s what i i call them dumb wallets and smart wallets smart wallets are your meta masks and kepler and phantom wallet these things that you're you can have an application and you like tell it oh here's a transaction and the transaction and the wallet signs it dumb wallets all they know how to do is send coins that's all they know how to do and i actually think majority of people only use dumb wallets right now so you know if i'm holding if i have a trust wallet on my phone right yes it has wallet connect and stuff but like really the easiest you actually just send coins right and what the axler system was designed was to deal with that ux so instead of like opening up metamask it just gives me an address and says send coins to this account and it will like automatically if i send each to that address it'll automatically it'll just show up in my osmosis account and this is so important because like okay who's the what's one of the biggest dumb wallets in the world is centralized exchanges when i if i via the axillary system i could say hey withdraw my eth from coinbase directly to osmosis all you have to do is you just send your eth to the address and it'll just you you put it as the withdrawal address and it'll just show up in your osmosis account i think that is like such a valuable ux or the other one would be like another big dumb wallet every single bitcoin wallet right like there's no no there's no smart wallets for bitcoin yet an actual actually originally started as focusing on their bitcoin bridge there's reasons to kind of push that down the line a little bit but like you know if we want to support bitcoin bridged onto osmosis you need this like dumb wallet ux flow so yeah that's kind of you know just their like sort of focus on like ux features that we thought were like sort of essential was why uh the community sort of went with axler but then in terms of like security issues like do you feel that with with xlr that they've resolved some of the other issues we've seen with these cross-chain bridge hacks there's a number of different types of cross-train bridge hacks right there's i would say the vast vast majority of hacks are not economic attacks they're really just software bugs right and you know the wormhole attack was a software bug and unfortunately you can uh you can do your best at that but you know at some point it's just a matter of thing you know good luck i guess but like actually you know it's gone through a number of audits it's written in the cosmos sdk primarily which i think is you know i'm probably a little bit biased but i think it's actually you know i don't think there's been any causal sdk chain that has had any sort of major hack yet which is good to see i guess you know knock on wood yeah so you know they're quite well audited when it comes to the economic security you know i like that axolotl is run as a proof of stake chain right it's not unlike you know so so ronin the axi one was actually the first one that was really like an economic attack where you know first of all they had these like eight validators but four of them were run by one company and it's like guys that's not a decentralized validator set and so you know that was able to be sort of taken over and then you have things like wormhole which is basically running this like you know white listed validators um meanwhile axlar is a proof-of-stake system that they have their own token and like becoming a validator is permissionless and the other thing that we're actually working with them as well with on is building in safeguards into in into the bridge so like there is no reason that like over 25 of your bridge bridges like uh tbl should be moving across the bridge in like a five minute period right like that is this if that's happening there's something going wrong so you know we're working with them on adding these like stop gaps where they're like oh okay look if we see this like net outflow of assets in like a 24 hour period okay you know similar it's because how you know have a circuit breaker right it requires like okay some sort of manual intervention to be like okay what's going on and so like building in these like stop gaps and like this sort of security mindset around the process is like i think how we resolve a lot of these things yeah that reminds me of like ages ago like literally i think like in 2015 or something eminent guns here he proposed like something called vault or something on bitcoin where for large amounts it would be um the transaction would be delayed by 48 hours or something like that so i noticed that recently when yooka labs had its debacle with its nft drop for the digital land and um other side it tweeted afterward that it urged its doubt to look at launching its own chain and you quote tweeted that and said app chains are the way but a lot of people felt that hugo labs was actually blaming ethereum for something that they themselves could have prevented so why did you see that as a kind of like a good example of why app chains are a solution yeah because you know people kind of criticize them that oh like you didn't make your contract as gas efficient as they could have been and it's like yes you're right but first of all i'm not sure that would have actually solved the problem because if they were more gas efficient i think the way their auction was structured it would just have caused the price would have just actually it would just cost more gap like the price per unit of gas would have just gone up and ended up costing the same amount really what it is and also it's like you know we're we're getting to this world where like to build on ethereum you have to like be like you know you can't even write into solidity anymore you have to like go into the evm byte code and like hand optimize things and it's like this is not how like secure engineering is done right and so essentially what's going to happen is this is a problem with any generalized blockchain is you're always going to have your application is always going to be competing for throughput and you and especially when we're talking about games like this is always a main issue so you see even on polygon right you had that like where polygon went down because that sunflower game basically ended up eating all the throughput and if you're some other dap sitting on polygon that's that would really suck right or like and so on ethereum yes like this auction took up a lot of space on ethereum but it's like if you're another gaps feeling ethereum that would suck if like i remember there was this joke back in like 2017 back when icos were happening and it's like oh imagine we're using to pay our like you know fill up our gas at the gas station and it's like oh sorry you know this is going to cost 50 because there's an ico going on on the other side of the world and it's like oh like this is this is kind of silly right and what we've actually seen in cosmos is a lot of the early projects sort of using cosmos are osmosis was sort of the first big defy application on cosmos a lot of the early adopters were actually more on the like decentralized web side of things so you had things like akash network which is like a decentralized cloud uh you had sentinel which is a decentralized vpn system and it's because these are the things that get priced out of generalized blockchains first so what ends up happening on a generalized blockchain it'll the price of using the chain will always get go to the like whatever the the highest user is willing to pay and so defy apps you know maybe a default user is willing to pay five dollars in order to make a transaction but i'm not gonna pay five dollars every time i want to connect to my vpn right and so those are the applications that get priced off first and i think gaming is gonna sort of be like the next big one where it's like you know gaming systems even if you were like as great as you want you know you're you're going to be on a generalized blockchain you're always going to get priced out and so i think we're going to start to see a lot more gaming ecosystems sort of building their own app chains and then getting all the benefits you get with app chains right oh you can go use our native token for fees and you know you can so one of our team members at osmosis his name is john patton he on the side built this little side project called treasure which has turned into this huge like i think it's one of the biggest like nfp uh ecosystems out there now and they're going to be building their own app chain pretty soon and like they can do cool stuff where they can like use their nfts to in the proof of stake system and you get all this like cool customizability and you can like build the chain system into the game mechanics and yeah i think that like the i think hugo labs has a lot of a lot more design space to create interesting systems when they have their own chain okay you made a good case after i read so much criticism of that comment um last bit you've talked multiple times in this episode about how you envision osmosis competing with centralized exchanges talk a little bit about that because i think a lot of people feel that the day when decentralized exchanges compete with centralized exchanges is a ways off yeah i think today most decentralized exchanges are competing in a very different market than centralized exchanges so you know you'll have unisoft that's primarily focused on the ethereum ecosystem and you have serum and the solana ecosystem and stuff but if you look in like you know major volume most volume is actually between like the native assets of different ecosystems the l1 assets and i think the the dex that's going to be able to attract that volume is not going to be a dex built on any of these l1 but rather a neutral independent chain and so on osmosis by being this like sort of neutral platform we're not in the ethereum ecosystem or the salon ecosystem avalanche we're just like and cosmos is not really an ecosystem in my opinion cosmos is a stack a software stack that many things are built on top of and within that you can have different ecosystems you have like terra is its own little ecosystem built on top of causal sdk stacks so you know the goal of osmosis is to be this like neutral place that we can you can come trade your eat for a soul and you know have all this like privacy and stuff that that we're providing people we're working with the axler team on building this like product where people can swap between like you know ethon ethereum for avax on avalanche and like one click right they don't actually you know they don't have to actually they don't even have to download a kepler wallet or anything it will just they make the transaction from their metamask and it will you know do get picked up by axillar they'll use this cool technology called interchain accounts to so the axillary chain will do a swap on the osmosis chain and then send the tokens uh to the destination on avalanche and so you know i think kind of kind of like the shape the shape-shift like experience but like you know actually live and working uh in a decentralized way so yeah so these are sort of the things that i think that will put osmosis ahead like you know at least competing in a similar market to centralized exchanges today and then when it when it comes to like the product offering you know that's just sort of where we have to go build the best product you know we're working on building like everything i've said so far you know the reason we're building a lending protocol is because i don't see trading and lending as two different products right i think they actually are two sides of the same product because if you want to build the best margin trading system you need your trading engine and your lending engine to be like so well integrated this is what makes the ftx system so well so good because it's like how well integrated their system is they're sort of like the gold standard and they have they can do all these like things like you know these like sort of staged liquidations and like you know very efficient cross margining and all these kind of things when you have this like sort of integration that's kind of what we're kind of going for on the product side by having this integrated stack and the last you know just like i said really big focus on ux and brand is another one so you'll notice that if you go on the osmosis website we have all this like colorful artwork and we have this like like mad scientist mascot there his name is wasmantin we were kind of just like you know you look at normal companies in the world today and they all have mascots right like you know you have ronald mcdonald or the geico lizard or and it's like why don't crypto projects have mascots and so so yeah you know we're we're just trying to like i think this is these are the sort of like more subtle like brand and ux things that we think will make osmosis more appealing all right well this has been an incredibly fascinating discussion where can people learn more about you and your work um yeah you can follow me on twitter i am at sunnya97 and you can also
