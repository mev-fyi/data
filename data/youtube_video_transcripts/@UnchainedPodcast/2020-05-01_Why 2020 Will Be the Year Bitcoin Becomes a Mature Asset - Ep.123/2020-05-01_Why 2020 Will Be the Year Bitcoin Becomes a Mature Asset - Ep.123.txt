hi everyone welcome to unconfirmed the podcast that reveals how the marquee names and crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon i'm your host laura shin in response to the challenging times crypto.com is waiving the 3.5 credit card fee for all crypto purchases download the crypto.com app today today's guest is mike mcglone senior commodity strategist for bloomberg intelligence welcome mike thank you laura it's good to be on crypto twitter was pretty excited last week to see your bloomberg intelligence crypto outlook report on bitcoin which was titled the bitcoin maturation leap why don't you explain first of all what the bloomberg crypto outlook is when it got started and why bloomberg felt that it should start a crypto outlook um well i guess it was me who started it i was kind of intrigued by the space and as you mentioned i'm a commodity strategist so i really started it 2018 um probably earlier in the year i felt this space really needed to be covered and the main reason why is the interest and the just it's you know the question is it evolutionary or revolutionary not come around to that bitcoin is revolutionary and um what i found is bloomberg is mostly institutional mostly professional and if anything it's a good sign that people are really interested so i started writing about it and got a lot of interest and so i keep doing it and partly because i'm interested in it and um i find that we've had a decent run at you know kind of predicting where the market's gonna go and that's what i do as a strategist i don't really care too much i am completely objective about um different current you know different markets my goal is to say this is where it's going and why and i'm actually after we're done speaking i'll be working on my outlook for may which will be published the first uh first week of may and in your most recent crypto outlook what were your top line takeaways that this crisis you know bitcoin born in the previous crisis 2008 2009 this crisis should define its maturation and it's doing a really good job of that now initially it did have a correction in terms of price again my outlook is really just where it's going in terms of the price of crypto's most notably bitcoin but now as we speak on friday may 1st bitcoins up 26 on the year and s p 500 is down 9 so bitcoin to me is trading more and more like gold and becoming a digital version of gold um and that was what this year should define because some of us have been really kind of expecting something like this is a decent setback i should say shake out the stock market um and continuation of some really unfavorable trends which is you know debt to gdp increasing more fed easing um but a potential recession which really was triggered by um i guess it had a major catalyst with the coronavirus and the problem is a lot of these indications were there well before the virus kicked in and bitcoin is just right in the right place to be one of the top assets to benefit from i guess you could say from the ebbing tie to the global economy and so was your feeling that bitcoin was reaching this point even before the pandemic but that the pandemic is just accelerating it oh yeah absolutely so let's see it's obviously not so much the pandemic it's some reaction to the pandemic the complete shutdown so the number one thing is unprecedented global central bank um liquidity providing people might call it money printing so for instance the fed fed's purchasing bonds interest rates are zero um and they're buying assets with basically creating money that is very bullish for gold and i view bitcoin in the same bucket as gold it's essentially a collectible it's a digital form of gold i don't really view it as a form of payment because it's not really good for that partly because supplies can is is linearly trending down the supply is going away um and it's being adopted so i view what's happening now globally is the key test for bitcoin this year i think we'll look back on is the the year to define bitcoin becoming a mature asset and right now it's doing quite well i.e one thing to remember a bit about bitcoin is risk adjusted it's trading very well even though it had that big correction it trades to me just like gold did in 2008 remember when the market initially collapsed i mean l markets except for the bond market gold went down about 30 percent and that printed printed at the bottom around 700 and then went straight up to 1900. that's right at the time the fed really started aggressive quantitative easing now we're doing the exact same thing now bitcoin corrected around 40 and here it's now back up on the year so i think that's going to continue and one other thing you mentioned is the trend in bitcoin futures increasing it um a little bit more than doubled year to year uh in q1 from 2019 to 2020. so what impact would you say that increasing bitcoin futures trade volume has or will have on the price of bitcoin so a lot of what i'm focusing on is the maturation and adult supervision coming into the space for bitcoin and that's futures are a key part of that and i don't mean um you know i mean listed futures i.e futures that are listed on um cftc approved exchange cme and are um part within the u.s regulatory format i.e that is part of the the the on-ramp to an etf in in some case so right now as we speak open interest in the futures contract and cma which started trading in 2017 is reached an all-time new high and that's an indication of adoption from an institutional standpoint and it's indication of bitcoin really coming into the the forefront of the mature space for asset classes it's a good indication of volatility should continue to decline and that's the key thing that's happening this year is volatility and bitcoins on the way down versus volatility on stock markets on the way up and that's what i think is transition mission initially bitcoin is kind of a risk asset i think it's transitioned to a risk-off asset so things like that futures are a good indication of adoption we see things like addresses used uh adoption um just i watch like uh well and then anecdotal you hear fidelity backed futures and the gbtc i watched the uh the total assets on the management in that in the grayscale bitcoin trust anything i can to see adoption and to me that's the key thing that matters when something has limited supply we know it's never going to have more supply all that matters is adoption and futures are a good indication open interest is just part of that and so earlier we talked about how um quantitative easing will probably drive interest in this sort of version of digital gold um but then i was and you also talked about you know the futures being an indication of institutional interest but i was also wondering then how this trend of well essentially this record unemployment that we're seeing due to the coronavirus how that will also impact uh the you know adoption of bitcoin well the the um the la the i guess it's the con compression or the reduction of income is a problem but bitcoin's global and it i really view it as getting into the institutional space so the number one thing that that this that's happening is causing central banks most notably the fed to just pump the system with liquidity so that's supposed to help the stock market in the short term it's okay so basically they're just massively increasing the supply of physical as people say in the space fiat currency paper money and bitcoin is measured in that everything like our homes are measured in its stocks are measured net so to me increases the incentive to take that paper money that you should be spending because it doesn't have interest anymore and there's massive supplies of it converting that into some form of physical safe assets now initially people are going to the stock market i think that's fading they're going to realize there's no earnings so that's a problem bitcoin and gold to me are the highest probability assets that should continue to appreciate then there's things like land real estate income producing real estate depends on you know that's all about location and of course there's a bit of a lower tide factor there but it's that that no interest rates and just the the fact that we're printing and people might call it debasing currency but in a deflation environment the fed and central banks are doing exactly what they're supposed to do but you're supposed to take some of that currency they're printing and putting in safe assets i think is a prudent investor and i think institutions are figuring out that in in the gold bucket bitcoin fits in a moment we'll discuss on-chain price well sorry in a moment we'll discuss price versus on-chain indicators in bitcoin but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible in response to the challenging times crypto.com is introducing three measures to help the community first the 3.5 credit card fee for all crypto purchases will be waived for the next three months second you can now get up to 10 back by using the mco visa card on food and grocery shopping lastly you could buy gift cards on the crypto.com app from merchants like whole foods safeway burger king and more and get 20 back on food and 10 back on groceries download the crypto.com app today back to my conversation with mike mcglone i was especially interested in the part of your report that talked about bitcoin's price versus the on-chain indicators what do you see happening there well i use a lot of data i can every i look i view as many stores as i can and one of his coin metrics the key thing i get from there is address is used i use the 30 day average of addresses use it just reached the highest since july i just look for anything that's a high correlation in the past and july is when bitcoin averaged around ten dollars the other um other metric i find that has a high correlation with price or somewhat predictive of price is trans transactions um transaction adjusted transactions and then of course hash rate hash rates is more of the bigger picture the transactions have lagged a little bit but you you combine that with what's happening with open interest and i see pretty strong signs of of interest and adoption um from the market so bitcoin around 10 000 makes sense with the way just looking at auto scale for last few years with um addresses used now address is used i like some in a better way because i see bitcoin transitioning to gold meaning yes it's great for trading but it's probably better to you know just kind of buy slowly and not spend and one other event that's on the horizon that everyone's discussing is of course the having what effect do you think that will have on the price in the short and medium term yeah i was hoping i was expecting we'd get there laura because it's the classic differentiation and having obviously matters in the big picture but from a macro market person's standpoint it's a known known everybody knows it's there everybody talks about it in the big picture it just looks i just it just the actual process been happening people will use that as an excuse as it for going up but it's you know we've known this forever but the key factor is if i look at it from supply standpoint if you look at supply of bitcoin on an annual basis last year it was around three percent the year before it's four percent year before is like six percent but the next few years it's going down to two percent and one percent and getting down so you see where it's going and that to me is a key thing as as the bottom line is we know there's gonna be no supply unless something happens i can't predict so the only thing that matters is adoption so i look at the having as meh okay i get it but it's part of the macro big picture when i compare it to gold is over time gold supply historically has been two percent and if it goes up they're going to bring on the old mines and they're bringing on more you can't do that with bitcoin so to me i guess i i average i understand is every day about 1800 coins are created a day and as of a couple weeks from now it's going to be 900 a day so when people talk about the cost of mining it just doesn't matter it used to but going forward it's not because of those 21 million total almost 90 percent have already been you know created and that's why i look at it as a collectible half the having is just part of that you know it's it's just it's great banter so we've only been discussing bitcoin up until this point and so does all of this come down to bitcoin or how would you expect some of these factors to affect the rest of the crypto market in particular some blockchains that have also gotten traction such as ethereum well so bitcoins about seven times the next uh most you know highest aum um crypto ethereum which is pretty significant and i view it as bitcoin is unique um it's no one else's liability it trades its adoption is completely picking up if you compare its hash rate compared to every other coin the most notably ethereum bitcoin is is off the charts so it's the one that's just done it's created it's been adopted ethereum the problem is i look at there's 5 400 other cryptos okay some that's somewhat subjective there's just too much supply too much ease of entry and too much competition for me to really care and that's why i look at ethereum and then i say okay well there's eos and you know i get it it's just not the one that's gaining the traction and adoption it doesn't have futures maybe it'll get there but i view the rest of the space as kind of a gaggle now really mattered before but now in this macro environment it's bitcoin and partly because just look at the adoption it's the one to that you can trust it's where you can get the liquidity and the bottom line thing you learn in trading and i learned in futures it's the depth if you need to buy or sell a large quantity you're going to get that in bitcoin and what about what would you say will happen with the adoption of some of the centralized stable coins such as libra tether or some of the central bank digital currencies that are in the works my bottom line is the outlook when i hear anything about tether or libra is it increases and proves my outlook for the appreciation of the price of bitcoin here's the main reason why the key inflection point in 2019 when bitcoin was kind of on the way on its way down and everybody pooh-poohed tether i was in hong kong two years ago and you know they just loved kryptos partly because they need to get away from china and they just hated tether and i remember pointing out well look at the aum that's all that matters to me so when the the new york attorney general came down and tethered and the market didn't care that flipped a switch for me because to me if the market doesn't care i don't care and to me what tether tether is what all the other cryptos want to be and that's currency most of the other kryptos are just speculative digital assets tether is obviously track um you know tethered to the us dollar the world's you know stable currency but it's indicative of what a real currency needs to be stable transactable and then there's a store value bitcoin so i view the appreciation tether is positive and not so good for the other cryptos because they just can't do that but good for bitcoin because it's so unique it's like gold it's no one else's liability look at ethereum you know it's someone else's project in a way and then the key thing is libra libra is also a wannabe it's it's potentially you know stable wants to be a digital currency but it again it just added to my bullish view on bitcoin because it it showed to me how unique bitcoin is no one else's liability and it's just something everybody else wants to be um i mean i don't know if it's gonna work or not but just the fact that people want to create it to me says well there's already something there that is digital store value that i can move my money around in the world on a thumb drive and i don't have to worry about versus you know hearing all these issues in physical gold lately there has to be some form of digital store value it's it's bitcoin and then i look at things like um you know we we hear a lot about you know one of the major for people are all going cashless i mean the world's going cashless and some of them my primary ways to do that is in this country notably is credit cards but there's someone in between getting two to three percent of that exchange that just does not make sense when interest rates are zero so um i view all the stable coins and potential you know digital ass assets i should say um sovereign um digital assets um like in china and even in the us as getting into that space where you'll be able to transact i know there's privacy things but you don't have to have that credit card in between and taking your two to three percent most notably from the emergent so it sounds like you think that adoption of centralized stable coins or central bank digital currencies well is like a foregone conclusion it's just a matter of time unless you think technology is going backwards i mean i i'm in my home in connecticut i look up to my garage i have electric car i got electric panels on my house i mean this is just this is just where things are going and what would you say about something like a decentralized stable coin such as dye don't know much about it um but because it's it doesn't help me um get a better view of what's going to happen with the price of other cryptos or bitcoin but that's more the space that a lot of your other guests will cover that's more business side but i think those kind of things are just a matter of time i just don't know much about it because my primary focus as strategists is this where this is where the price is going and why and um it doesn't really help give me an indication and well so but to go back to that i mean if one of the you know obviously you cover commodities and people have talked about ether as um sort of like a digital oil oil used for running the ethereum virtual machine what do you think of that theory yeah um sure that works but there's a lot of competitors oh meaning like other smart contract platforms yeah no i just i can't you know i just mentioned eos one of them because i was at bloomberg we have we launched the bloomberg galaxy crypto index we worked closely with mike novogratz and he was a big fan of eos so but i just see that as um they're just yeah ethereum yeah great helped created a lot of the you know a lot of the other coins and things but it's just not it's in a macro standpoint from what's happening in the world for with money and things bitcoin is obviously gold and ethereum is just another one of the five 000 other cryptos out there and i also wanted to get your opinion of this trend in decentralized finance is that an area that you're watching and if so where do you expect it will go oh definitely watching and a lot of it i get from your program listening to your guests laura but um for me i think it's just a matter of time most notably what's with what's what with what's happening in the world but um i don't know how that's gonna really impact prices so much because if anything decentralized finance needs a stable something for stabilized stable to transact like the dollar average annual volatility the dollar is what uh five six percent bitcoin it's 80 and a lot of the other cryptos it's over 100 that's just not practical for transactions that's speculative speculation so but my my bottom line is that that helps this the trend that way helps me think if that's successful that means a digital store value like bitcoin is going to gain more traction more adoption which which is improves the outlook for the price yeah and actually there was a new version of bitcoin what they call a trustless bridge um that like basically you can uh use your bitcoin as collateral in d5 and so we'll see what happens when um you know how this works with the digital goals being used in the device space um well anyway it's been so fun having you on the show thanks for coming on unconfirmed well thanks for having me i i i'm actually i never write my outlooks without listening to your program and i have since we've been locked up lately i haven't been listening as much because i don't commute as much but i always use you're you've i really appreciate the education that you provide in this space it really helps me formulate my opinions and my views which i publish great thank you so much yeah and i i know people have told me they listen on their commute or at the gym and i'm like hmm i wonder what they're doing now i wonder when they're listening to i guess people have to tweet at me and let me know all right um well thanks again thanks for having me hey everyone time now for this week in crypto first headline telegram delays its launch due to regulatory battle telegram has postponed the launch of its ton blockchain to april of 2021 and offered to return 1.2 billion to investors after a judge ruled that telegram could not launch its blockchain or issue gram tokens until its case with the sec was resolved last fall the agency charged telegram which had a 1.7 billion ico in early 2018 withholding an unregistered securities offering coindesk reports that the company is now offering to return up to 72 percent of each investor's stake but has also given its investors the option of lending their investment to telegram until a year from now it quotes the letter as saying as a token of gratitude for your trust and ton we are also offering you an alternative option to receive 110 of your original investment by april 30th 2021. which is 53 percent higher than the termination amount read the full coindesk article for some juicy details include indicating that the decision to postpone the launch was made at the 11th hour next headline a16z kryptos second fund raises 515 million dollars after its first fund of 300 million a16z crypto has announced a second fund partners chris dixon and katie han wrote up a blog post about the areas within crypto that they're excited about including next generation payments modern store of value decentralized finance new ways for creators to monetize and web 3. next headline ethereum's not any more centralized than bitcoin an analysis of ethereum's top 10 000 wallets adam cochran partner at metacartel ventures wrote up a 109 tweet tweet storm on his analysis of the top ten thousand holders in ethereum not counting smart contracts such as the wrapped ether smart contracts he found that the top ten thousand addresses represented fifty six point seven percent of all eth which he says is basically the same as bitcoin's top ten thousand holders who hold fifty seven point four percent of the bitcoin supply in comparison 16 xrp addresses own 55 percent of xrp 300 litecoin addresses own 54 of ltc and 1031 addresses own 51 percent of tron's trx he writes this means when it comes to equity of distribution ethereum and bitcoin are in a league of their own no other coin comes with an order of magnitude of their distribution he also makes an estimate of what the yields would be under a proof-of-stake system in ethereum finding that early adopters might obtain something like 12 to 20 yield i urge you to read the whole thread which is actually much longer and contains many more nuggets of information than what i was able to to give you here and there is also a version available on sub stack and on medium although oddly i personally found the tweetstorm to be the most readable next headline uma's initial uniswap offering permissionless price discovery or manipulative as hell the token sale for uma protocol on uniswap caused a bit of controversy delphi digital did a great analysis titled uma is listing on uniswap in four hours we can already tell you what will happen i'm just gonna urge you guys to read this because i actually cannot do justice to this post here but long story short because you uma was listing only two percent of its tokens and because of uniswap's constant product model the writer analyst jan lieberman was able to predict that the uma token price could not go below its starting point he wrote quote the 2 million starting in the pool establishes the floor price and the constant product aspect of uniswap ensures that even if prices increase considerably a massive sell-off would still end with prices never going below that starting point on crypto twitter the way this played out did not garner accolades as rick burton who's active in defy said quote the fully diluted valuation ripped through 120 million dollars plus for a promising team with a protocol that is still in development or as adam cochrane of medicare cartel ventures put it manipulative as hell suzhou of three arrows called it arguably skimmier than actual icos playing defense was co-founder hart lamber of uma who tweeted my view initial price discovery is really hard this wasn't a perfect attempt and in hindsight rick burton is right we should have upped the communication but this was a genuine attempt at permissionless price discovery other options aren't great chris burniske of placeholder who has invested in uma also tweeted uma protocol has decided to publicly release uma starting at the same network valuation that seed investors paid and he followed up with another tweet saying the options would have been to cater to centralized exchanges or seek further illiquid and bespoke private market valuations uma opted for a novel low-cost and permissionless price discovery process uma co-founder alison liu solicited community feedback and said quote i felt that it made more logical sense to have this convo after the token had a price and feel awful that it came off as anything else next headline hedgic typo creates ruckus if after the bzx and d-force attacks you didn't get the memo that the security in d5 is questionable a kerfuffle last weekend about on-chain options protocol hedgic is a good reminder on saturday april 25th hatchik tweeted an alert saying quote a typo has been found in the code because of that liquidity and expired options contracts can't be unlocked for new options please exercise all of your action active options contracts now everyone will be 100 refunded with the amount of premium that you paid for options this prompted a number of responses similar to this one by hudson jameson of the ethereum foundation who tweeted it's a bug not a typo you're downplaying the severity of the bug in a series of tweets trail of bits ceo dan guido tweeted in three days earlier this month we identified 10 critical flaws and hedging options that could harm users we noted a lack of tests a lack of documentation and that the time afforded to review their code was insufficient bottom line we told them to hold off deploying maria paula fernandez summed it up as quote to those late to the party a summary we can all get trail of bits basically told hedgic to not go out but because they were too wasted and wearing a tube top and hatchet went out had a wardrobe malfunction and ruined everything and said trail of vids didn't mention that tube tops and drinks don't mix uh next headline a number of defy users still small but growing exponentially richard chen partner at one confirmation wrote up a great post arguing that total value locked is not the best metric by which to judge d5 popularity because that figure can be driven by fluctuations in the price of eth and also because d5 is dominated by whales so he looked at total number of users for defy across the number of projects including kyber which had more than 62 000 unique trader addresses uniswap which has almost 52 000 unique liquidity provider and trader addresses compound which had nearly 28 000 unique lender and provider addresses as well as other big d5 projects he finds that the total number of unique addresses across all projects is a bit over 150 000 users and says quote at the current growth rate of 0.56 percent daily we'd expect to see 1 million defy users by march 2021 and 10 million by may 2022 we shall see all right fun bits crypto twitter shadow band so this is not actually actually fun necessarily but it seemed worth mentioning and yet this is also random enough that it didn't really go in their regular headlines so i'm going to put it here a number of crypto twitter people such as anthony cesano niraj agrawal linda shea nick carter mike dudes and jeff garczyk believe that their notifications and twitter impressions have been down over the last few days so actually i don't really tweet all that much but i think perhaps that maybe this is also happening to me too it's unclear why but if you like following crypto people on twitter maybe set up a dedicated stream for them
