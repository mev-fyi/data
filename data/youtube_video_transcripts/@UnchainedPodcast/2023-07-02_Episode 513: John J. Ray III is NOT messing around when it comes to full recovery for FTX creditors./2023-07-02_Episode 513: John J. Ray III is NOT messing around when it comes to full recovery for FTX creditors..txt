when I spoke with John in person at a detwire event in New York he was pretty candid that hey we're going to look into all this stuff but at the end of the day like I don't really you know I don't really care if we restart or not uh I just want to get 100 repay for creditors and I'm gonna do try whatever means I can to get that and and so I think of course they're entertaining it if someone's going to make a 200 million dollars cash in the balance sheet and we'll run everything and you know there's cop there's high confidence around that I think he's going to be very open to that so the process right now is a little ad hoc it's not very like streamlined um if you get an what will happen Laura is if you get one bid very similar to Celsius that kind of sets the tone for the structure that people want to see or what the estate's willing to accept then you'll see people reading that offer and saying like oh that's really good we can do better than that and so you'll see topping offers on that
