avoid blockchain terms like crypto or nfts Reddit refers to nfts as digital Collectibles and only briefly mentions that they will be available on the blockchain with some more user-friendly approach trading volumes have soared over the past few days reaching a sales volume of 2.5 million on Monday Kane and Linder co-founder and CEO of gaming company Stardust told the block I think that decontextualization that these are just games these are just Collectibles these are just items you can take from one game to another it's going to make this technology so much more accessible updated policy terms give Apple a hefty cut of nft app purchases Tech Giant Apple updated its app store policy terms to give more clarity on how to sell nfts and crypto within the iOS ecosystem as per the new terms applications offering trading of nfts will be restricted from including buttons external links or other calls to action that direct consumers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchases

are likely to be crypto exchanges web 3 games and infrastructure providers nft royalty drama continues looks rare an nft Marketplace on ethereum decided to remove mandatory royalties from its platform joining others like pseudoswap x2y2 and Magic Eden instead each quarter the protocol will distribute to creators 25 of the platform fees charged by looks rare the pseudonymous looks rare co-founder

eth a jump in prices triggers talk of a bull market the crypto markets experienced some relief for a couple of days after weeks of falling prices ethereum jumped by 20 percent in the past seven days reaching pre-merge price levels meanwhile the price of Bitcoin Rose eight percent in the same period and the total crypto market cap surpassed the one trillion dollar Mark once again this rally wiped out almost 1 billion dollars worth of short positions and already triggered talks of an incoming bull market a potential reason why eth has outperformed the market is that the token has gone deflationary over the past few weeks with its Supply getting close to pre-merge levels the market share of Bitcoin against all coins hit a two-year high this week some believe that this is a good sign for altcoins since BTC usually leads the way prior to an altcoin pump cryptotrader and analyst Arthur Hayes thinks this pump in the markets has to do with the possibility of the U.S treasury quote supplying the market with more short-term t-bills to alleviate a shortage other people mentioned perhaps jokingly that the reason the prices spiked was the publication of Matt Levine's 40 000 word
