design lets you minimize transaction costs and maximize your speed consistency and user experience to experience web3 like never before head to avox.network to learn more with the crypto.com app you can buy earn and spend crypto in one place download and get twenty five dollars with the code laura link in the description today's guest is mika honkasalo independent crypto researcher welcome mika happy to be here this has been yet another huge news week in crypto with one big lender centralized lender celsius and one big trading firm three arrows capital both teetering on the edge let's just start with the very basic news it all began with cryptolender celsius tweeting out sunday night celsius is pausing all withdrawals swap and transfers between accounts in may celsius reported having 11.8 billion under management with 1.7 million customers why don't you explain what it is that celsius does what this news meant and why it was so significant sales is one of these sort of fintech layers on top of d5 and allowing sort of basic crypto capabilities like buying and selling crypto they also had services for earning yield a lot of that was derived from d5 sources and then also the ability to sort of borrow against your crypto so kind of like this kind of fintech layer on top of the existing crypto ecosystem what happened here was in celsius case it was very interesting that there were sort of rumors that started quite early already and i don't think people really realized what was happening and how uh how strange the situation might get but there were early on just these weird signs sort of on chain that you could see something happening that really shouldn't specifically like them selling their sds positions or people suspecting that it was them and from there i think it just sort of snowballed a lot and the information started to come out more and more and i think first people were a bit downplaying it but then uh people started to realize that the situation could be quite serious and they could actually be a borderline installment and so you mentioned st staked eve why don't you describe what that is for listeners and why this could cause an issue for celsius staked and i think you'll see this as a theme of of a lot of these mistakes that have been made is a financial instrument within crypto and and misunderstanding of that final financial instrument how it works and how it should be priced really is like at the cause of a lot of these things so st is simply a derivative of ethereum that gives you two things it allows you to access the yield that's already on the ethereum two chain so this like the inflation from proof of stake and then you'll able to be able to redeem that derivative to the underlying collateral eth in about a year or so or maybe a bit over a year and this instrument has traded on par with ease like one to one or most of its history but since people started to be maybe a bit more skeptical about what each of these financial instruments should be priced at after the ust and luna collapse the price has started to drop and one of the first indicators really that something was wrong was that celsius started selling their st on the market and this is something that you wouldn't really do unless it was kind of a bad situation because you should have sort of known what you're getting into and you know that when those are redeemable and really the only way that it can create a problem for you is if you're mismanaging risk and and you are in a very bad position where you actually have to start selling this asset that only has a certain amount of liquidity on decentralized and centralized exchanges and when you have to start selling that position that's like a pretty big red flag that something is going wrong yeah and even just to take a step back for people the reason um that steak teeth exists is because if you want to actually stake eath on the beacon chain in ethereum two then that locks it up and there's no liquidity so that's what the purpose of this derivative is is to enable you to actually still use that ether even though technically you um have it staked and so essentially it's like when you say that they were selling it and correct me if i'm wrong but my understanding is that it's sort of like this long-term asset and yes you have this other asset that represents it but by selling it that indicates like you need that money right now which technically if if you you know have it locked up then then like it should be money that you wouldn't need at that moment exactly the misunderstanding most of the market seems to be making is that st was supposed to be somehow pegged to the east price which isn't the case at all there's no reason for the derivative to trade out on par with eth arguably it doesn't have to it can be priced at whatever the market wants to price it and that should be okay in under any normal circumstance but yeah if you're now here forced to sell that position that's very strange and and the situation that uh celsius found themselves in so the time of this recording it's not clear whether celsius is illiquid or or truly insolvent but i think most people would say that no matter what after this debacle the company is essentially done for since they've lost people's trust and why does it appear that at least so far its competitors nexo and blockfi haven't yet been hit so hard and i should also make a disclosure that nexo is a former sponsor of my show well i think you have to take a few steps back here and one of the words being used all the time right now is contagion and how things affect each other and this problem probably really starts from the the luna ust debacle and it's likely that they were quite exposed to that that means that there's some amount of money that they expected to be tied to the u.s dollar that simply went to zero and based on how large those losses are mixed in with some suspected defile asset that they have they've had over over the last year that's what really put them in a bad position so it really comes down to risk management within these firms and it's just that this company doesn't seem to have done a good job and and it's really as simple as that all the due diligence for understanding that what the downside case may be with luna and ust that was available there all the issues that steve may have that was all available there it's just that i think during the bull market no one was really doing too much due diligence everyone's just jumping into things and this is the end result when things become adverse and suddenly not everything goes up and you have to really think about what should be the correct price for some of these assets yeah and just to highlight some of those defy hacks that hit celsius one was that they lost maybe about 22 million dollars from the badger dow hack and there was another one um unfortunately i i put this in my notes and i forgot to put the name of the actual hack but in that one they lost 35 000 each which at at this moment is worth 39 million dollars i'm sure at the time of the hack is worth a lot more because you know as you mentioned they appear to have had a different strategy potentially riskier strategy for investing its customers assets nexo threw some shade at celsius by tweeting that they would offer to buy some of celsius's assets this week but one thing i wanted to ask about was that you mentioned that they probably had exposure to tara and for those of you who have you know been following everything that happened postera nansen did a report on all the wallets that triggered the terra collapse and one of them actually was a celsius wallet so from that report it sort of appears that at least that one celsius celsius wallet was able to exit terra unscathed so are you saying that celsius must have had other wallets that were also invested in terra and then lost money from that it would certainly explain a lot because when you're just calculating up the losses and the customer funds and the funds they've raised it's likely that they would have lost like physicians in luna but it's these are always obviously difficult to verify you can see this dynamic where the information that we really get in the market that's good that's the defy information and things we can see on chain but then everything we can't see on chain is a suspect and you don't know who owns what wallets and they may not be perfectly tagged and that sort of thing so ultimately it's like impossible to know but it would certainly help explain losses in the lunar ecosystem have certainly explained like some other volatility that has happened also in the market recently so it would be very surprising to make those losses without losing money there in a sense all right so in a moment we're going to talk about three euros capital which is what you were alluding to but first a quick word from the sponsors who made

subnets are already seeing rapid adoption across d5 and gaming applications as builders have a clear path to scaling their project for user demand today while future proofing their infrastructure to support mainstream adoption experience web3 like never before scale with subnets head to avox.network to learn more back to my conversation with mika so actually before we turned to three arrows i did want to just kind of look ahead to what might happen for celsius's investors the wall street journal reported that at least the venture investors in celsius are unlikely to provide more funds to build a company out and the wall street journal also reported that the company appears to have hired over some restructuring lawyers so at this point what would you say is most likely to happen not just to celsius but also to their customers and those customers funds there's really no reason for investors to bail the company out because it's obviously like a dead company and any money you put in would be a loss at this point so i understand the investor point of view very well then it's just a question of how bad the financial situation really is and that one we don't know on how much like users will get back uh when withdrawals uh will with resume it's almost impossible to know actually like how bad the situation is and how it plays out for individual users and i'm not a lawyer but there's also a question of question marks around how much like they have to pay back in what scenario as well so yeah at this point it's just a waiting game and seeing how bad the situation is i think people suspect it is quite bad overall but it's really impossible to know but i mean the company i think is quite obviously done and no investor should put their money in money and help them out going forward yeah i definitely worry about their retail customers at this point let's now talk about three eros capital because after everyone was abuzz with what was potentially happening at celsius rumors began swirling that three arrows capital was being margin called or insolvent again at the time of recording nothing's been confirmed but it's clear that the company is in a bad place let's explain to people what three arrows capital is and then why it is that they believe that three euros capital is in trouble three arrows is uh basically a crypto hedge fund that also has done quite a bit of venture investing um with very prominent sort of figures uh suture and carl davis within the crypto community and what makes that uh situation and basically they're in in a situation where it looks like they've been margin called a margin called a lot and and are if not insolvent like all basically there uh that seems to be a pretty safe assumption and that one is so surprising because a lot of industry players trusted them they're a very large name and that's really where you have when celsius is a story about contagion within like retail and how cryptos is seen by the outside public uh three arrows really is more about what industry players were at risk and how much with them so yeah it's been a pretty surprising situation and that's definitely one where no one saw it coming when the rumors started swirling no one really believed them and because it seems almost impossible for a smart investor like them to be in a situation where btc is at like 25 30k and then you are actually liquidated entirely it's it's completely different to be down a lot versus actually being in a in an insolvency situation and where you can't pay your landers and things like that so that one is really surprising because people just assume that they wouldn't go this far and and especially at this kind of price point which is historically not even such a large drop for btc so how can a player who's so well versed in the industry not be able to survive like such a simple thing actually it's it's something that everyone should be prepared for quick correction three arrows capital is actually primarily a proprietary trading firm though it did do some venture investing with limited partners however the vast majority of the operation was trading with the general partners own money and so just explain a little bit about these margin calls so what positions would they have had and then like what puts them in this position of being margin called and liquidated in its simplicity they were borrowing to go long and they were in some form or another uh there may be like complex ways in which they've done it but in some form or another they were along the market a lot to be put in this situation so yeah it's really one where i think they probably also got pretty good terms from like landing desks and other companies that they work with because they're such a trusted partner i think that makes it sort of all the more worse in this case so earlier i was actually surprised that you know you seem to to sort of express surprise at their position because i think pretty early on it was known that three euros capital was one of the firms that was affected by tara's collapse so i imagine that that probably kicked things off is is that the case and if so how badly do you think that that kind of triggered the rest of the story for them yeah that one triggered the story for them in the sense that they would probably have made pretty big losses they were very big investors in luna we don't know if they did anything with ust or spent money trying to defend the peg at the time but there's a huge difference i think between just being down a lot being down 90 percent and actually being in a position where you're levered long and can't pay your debts it's more understandable to make a loss and just be wrong about stuff than than to manage risk that poorly i think that's the part that is really surprising so i think it's good to make that distinction and then so what happened this week to send three arrows capital into a crisis situation i think it's just the price of btc dropping ultimately that that meant that their portfolio wasn't performing and they were long the industry overall it's hard to know like what the specifics are but in some sense they were just long btc and must have been long btc on margin so they also had the exact same thing as celsius which was a thirty thousand eighth cell into the curve the std cell into the curve pool which is the classic sign of disaster apparently right now that everyone can sort of see and that that's one where you're actually worried again that why are they market selling this then this is it's so weird such weird behavior so overall i think it just comes down to yes there are positions probably within their portfolio that have done really poorly over time they've been long publicly things like avax and solana and those are down a lot so it's btc and eth but again being long spot and being down is very different from actually going insolvent which they seem to have managed in this case right yeah not not yet confirmed so we'll we'll see what you know what uh eventually we find out but as we discussed earlier celsius's troubles will hit its retail customers who gets hurt if three arrows goes under this is quite clearly the large landing desk who they do business with so you'd expect the usual suspect names that are the biggest sort of blockfi and genesis and others to be involved in some way i think blockfly already said that that they are in a pretty good position and this doesn't affect them much but generally those are the types of name you're looking at and they will be the ones who are taking on pretty big losses here i would be surprised if any of them actually took such a big loss that it's it's really existential to their business in any way then you would have to look at their risk management as well and surely some of those practices will have to be improved after this but there is money lost here clearly and it comes with their counterparties and their counterparties are also things like they make funds under fund investments those funds are expecting them to to participate in capital calls that won't be happening in all likelihood so there are a bunch of industry players who are who are tied to i also saw that a company called eight blocks trading tweeted that it had been trading out of one of three ac's trading accounts and they said that three ac took one million dollars of of their money so in that case are they is it just if three euros decides to give them the money back like what happens to a trading partner like that the feeling is pretty much that they may have been going around and this is unconfirmed but going around a little bit and just trying to borrow from everyone sort of unsecured at the last minute and what this capital was used for it's unclear probably is some margin calls or or something like that seems most likely here so yeah these are when you're one of these partners it sort of depends on the specific legal contract you have with them but you may be trading and doing specific strategies within the market using their funds let's just delta neutral strategies which this firm and you mentioned seems to have done so in that case this is one where i sort of hesitate because i'm not a lawyer but it starts to get really really questionable the actions accent when you get to this level so obviously uh it would be huge news if uh both celsius and three arrows capital had their demise uh right now and so as we mentioned it looks like you know the writing's on the wall for both of them nothing's been confirmed but if indeed both of them go under what effect would all of this have on the industry i would say that three arrows leads to some industry losses are just two very important players and celsius it's the aforementioned retail trust and and how we're able to as an industry build that over time again is is a big question but i think in the big picture the worry isn't necessarily even what happened here the worry is that does it stop here and also if the market goes under 20k under previous all-time highs is that a situation where you would actually see other players be in a similar situation and also have mismanaged risk in sort of similar ways so i'm not even that worried about the specific cases here but i would be worried that others have behaved in a similar manner and they would be in sort of a close close proximity from the current price point and that that is sort of a really bad scenario and would lead to a pretty big flush out so the things were monitoring monitoring going forward are what who's the next one who's the next one who is sort of part of this line of the current line and then also who are the new names who may come up if price goes under 20k specifically whether or not we see a lot of this type of thing happen at that specific price point because it's right below the all-time highs it's a a previous all-time highs it's a nice round number and it feels like there may be some risk right below there and are there any particular types of companies that you will be keeping your eye on it has to be funds funds who are leveraged and the and the landing desks who participate in in those actions those those are the large ones anyone who has touched high defy yields taken too much risk on behalf of their customers i think in that case you see a lot of maybe smaller companies than celsius celsius is just a big name but sort of the smaller versions of them who could be in a similar situation who probably are so yeah i think it's sort of the same batch of mismanagement and uh same type of companies that we've seen be in trouble up until this point who would also be in trouble sort of going forward and do you think that blockfise and nexos and any similar centralized lending companies that those would be ones that people should keep their eyes on or potentially pull their funds out from i would and it is very difficult to justify holding your btc or usdc with a lender who has actively participated in some of this more questionable side of d5 not like the core device is working very well but some of the stuff that like ust and luna that has broken so i think people should really look at the company and look at how they behave and do they seem like an institution that that would go so far out in a risk curve that they are in trouble in a situation like this so i think there are companies who operate very very differently to others in this space and this really is a situation where maybe the other company has been able to bring in customers with better yields and things like that but the companies who have been really long-term thinking all the time who may have struggled in some cases because of that i think those are really the big winners here because now the strong companies survive and they will be like the next generation of winners and for the next a cycle that we have if if there ever is one that will be that won't have some of these names that made mistakes and it will have as its biggest names the companies that survive so i think there is a sort of a positive silver lining to take from this yeah yeah that makes sense i think that's why when the rumors were going around that someone had attacked tara and set this off people were like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter how this happened because if they couldn't survive then you know they shouldn't so anyway all right well thank you so much for explaining all this it has been a pleasure having you on unchained it's been a pleasure

year-to-date kraken's ceo gets political invites unhappy employees to leave the new york times reported that kraken ceo jesse powell sparked an internal culture war at the crypto exchange powell has allegedly led company-wide discussions on topics like the usage of preferred pronouns when using the n-word is okay and whether kraken employees should be able to arm themselves powell an early bitcoiner with roots as far back as mount gox was cited as describing american women as brainwashed on the company slack in addition kraken also published a company-wide culture document alongside a jet ski program because they want people who are leaving to feel like they are hopping on a jet ski and heading happily to their next adventure that allows anyone who disagrees with the company to

someone strongly dislikes or hates working here or thinks those here are hateful or have poor character work somewhere that doesn't disgust you the sec is investigating insider trading at crypto exchanges according to fox business the u.s securities and exchange commission launched an inquiry into whether crypto exchanges have proper safeguards in place to prevent insider trading on their platforms fox reports that the sec has sent a letter to one of the major crypto exchanges requesting information on its current insider trading safeguards the sec did not immediately respond to fox's request to comment coin center is suing the irs here's why coincenter has filed a lawsuit against the treasury department arguing that a crypto tax reporting requirement from last year's infrastructure bill is unconstitutional the requirement called 6050i which goes into effect in 2024 and which some of you may recall was covered on unchained last fall would require u.s taxpayers to report the social security numbers and other personal information of anyone who sends them more than ten thousand dollars in cryptocurrency this is problematic as coin center explains in its lawsuit because the reporting mandate would force americans using cryptocurrency to share intrusive details about themselves both with each other and with the federal government coin center argues that such detailed reporting could have a negative impact on transactional privacy in the u.s the reports would give the government an unprecedented level of detail about transactions within a realm where users have taken a series of steps to protect their transactional privacy they conclude in practice the amendments reporting mandate would often be impossible to comply with because its terms do not
