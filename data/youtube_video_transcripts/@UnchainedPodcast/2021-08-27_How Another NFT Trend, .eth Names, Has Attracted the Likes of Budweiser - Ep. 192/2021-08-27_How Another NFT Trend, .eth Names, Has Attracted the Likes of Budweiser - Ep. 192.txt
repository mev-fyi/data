reimbursed up to one hundred dollars today's guest is nick johnson creator and lead developer of the ethereum name service welcome nick pleasure to be here so you're the creator of the ethereum news service and that's been around for quite a while but this week has been quite the week for ens with even budweiser getting in on your invention why don't you start first by telling us what it is that ens is and then we can talk about that so enes's basic job is to enable users to use simple human usable human readable names uh like nick.eth instead of big long identifiers like 0x 0x1234 etc etc or access content on distributed hosting sites like ipfs via simple human readable names as well it works not just for ethereum names but also for pretty much every blockchain in existence and we've been working since about 2017 to get it rolled out to as many integrations and wallets and apps as possible oh wow okay i wasn't even aware that it was um i mean it's called ethereum name service but uh that's great that it's a multi-chain service um so let's talk about the budweiser news budweiser bought beer dot eth so what would a company like budweiser do with an address like uh i mean first off there's a good chance that you know they wanted the attention it brings of course and so we've obliged them the whole community with that it seems i guess the things that come to mind are if they're going to be uh offering up their own nfts or anything like that then it gives them a public profile to do so from uh they can host distributed content on it so you could if your browser has metamask for instance or if you're using brave or opera you can just go to be a dot ether in the browser and it will show you their distributed website uh you know possibly they they could sell beer for eth but i think that's slightly less likely and probably people wouldn't take advantage of that um so when people so p it's both for receiving but even also for displaying yeah so uh one thing we've been focusing a lot on recently is ens as a universal username and ens for sign in and so with that if they're if you have set up your username and say you post a bid on openc on something or you vote on a snapshot or anything like that it will show your ens name uh instead of your address and recently in fact etherscan added support for that so you can actually see transactions is coming from and going to ens names oh interesting and so how did you come up with this idea in the first place i was hired by the ethereum foundation uh back in 2016 uh shortly after the launch uh originally to work on swarm uh and one of the first things i did on swarm team was they were looking for a naming service of some kind because they had distributed content similar to ipfs they needed a way to host it in a human accessible fashion and so i was already very interested in naming systems i've done a bit of stuff with dns in the past and it was sort of failed to me to figure out how this should work in a distributed fashion and there were existing sort of very basic naming systems that people put together on ethereum but they were all extremely limited so i see how to create something that was more versatile and expandable and generally useful so ethereum domain names are nfts basically but it's not what people typically think of when they think of an nft so amidst this nft craze that we're seeing has the growth in um ethereum names been as explosive as we've seen for the art editor it is it's really surprised us in fact this month we're set to hit two million dollars in registration and renewal fees which is double our previous high water mark people are clearly very enthusiastic about uh dot eth names at the moment just as they are about uh art nfts and so what are people doing with them now typically i think the the most common by far is people buy them to to use them as as identifiers for receiving ethan tokens and nfts and so forth and you know to a lesser degree on other blockchains which is uh you know supported by a number of wallets um secondarily people buy them to host distributed content there's also a degree of sort of buying them for flex you know somehow uh you know back in i don't know 2017 or 2018 i set my ens name as my twitter handle and since then it's become like almost a universal and group identifier for ethereum which is really weird uh i mean it's great but it's it's not what i expected um and so i think a lot of people get it because they're sort of expected to um but with the number of integrations now it means that effectively you can use it anywhere you would use an address which has always been our long-term goal and so how should people handle privacy issues around these names because um obviously if our blockchain addresses show our financial history or at least some of it for instance i probably wouldn't want to have a business transaction sent to my daughter's name or i would want to make a big payment from it so kind of how how are people handling that or how do you suggest that yeah it's privacy is kind of a thorny issue on public ledgers in general and ens kind of highlights it rather than worsening it because when it's associated with a name it's suddenly a lot more obvious that oh yes actually all of this stuff is public whereas when you're looking at addresses you can fool yourself that oh well probably people won't make the connection and so sort of we recommend people take the same sort of privacy steps that make sense in general and so we have existing privacy tools such as tornado cache and the the best general idea is maintain a fairly clean public-facing persona accounts that you use for things you're happy for everybody to see like the nfts you want to show off or you know whatever spending money you have for coffee or to pay for dinner or whatnot and then use anonymity services like tornado cash or an extremist you can use a centralized exchange to send funds uh to and from your your own accounts which you keep private oh interesting okay so so if i receive something there that i decide i don't want other people to see then i should use tornado cache to basically send it to a wallet that nobody knows is connected to me so yeah pretty much it's uh you know it's generally a good idea even if you don't have an es name set up to try and uh separate out uh the funds that and the the assets that you're happy having associated with the account you've made publicly known uh from those that uh you know you'd rather sort of keep on the down low because for your own privacy and i also would like to ask about situations like how vitalik earlier this year received a lot of tokens that he did not ask for from the shiba and akita communities and i feel like there was one another that i'm just blanking on but um you know i don't know how much of an issue that is but i have seen on certain other blockchains that um particularly if they're ones with low transaction fees that sometimes people do spam certain well-known addresses so how should people do well i think it's uh to a degree it's it's a vitalik problem in that uh you know not many of us are so famous that people just like randomly send us money because they think it's good for their business model and you know in one extent i think actually what vitalik did was a very good way to discourage that sort of thing for everybody going forwards because you know people had fooled themselves that oh well you know we'll just send it there and for some reason we've decided that he's gonna like sit on it and not spend it because it's metallic i guess and he went well no actually i don't want my wallet to be a dumping ground for all of the stuff if you send it there i'm going to donate it to public goods and you know if you don't want that to happen don't send it but i guess the the broader issue is just that there's no way to control what people send to you and so part of that is you know you can set it to burn addresses you can uh you know you can sort of acknowledge that uh your public profile you you don't have direct control over what's sent to it and i think people need to exercise a degree of skepticism when they look at somebody else's address that oh look it's got this you know controversial token or whatever doesn't necessarily mean uh that that person bought it and wanted it there uh you know if somebody else values enough making a mess then they can pay to do so basically yeah yeah it's it's definitely obviously quite different from you know like putting up your own website or something i think it's going to be an interesting problem because uh it's not that sort of abuse is something that platforms like openc haven't really had to deal with much yet but i can make up a uh a token that you know that says uh you know advertises my own  coin or you know is full of profanity or whatever and send it to vitalik and it will show up on his open seat profile and i can even write a custom token that is impossible to transfer away and right now that would just show up there forever dealing with those sort of abuses is something platforms are going to have to figure out options for going forward i think wow a token you can't send away that's interesting um all right so in a moment we're going to discuss a little bit more about how this works plus also dive into some news that ens has but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible today's sponsor is poly market the world's leading information markets platform where you can trade on the most

have an official interface at app.ens doctobanes uh you can simply go there enter the name you want and it will lead you through the process which requires two ethereum transactions uh it's all run by impartial smart contracts on the back end and so there are a couple of other uh sites such as uh my crypto and my ether wallet that support registering uh names through their interface as well and how much does adani's name typically cost so we charge uh or or ens charges uh five dollars a year uh for any domain that's five characters or longer um and then four character names are significantly more expensive at 160 a year and three character names more expensive again at 640 uh dollars a year and that's because those names are correspondingly you know more rare and extremely rare and we didn't want to set up a situation where somebody swooped in right at the beginning and got every three-letter domain and resold it on openc i see there was a period earlier where they were being auctioned off and i can't remember if that's that's not how it's done right now right now so there were a couple of phases where we had something like that when we very first launched uh we used a vickery option a second price auction uh to release all names and the money people put in was was put into a deposit which was refundable if you released the name uh two years after launch we transitioned to the current model the the rent-based model and everyone who had a name under the old system was able to transfer it with the years free registration to the new system uh we also more recently uh the original implementation of ens only permitted registrations of uh seven character and longer names and that was a sort of a deliberate choice to ensure that uh all the short names weren't snapped up when it was still obscure and and new um and so when we reduced that limit to three characters uh we had what we call the short name option where basically all the newly released names were put up for auction at the start okay and how do you handle issues like squatters or imposters who could rank in a lot of money if they use the names of famous people like you know if i create oprah winfrey.eth or something i could probably collect a lot of money but wouldn't be very ethical yeah so so i mean there's sort of two issues here one is uh is squatting for for resale for profit um and we're committed to building a neutral platform that doesn't and in fact can't discriminate based on you know ownership and so forth so the only real mechanism we have there is is setting prices to make it uh cost and effective to try and squat on names you know we try and uh ensure that the price is low enough it's easy for people to register but high enough that you can't just take you know register 10 000 names and resell them all at a profit and the the impersonation issue the way i look at it is that the value of a name comes from it being attested to by the the person who owns it so on its own nobody would go oh i think i'll send some ether to nick.eth because that's probably nick johnson they would first you know find out what is nick's ens name and although oprah winfrey pretty uniquely identifies the celebrity uh anybody just seeing it off the bat is probably not going to immediately assume oh that must definitely be owned by her they would uh you know first verify and that's one reason that like e s names and twitter handles is so amazing because it means that person is asserting that name is my name and you can rely on you know the if you send to it it'll arrive with me and so what happens if i have a certain address associated with my dot youth name and then i lose access to that to those private keys and then can i move that laura shin.ether or whatever my daddy's screen is so we have a distinction in ens between the registrant which is the account that registers and sort of uh ultimately controls the name and the controller which has sort of day-to-day access to update things so one way to avoid that risk is to make sure that you register it the registrant is an account that you have backed up in a secure location and so forth so if you lose access to your day-to-day keys you can always use that account to transfer it to a new account or to update it to point to a new account you know the ultimate issue is this is a self-custody thing and if you really lose access to all of your credentials there's no secure decentralized way to restore that access and that's also part of the reason why we have a yearly renewal instead of a or you know yearly fee rather than a forever registration um is because it means that it reduces the risk that in you know looking far into the future 100 years all the interesting names are owned by people who have uh you know forgotten their keys or lost them or whatnot right which would happen if you didn't have that in place um so you made an announcement today on thursday august 26th which is the day before the show comes out and that had to do with traditional domain names tell us about that so so ens unlike a lot of uh you know competing decentralized name services has committed to to working nicely and integrating well with the existing dns namespace so we have.eth which is our own unique uh top level domain it has its own special properties by virtue of being hosted on ethereum but we want to be part of the global lane space which includes dot com and and every other top level domain you can think of and so we've been working for a long while on integrating that better into ens a couple of years back we we piloted this with supporting.xyz domains on ens just uh yesterday we rolled out support for almost every top level domain uh in the dns route so if you own uh you know comma dot org uh dot domains uh dot you know name the top level domain uh you can now import that into ens and use it as your ens name uh the same way you would use a dot eth name uh and because this always comes up if you have uh lauritian.com and you import it into ens you get laura shin.com not laura shindotti that's a separate name so it allows anyone to use their names directly as they are inside and s as native vns names oh interesting okay yeah i saw people responding to the twitter announcement saying things like oh i got rug pulls me and i took that to mean that they had squatted on some names and then but but you're saying they couldn't have i think people are upset because they were speculatively registering hoping to resell the domains at a profit uh and they view the availability of more top-level domains as reducing the intrinsic value of those domains they hold but we've been very clear since day one that we don't view ens as an investment vehicle it's intended to be a utility you know and it's intended to be a public good that makes it easier to use ethereum we've had on our public roadmap since about 2017 our intention to integrate with dns so uh i you know my own view is that we're pursuing what we've always publicly said we want to do uh if you took a punt on on ens names as a investment that's not something we've ever really intended to support and so you should bear that in mind when you're thinking about buying a name to resell all right well what other new features can we expect to see from ens going forward uh the big thing we're working on at the moment is uh support for layer twos in order to reduce gas costs uh so you know we see ourselves as a public good we don't want to pick one uh layer two and endorse it as the layer 2 3 and s and we're aware that you know ens users use pretty much everything so what we're doing is we're building a platform that will make it possible to move an ens name and all its sub domains to any layer 2 system and then update the records there and anyone who resolves your name like in metamask or any other wallet uh will be able to just transparently resolve it against whatever layer 2 solution you're choosing to use and that's going to massively reduce the gas costs for for updating and registering sub-domains and so forth which layer twos do you intend to support first uh so we're kind of building like a really simple base layer first which is that we'll we're building a framework so you can support anything and that will include your own database on your own server and so forth which most people may not think of as a layer 2 but with the correct signatures can have the same security assumptions beyond that i've built a prototype on optimism and it's currently the one we understand the best and so it'll be the easiest to roll out first i expect beyond layer 2 we're really focusing on the the core usability sort of features of ethereum so into vns and so layer 2 support initially will just support setting your already registered domain to resolve viral layer 2 but we'd like to start to do things like move registration and setting reverse records and so on on to platforms that have lower gas cost as well uh really in the long run we're focused on making things as efficient and easy to use for people as possible we're also really hopeful that this layer 2 support will lead to a really high adoption of wallets assuring names sub domains to their users and so forth which means we'll be able to onboard a whole new group of people who might not have bought their own dot eth

verification requirements for users as rumors of a 200 billion raise swirl finance the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange is now requiring all new users to complete its intermediate verification process existing users who have not yet completed intermediate verification will see their accounts severely limited this means customers will need to submit a government-issued id along with a selfie to obtain approval to trade deposit and withdraw on the platform without restriction the move is meant to align finance with what the company called evolving global compliance standards with which the crypto exchange has become intimately familiar as of late the new verification mandate is the latest in a string of compliance friendly moves by the exchange a few weeks ago binance reduced the daily withdrawal limit for non-verified accounts from two bitcoin to .06 the company also recently capped trading to a maximum of 20 x leverage down from 100 x in july one explanation for the increased verification requirements could be that finance is attempting to raise money as chinese journalist colin wu reported we was cited multiple sources writing that quote binance is considering obtaining investment and protection from government funds and a valuation of 200 billion dollars singapore is one of the most likely options in related news the uk's financial conduct authority published a memo saying binance is not capable of being effectively supervised by the agency last month the fca banned binance from conducting regulated activities in the country the infrastructure bill is likely to leave the controversial crypto provision intact a controversial crypto provision tucked in the bipartisan infrastructure bill is likely to become law after the house voted to move forward without any new amendments as in the senate the decision is a blow to the crypto industry because the current wording could classify miners validators and developers as brokers each broker would be responsible for a filing of a 1099 form on behalf of their customers and reporting any transactions over 10 000 to the irs for many entities captured by the current broker definition it would be nearly impossible to comply according to cnec an unnamed treasury official said that the u.s treasury department will not target non-brokers such as miners hardware developers and others even if there is no amendment coin center's jerry brito remains unconvinced though quote i'm glad to hear that treasury officials are telling reporters on background that they don't intend to target minors if the infrastructure bill's crypto tax provision becomes law but i'm afraid that that is of little comfort for now the plan is for the house to vote on the infrastructure package by september 27th if approved it will go to president joe biden who will almost certainly sign it into law in other regulatory news representative darren soto democrat of florida reintroduced two bills on wednesday the first is the u.s virtual currency market and regulatory competitiveness act which directs the cftc to produce a report on worldwide digital currency regulation and how the us can promote digital asset innovation the
