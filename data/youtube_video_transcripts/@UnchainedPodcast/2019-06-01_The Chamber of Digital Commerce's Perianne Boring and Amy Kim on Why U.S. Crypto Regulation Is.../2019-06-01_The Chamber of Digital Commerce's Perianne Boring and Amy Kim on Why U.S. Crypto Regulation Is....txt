today's guests are Perry and boring the founder and president of the chamber of digital commerce and Amy Kim the Chamber's global policy director and general counsel welcome Perry Anne and Amy hey Laura thank fora so let's start with Perry n tell me about how you got into Bitcoin and crypto and how you came to phone the chamber of digital commerce yeah no thank you and so we launched the chamber of digital commerce in July of 2014 I formerly worked on Capitol Hill and I learned about Bitcoin through my work that I did on the JOBS Act so as an economist when I first heard or learned that there was this currency out there that was not controlled or owned or operated by the government or a corporation or any organization to me that was just a fascinating concept and I wanted to understand it better and learn more so that started the the trip down the the rabbit hole and over the course of a few years I I did a just a personal study into the industry and what came out of that was me being completely convinced that this is the most important thing I'll see in my lifetime and was really excited about it and just wanted to work in the industry so I had to spend a little bit of time doing a self study and understanding what I would have to contribute to this industry because that was in pretty early days and at the time most of the people in the ecosystem were software developers colleges those in the technical community so it became pretty obvious over time that the industry really needed an advocate a team on the ground in Washington DC to work on the policy challenges so 2013 was really kind of the wake-up call for me because that was the year where the Bitcoin industry had a handful of very public scandals everything from Silk Road and mal Cox and that had ripple effects around the policy community so what came out of those two incidents were multiple hearings on Capitol Hill scrutinizing the technology and dangers of it we started seeing guidance come out from the regulators and there were a lot of talks in the general narrative in DC was that Bitcoin was being used to facilitate illegal transactions but there were very few people that were able to articulate the positive benefits of this technology and I felt like it was super important that the industry was able to balance that out so we founded the chamber to be an advocate for the blockchain ecosystem and we've been at it for almost four years and we've grown quite a bit and we've made a significant amount of progress in that approach yeah I think we saw in the recent hearings that it just seemed our legislators or at least some of them are a little bit more well educated on this topic then I think some people in the community expected and a lot of people were saying it's because of the work that groups like yours have done Amy what is your role at the chamber I lead the legal and policy work here at the chamber so I'm helping to try to do exactly what you just mentioned really which is a lot of Education and information and in some cases advocacy and some of the issues that are being raised in Congress and in the agencies and sometimes even in the state legislatures on some of the issues that are impacting blockchain and virtual currencies and how did you come to work at the chamber and what were you doing before yeah I was a lawyer in private practice for many years and started working with virtual currency companies around 2010 really when you know when you have clients that come asking for advice in that area so my background is in cross border compliance programs so anti-money laundering sanctions compliance and then because of this industry the state money transmitter areas and so started then I was in the audience when Perry Ann announced that she was creating a trade association and I thought that is such a great idea it's it's it's a really needed function and went up to her and introduced myself and said how can I help and so helps her for a couple years just in my spare time and then last year she convinced me to join full time and really it was just obvious to me that blockchain was going of such an impact on our lives and an industry and everywhere else and I just need to be a part of it overall what are the main functions of the chamber of digital commerce what is kind of your daily activity look like or your weekly a schedule well our mission generally is to promote the acceptance and use of digital assets and blockchain based technologies and we do that through education advocacy we work very closely with the policy community the regulatory agencies the industry and our goal out of all of this is to help develop an environment that fosters innovation jobs and investment and we very much believe that public policy is one of the biggest risk to the barriers of adoption of blockchain technology so a big piece of our day and our time is working with the policy community whether that's on Capitol Hill with law enforcement regulators and the other side of that is working with the industry spending a lot of time with our members really understanding the the businesses who are utilizing blockchain what their challenges are and then providing a platform for those two communities to come together to discuss these challenges and to work together to build a policy environment that's going to grow the ecosystem in a responsible way so it's a lot and we stay really busy and there's a lot of different stakeholders we've built a really big community in a network of people and stakeholders who are all invested in the future of what this technology looks like so a lot of what we're doing is is coordinating collaborating and bringing people together before we dive into all the particularly these around regulation in the crypto space I actually want to get a big picture look at a high level what would you say is the current state of crypto regulation in the US well it's very complicated there are a lot of different regulatory agencies who are all clamoring for jurisdiction over this technology just to give a super high level kind of intro I really all started with fencin at the the US Treasurys Financial Crimes enforcement Network in 2013 put out the first piece of guidance that said convertible virtual currencies would be treated like a currency and so you had that regulatory framework that started off there and then shortly after that the Treasury decided that they were going to tax this as property and then we saw the CFTC come out and said that Bitcoin meets the definition of the commodity and now we're saying a significant amount of activity from the SEC SEC applying securities laws to this technology so that's just for examples currency property commodity security of how regulators are looking at this technology and there's more stakeholders than that because you have law enforcement you have the consumer regulators and then you have the states so it's very complicated this is not something that volunteers can do in their spare time navigate through this it really takes a dedicated effort to truly understand the legal and regulatory landscape that's developing and to also be able to help build an environment that's gonna help the industry but also take into the unique attributes of blockchain so it's it's a little all over the place and it's it is a lot to manage and navigate through and Laura I would I would just add to that if I could um you know I do think I mean just building AI what Parian said so what you can see is that it's been somewhat it's grown in a fragmented way with with not as much collaboration and I guess high-level guidance from policy perspective so you see a lot of agencies enforcing their own laws and in a sometimes in an enforcement role without a higher level understanding of the benefits of the technology and how and looking at it through that lens and then pushing that policy down into the agencies and I think we'll start to see more of that we already are sharing to seize more of that collaboration and I think that we'll continue to see that in 2018 one thing I was curious about is if all these agencies are looking at it in these different ways a currency commodity property security does a key confusion for industry players it's very confusing I mean it's confusing it can be confusing for us but for any company especially a start-up that doesn't have a team of lawyers and compliance and regulatory experts on hand full time it's a lot for anyone to have to navigate and it does create confusion one example of that is with tax law where you have the IRS who's taxing this as a property but then you have fencin who said this is going to be regulated as a currency and there's a number of different questions that community has about how to comply with that when there's other regulations out there that have put this technology and other boxes and so there are a lot of areas where we could use greater clarity and that's why it's important to have an organization like the chamber that's fighting for that so let's actually put a pin in the taxation discussion because I think that right now the biggest question everyone's minds is whether or not the Securities and Exchange Commission will regulate tokens in securities or initial coin offerings as sales of securities why has this become the big question what are the issues well from our perspective you know I mean the SEC is certainly taking the view that certain tokens can be securities based on the facts and circumstances that's what we saw in the issuance of the Dowell report and then you saw that evolve over the coming months and in the Munchie case also kind of extended that into marketing so certainly that is I think you know in our view a big frontier as far as how that landscape is going to evolve in that enforcement environment given that the the market for token issuances has grown so explosively as well so you have those kind of two interplaying industries coming together and so yes how the SEC ends up regulating that we'll all icos be securities like the chairman you know he said that all the ICS he's seen so far are securities I think that what that really means has yet to play out and just describe what happened in Munchie there and what you meant about how it crossed over in a marketing munch he was designed as what was it designed as a utility token yeah I mean I think that was the intent is that they they were issuing a token to enable users to use their platform in the food industry and restaurant industry and so a lot was said about you know how that token would be utilized on that platform what they also did though was was say in their materials that the token would likely appreciate in value you know making other statements like that that that that went that crossed the line for the SEC and for listeners who have not yet learned what the how a test is that is the test the SEC uses to determine whether or not in a token offering in particular as a security we actually had a previous a couple of previous episodes that described this but I'll just briefly recap the definition is an investment contract in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits dependent upon a third party or promoter and so in this case munchies kind of like promise of profits and then the fact that it depended on this company Munchie executing this project well we're probably the factors that tipped it over for the SEC into being called a security one other issue I wanted to talk about is that when I do a lot of these interviews a lot of my sources will say something like clearly some crypto assets like Bitcoin are commodities but then when I ask them which other tokens they would put in that bucket they hem and haw a little bit and I had kind of an S inferred from the Dow report that the SEC was going to put ether from the etherium network in that bucket but chairman Clayton as he mentioned has recently been saying that all the ICS he's seen our securities offerings and etherium did have what I guess we would recognize today as an initial coin offering and so that sort of leads us to this question does that make ether today a security to my mind if so wouldn't have they set wouldn't they have said so in the Dow report and if I really understand the how I test correctly to my mind ether as we know what today does not pass the how I test but what is your sense of where the line is being drawn about securities versus commodities do you feel confident that ether will not be considered as security you know that's I mean I think that's a it's an interesting question you know certainly this SEC had the opportunity to make that statement in the Dow report and they didn't and certainly ether it has it is designed as a utility as the gas of the the ether Network so aetherium network so you know for the moment I think really the focus is on some of these other tokens and other other tokens really that and whether they would be considered securities or not and I think that platforms are looking at that closely because if you are trading a token that happens to be a security that triggers registration and other obligations with the SEC yeah and we also had the opportunity to meet privately with the SEC after that hearing just to get a little bit more clarity on termen clinton statements where he said every IC o---- that he has seen to him look like a security and we just asked him you know could you just explain that in a little bit more detail what he meant by that and they said you know this is based on every IC o---- that they have seen and they also said that they we haven't seen every IC o---- and I said you know there's 1500 or more crypto tokens out there so every single one of those is a security and they said no it's just the ones that have come to us and we've had the opportunity to examine so there I think they're there's a lot of that is yet to be seen and in the dialogue is it's still in progress and that the SEC is still forming its position on this did you ask them about aetherium we did we did and again my sense is that if it was going to go in the direction of a security that they've had the opportunity to do that and they they have not so far but at the same time we couldn't necessarily rule that out because we there there's still unclarity in that in that question yeah well one other thing that I wonder is there is this I guess maybe sentiment isn't exactly the word but a line of thinking in the community that promises of future tokens sold before the network has launched are definitely sales of securities this is something I've both written about and then Marco sanatory who was on my podcast earlier put out a white paper kind of promoting this line of thinking and so he and the other co-authors of that paper who are protocol labs who did the file coin ICO they were calling for what they call simple agreements for a few your tokens to be considered sales of securities and that's when people by the promise of tokens before the network launches but they and and some others also take the approach that once the network is live the token is then a commodity and so this I think kind of goes back to this aetherium question it's sort of like Oh at the time of the sale would ether or the promise of the future ether be considered as security but then now that the network is live is it a commodity so I just wonder do you get that there is a sense that there's some magical line at which a trans security transforms in a commodity and do you feel like there's some consensus around when that happens allora my sense is that there isn't consensus around when that actually happens and I think that even the the regulators are trying to sort that out I mean you've heard some of the commissioners at the CFTC raise that very question and and I think they're still working through that I mean we're dealing in a within a space where you have to connect can represent something that and be traded and maybe even like you've kind of suggested it become one thing or be one thing and then become something else and that's you know something that we may not have seen before and really need to think carefully about how to to regulate that if we regulate that and and what those parameters should be so you know we're all trying to work through that and find a way to help this industry move forward in a responsible way protecting investors of course protecting the markets but still allowing some of these innovations to flourish which I think they're very important innovations and we need to think about all three of those things together yeah well so when you said it may not be something that we've seen before it that's actually what something was going to ask you has there ever been anything in history that started off as a security that later transformed into a commodity or is could this potentially be the first time you know when you think about I mean the traditional securities things that are shares in a company you know know whether it's the very first time you know I'm not so sure but certainly it's unique I mean a lot of things about this industry are unique they don't fit well into laws that were written 10 20 30 years ago often you see that not just in the token space so and we might have new new sets of circumstances to be looking at here one other thing I wanted to discuss were the recent laws in Wyoming that were passed that create a category of launching tokens that are not securities I think this is what we in crypto would recognize as utility token although they didn't use that phrasing in the law but this is a token that's not structured as the security but has a function beyond its investment value sort of the way that for instance in Manhattan condo has a function beyond its value as an investment and one of the qualifications in their law for these utility tokens is that the network could be live so I was kind of curious to know do you think that this is a stance will see other states or the federal government take that if the network's live then the utility token is not a security you know I mean we'd like to see that I think that's you know what's happening in Wyoming was very interesting and it for the industry not just on that that utility token bill but some of the others as well it's possible states could you know I think some of the states we'll see I think it's it's going to be a different calculus in each state but certainly I think it was a helpful push and I think what you're seeing is when there's this kind of uncertainty in federal government or in some cases in action as far as guidance on by the federal government you're seeing the states step up and try to encourage industry to come to their state and to promote it and is that a good idea for there to be separate state regimes or should there be one federal one well I think it depends to on the issue you know certainly I think with respect to the money transmitter licensing regime that really is is not functioning well for for this industry and so our position on that is we prefer a federal solution ultimately and what about for the IC o---- regulation I would agree with that as well I mean that it's a little bit you know there are some intricacies with respect to different state laws and things and and how they regulate versus the federal government so I think they're gonna have to some of that will have to be it worked out yeah I keep in mind this token and ICO landscape is still incredibly nascent and under development and we're going to continue to see a lot of evolution in tokenization over the near term and sometimes it's really hard to put together a concrete regulatory framework for something that we know that's going to evolve and so what we have been doing at the chamber to address the issues and the activity we're seeing around icos is write best practices so we created an initiative called the token alliance we launched it last year with about a hundred and sixty participants we've grown that to over 250 box chain and token experts around the world we've also brought in two former regulators to co-chair this effort we have dr. Jim Newsome who's the former chairman of the CFTC and Paul Atkins who's a former SEC commissioner who's overseeing this and what we're doing is organizing the industry to write what we consider to be the best practices for token issuances and the listing of tokens on exchanges and then the inner sense between exchanges and token issue issuers now what regulators are most concerned about and why you're seeing so much activity from the SEC and our securities regulators because they're very concerned about the retail consumer a lot of these token sales are being marketed to just the average person and some of the activity we're seeing is really exciting there's a ton of innovation new technologies starting to arise but there's also some not-so-great stuff out there to there absolutely are fraudulent I SEOs and it's in our interest the the the entire community's interest to be able to address that and so while we are in the absence of regulatory clarity we're being proactive and writing these best practices to be able to regulate ourselves in a way and to be able to have a framework to be able to delineate the good from the bad and we believe that this will take a least 90% of the issues that securities regulators today are concerned about take a lot of that pressure off of them and be able to take a step in creating a framework to oversee this activity we're going to talk more about self-regulation and also taxation which came up earlier and money transmitters but first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our fabulous sponsors starting with ppreciate

wanted to ask about is that something that you think is likely to happen there have been calls both within the industry and also from one of the cft c-- commissioners himself so what is it and and how likely do you think we'll go in that direction yeah so and just to give a little bit of history of how we got here and how this dialogue I've been SRO got started and CFTC commissioner quinten's made a statement calling for an SRO which was really just his kind of action item to the industry to get organized and start addressing some of this activity that we're seeing and and so we've asked him to clarify that and a little bit more detail what what he meant by that and so he came back to the DC blockchain summit which is a conference we host at Georgetown every year and he gave a much more detailed presentation on his vision for an SRO now a self-regulatory organization is something that Congress would enact so a wall would be passed Congress would vote on it and it would establish a regular self-regulatory organization that would be overseeing likely by another agency similar to FINRA or the National Futures Association but what Commissioner quinten's elaborated on is that you could go that route and have a true sorrow of this congressionally established organization or the industry could just get organized create a set of best practices and standards and do this on their own now the benefit of having a true SRO is that you would have the ability to enforce and you would have the authority to do so but there's no reason why we can't set up a voluntary a voluntarily structure today where people would volunteer to opt-in into it adhere to a set of standards and best practices and that's essentially what we're doing with the token Alliance but this is that there are significant efforts underway to do this so it is inevitable and I think it will evolve over time as the markets continue to mature and as regulators continue to call for efforts like this and so what is the chamber and the token alliance what do you guys think are the best way to move forward in terms of like what are the best practices that industry should adopt how do you think the SEC should regulate this area do you think that they should say sales for initial coins offerings that happened before the network as lives should be called securities that once the network is live that should be a commodity like what what are all the different recommendations you both of your organization's make right so the concept of what is a security and tokenization is not clear and companies want to be compliant our members they want to follow the laws but there is no official guidance on how to issue or operate a non security token today in any form so that is what our best practices will cover it's if you want to issue a non security token how to do so in a responsible way and we're doing this with significant industry input from around the world so bringing the industry together to agree upon of what those parameters would include oh so you haven't decided those yet well that we're doing it in consortium or just sitting down and right it's something that were we have over 260 people around the world contributing to do so so this is not something that we want just one person to sit down and control this by Fiat we want this to be an industry effort because ultimately we need the industry to adopt these best practices so there is a great deal of collaboration underway so the first draft of this document is done and it's in peer review right now so we now have all the members of the token Alliance reviewing it submitting their input refining it making it the best document we can possibly make it and we'll be publishing it shortly and just that first drafts recommend the use of something like a saft for that initial sale before the network launches so it's a jurisdictionally neutral document it really more covers the technological aspects of issuing a token or operating a token so we do not get into the specific regulatory considerations and we're doing this so you can use this anywhere in the world because this is a global movement we wanted it to be relevant to all those who want to participate in this community so it doesn't get into all the regulatory concerns but we see that as the next step and what I'd say on that too is we do first talk about the entire legal landscape applicable to tokens so going through the SEC the CFTC anti money laundering and sanctions compliance and even some of the tax implications first you know just having that kind of as a resource all in one place so that you know people are fully informed of the things that they need to be thinking about and then the best practices then go into if you are issuing what you what is it what is a true utility token here are best practices to to make sure that that you're doing this an appropriate way for potential purchasers and that purchasers are fully informed of of what the the business model and the product is is about and since you mentioned before that you are talking with the SEC do you have any clues yet as to how they plan to proceed well I mean I think you know I think we can take some of the clues from some of the statements we've seen in the media you know there are what we've seen publicly or that there are investigations ongoing there are these subpoenas that have been issued some confusion over how many subpoenas and to whom but you know I would expect we'll see more enforcement actions before we see less unfortunately but I think that can help provide some guardrails and you know I would hope some guidance too rather than purely enforcement as a tool to inform the industry but I would expect to see more enforcement actions this year so one thing that I also wanted to ask about and this gets us into money transmitter territory is and it correct me if I'm wrong apparently Finn's and also said that ICAO issuers could be considered money transmitters but as far as I understand a money transmitter is a company more similar to Western Union where they take money from someone and pass it to someone else so if that's the case what laws do ICU issuers have to comply with well I mean I think yeah you're talking about the letter that FinCEN sent to Senator Wyden you know I don't think I mean since that's a little bit of my background what they said in there wasn't surprising to me I think you know they they said what their law says which is based on the facts and circumstances companies may be considered money transmitters if they receive money for transit mission or funds of the value of funds for transmission to another person or other location so then if you are going to issue a token you have to kind of assess your business model the way that your funds flow how your virtual currencies or whatever the tokens are issued however you're characterizing those and make a determination on a case-by-case basis if money transmission on the federal level applies and then you probably need to look at the state laws as well each state does deal with it a little bit differently unfortunately that's what we're dealing with today and so you'd have to take a look at that and take position and it probably involves some legal advice is it possible to be both a money transmitter and also a security issue or at the same time well the money transmitter I think that the FinCEN regulations exclude from the money transmitter definitions SEC and CFTC registered entities and there's some technical language in the Bank Secrecy Act regulation so you'd have to look at that carefully to see if you actually did fit within that exclusion which really means you're just excluded from the FinCEN portion but it puts you into the equivalent on the the equivalent coverages for securities or commodities right but I guess I'm just trying to get at the point that it doesn't sound like you can be a money transmitter and an issuer of security at the same time right like it would be one or the other and then the laws would apply for whichever category you were put in is that correct uh you know I don't know that if that's correct I think it would depend on which part of your business if it's the same exact if your time with the same exact activity that might be true but again yeah yeah that's right yeah I I would seek legal advice on that question as well yes and actually just for anybody listening nothing we're saying at all okay so we have been discussing a few other really big topics and so a couple of them that I definitely wanna cover our taxation and money transmitters but let's start with taxation what is the current state of taxation in crypto so this is one of my favourite topics to talk about because I worked on tax policy when I worked on the hill and it's just really fascinating where we are today in tax policy in the United States so in 2014 the IRS issued guidance that convertible virtual currencies would be treated as property so as all of us who in the blockchain and crypto space are very well aware your transactions any time you use a cryptocurrency to purchase anything it is subject to capital gains which is a huge administrative burden as we are all aware the issue is that the IRS didn't do the best job of explaining how the apply with this guidance there's a lot of areas that have not been clarified for one how do you calculate the fair market value of virtual currency when there is no standard exchange rate so what exchange rate are you supposed to use we don't really know what about for miners if you acquire crypto through mining what is the tax treatment of that another really big and important question and also for merchants who are holding cryptocurrency is that considered capital or an ordinary asset again there's there is no answer for that so there has been a very hard time for the community of following the laws of being compliant because we have a lot of questions and it's it's been a frustrating process because the IRS actually accepted comments from the public and 2014 and the public submitted a lot of these questions over to the IRS and they didn't answer any of the questions they never responded to the public opportunity for comment which is a little not quite sure why you know they didn't they didn't respond and so a couple years went by and then the IRS is Inspector General issued well they did an audit on the IRS his virtual currency program and they issued a report that really criticized the IRS is a virtual currency program saying there's a lot of areas that you haven't answered questions you received a bunch of comments you didn't respond to them and and really you know asked the IRS to follow up on these questions and they didn't instead the IRS issued a John Doe summons on coinbase as I'm sure you've you're aware of asking for the records of about a half a million of their users and they you know really seem to erroneously cast this perception that all cryptocurrency users are tax evaders but really I think most of us just need to better understand how to comply with this property guidance so that's where we are today it's a little bit of a mess so in response to this we at the chamber have developed a attacks policy position to advocate for just a better way to tax cryptocurrencies or virtual currencies and we believe that virtual currencies should be treated like currency just like the US dollar they should be allowed to function as currencies and I would argue that a big reason why we haven't seen the coin or other virtual currencies really take off as a medium of exchange is because if you're using it as a medium of exchange you have this administrative nightmare of having to calculate your gains or your loss on every single transaction so we believe and we're fighting to make virtual currencies treated fairly like that of a currency or an alternative currency and and they should be in order to achieve that you can do this pretty simply by just excluding them from the capital gains and the investment income tax and all the reporting requirements that would come with that so I totally understand your point here it completely makes sense obviously if I I'm trying to pay for a cup of coffee and I have to calculate how much I paid for the money that I'm using then what the capital gain is when I buy the coffee obviously it's pretty cumbersome but at the same time when you hear people just talking about buying Bitcoin they don't they don't talk about it the way they talk about currency they talk about quote-unquote investing in Bitcoin or investing in crypto assets so when you have people thinking of it in that way does it really make sense to tax these as currencies you know I think that people have been it we've been kind of pushed into that direction because in part because the IRS you know treats convertible virtual currency as property and then you have you know Bitcoin features contracts being offered and you're seeing these price fluctuations so I think that is where the market has gone due to both regulatory and then just some of the volatility but if you're looking at this if you're looking at the horizon right first of all if you're looking at the beginning and then looking at the horizon this was originally created as a form method of payment a method of exchange mechanism of value transfer and and that's really where some of its amazing utility sits and we're really not this IRS tax treatment is really hindering that potential in significant ways and I and it our view is if that's corrected we'll start to see some some of this normalize in a way that makes more sense so and I know that this is a difficult this is not an easy this is this is not an easy request this isn't an easy it's a challenge it's going to be a significant challenge but we think it's worth it it's worth it to get this treated right and and as close to the beginning as we can so we'll keep pushing on it and see what kind of progress we could make yeah and and also just to build on that is we also need to recognize and and pay attention to other dynamics that are happening in this community and there's many central banks around the world who are looking at ways to integrate watching technology to create their own digital currencies so if central banks are looking to use this technology to issue currencies it cannot possibly be a property at the same time that is that is a good point but one other thing I wanted to ask was do you so if the government does seem to believe that people are evading taxes with cryptocurrencies do you have a good sense of whether or not that's true I think people are having a hard time understanding how to comply with the property designation again there's a lot of areas where the IRS has not been able to clearly articulate how to comply with that designation and so because of that it makes it very hard to to to be able to do so so I don't think that's a fair characterization I mean at the chamber we represent over 160 companies all of which adhere to our code of ethics and our companies they want to follow the law they want to do the right thing and they will right thing if you tell them how to do so so speaking of companies wanting to do the right thing let's move to the money transmitter issue I know that many in the industry feel that one of the obstacles to growth is the fact that a lot of cryptic companies need to get licenses from 53 different states and territories what kinds of companies need to to do that and why is it 53 different licenses well so the types of I mean those would be you know I think the classic example would be your exchange platforms who have applied for those licenses and the reason you have to do that is because money transmission unlike national association banks who are regulated by the OCC money transmitters are regulated at the state level so through the state banking departments and so if you're engaging with customers or residents of those states you need to apply for the license meet all the standards that the banking departments have and then also maintain those standards and go through it and so that applies to all 50 states and several territories although they each apply it a little bit differently and do you get a sense of how much this is hindering growth I mean have we seen any companies get all 53 different licenses no we haven't we've seen them get maybe 28 be the low 30s and as far as number of state licenses and that's because some states you know you see some states the requirements in those states are designed to test the the capital structure and the capitalization of these companies and make sure that the executives and other personnel are qualified to run that kind of a business that will you know take or transfer consumer assets so they treat those categories of qualifications differently and one way that that can be an impediment is if the reserves that they require in exchange to maintain are required to be maintained in u.s. dollars so that would require a company to essentially maintain double valuation basically you'll have for example Bitcoin that you would hello to your customers on any one day and then also have to back that up with a you dollar I'm so those that can be quite burdensome and in some cases has forced companies to leave the state because of it this is very much a regulatory failure it's unacceptable that in the year of 2018 we still do not have one company in the entire industry that's been able to get licensed across the entire United States it's sad and we are seeing many companies that are either closing up shop cutting off customers in certain states are just moving overseas and it's also really difficult for consumers and it hinders consumers because the people who want to use this technology in some states they don't have access to any exchanges so they're being forced to use services overseas so it's it's a vicious cycle and we deserve something better and and that's something we are fighting for at the chamber is to be able to address this and and we believe we need a federal solution to truly fix this issue and what would that look like the federal solution that's a great question we've spent a lot of time talking about that and you also want to be careful what you ask for so there was you we have seen this dialogue start to open up on the federal level you know the the Office of the Comptroller of the currency or the OCC tried to launch a phen tech charter it's it's been stalled but they did go through several years of comments and deliberations and even put out the first draft of a licensing manual to establish a banking charter for FinTech companies and it turned into a big political fight once the OCC went down this path there were states that were very threatened by this and who are now suing the OCC saying the OCC doesn't have the jurisdiction to do this so the state of New York and the conference of state bank supervisors have sued the OCC over this so the dialogue is starting to open up and the OCC has lied that but as of today we still don't have we still don't have an option but it's something you're hopefully in the long run we'll be able to to achieve the other thing I would just add to that is any one option is looking at it from a special-purpose National Bank Charter at the OCC the other way would be if there is some type of oversight over this the spot markets that's being suggested by the CFTC that would have to specifically preempt state law on in order to work but there you know so there are some alternatives and and maybe there's even more ways to think about that I mean I think whatever whatever solution we know whatever path we start to go down really needs to take into account the unique nature of virtual currency and and tokens and and how that differs maybe from the way we've traditionally thought about these types of Licensing or chartering or authorizations an additional area of confusion I think that's occurring around this kind of like State Federal divide is that I think some states have been issuing state specific legislation for smart contracts and I know you guys are opposed the Chamber's opposed what do these laws say and why do you think state laws for smart contracts are a problem so you know I think this is actually coming from a good place I mean I think these legislators are trying to help the industry and and for that you know we need more of we need more supporters like that I think the issue is just that the very specific type of legislation that you've mentioned which is state efforts to amend their uniform electronic transactions Act to include specifically blockchain and smart contracts so what these uniformed acts do is recognize electronic signatures and electronic records where a written record is required or where a written signature is required and so but the way but the way that they're already written is electronic signature electronic record it's not technology specific so first of all just by doing this it doesn't it's not needed I mean first it's unnecessary because it already should cover for that second is that this well second is that the states are also not creating these laws uniformly themselves there's I mean anything from minor deviations to you know to two different types of authorizations that they're putting into their their statutes so that's kind of it equates to what you just mentioned which is the money transmitter quagmire which we may be heading down that road and then the third is of the federal esign Act so on the federal level there's an electronic signatures and electronic records Act that says that to the extent a state deviates from that standard or specifically references or calls out technology that's preempted so now we're creating a legal question as to well does that preemption apply to what these states are doing and you know so now it's actually opening up some doors on some questions and so so yeah so unfortunately we're were become you know we're advocating more than we would like to have to but you know to reach out to these state legislators and try to explain to them this situation and and you know hopefully point out to them here's some other ways you know let's let's think of other ways we can work together to promote the industry I also want to talk about anti-money laundering I know that that's an issue lawmakers are worried about what anti-money laundering with cryptic on or or rather they're worried about money laundering with cryptocurrency how big is that risk and how well are crypto companies imply complying with anti money laundering laws well I think what we've seen said publicly so far is I mean I think money laundering is going to be a risk in in any agency in any industry that you're in so we need to understand that that risk exists and people need to take precautions but we need to understand the size of that risk and there's been reports that say that money laundering in this industry is less than 1% of the overall industry whereas reports beyond that you know with respect to the u.s. dollar estimated to be a vastly larger number but we take it seriously money laundering is a significant concern and and we have companies within the Chamber's membership that actually assist companies assist financial institutions and government in ways to identify trends identify money laundering and ways to to fight it yeah one thing I wanted to flag for listeners is that if you haven't heard the episode with Kathryn Hahn from about a year and a half ago she talked about tracking crimes with the blockchain and so I could understand why maybe there hasn't been a huge amount of uptake of money laundering with cryptocurrency face based on her her remarks and I actually just also wanted to flag that I'm starting to realize there have been so many previous episodes where we've covered issues that are similar to the ones were discussing in this episode so I will link to them in the show notes and you should check them out some of the ones that come to mind I mentioned like the one with Marco Centauri but also there was one with coin Center where we talked about the Howey test there was also another episode about the coin base case so there's definitely a lot to dig into if you find this conversation fascinating the last thing I wanted to ask you guys is I was curious to know how the u.s. compares with other jurisdictions when it comes to regulation of crypto well the United States federal government is organized very different than most other countries so we have a very fragmented approach to regulation especially on financial services so we have the SEC the Securities and Exchange Commission we also have a separate regulator for the futures markets the CFTC we have multiple bank regulators from the Fed the FDIC the OCC so one of the biggest challenges the United States faces is this fragmented approach where there are a lot of different stakeholders and they're not necessarily very well coordinated either and in other areas of the world where they have less complicated markets and smaller governments a lot of them will just have one financial services regulator so for example in Singapore the Monetary Authority of Singapore is both their central bank and their bank regulator and all things financial services so there's just one entity you have to go to if you want to issue a product or or work in the financial services industry in that jurisdiction or in the United Kingdom is another example of that they have the UK FCA the financial conduct authority so it's kind of a one-stop shop so it's a lot easier when you only have one agency or one entity that's having to develop the policy for this industry so the u.s. is very unique and it takes a lot more coordination there's a lot more stakeholders that you have to work with and get them to work together and so it's just different so because of that some of these other areas of the world are have been able to really get to market faster or have been able to develop policy positions or sandboxes faster and easier than the US and that really is working against us and when you say that you mean like it's hindering the pace of innovation in the industry here in the US yeah because there's such you know a lack of clarity in so many areas and they get that clarity you have to get multiple regulators to sit together and make this a priority and discuss it and come up with the determination but that's a much longer process and if you went to you know another jurisdiction where there's just one office there's you know one or two people overseeing the issue where they can make a decision and without having to go through you know the same process we would have to go through here so like the idea of putting together a sandbox we don't have one in the United States where would you even put it so it's it's other countries without a lot more success have been able to move a lot faster than the US because of the and I think the idea of the sandbox just shows that I think there are some countries that are capitalizing on this opportunity to make an advantage for themselves in in technology industry and so you're seeing regulators working with industry in a regulated in a controlled environment to help to help both parties I think learn from each other you know the regulator's have the advantage of learning about the technology and the the companies the innovators have the advantage of gaining a better understanding of what might work and what might not work from a regulatory standpoint so there's definitely advantage in that system that we're not we're not seeing here right now well I know that regulators at this sec at least and hopefully regulators at other agencies do listen to this show so if they haven't heard this message already from industry I'm sure then they will hear it now so it's been fantastic having you both as guess where can people learn more about the chamber so you can visit our website digital chamber org we did just publish two
