africa's shark tank and a Bitcoin foundation board member and Vinny's also been nicknamed the bitcoin oracle for his uncannily accurate bitcoin price predictions welcome Vinnie Thank You Lauren good to be on the show so hands up everyone that we are on the 44th floor of a hotel the Marc Marriott marquee in where consensus was held and despite are kind of like perch over the city you might occasionally hear assignments in the episode just wanna warn you so Vinny you made a number of big announcements here at consensus but let's start with the basics what to civic do thanks Laura so civic is a blockchain base at any platform weather really means is that we've used the blockchain to reimagine how identity would work in the real world and we're doing it by giving people the ability to store the person the information and any eating really around personal data health records etc on their mobile device secured by the biometric tools like touch ID that's on the mobile device and no one else gets to see the information unless they explicitly give permission for it and so that means that information is not stored in civic servers it's a fully decentralized model everyone in the world can be storing their personal information on their devices and we would have none of it so we can't get hacked and you can't lose your information through Civic because we don't store any of that data and we're doing that because we think it's important that people have control of the information and they can use it to gain access to places where they need to go so potentially through an airport or going online logging into websites replacing two-factor authentication etc so we see a ton of use cases what we've done is just launched our product which allows you to log into websites using your your phone scanning a QR code past witness entry and an ultra secure so walk me through what that looks like like if you are going to an airport you need to prove who you are how does that work so that's kind of the long-term dream we have is that because the ID information in your phone is so secure and locked down that you know governments around the world will start accepting Civic IDs and civic accounts in the future we're not there yet we've just launched and so right now we're focusing on really the cryptocurrency community so the web developers the cryptocurrency sites and exchanges where instead of having to do kyc which is know your customer and where you provide the exchanges with your passport your driver's license and all these if all this information about them really multiple times every time you open up an account we're trying to make it simple so that you do it once the information is verified digital signs certified on your device private keys are places and device and there's a blockchain there's a hash on the blockchain on the Bitcoin blockchain which which confirms that that the owner of the key is the owner of the information so when you go to the next site to sign up if you if you've already provided information once they can trust that the information hasn't been changed and therefore you can log in and you can sign up and not have to go through a full kyc again so it's really more of a reusable kyc model but it also means you can just log into websites as a without a username password and by having the app and and and authentication through the app you could gain access and the good thing about that is because the sites that integrate with us are not storing a username and password for you or an email nurse and password if they get hacked the hacker can't use that information elsewhere to gain access to your other accounts one thing was so you were talking about kyc which is know your customer so what information is that that consumers need to get when they're signing up for civic so when you sign for civic you can their multiple levels of accounts the basic account really is just email and phone number and that's not a verified account that's just a basic Civic account that also means that when you go somewhere people don't have to send you an email we are attacking the code click the link that understand your text message you type in the code again it's already done so the website who receives that information from you knows that Civic is verified that that's you know that's your phone number and as long as you willing to give that information to them they don't have to have Yuri verify it wait so that's like if you travel and you want to check your your bank balance or something at the moment then your bank knows that it's still you or what's that make this two types of accounts you have a basic account where we only verify the email address and the phone number and you have a verified account will be verify your email address your phone number your address your first name middle name last name your social security number and really any other information that the website may need about you and so verified accounts are very high level of trust and and basically counts have got some degree of trust because that's just an email and a phone number but in both cases when you're logging in to a website they can choose what information they want from you and what level of trust that they really want from Civic to verify if you are who you say you are so which types of accounts what I use just like the basic account to login with and then whichever accounts what I use the verified account with so if you're applying for a bank account you would probably need a verified account cuz no bank is this can accept the phone number and email address they want to know that your your first name last name matches your email address matches your your physical address social security etc so if we can provide them with that information as being verified it makes it a lot cheaper and easier for them to open the account for you versus having to go through the entire process we have to submit driver's license potentially and possible information and that's what you do right now for exchanges and so we're trying to make it a lot more easy and more secure to do that and then when would I use the the basic account with just the email address and phone number so for basic accounts if you are signing up for a social network website or something you know it doesn't really require a high degree of knowledge of creating an account on a forum etc they just really maybe even want just to humor this and the best part about the basic accounts they can also be used for something called private logins and that means that they the site accepting and private login will take no information from you at all so you can sign up for an Apple website give them nothing except a unique token so that they'll remember you when you come back but they don't know your email or your phone number and you can test the service out and they decide in the future well you know after seven day of a free trial maybe we now need to know the email address the phone number they can then request it from you at that point and then you can decide whether you understood information so I mean I think I'm one of many people who have a problem going to these sites and apps name and you sign up and give all my information just to check out nap and so we think that that the Civic protocol makes it really easy for people to just try things out and if they don't like it they can you know they can even and the site can't contact them there's no information so at the moment of onboarding how does cific know that I'm really who I am like what if I'm a fraudster trying to impersonate you know that my target right so so on in terms of onboarding we've been doing this for a while so the last year we launched an ad in the theft protection product um which allows us to really verify your identity and we've been testing this and a lot of success and making sure that we can verify people's information so yes it's entirely possible someone can fake being you and they can come and hit your information but they'd have to you don't have to have access to your email most likely and your phone number and then through some records matching we we sent a postcard to your house to make sure that your never that addresses how to match and public records so we go through quite an extensive verification process and we adapt that process based upon country we go into and public records availability but by and large the process we go through is the same process that banks and and exchanges go through already so all we're doing is we're making sure that to a high degree we can we can validate that you are who you say you are and it may not be a hundred percent but it's gonna be a lot better than a light touch background check what types of partners do you envision and like how will you get them to adopt Civic so that's one of the reasons why we're doing a token sale we felt that so that needs to be something which is a community based movement and we wanted to create a platform where people can really get involved and help us change the world and make ensure data privacy and security and it's really there's a fundamental terror I think you know cryptography world and and there's this freedom of information and this knowledge of how unsecure our data is everywhere and so my structure in the token cell in such a way where you can get tokens as part of the network so we issue in Belem tokens double use for smart contracting and data transfers etc and many other things but in order to get tokens you can do two things you can buy them in the token cell or you can earn them so as a developer if you choose to integrate Civic you will be receiving tokens for driving traffic getting people on board and depends on the partnership we have you will earn free tokens and be part of the networking and obviously we only have a fixed time of token so it's gonna go to the people early on who helped us build the network and get to scale and that's one of the best reasons I think we've thought about in terms of reasons for why a token still makes sense how do you how do you involve the community so civic will own one third of the tokens and two thirds would be sitting in the community and people can choose to buy or own both and so I understand how you're going to use the tokens to build the network but then like once the network's kind of like sufficiently large enough what will the tokens have a function then well the tokens have function effective from day one when you know once we launch the market barriers the tokens act as a smart contracting system so right now Civic is the only ID verification service in the network so to speak so we're we're the ones doing the verification but the plan and the partnerships were busy forging right now are for large institutions to come in they may have 1020 million customers and give their customers their data and like that customer to use it at other websites through the Civic network and those websites who then receive the data can validate that it was validated by the SSF example a bank if a bank ever your personal information on the app or through civic said look you can now use the slower to log in to a website or to open up a security account or to you know apply for medical insurance whatever it is you could have a situation where the the recipients let's say for example it's a different financial institutions as well we trust this bank and instead of us doing a whole process on you and spending 10 20 dollars they're asking for one dollar fee or 50 cent fee we're gonna pay them that one dollar fee and we know that you open account instantly because the the keys matched your information matches we're pretty certain that that's you so then you basically have both of these things as you are partners right and you are kind of like the facilitator of ensuring that the information from the first bank is is all kosher in that and not okay it matches what the second banquet would require exactly and so so and you take it to the next level I mean when you have multiple institutions in this platform you can drive the costs of kyc and ID verification right now I mean right now the world spending tens of billions of dollars on verifying the same people over and over and over and if we make it reusable it can be a lot more simpler easier faster more secure and then to go back to how you were saying the tokens can be used in smart contracts what's an example of what that would look like so a list of example your profile may have it's called Fe stations so it may have three companies one company would say one bank would say this is Laura and we verified the social security number you may have a health you may have two or three other bits information who knows and when you do a transaction with another organization and they need to get some of this information from you there needs to be a you know a way of settling for the city Miss Martin so the smart card we're going to show that the person who verified the information gets paid for verifying the information and it may have to be split between multiple parties and they have different they're in different countries so they're me different currencies and etc so and then they kind of had to execute so in a way that's private because you don't want necessarily the one party to know where you're at decisions came from because there's a privacy issue that so the smart contracting systems basically ensuring that what a transaction happens that the the tokens get split up between the right parties there's a transaction happens the data center over it's verified as checked and it's all done and secured and the settlement of tokens happens on both ends what's interesting about what you're saying is that in this case these are like b2b payments essentially but your token sale is gonna be to the crowd so at what you know what what are the ways in which the tokens kind of move between consumers and and the and the business layer where is the b2c aspect so the BC aspect for consumers is they'll be services that so they will provide some background checks maybe credit reports we do ID verification protection services right now and you can pay for those services using these tokens we will accept these tokens as a way of paying for services that we are offering the consumers our network as well but it's largely focused on the b2b it's largely focus on developers because think about it this way if you have tokens which operate in the network and we write smart parent contracts which you want to execute and you are to lower your kyc costs you find other companies or 18650 tokens and an ASIC you the smart contracts with them on the network using the using the tokens so you're hoping a lot of developers my in your ICM well they don't have to buy they just need to develop on our platform and integrate with Civic and integrate with our network and then their tokens they don't necessarily need to own them themselves no so so part of the early adoption cycle is getting especially the cryptic developers behind us and integrating and help contributing to building Civic building the network and by doing that we were like a tokens today okay so the part of the one-third one-third one-third is the federal tokens are going to be given away for partners to come on and strengthen the network by bringing users on board by bringing integrations ways of transferring data etcetera so yeah if we had partners coming on board that had millions of users and wanted to reduce their KRC cost and the verification cost that would add a tremendous amount of value to the network so we would give them a grant of tokens based on about the following million in both in the network and so that's how we strengthen the network so fears of choosing partnerships then both the network would and tokens as well no interesting but that's that's really interesting to give away ticket that's kind of your business partnerships and these tokens are valuable because there's a limited amount of them so if you want to gather network you need the tokens and if you as a company if you come on board early and you get a healthy allocation of tokens you may never need to pay for kyc services for a long time because you know you'll also be earning tokens when people are using the data for the existing customer base so there's a strong incentive for early adopters with what we're doing right now okay and then how does cific its itself make money it seems like you're making money from the tokens that then are you taking kind of the transactions or so we write smart contracts for these tokens and when you give these smart contracts they'll be a percentage of the of the of the token that goes to us wait a percentage of the tokens yes it was a transaction where one token was exchanged for an information exchange there may be a percentage of that token which would execute to our wallets as far as the transaction okay no interesting um so one other thing that I was just curious about is you've been active in so many different ways in cryptocurrency but why did you decide to focus on identity so at my previous company gift we we found that Adonai was a mass upon people using some credit cards the forces are very difficult to [Music] to catch alright and the reason is because it's not really a card problem using a logarithm from the card networks is that well it's card enough present and he can't verify who the person is and and so the merchant takes the charge back in he gets the hit and that's really the issue is that we haven't really as a society solved personal prisons how do you know and how can you digitally confirm someone who they say they are if they're not physically they and we've got to the point now where I mean let's be honest even the sounds physically there we let people walk into banks with a stolen driver's license to pretend to be someone else I mean it doesn't work right so how do we need a better solution and so identity is one problem that hasn't been solved I think the the blockchain is well suited to that the victim bar chain and other box chains potentially as well we focus on the humbucker and blockchain and one of the things that I think we feel strongly about in the company is with bigger greater mission is that you know I'd like to see democracy change or less like to see a skill appointment boating for president is inclusive of everyone not just people who can afford to take the day or finger vote and and I'm from South Africa I grew up under apartheid and investment that was released I witnessed how you know people stand in lines for days to go vote and it's kind of crazy right so I come from a world where I was born without a vote and and so as a mission like if I could give fo ting to the world it would be amazing if I can do people follow the mobile phones any part of the world where they are like if you're traveling while your elections are in the country you can't really participate there's a way of doing it but it's really cumbersome and voting is not secure I mean people relations get hacked good luck hacking the record watching you know so if we could get the point where you could use tokens as a way of voting if you could use you know bitcoins or any other crypto to vote it would be very interesting because the results of tabulates in real time you'd have you know you'd have results you'd have guaranteed no double spin guarantee no double votes different so so that was like the origin for the company Civic and then we thought about the problem one more and we realized to solve that problem we have to solve identity first and because when I spoke to lawmakers wrong on voting there's we've already ensure the technology exists and you can hug you the current take is pretty bad and it's prone to hacking and yeah blockchain Tech is great but the real issue isn't there's a I think lawmakers just on their faith and in the fact that identity is digitally secure and sound and so they would not be willing for years I mean the one conversation here with the state representative emmer said yeah well we could probably earth in about eight to ten years time and that's probably about right but in between now and then you've gotta get to a point where digital identities actually solved so then it becomes have a no-brainer to use a way of digit devoting and so that's that's kind of a long-term vision for company no interesting and on the back end now are you using Bitcoin or aetherium or private you know we're using Bitcoin we felt the color is the most secure and non partisan type of coin outfit its global yeah it's in every country the notes get everywhere it's just it's you know obviously there's a pending heartful and that may be coming soon there's some other issues there but we think that the long-term the security M it's more the neutrality of Bitcoin kind of serves the purpose for voting versus having you know you have example could go to the theorem but then you know the they actually all of the personalities penny theorem and there's a foundation and and this is some form of centralization they you think about it but it's bit quite I mean you know fair you have core developers and you've got mining civilization but largely I think everyone realizes the Bitcoin is something which is just clearly it's in the technology stuff is neutral so there's no other than one government that yes that you know it would not be it can be taken over by another government necessarily and I think we would have better an arms race that happened because everyone sees Bitcoin has a global asset and this is controlled by one person or persons right now good all you otherwise but I think the logic says I think it's pretty neutral a lot of these certain launches are happening on aetherium but are you doing yours on bitcoins so we'll be issuing a pre token using if you're MC 20 yes because the small counting systems already in the marketplaces already obviously we're were rolling it off now but it'll be written about I would say conservatively I say q1 and we expect he'll be ready by then but the reason we're doing that we reason we're not using necessarily using energy 20 going forward long term is that we've both on both points so when we saw what our scale was doing and with smart contracting and on Bitcoin we and because our systems are built in Bitcoin just makes more sense for our CSRs can not have to try and integrate into here and have a bridge between teachers that are asking when is that launching well there any live on contestant on the test net right now and it seems like everything's going well so I think you know in the next couple of months we'll have something there and then we'll test it long as we feel is secure and and robust well overall out of them we should be the first token sale and that runs on our SDK but you know we're confident that they can pull it off but we you know for now an issue in university 22 can remove it we'll take it from there so but when they met what you said was you're issuing a pre token I don't know what that means so a pre token is basically look the tokens not gonna be functional in the sense that you can't really use it for the small contracting isn't even built in we haven't lived in this part contracts for the RC 20 token but you'll be able to at the time exchange that for the final token and for some reason if we decide to stay with you 20 or there's some of the issues we would basically use that token moving forward but we're pretty confident that the RSK team can execute and get us a ready in time to deploy the platform so we were expecting to be an honor stay and be the first and I think it's also good for Bitcoin I mean I'm a big Bitcoin believer and supporter and you know I think Bitcoin is is good the power to change the world and I'd love to see us doing smart contracts on the top of Bitcoin about to see us using Bitcoin for a variety of different use case other than many transfers and payments and and I'd like to skip this so we're gonna keep pushing on that and if for some reason we had a limitation I just can't make it happen sure we'll use other we use other technologies but for now I think we can get there so it's just a couple more things about this though like sometimes they say that if you launch a token you should do it when your networks already functional so that way it like reduces the chance you'll be your token won't be deemed of security but do you feel like you're running that risk doing it this way not at all I mean we most people are running token sales and I see us right now on the back of a white paper with no tick and we spent two years building a platform Jonnie and we've got all the infrastructure running verification processes it works it functions and so the last part is really writing the smart contracts and integrating it into the back end so I said that the platform is nearly ready a few more months ago so I don't think that is you know we're really setting right now is a product it's a you can use the part of today and so we're studying network access to the the product way you can start monetizing your customer data and any revenue from it and so that network access is what we we've got the packaging as a token and we're selling so we've also been very I'd say circumspect about how would you talk and sell versus every others still out there and a lot of people have set up offshore companies and foundations and you know Virgin Island trusts and whatever all this fancy the tech structuring you know miss we've thought about this very long and hard we spoken to our attorneys Perkins could have been advising us really well in the process and working with Deloitte as well and yeah we could have done all that we could have gone through this and maybe it would have been okay from a legal perspective and maybe we could have you know saved a whole bunch of money in taxes but the reality is were not some sketchy offshore company trying to take you know money and hide it from Texas until since you start where I should just building building cool tech and we think that we can change the world so at the end of day we decided to keep it as where we are a venture capital fund a Delaware c-corporation with the board with you know all the structure has done this before we're gonna pay the taxes as we as we need to the money flows into the company into the u.s. is regulated from you know the the US company and we're based in Pella also what-you-see-is-what-you-get we're not gonna do any fancy or crazy and and in doing so we think yeah we're gonna walk the straight and narrow line and you know maybe we don't save as much so we don't raise as much or whatever it is but you know it's it's it's more important that we do it the right way you think okay and um I also wanted to ask you why why did you not go for VC funding this time I totally understand the function of the token and all that but like I know you know initially you were VC funded oh yeah we all these friends okay right but then now you're choosing to raise the money another way why did you go that route so we've raised you know five point seven five million dollars in funding so far actually have announced a lot but yeah settings should be probably by now and so we've raised that much money it's it's a good healthy amount of money for the other company to the point where you've got a product launch ready it's a very difficult building taking our space because remember we're dealing with a lot of regulation with regard to identity consumer information data we have to really take think we've had to read architected so we can effectively store everyone's in the world's information on their own devices and this is a lot of security that goes into that and a lot of thought and take and second is lots of bullets so when it came to the next stage well we could go raise money from a VC and let's say we go and raise some money from VC what does a VC do for our business we think about this is a grassroots level community driven thing I mean we need lots of small developers mean developers cryptocurrency players exchanges etc playing with us so we need to figure out a way to get these guys incentivized to move to a better more secure system because money in the bank itself isn't gonna get us there I mean you've got to get the community to support this so people need to see this is a better way of logging into websites protecting the privacy security and so you know also speaking of VCs you know as I do in Silicon Valley up until a month ago two months ago the Bitcoin blockchain at I mean they treated it like 1999 right well 2000 the big public crash and they paid no attention to it so I spent most of my time in VC meetings educating these guys and having them to bring in more people to educate and then the other day I don't think they quite get it and now they you know on a criminal trying to catch up and figure out what's going on in this IC no space and and it's sad but it's the second you know this is years of experience that people in the Crippler community had understanding this and how it works and and IV she's the time play catch-up and so you know I'd rather take I'd rather take a view that working with the community and building something which everybody benefits from and people who understand it so we targeting the crypto cunyfirst will become the early adopters and that would basically then encourage mass-market option over time because people would understand why this is important and the value and it's always just better to have you know hundreds of thousands of people who are part of a network this is one VC this is such an interesting conversation but we're gonna take a break just for a second for an important word from our sponsor on-ramp and then we'll talk more about your background before Civic and also we'll talk more about Bitcoin and crypto in general with so many companies vying for people's attention now it's important to stand up from the pack if you're looking to become a

your firm's lead in the market learn more and see examples of its work at think on-ramp comm I'm talking with Vinnie lingam CEO and co-founder of civic so let's go to your background how did you get in Bitcoin so when I was running gift my previous company and we launched in late 2012 we got hit by a ton of credit card fraud I mean thought with thousands of dollars and then some day is like five grand in a day from you know people overseas and whatnot and it was tough because your startup in the in a very tight budget we haven't raised that much capital and so we were had to figure out how do we get past all this for how do we is the moment n the fraud fault is up the moralist sells we had no problems we would have a customer support so it was a fine line kind of balance and making sure charge backs were not a big issue and being around January or February of 2012 he was January I started chained to a friend of mine one of my advisors and he was chatting about Bitcoin I kind of had about before when I dismissed it the usual cycle and the price is back up again I was like a gonna go bison so I want to buy some coins from winces yeah patient zero for Bitcoin in Silicon Valley it says this guitarist CEO of zap oh yeah and this is back in 2012 and I'd noticed I didn't wince this fool for many years because I was part of endeavor the interpreter foundation organization and so you know winces was yeah if you know insta sees he was always on fire about Bitcoin and and yeah I watched the the run up to 255 bucks and once it crashed onto like 50 this is very exciting and interesting time to the trading made some money lots of money cab broke even in the end and but I was I was hooked right this is the next big thing and I decided to plug Bitcoin into your gift and so we worked with Tony Eagle ap from bitpay and we integrated and my developers thought I was crazy IV she thought I was nuts and I mean I bet one of my developers he wouldn't read it more a thousand dollars in sales and the first day he did he didn't believe it so I want a bottle of wine from him but we did I mean we broke a thousand bucks in the first day and eventually we're doing hundreds of thousands of dollars eventually millions a month in Bitcoin cells and so you know when we stole the company the first data we had grown the business tremendously on the back of Bitcoin but we really started seeing you know more payments through credit cards and PayPal and just we took something which is really but yeah it was really a cryptic community-focused product and we took a mainstream so in the end you know gift for using missing 10% of its total volume on Bitcoin in the beginning was doing 95% but that helped us get all the merchants on board because we had volume whereas wouldn't have had volume use of the credit cards and so yeah it's a Bitcoin was instrumental actually in getting gifts from a niche audience to the mainstream audience we're now it's but far the biggest online gift outside wait so I'm still confused by that like 95% of the gift cards being bought on gift were being paid for with Bitcoin initially because we're just targeting the Bitcoin community right so so we had everyone from the Bitcoin community coming in using us and it was a way of you know usually spending your bitcoins and going shopping and buying stuff at you know all the great stores that we had and it helped us attract more stores because we had this you know I'd rather have like 10,000 like super loyal excited happy customers than millions of people who don't really do much and so the theme of the crypto community is they're very passionate and so when they see a great service they tell their friends they get involved and it's kind of why we're doing the same thing with civic we want the community get involved I want you know a million crypto you know futures to understand the technology and how we were protecting their privacy in the data telling their friends about it and taking the product mainstream's that's why I'm kind of using the lessons I learned from gift in civic and engaged in the community of us and people basically were they were holding Bitcoin and they couldn't like spend it at Amazon so what they were doing or I don't know who were some of your I mean Amazon Starbucks target was big retailer still do I wanna say we gift us well okay and so since they wanted to shop at those doors but they couldn't spend oh I see yeah so we open up 55,000 visas new retail locations to anyone at held a Bitcoin really thank you the days so you could go to any other stores dollar gift that buy a gift card and we would have zero fraud oh well right and no charge no chargebacks and so we were very happy to take the money and our margins are much higher and then we introduced loyalty points which incentivize the network here in law and so we both an integrator on that so we're counting the same thing with tokens in civic we gave me tokens to reward users and partners and making everyone feel part of the network and so engaged in the crypto community with something which they're comfortable so tokens and that's why we do the token sauce so this is this is a natural evolution of what we what I learned at gift and applying to serving him and already within you know just announcing the platform you getting out there the response has been phenomenal so let's let's talk more generally about Bitcoin and crypto and I want to talk about your reputation as the Bitcoin price Oracle how did you get into the business of Bitcoin price prediction well I never be in the business of price notation I kind of dragged into that part I mean how is in the business of giving fundamentals and talking about fundamentals and advice so when I said that the coin summit conference in 2014 Bitcoin and Carnap and I was watching the data from the back end of gift so I could see when people Spain with a don't strain based upon the price and so I had a lot of insights that I've gained from how consumer behavior followed the price and so when I sat down at this conference I think it was March March or April of 2014 everyone is like pence trunk like they were but I was like in a box or whatever it is 17 bucks and they all thought it was gonna go mm that year look like I asked the whole room anyways in 2000 and the funny thing is like a year before that I was at the San Jose Bitcoin conference where it bickered was 100 bucks or something in and everyone thought it is not gonna go up that much the high seas a thousand so we hit a thousand the previous year I got the WoW if any how'd you know and then I said okay well it's gonna go down and it goes sideways for a long time until these issues resolved and I pointed out a lot of blog posts about the fundamentals of people spending the money merchan abduction lack of on Rams for Bitcoin etc you know like a fear to buy Bitcoin cetera and so I was able to make predictions based upon market fundamentals understand which I communicated in my blog post and then about 12 to 18 months era but when he kind of brought him down to the 200 so normal day and then started climbing back up again and then I felt that okay the final is to change against our another blog post called Bitcoin awakens there was about a year ago I thought the 450 mark and I said all the reasons why I think bitcoin will go to you know over a thousand bucks you know in 2016 basically it they I think within a couple of hours to Cepeda pay was exchangeable CAD was like my New Year's Eve 1000 bucks and and you know along the way just my tweets like I was able to call certain you know false drivers of Bitcoin getting started and whatnot and make fun with Ryan sulcus and you know because they both say oh this is the next big grinding noise like no it's not and and yes but I spoke about the having and how the fact that would have and how it would go sideways for a while again so I made a number of good prediction of Bitcoin the one prediction which which I made which I can people kind of homey to is the fact that at 12:50 at the etf announcement i said that BTW it's not going to happen which it didn't and i said the price in the tank and may not recover very quickly and i have a price target i said look i mean it's just a tally on the upside I think but couldn't goes to two thousand or whatever the number was if he just approved but it doesn't taste like 850 and it dropped down to 880 and I actually thought it will go below eight fifty Hertz maybe in my name is stay there but my my prediction relation and I guess someone's hit so much for not hitting the 850 number I people to understand like that was more directional it was like hey it's gonna go and the fact that it broke 900 went down it's like pretty close to my mind 815 880 that's fine yeah exactly so then I get I get a lot of crap on front when I started just meeting people because I think Twitter is not a place for debate oh yeah no it's not I I'd like to read the threads like I try not to engage too much um but wait so when it asked like you know when you were saying that you felt like the market fundamentals didn't weren't there in 2014 but then things changed um so what are some of the things that did change about was it again I guess a year ago like what what did you seem then that you felt like was gonna enable the price rise well I definitely felt that hobbing coming up would have an impact it was like just about a year ago it was like well 11 July Oster July yeah so about a year ago they would have an impact and when Chris bike and they were there's a number of things like you know global markets instability I wrote about the currency commodity but coming to sort of value though I mean I did I have to say the people is that Bitcoin moves up too fast it's gonna create bubbles and crashes and people don't wanna listen so we're gonna be in that phase again so so it's not what you think is going on now well I first of all I think that the I did not expect we're trying to go over you know the twelve fifty thirteen hundred mark and it did and you were drawn because that's typically invest we mean you didn't think it wouldn't go far second hundred this year well I told the skating issues resolved in the honks that's right I didn't believe it and I also believe that by you know the price being kept lower that would have quicker resolution on the on the skating debate because at some point it's off profitable to keep mining and so I had a whole you know a little bit of a I went on a limb on that one but what but all that happened essentially was the price kept rising and people don't care about the the technical fundamentals of Bitcoin and so now we're situation where transactions but are 100 bucks to make any sense because the fees and you know and and the it's not a healthy situation everyone knows that so the me also coming in and people are learning that and I and so I don't like to see that any bitcoins not you know probably double 1250 I mean I bleep you sold at 12:50 because I felt that was a short term you know cap we've had a run and the reasons for the run I'm not so sure are necessary sustainable but what a did do is it brought confidence back into the market and the broader markets and I you know people who have no idea what bitcoin is buying Bitcoin and well I've seen a story crab before and we'll see how high those afford comes back down again I think so where do you think this investments coming from from people who don't really know what's going on yeah I think it's more they well I mean I've had tons of friends contact me they they wouldn't know a Bitcoin from an ISA I've no idea what they're doing and they finish I buy so I'm liking people advice anymore I'm just gonna step back in and see what happened so look the way I look at it is I've always been a level-headed reasonable person through the years and when things are like out of whack on the downside people think I'm crazy like but coin a thousand bucks that you're not according are you have 3x are you nuts and everyone's a different personal risk and personal risk and an appetite so when it comes to personal risk appetite I mean I had a ton of my net worth you know double digits sitting in Bitcoin at 12:50 and I just didn't feel comfortable with the way world was and I already found holding significantly I hope you I sold 90% of my coins but is what I have left is though a decent amount of money but for my personal risk appetite announced effectively doubled to 20 percent whatever it is you know it's a it's a decent amount of money and I'm happy to support Bitcoin but I wasn't comfortable with the with the price given the risk and if you look at again the reasons for the run some of the fundamentals you've got fiat the tango each exchanges you've got you know all time I mean right now and I think BitFenix 360 percent of your interest to lend dollars to people who are going long on Bitcoin I mean at some point this stuff I saw this happen in 2013 as well and and it happens and there's stuff on wines and so it's kinda like musical chairs music stops you should have a change the bubbles gonna pop this year and and what's gonna happen it may never pop I mean it may it may never thought the reality is that markets they can stay rational for longer periods I'm Likud look at the traditional financial markets you've got bonds which are in a bubble you've got there's a lot of I mean with capitals cheap worldwide everything gets inflated I mean people in Japan can borrow yen for zero percent interest and go buy a Bitcoin so what's gonna have the price keeps going up the velocity of price increases more my concern the faster it goes up the fastest can come down and the other thing which people forget is that when new money comes into the system these aren't long term holders the people coming in to speculate they're selling their houses I've seen these stories again just like we did four years ago and they're putting all their money into Bitcoin really yep and what happens in the price drops 20 percent well then it drops another 20 or 30 percent because you're penning sell the market because they're holding too much now they they can't service a day like this stuff always ends badly and so when you look at the market right now I'm just I'm biting my tongue I'm you know kind of like tough Joe King I got bored 185 bucks there's like I thought the guy nice to me but if I buy one at that price in the tank right kind of in town let's build up again yeah adds up again and the markets RC rational just largely irrational across the board right the like those coins were three hundred fifty million dollars or something right now so so this this this is everyone in kind of knows been around for a while knows that this is an international market doesn't mean you can make money I think the probably the biggest mistake you make is shorting any rational market it's a bad idea so I'm not shorting I'm not you know going long and I'm just sitting back and waiting to see what happens I think there's a lot of good crypto projects out there right now and these projects was another real value but there's a lot of noise and you can't see the noise from the signals you're gonna lose some money and the way this and I think people need to learn missus as well so instead of me trying to tell people hey there's a bubble watch out I kind of sit back and this to see what happens and again I could be totally wrong I just I see you but you think there's gonna be a correction what would like if so right now bitcoin is above $2,000 like over 2500 yet so what would what what do you think would be like a more reasonable price and kind of like what market fundamentals do you look at to kind of gauge what the value should be like and also what risks you see right now it's not a price issue it's a velocity are value increases it's like it's the quality of money going into the system versus the time there's no one can argue a lot of money's coming to inter Krypton but in past documents it's the quality of money how these people long term or they are they do speculators you know okay but what about like things like the potential heart for I mean that's the issue people my putting money in they don't understand this stuff and so you got people aren't even in Bitcoin I do in the senator say well a hard folk will be fine the reality is that even an 80% hardfocus the contingent heartful then you're gonna have a split and then you're gonna have raju owns bitcoin calm and PTC or calm or whatever else and you can have two different flavors of Bitcoin all of a sudden the whole thesis of Bitcoin only has 21 million units well that's probably 42-minute actually no it's 63 million because now there's three chains like this is another conversation that you can have with with Madeline Street you just sees the price to happen to buy bitcoins so this is a stuff way Bitcoin can go up to five thousand some laters today it can double it can triple the faucet happens the more likely it's gonna crash so and what are the odds do you think of a of a split in Bitcoin where we end up with two coins or three coins much higher than the markets price again okay you bet you don't want any mods no I I don't think it's up to I've written blog post about this I've said my piece I try to always be known as the guy who try to prevent the bubble and I failed okay because it's gonna happen and I think we it's part of a learning cycle we have to go through these bubbles and I think one man can prevent the market from being irrational and if the bubble never bursts and that's great I'm happy for Bitcoin I have bitcoins I'm not going to be complaining about it but again I try to be rational so do you think that the odds of a split are more than 50% or just yeah yeah yes oh wow and so if Bitcoin does split which chain do you think will take the greater market share or be considered the real Bitcoin that one is a very different one that's right because it when you say consider the real Bitcoin by what by the market by the price based a market cap based on fundamentals the majority of people in the whole world people China people in Japan people in Korea people in the u.s. yeah I guess how do you how do you every doctor everybody everyone well bitpay of something the cells have said they'd mind never basically have to run to bitcoins that point operator in both chambers didn't we go well for a while so they would be operating in both chains it's kind of scary right so from some of the constitute consumer tech background when you go and buy one Bitcoin you go to gifts any wanting to spend the coins they and now that you get told that oh we have their own Bitcoin this is not good for business it's not different either Bitcoin a contentious hardfocus that the biggest we've gotta write down and that was my biggest concern and I think that it's gonna happen and the market stopped pricing it in and so the moment the market gets spooked that this is as she can happen and the moment he gets closer to actually happening the more we are they to see the bubble you know plate a bit maybe temporarily maybe for a while I don't know it's uh I'm I never gave myself the article name people pull me an article it's kind of funny it's like again I like to be pretty even even killed about these things so when statements low I'm you know I looked like I'm positive and when cinnamons high and looks like I'm negative that's a whole perspective thing right so let's see I think I want to see us get through this of the year without a lot of contentious heartful and if we do that I've been totally wrong about everything I'm saying and if we we do have a contentious onfocus yeah then people need to realize that again how was the guy who try to stop this listen okay well let's talk more generally also about that ICO trend you kind of like made a few remarks earlier that sort of give a hint what you think but so what would you say is your overall opinion of what's going on right now well look I think there's a number of it's like calm days innocence all right this is new thing people don't quite understand that you know wants a piece of it like you know missing the friends do it the dot-com bubble and burst was really bad for a lot of people in the shop special time but really good for majority of the world for a long period of time and so you don't have to take the good of the bed and so when I look at it as I mean Google raised 25 million bucks during the dot-com mania and we have Google today thankfully for a lot of things right and so I think that you will get some companies and some organizations that leverage as well and and they're able to use this current call it environment to both amazing services for the world and make a difference long term and those will more than pay back all the losses or whatever else but the people who are just like hum des got scammed scammed you know have these crazy parties that the company's thrown and you know in Vegas and burning five million dollars in launch parties like you can have all that crazy stuff happening potentially you also have the problem that people think that because cryptography and technologists are not distribute around the world that the culture is the same run the world around building companies and building organizations it's not and so the discipline aren't building tech companies differs from market to market and how people spend money how they behave how they act how they hire how they fire how they build these services now I think we're a lot more line now than we were 20 years ago in terms of the differences between cultures but these culture there are cultural differences in cars countries in South African I have investments Africa and the culture is different there to the US so I know I'm not saying there you're saying that because of that for that reason than the icos in different places are some are gonna be more scammy or is that what you're saying potentially okay and look at the culture to the Kimberley you know you finally found a start and buy a Ferrari and drive around in the streets of the nation's we all I would point out examples but they get hit pretty hard right so you don't do that in so they came ready you don't go buy a Ferrari off the edge funding or or have a you know the you walk around you know sneakers and and t-shirts a lot more understand it and so the really is about the wealthy but there are other parts the world way you know it's like founders will go buy Ferraris no you know the culture is to go and you know it's less intellectual and I'm not saying it's everywhere I'm not saying every company's the same but there are certain cultures that it's not about them it's all about the good you do in the world the technology to in the world it's about you as a founder and you're you know if you're single of car you drive and house and a playboy lifestyle I see this as I travel on the world and look at investments and look at the people behind it and so the problem with that is that a lot of people are really good at marketing and selling and not as good a technology I must again not saying so think about he has the the monopoly on this I mean you've got great companies in every part of the world but the moment you pull out the bad elements out of certain cultures thirty-fifth a mighty be spent well okay and also so what are some of the things going on in the ICS right now where like you look at that and you're like I wish people would stop that what are what are some of those things well first of all father is taking money off the table and through a sort of token sale and Isis is just nuts like teams I want to take that's just like I have a story about that yesterday and I haven't confirmed them and that's the case and now already like I thought you mean like not putting some of it but interest like immediately yeah yeah into the focus oh wow yeah so that to me is and that's a red flag straight away I think the notion of uncapped token offerings is a bad idea as well I think it's the sins are on signal and I think the the data auction system was bad I think in my opinion but the markets kind of rewarded generous assume that so so be it yeah I think it's about being fair I think it might but like you have to create the value for everyone in the network and so depends is like I'll go secure Network and make sure everyone benefits from the network in you know in many ways and I don't think everyone says the same sort of ambition so some people this is a get-rich-quick scheme some people basically because they outside the u.s. they can they can do these I CEOs and other jurisdictions and they can take the money and run and it's not you can really do about it and so the people and the team and the quality of the work and the track record is very important to me not to say that people with no track record should be discarded I mean the quality of the works but I think it's it's it's you you got to find I mean I think people go from one end to the ramp they go from the air to the end of well it's a venture-backed company must be great to if it's not venture better must be crap okay and I think there's a middle ground here and there's a little ground way just because the team isn't bench battle or necessarily have experiences they couldn't be balling something amazing but they they should be some governance structure in place some you know besides those two guys in a room who's on a tee - there's some advisors do they have a board member do they have someone who is going to you know look over them and and help them it is in pedigree oh and and sometimes you give RQL doesn't matter but many building companies and your building technology companies and startups and you're working with people and you're hiring and the way you treat your people is important the way you both the culture is important the way you you try to be non non race non-racist non prejudicial like equal opportunity for women all these things I think it's important I think you can't you cooperate in today's society with the same biases that we've had in the past and you've got to be a bit more for thinking and sometimes the technologists who sit in the room come for the stuff they don't know how to operate these organizations and businesses and so you get the situation away and it's changing now I mean bitcoins been largely male-dominated now that only is entirely the the technologists fault I think it's just a nature of the the people who were into crypto or whatever else and and thus technology cycl were largely you know large email whatever reasons society education yeah yeah so she's boys into you know techie special types and girls into not exactly yeah so but so you can't blame the people in this city but then it's also upon us to try and bring in diversity into organizations so we can't say well because society created this problem it's heavily started one towards one group that we can't fix it yeah and so so so I think that's so key and culture is important and I think when you're backing a team and you don't know about their views on culture and and what they doing like I'd like to look at the capital is something which is like I call a conscious capital so if I am based in something I wanna believe in the team want to believe what their vision is the values these are important things to me like the only reason teammate is well I mean we're not innovation the team that's racist know when I raced a team that prejudicial towards a certain group know like so why don't we find these facts art and that only way you do is like by getting to other people and understanding their vision what they see and their values and I think it's it's a lot easier to align values when you know people versus when you just rhenium i paper oh well so that means that it must be pretty difficult to invest in nico none I mean is another they need again and since sometimes it's investing sometimes by tokens like you can its didn't tokens you can easily buy because of what it is and it's not ready link to the culture of the company and model the service people want exactly so there's lots of reasons before I fed I think III like this as a start-up investor investing of that shark tank like in on Shark Tank if I don't give a sense of the people of what the cultural alignment with my values I don't like this okay yeah I actually said we don't have a lot of time left but I do want to ask you a few remaining questions so one of them is about shark tank how did you get on that and how has that experience been for you so yeah those great experience I I was invited to be on Dragon's Den which is like the UK and Canadian version of shark tank three years ago in South Africa now I went on it was a great experience and then Sony owns the rights to dragons in so that were our shark tank in South African myself and the other dragon was selected to be sharks as well so it was great not a shock time for my favorite TV shows in the US and I'll be watching in four years so I really enjoy rested Mark Cuban seat and I get to see all these South African pitch ideas and one of the deals we did was all paid tools which was on the show and these guys came and they were trying to like figure out how to monetize this thing and put my guys won just used like the buff chain and once you create through the rarity of these items and and so they didn't they didn't ICO and they sold a million dollars or tokens and outs and literally up like the data that's at 20x and so I mean at the end the markets frothy to say the least so everything is up 26 but but it was interesting that we were able to take something on stock that we did the first I did the first have a Bitcoin deal on shark tank and I was way around between stocks at the time as well and so it was a good experience and again met some interesting people what are their projects and tokens are you interested in I actually never I mean Shark Tank I kind of had to talk about data bits and whatever else because it was a TV show broadcast I couldn't hide the fact that I was behind it and but I actually never talked about what I like it when I don't like publicly because I do have a large audience on Twitter and a large following so I say XYZ coin is gonna be big it's the the price will just move and people buy because I said so and I just want to be responsible for that so I'd largely limited my commentary to Bitcoin because it's I can't move the Bitcoin price trust me no everyone stay stuck with a bigger price try as I might so a little bit a Bitcoin a nice G theorem and a little bit unless I mean I'm less a favor for theory and I'm always a Bitcoin yeah well I want to get what's your take on a theorem I don't like the unlimited supply the numbers are not for me I know they trying to move to proof of state but that mean they're the comments we can have a look at what the supply looks like then I'm not sure why if you do the math that we need so much Theory amount they in terms at that price and so I'm still trying to Hitler on that so I don't know it looks published to me if it's extremely published to me but again I can be wrong I'm I'm yeah it's it's hard to call the top is why I used in no idea I mean it is irrational on demand for certain items and it'll go up in price is one of those things and at the other day it needs to be used in the real world and if the Arianism is I'll give me a better technology it's you know it's a different use case of Bitcoin I think I think Bitcoin is real long term store of value and I think if there's a a more color settlement layer smart contracts it's very closer to what we're trying to do with with civic and so I respected theorem and again price and that you are always two things which people that understand like it I don't hate a theorem and this was sort of the price is aligned with the value content do you have any price predictions for Bitcoin by the owner near my price prediction for end of this year was three thousand bucks okay and I did say we should get there as slowly as possible okay no one kiss there in like a day we'll see but that was the finish tonight last year and so I think the annual predictions have been spot-on for four years now pretty good well we'll check back in and say no you did um okay well where can people learn more about your work and get in touch with you the evening and become is my blog you log in there and then at the kneeling I'm on Twitter and then Sarah comes my company so check it out if you're a developer get hold of us we'll have to figure how to get you some tokens and you have been running and if your user damaged Civic we're gonna be giving users tokens as well as part of the part of the distribution so yeah just try it out and tell people about it and use it and and give us feedback and tell us how to make it better and how we can better protect your data great well thank you so much for coming on the show Thank You Laura thanks everyone for joining us today
