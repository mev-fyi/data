Hogan from Unchained has the scoop that'd be good the price of Bitcoin is up and twenty six thousand dollars it hit its peak since June 2022. honestly watching its value rise to its highest level in nine months is the closest most Bitcoin gross will come to ever giving birth even though crypto is now totally unbanked after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank Signature Bank and silvergate bank this rise in bitcoin's price might be evidence that maybe banking is overrated personally I keep all my money in venmo I don't say that Regulators shut down Signature Bank in an attempt to send an anti-crypto message but this is evidence that their plan has backfired I can't decide if I find that satisfying being asked to choose who I'm rooting for between regulators and Bitcoin holders is like being asked if I want the temperature at 12 degrees or 112 degrees Regulators missed the Mark here they don't need to shut down a whole bank just to send an anti-crypto message it would be enough to just read the quote tweets on anything SBF puts out it's not as though crypto is permanently unbanked either like a bunch of banks have indicated that they may tentatively accept crypto including Santander HSBC Deutsche Bank and the Ghost of bear Stearns thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Jim and the recent Market developments around these Bank closures check out the show
