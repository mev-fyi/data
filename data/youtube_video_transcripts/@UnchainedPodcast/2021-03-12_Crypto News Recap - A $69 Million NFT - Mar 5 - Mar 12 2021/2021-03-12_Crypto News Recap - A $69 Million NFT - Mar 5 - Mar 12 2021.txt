[Music] heads up everyone before we get into the news recap i wanted to mention that when we did the show last month all about crypto taxes for 2020 i asked about taxes on nfts but i asked only about nfts for creators i neglected to ask about taxes on nfts for investors i reached back out to one of our guests sheehan chandrasekhra of cointracker who graciously wrote up a quick explanation of how nfts get taxed for nft investors to briefly recap how nft creators get taxed he writes quote creators get taxed at the time they sell nfts say sam created an nft artwork and sold it for two eth valued at two thousand dollars he would report two thousand dollars as ordinary income if he's in the business of creating nfts he can also deduct business related expenses to reduce the tax bill and so as for nft investors this is what she han had to say about how they'll be taxed investors are individuals who buy and sell nfts for speculative purposes most people fall into this category for investors taxes work very similar to crypto trading there's a taxable event whenever you sell an nft into cash or another cryptocurrency profits are subject to capital gains tax rules say sally purchased an nft for two eth worth four thousand dollars in january 2021. if she were to sell this nft for ten thousand dollars in march 2021 with a holding period of less than 12 months she would have a short-term capital gain of six thousand dollars and this six thousand dollars would be subject to her ordinary income tax rate if she were to sell this nft for 10 000 after holding it for more than 12 months say in march 2022 the profit of 6 000 would be subject to more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates one interesting item to note is that some nfts could fall under the definition of collectibles under the irs rules the maximum long-term capital gains tax rate for collectibles is 28 the maximum long-term capital gains for crypto non-collectible nfts is 20 all right now time for the news recap

potentially reducing the total supply of eth while eip-1559 may sound exciting for eath holders and application builders a majority of ethereum miners reportedly over 60 of the network's hash power oppose eip-1559 as it effectively reduces minor revenue stream miners however have few options to stop eip-1559 outside of a hostile 51 attack which is a highly unlikely attack vector given the lack of economic incentives now that the proposal is approved the reduction in minor compensation may lead to a rise in the implementation of minor extractable value software which takes advantage of a
