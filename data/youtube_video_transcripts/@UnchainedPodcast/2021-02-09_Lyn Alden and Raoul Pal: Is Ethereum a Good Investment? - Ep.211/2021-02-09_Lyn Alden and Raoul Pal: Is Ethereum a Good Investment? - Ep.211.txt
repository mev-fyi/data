founder of lynn alton investment strategy and raul powell founder and ceo of global macro investor and real vision group welcome lin and rao great to be here hey thanks for having me both of you are widely respected for your financial analysis and views and you're also both known for being big believers in bitcoin and yet you two have opposite views on the value of ether which is the asset native to the ethereum network well in january you tweeted if equals btc like it or not what do you mean by that and how did you come to that conclusion you know again i'm a macro guy so i'm you know i'm not i don't know the engineering background that lynn has but how i approach this is i look at the attributes of how it trades as an asset and what i did is i looked at estimations of network effects and said well do they look similar and when you plot out bitcoin's journey its market cap or its price versus the number of active wallets actually there's a nice clear regression line um and it happens after a certain period of time so it gets to about five million wallets and then it goes in a very clear steep line which is essentially an estimation of metcalfe's law and i found that ethereum was exactly mirroring bitcoin when i say exactly when i look at it on a plot graph with the same regression it looks similar but because it started later it just follows bitcoin earlier but in fact it's adoption i.e the number of wallets at this time is actually faster rate of adoption than bitcoin had but what's super interesting is when you go back and match them from one million active wallet addresses each their prices are identical and their price movements have been identical and that took me by surprise i didn't expect to see that because that normally doesn't happen you have to fit the graphs but it perfectly fits in every way it's exactly currently in the 2017 run-up the bitcoin and at exactly the same time after i hit a million wallets it gives you something similar so that's when i say ethe equals bitcoin is because when you think of it in macro terms they're both really network effects and so they may have very different properties there may be different things entirely and people struggle with value when it comes to network effects they almost everybody underestimates value by definition because we try and anchor it on something that we perceive as value but network effects are so hard to think because they're exponential yeah this is really interesting and you're right when i think to the kind of like late 2013 early 2014 run up in bitcoin i think it peaked at about 12 50 and then eth in the last cycle peaked at about 14 something 20 or roughly so just 200 or less than 200 dollars they both had 90 pullbacks everybody said they were dead they were worthless bitcoin got down to about 100 and started rallying eth got down to 100 started right i mean it's literally identical and it's that's weird that's weird yeah yeah yeah no definitely i i mean it was compelling i mean the one thing that i do have to ask you which uh you know i um didn't prepare early enough to send you an email but i just was trying to figure out did the metrics about the wallets come from blockchain.com because when i was looking at the blockchain.com wallet numbers i couldn't really match them against your slides and then i was wondering like anyway but did it come from blockchain.com not sure remy my uh analyst who puts together the data got it from i'm not sure what sources but i don't think it was blockchain.com oh okay okay all right so yeah maybe i can send an email then we can put a link or something in the show notes okay so lynn you have a totally different conclusion after writing like an extremely well researched piece on all the ins and outs of ethereum so based on that extensive research you concluded that you would not invest in ethereum at this time so what factors led you to that decision yeah so one thing i point out is i don't really view my my position as opposite of raoul i actually think there's a ton of overlap um it's just not a perfect overlap and the you know the way i kind of look at it is so for example in the article uh the overall conclusion is that i i could see a non-zero allocation to ethereum is making sense and so if i i gave for example 80 bitcoin 20 ethereum or 90 bitcoin 10 ethereum or 100 to zero i think there's still a case uh to kind of you know focus on bitcoin which is what i'm i'm preferring to do uh but i also point out that you know if a theorem were to break over 1400 which now as as of this recording it has that's pretty bullish for the price action during during a bull market in a broad sense and so it's not necessarily that i'm bearish on the price in any kind of given six or 12 month period it's more about outlining various pros and cons and then kind of sharing some of the concerns i had and so i do agree that it is the the you know really the one other protocol that does have a substantial network effect uh and so that that's pretty much undisputable because so many tokens run on ethereum now there's so much development happening on ethereum and i so in my kind of mind i think that the big concern is to make sure we in some ways we separate uh the growth of the ecosystem from the growth of price in the long term uh and because you can be for example very bullish on the the amount of value that's settled on ethereum the amount of uh smart contracts that happen on ethereum and then have a somewhat different view on what happens to actual ethereum token appreciation over the long run when you include bullish and bearish cycles and what i mean by that is for example if you look back during the 2017 high since then about three times as much value settles on ethereum and the market cap is still just roughly back to where it was and you know that for an ethereum bowl uh what you then argue is that therefore ethereum's undervalued and therefore that's kind of a bold case for ethereum a somewhat different view is it you know for people who aren't familiar uh john pfeffer wrote a paper back in late 2017 you know kind of highlighting this problem and basically his argument was that the utility protocols even if they are used for a lot of you know kind of ecosystem gdp you could call it if they're if they're used for a variety of things that the value won't necessarily accrue to those tokens basically you can have a high velocity and that you know there basically might not be kind of a quote-unquote moneyness associated with those tokens in the long term it doesn't preclude those from from being money-ness if we see things like uh you know more and more collateralization of ethereum if you see you know a strong preference towards staking and kind of enough people wanted to to huddle it as money it can still become money uh but basically there's somewhat of a separate argument about the size of the the ecosystem and this and the price of the tokens in the long run although i do agree uh i think in many points that it you know i can see why a lot of people want to have a position in ethereum and i can also see that it does so far have a substantial network effect uh and i think one of the challenges going forward is how ethereum is going to transition because bitcoin is you know for the most part a finished product it's still is still evolving just like any other finished product like they're still making updates to adobe photoshop for example but it's in but it's in like microsoft word exactly but they're release things whereas ethereum because they're still doing radical changes to the underlying protocol and they're you know as they shift from ethereum one to theorem two they go from proof of work to proof of stake they're changing some of them some of the dynamics because they're running into the scaling problems basically there's just a lot more implementation risk i think so you're kind of getting a higher higher risk investment and you know i'm kind of open about whether or not it's higher reward and that's why my preference was i can see why people like it but that my view is i i still like the risk reward of bitcoin the best and you know to be fair lynn and i would probably have roughly seller similar allocations for the same reason you know when we look at asset allocation terms there's three main metrics we use one is liquidity preference so bitcoin has liquidity preference so it's our base in this bet in the in the digital asset space the next is time preference well bitcoin has been around longer it also has a more understandable um both network effect and value proposition so you tend to hold it longer but risk preference and ethereum has both of those but not quite as superior as bitcoin risk preference there is a um because it's earlier and its network affects the chances of more exponential price rises are higher so you need a smaller allocation to have roughly similar effects in the portfolio so we kind of agree the one thing i did want to mention was that john pfeffer paper i kind of wrote a long article about it both of those things firstly he kind of said that the network effect didn't apply to anything said bitcoin which i i think has been proven wrong but the other one is he used the quantity theory of money which basically we threw out in about 1981 um and i worry that trying to look at these in terms of moneyness is trying to compare bitcoin with an apple that they're kind of not the same thing can you explain what the quantity theory of money is well this is this mv equals pq way of of looking and that's why we talk about velocity of money because that was one of the reasons the whole thing fell apart and and you know you're trying to figure out what the overall value of the money proposition is within this and i'm not sure any of that applies and that that was my issue with john pepper's paper i thought it was really interesting but i spent a long time thinking about i thought hey that doesn't work in the real world i mean there isn't literally zero correlation between uh money supply and inflation so that kind of throws all of his arguments all of that kind of freedom and stuff out of the window so i looked at it and thought well what is the difference here i think he's arguing the case for bitcoin about bitcoin as a reserve asset and then saying basically nothing else looks like that and guess what nothing else looks like bitcoin and that's why we love bitcoin you know it has a unique value proposition in the world and many of these other protocols have their own unique value propositions many of them will not get network effect and some that we don't even know of now will have massive network effects it's the same happen with the internet same happened with mobile phone networks and almost any other network that we've seen and so does that mean that you allocated 10 or 20 like lynn was saying she might do if she were to allocate so i started at um 80 20 um the ethereum's gone up a lot more already um and then i allocated more so i'm like 60 35 and then i went further out the risk curve and i bought a basket of alts as well yeah which ones well i'm not going to say because i i get because i don't want to make it like i'm pumping anything you know because the alts world is a little bit wild and crazy so i didn't want to do that but basically what i took was i just looked at ones that looked like they were getting network effects i asked people on twitter i got six and a half thousand responses so i could figure out okay what looks like they've got network effect here i look at the charts and as long as they're a reasonable size market cap i just took an equally weighted basket because i've no clue and i just don't have time to understand these in the depth that you know we've all had to learn bitcoin in and we're all having to get up to speed with ethereum in so i did that because i know in the end everybody does what i've done which is they go further at the risk curve they do it in emerging markets so you might start with the em etf which is a very simple way of getting emerging market exposure then you might get more india exposure because you kind of favor that and it works for your time preference thing okay india i can see that this is going to work for the next 10 years and then as that trend starts developing you start buying all sorts of frontier markets because everybody's piling in the risk curve and the same happens in crypto but and so you don't even know if they were like defy tokens i've got a mix from derivatives to define to dex i mean i've i purposely made a kind of relatively balanced basket you know i didn't it wasn't a totally random process but it was just a yeah okay some of that some of that some of that um to try and get an overall balance of the space you know i wanted interoperability i wanted defy i wanted um fast payment networks i wanted you know just different things different protocols that allow smart contracts and just got an overall basket of that interesting i know and actually so this uh then leads to this other question i wanted to ask you this thing about um metcalfe's law and the value of a network so i was just wondering like does that simple framework apply to any network with any purpose or do you feel like certain purposes will kind of like retain more value better than others well we can see it within let's say social media influencers the more that the larger their network is and the more their network creates connection points with each other and other places the more that that celebrity's worth it's it actually exists almost everywhere it exists in nature as well so a strength of the network comes from the network effect so i think it's it's true almost everywhere and the internet has made it more prevalent um in our everyday lives religion it was basically that too that was a network effect and had metcalfe's law in its earlier days so we do see it in many places and in in biology and in nature uh we see it almost everywhere okay so you don't feel like whether it's a payment network or a borrowing and lending protocol it doesn't matter so facebook google amazon three wildly different um network effects um and we might as well use you know 3g yeah three completely different things uh internet um no instead uh email you know the all massive network effects all wildly different things okay this is yeah this is really interesting so okay another fun argument that i want to explore is lynn's critique was super interesting because there was this point where she was saying that ethereum's use case is what she was calling circular and so if you're a theory lynn can you define that and then explain you know why you think that that makes eth less investable uh sure um one point i want to touch on first though is so if you look at um kind of a couple points there because i think rao brought up really good points and so uh just to kind of hit on a couple of them in a row i think if you look at that that old equation you know that that mv equals pt equation um the one of the things that was wrong with the initial assumption back in the friedman days was that they assumed the velocity was constant and that was the big flaw because as velocity fell you didn't get inflation the same way that it would have been expected by the money supply increase uh so whether or not john fever is making an error it wouldn't be the same error because he's actually one of his kind of assumptions is that velocity will rise in those utility protocols and that that's why even though you have more and more kind of one side of the equation sorting out that it won't necessarily accrue to market cap it'd basically be the opposite reason why uh the friedman version kind of didn't work out and so i think it kind of remains to be seen whether that's happening so far for example because three times as much value settled on the ethereum as it did three years ago and we haven't seen that that rise in the market cap of that level so far i'd argue that the papers it's somewhat on track now whether or not it will continue to be on track i still think it's an open question um and then for for network effects uh we actually do see some kind of divergence in out there so for example if you compare twitter's number of users to facebook's number of users facebook has more but if you look at say the market size comparison it's like night and day and that's because twitter has been less ideal at kind of accruing value from its network in the same way facebook has and if we do a more extreme example uh for example there's no like email companies that have just you know tons and tons of money it's usually like a kind of you know it's kind of a unprofitable segment in some ways of these larger entities now and that's because there's not a ton of money to be had uh in email despite the the massive kind of user base of them similar things for say wikipedia if you were to if if wikipedia was uh kind of valued it'd be less valuable than than other things with a similar kind of amount of traffic because it's just not really prone to monetization and so one of my concerns overall with ethereum is that it could fall more like those other ones where it has a substantial network effect and the overall kind of gdp of the ecosystem is very large and then i think the big question is whether or not that accrues to the value of the tokens and so going back to the point about being circular my concern is that okay during the bull run you know we all expect like most times that you know bitcoin will go up a lot of these alts would probably go up even more and i think the big question is what happens next time and so if you look at kind of uh quote-unquote successful protocols like bitcoin and ethereum so far they managed to make new highs in the next cycle uh whereas some of the altcoins they hit these these big highs then they collapse and then when the next bull market comes years later they're unable to get back to where they were because they never really kind of accrued that that moneyness or that value and so i think the big question going forward is how's ethereum going to handle a bear market because a very large portion of its use case is uh decentralized finance uh you know that the exchanges as well as the liquidity providers which all of which i think is extraordinarily valuable to have but then the big question is what are what is all that worth uh once we kind of get out of this you know this two-year bull market we've been in and when we have a another consolidation another kind of bear market you know i have concerns about what that would do to kind of a theorist price at that point yeah my my i we don't know these are always interesting things because we don't really know it's kind of like asking what happens to amazon's price during a recession and they sell less goods we kind of know what it does to the network itself but over time as things recover you know we know with the theorem that whatever's happening there's a lot of people developing stuff right so whatever we think we know about what it's worth now we don't know in the future because we don't know what other breakthroughs d5 is so nascent right i mean this is basically icos from the last boom and a ton of this will go bust and then some bigger ones will rise and we'll see you know i think you know i don't have an issue with that you're right we need to keep an open mind to it because we just don't know and to try and choose which ones i'm not smart enough um and so the only way is use the vc approach i think which is you take a big enough basket my 10 is not a big enough basket you should take a larger basket put a bunch of bets in it you can weight them accordingly to you and then wait and see how it plays out for a number of years and assume that vc should not be real-time mark-to-market it's the worst thing in the world because you know any business that starts up does this this is this best thing is just the bc bet i'll look at it in five years and figure out what's the next valuation so you know i you know lynn's question is dead ryan none of us know any of this we're just trying to figure it out because it is a very new space and maybe the whole space next time around it gets up to 100 trillion in size we don't we just don't know we just don't know and it's fascinating to be at this point in time seeing something so new in finance that gives us something to get our teeth into i mean lynn and i are probably bored of talking about the dollar now and probably boarded back talking about rates right here's something intellectually interesting that we that has not been around forever moves a bit more so it's a bit more exciting you can get up in the morning get excited because it didn't go up and down 0.3 there's no central banks really involved in it i mean it's nice we can be optimistic as macro people we can be optimistic about something yes and for journalists it's also more exciting than covering traditional financial markets okay so um one other thing that i want to oh so lynn when you were talking um you know it just seemed like i totally got how you were saying that the way ethereum is going now like you could see it going one way or the other like becoming a widely used business that where you know ether isn't exactly super valuable or you know also becoming used but also either does become valuable it's sort of like unclear um however uh obviously we do have the ethereum 2.0 transition that has begun it will take you know who knows at minimum 18 months i think so um it could even be as long as like three years however um within that there's also this ethereum improvement proposal one five five nine which would burn the base transaction fees and then given the um kind of like minimal amount of inflation you could end up with uh ethereum being deflationary and so do those um changes that are kind of in the works start to make you think that actually down the road if could become more investible yeah i think it's possible and actually that the most favorable thing i said about ethereum in that article is probably the eip1559 point because i think that's a really elegant way to kind of improve their monetary policy compared to what it has been and so for people that aren't familiar with it yeah they would you know transactions the base fee would be burned and so you'd have this kind of deflationary aspect to the protocol and then you'd have a somewhat adjustable inflationary policy uh to incentivize validators and it would be flexible depending on how many validators are present but the overall issuance would at maximum be pretty low and in some cases if there's a you know kind of a medium amount of validators and a ton of throughput then you could have a deflationary scenario and so i do think that if they get that into place uh and that they're able to do their transition that is i think a really elegant monetary policy for what ethereum's trying to do i think uh kind of my one of my concerns is that as the transitions from ethereum one to uh you know ethereum two we do have these other competitors probably some of the ones that are in in rao's side that portfolio probably you know i can i can probably pick that's what i was going to ask i could probably pick out i can probably guess two or three that are in there and uh so some of them are they they came after ethereum so they and you know some people would argue that they're technically superior but that the big problem is they don't have the network effect that ethereum has and so the question is can kind of ethereum kind of round this turn and maintain its network effect while it's running into some uh throughput issues and so one of the things we're seeing you know i think that one of the things that rao and i are both super bullish on is stable coin usage probably stable coins are are going to keep proliferating in you know the amount of that they're used but if you look at uh you know the history of tether for example that used to be you know based around bitcoin and omni and then when ethereum came out that you know tether became more associated with ethereum and as you know we've seen ethereum fees rise over the past six months now actually more transactions for tether take place on tron than on ethereum and there's still more value settled on the ethereum side but because the fees are high a lot of the small transactions have had to spill over onto a cheaper protocol in order to justify because bitcoin since the average transaction size is pretty high they can handle higher fees whereas ethereum when you start to run these high fees a lot of these smaller transactions have to have to go off to a spillway and so my concern is that even though i'm i'm bullish on kind of the use cases for a lot of these utility protocols including some of the ones that can run on bitcoin for example but you know i'm bullish on utility protocols in general in terms of you know kind of the developments they'll have and then i think figuring out where that value is going to accrue is tough because there's not a ton of switching costs from moving stable coins from one chain to another and that can also apply to some of these other protocols if say ethereum were to stumble in its implementation and and one of these other you know smart contract platforms kind of uh you know picks up the slack and so i i just think it's it's a it's a kind of a point of uncertainty and people would have to watch that space very closely in order to make sure that their their chosen protocol is kind of staying ahead of whatever issues it's facing also i think the i think one of the things we're talking about here again i wrote in that long article that i wrote in global macro investor about this is s curves are very prevalent in this and the s curve is it's either the questioning point or the failure point and you know what what we're saying here is there's a big s curve in in ethereum right now coming up and will it work or will it not work we don't know almost all of the currencies have had this bitcoins had several s curve moments where it could have failed and it didn't then the lindy effect takes place which is the longer it survives the more likely it's to survive so again it's why we're all really interested in this space because there are outcomes of which we don't know we can't figure out the probabilities we've got no historical parallels so it's it's a really interesting space for all of us to try and figure this out because you know what s curve is just to pause before the rise and maybe that's what i think ethereum is going through again i don't know we'll find out and you know and that moves that drives us further up metcalfe's law and the lindy effect some of these s curves will see total failures um so as they have existential crisis so it's it's amazingly interesting yeah well it sounds like you know both of you kind of agree however um uh lin's just sort of decided oh you know because of these different factors i would rather just go with what i you know believe will take off where is like raw you've kind of like you know decided to put a little bit of money in but you're also hedged so that if the competitors do kind of pull through and um start to take market share from ethereum then you know you'll still benefit um but i actually wanted to ask lynn one more thing because um in your paper on this you cited this irony within the incentives where you said potentially eth the eath price would dip when demand was high and what you wrote was quote if transaction throughput is super high and fees are pretty low users don't need much ethereum tokens to run dapps and there's this interesting trade-off high fees make daps less attractive and provide room for competitors to take market share while low fees potentially decrease the demand for ethereum tokens so can you talk a little bit more about that and you know what you think will actually happen yeah so on one hand high fees are a sign of a healthy vibrant network it could means a lot of people are using ethereum uh and so and that's you know in the short run a good thing and then you need ethereum to run all this and so you have to you know you have to buy and use ethereum and so there's that there's that demand for ethereum as like fuel in addition to this the size thing of ethereum as as a store of valuers money that some people use it as uh and so uh but then in the shorter run in the longer run i mean that starts causing problems like the one i mentioned where some of those stable coins start spilling off onto other protocols because if you're trying to send a hundred bucks you you can't pay a ten dollar fee that that'd be uneconomic and so uh you have to kind of sort out those smaller transactions and then for example if you're trying to do a trade on unit swap you're paying like you know 50 bucks or you know because that's a more intensive calculation and so it's higher fees than it's multiple fees basically and so that becomes uneconomic compared to say those centralized exchanges or towards a centralized decentralized exchange is trying to run on a different protocol and so you kind of run into that problem now one of the whole points of ethereum 2.0 is that they'll massively increase the throughput of the system so you can have much lower fees to run all these applications but then it also means you don't need a ton of ethereum tokens to do all this and so uh the question of ethereum kind of retaining its value uh goes back to my earlier point of you know kind of the conception of it is money is somewhat of a different thing than than the velocity and the size of its whole ecosystem so you can you can theoretically have a case where you know a ton of value settles in ethereum like it's something like a trillion dollars last year it could go up 5x and it's possible that the market cap would you know double or maybe stay flat and kind of you know this big choppy thing it might not go up in the same kind of ratio that it has been which is actually what happened over the past three years as well because the the use case tripled and the market cap had this big kind of u-turn uh and so i i think that's kind of the key thing to watch is is that that kind of awkward trade-off between fees as something that's a sign of the health of the network but then also something that can pressure it and then start spilling over onto the competitors the other question is within all of this is and again i don't know um is does the number of transactions mean anything in network effects or is it the number of nodes so in which case it doesn't you can put gazillions of transactions um and that doesn't change it if there's only three people using it you have a billion people using it that is the value of the network so maybe there's different things here we're thinking of we're thinking of it either as a utility or a network and we don't know it's exhibiting the qualities of a network but at core maybe it's a if bitcoin is they isn't here's an idea if bitcoin's a reserve asset with this adoption curve that comes with it of technology why could ethanol be a utility with an adoption curve that that has a potentially higher future expected value so they both have different attributes a utility versus a reserve asset and they both have these huge upsides because of the network effect maybe there's that maybe maybe we're just even still framing it in wrong terms i don't know i hadn't talked about that before but maybe you're right and i'm right is the kind of what i'm trying to say yeah yeah i think it's i think it's certainly possible i i guess just at one point if one one thing i'd like to see over time is um the number of stakeholders in ethereum because if we're monitoring different uh kind of aspects that we can we can monitor uh that's one of the ones that shows people's willingness to hold it for the long term and so far uh you know since they've launched that that's been pretty robust it says a lot of people have confidence to kind of stake eth and then you know let it play out over 18 months which might end up being optimistic however long that kind of conversion process takes uh because that should that that's purely kind of ethereum as a money rather than ethereum as some of these other attributes and so i think that over time that that's one of the metrics i would want to keep uh track of in terms of kind of monitoring its adoption as something that can the for the token price itself it's kind of also a little bit like spax you know you've got this 18 month or whatever time period of which they could put this back together and you need to have faith that they're going to do something that's it's it that's really interesting because they did create that money market curve for a period of time which what am i going to get compensated by giving you my eth and as you said i mean i found that surprising that a volatile asset people will lock up for 18 months you're like wow okay that really is interesting yeah yeah but they can still um you know they can borrow against it and stuff like that so there's all kinds of solutions for that all right so in a moment we're going to uh just do two more questions about ethereum but then we are going to switch to gamestop because that's what everybody's talking about these days and it's super

really amazing piece by the way people should read this because it's like just extremely comprehensive analysis about ethereum it's really really interesting um but one of the things was you know i know that you're a you know big supporter of uh bitcoin and when you wrote about ethereum you said that the purpose of decentralized apps is largely to circumvent know your customer roles which you know those are meant to combat money laundering and counterterrorism but bitcoin is basically also a network that enables to avoid people to avoid kyc and then i wondered so you know since bitcoin does also share those features does that uh you know is that something that gives you pause about investing in bitcoin or or do you not see it that the way that i just framed it in my view it would come down to kind of percentage use case uh and so that that's all you know in bitcoin that's always kind of been a trade-off between people there's kind of the earlier adopters that are that are more uh you know kind of the cypher funk punk culture and then there's you know the more traditional finance people that want to see it as a more regulated asset so they can get more institutional capital into it uh and i think you know bitcoin is going to kind of continue to exist in both worlds where some people want to use it off the grid and other people are fine with using it on the grid because i think you know apart from the koic question a really big use case for it uh is uh you store value and then we're also seeing cool things like for example strike global being able to use it not just as an asset but also as a payment network to use lightning as a way to kind of send fiat to fiat uh international transactions you know settled you know within seconds for free uh and so you know i think that's that that's kind of it's got enough use cases outside of the the kyc question that i think it can it can you know kind of get through all those regulatory questions the big concern i had for you know ethereum is that we have a lot of this interest in decentralized exchanges decentralized liquidity providers which i think is a good thing i'm happy that they exist and i think they're going to continue to exist in some form and definitely i think you know we kind of opened that that genie now uh and so but i think the the the question is um you know in the long run what is the kind of willingness of people to pay high fees for a uni swap transaction for example uh compared to some of those decentralized exchanges so of course we have this big kind of growth area uh we have it's kind of you know once you have your your tokens you can kind of you're operating off the grid a little bit uh and and people can you know there's there's tax questions associated with that so you know the question is how many of those people that kind of trade on some of the decentralized errors are properly accounting for the taxes every time they do one of these swaps and transactions and i think that if you were to see a regulatory crackdown on that my concern is how much of that volume would would dissipate uh whereas bitcoin i think is a little bit more kind of cockroach like it's a little bit more resilient to crackdowns and i think its use case is a little bit you know there's basically more use cases other than kind of circumventing uh you know kind of these kyc issues although if we go back seven years five years in bitcoin so i the same time in the cycle if it's birth then bitcoin is now you know bitmex on kyc derivatives we have the rise of tether completely unregulated we have the rise of i mean that whole space was the same right it's only because as its market cap has got bigger the regulators become more and more interested and you're dead right this is this whole new space that we've got in in the ethereum world and all the others it's the regulator's just behind they barely catch up with bitcoin let learn all of this stuff i mean how the hell they're going to regulate this i have no idea my guess is all they can regulate is your on-ramps and off-ramps to fear and then they can say well hey you put in 10 grand and you've brought back 20. so i don't care what you did with it prove that it went to an exchange or whatever and then you owe us tax on that i mean they'll have to figure out a different way of taxing because they can't tax transactions that happen nowhere and everywhere and whatever so again really really interesting to see how this develops but it feels like that whole space is as early as bitcoin was five years ago and everyone was scratching their heads then you know it just now the regulator is still catching up with the securities offerings and the icos and you know trying to get whatever happens to ripple and xrp you know there'll be an outcome that will have clarified a bunch of legal points and then we can all move forwards again yeah no i um sometimes when i think about these defy hacks where it's like you know they borrow money they do like a flash loan and then they short the thing and then they manipulate the um the automated market maker curve to manipulate the price and like all those things together i'm a little bit like okay when you can do that in one etherium block that's like 12 to 15 seconds and you know normally in the real world that would take you know i don't even know how many days or weeks whatever i mean it's just like okay this technology is definitely going to take off much faster than the regulators can wait you know tokenization really takes hold you know we barely started with tokenization we're not fiddling around with ideas but when tokenization there's going to be literally millions of these things with all with complicated attributes some with smart contracts everything is going to be different it's offering a whole new trading world of which basically it's almost impossible for humans to deal with the complexities of some of what these are i mean wait till insurance market with insurance tokens on policies comes in and allowed freely tradeable for all of us i mean i don't know how to do that we're just not prepared for any of this stuff but it's all coming yeah well i'm excited for it um okay so before we transition to gamestop i'm just curious so ral which of lynn's points was most persuasive to you or like kind of made you pause a little bit about your youth investment and then same question for lynn well look i think i think lynn raises really important questions and the question is is is is the transaction volume on the network gonna drive network effects or not i don't think it it's the issue but it's something again we need to see that dichotomy and see how that plays out i think there is an s curve moment we don't know how some of this plays out and she's right to be more heavily weighted well all weighted but saying listen i can understand why people have an ethereum view i think that's totally right too um you know i think what happens to these applications um with the cost usage and all of this again something to monitor i mean the the great thing is is none of us know we've never none of us have seen this before so we have no precedent which is again i keep saying it's one of the most rewarding things about this space is we get to think blue sky and not oh well back in 1947 they did this and it's like this is very different and that makes it very interesting and so there is no truth the only thing you can do is take on board what everybody's saying and just observe and draw your own conclusions and assess your own probabilities as you go yeah and lynn so i think rao's totally right about keeping an eye on it and and basically watching the network effects unfold and then see what kind of roadblocks come up and so you know uh for example in that article uh you know since then this past weekend i you know i provided an ethereum update in one of my premium reports uh just because you know it basically the point was it was kind of right under his previous all-time high it looked a lot like bitcoin did back in like november where it was kind of flirting under you know like in the low 1900s and i basically said if this breaks out you know it's it's it's it's probably [ __ ] 2021 and then the question is i i'm less conviction about the long term because you know that goes back to all the other kind of concerns i had and so i do think that ethereum is large enough to warrant observation uh not only as it pertains to a couple different things one is you know how it's going to affect the bitcoin investment is it going to eat some of bitcoin's lunch are they both going to grow do you have to monitor it for that reason and then two you want to see okay how that's going to impact say uh you know centralized exchanges around the world uh how is that going to impact the banking industry how is that going to impact the insurance industry and so i do think that that defy in general is something you have to watch whether or not you're invested in the tokens it's some it's clearly here it's clearly growing and i think it's important to watch kind of all the ramifications because like rao said we really don't know in some ways what the future looks like five years from now and so i'm monitoring the bitcoin network i'm monitoring what's happening on lightning and i'm also watching some of the things happening on ethereum as well all right and actually so the one last question just about this before we move to gamestop ralph you did tweet that you thought eth might well when i'm quoting here might well go to twenty thousand dollars this cycle are you still standing by that it's all i did no magic i took the chart from a million wallets and a million wallets in bitcoin and where did it go it went to 20 000. so i'm like okay there's a good enough guess does it hit that does it not hit that irrelevant what it means what i'm really trying to say and something like that is it's much larger than you think and we've got some idea of an event that played out in the past and looks very like this and you know people like me love a bit of a historical chart pattern even though i said this whole new space exciting but when you've got something that's so highly correlated it's okay this is interesting that sounds a sensible target um and i know it sounds nonsensical to many but because nobody can think in exponential terms we're just incapable as humans to think i just spoke to as i said i spoke to mark cusco earlier he said and he had a great and again i don't know if his math is dead right but just take it as roughly he said i can walk 20 paces and go across my office linear paces if i take 20 exponential paces i go around the world three times that's why we cannot think in exponential terms it's hilarious humans just can't do it because we don't think that yeah that they like that that's a great quote and so whether mark's maths is right or not i don't know maybe i'll try to find somebody to fact-check that yeah exactly i'm sure we can find something that's like that's like a jeff boost thing where he always points out that if you fold a paper 50 times you know if you ask people how big you think it is and people say i don't know like three feet and you're like no it's to the sun like it's and after like fold 37 like you're already to the moon like it's the math gets silly once you get out far enough yeah wow okay so lynn what would be your price prediction for if i end of year i don't have a strong opinion on that but um you know i think that because the concern is if you if you were watching in 2017 you gave a price prediction on any of them in early 2017 they probably would have all undershot what happened in 2017. and so uh but i do i think rao's approach we're just kind of looking at at historical half uh you know price and seeing what happens i think it makes sense and it's part of the reason why i got so bullish on on bitcoin about a year ago is because i said look every time there's a having uh this happens and so i'd rather take the bet as as a you know a certain allocation because even though i don't have a specific price target it's almost like you're embarrassed to say what you think the actual price target is you're like you know if it's if it's sitting in there like seven thousand you wanna be like i think i might go to a hundred thousand you know but like it was like so even then when i kind of made my bitcoin argument i didn't give a price target other than i thought it's it's well north of here and i kind of gave like a really big range of outcomes like starts at like 30 000 and it goes up from there and so i kind of view ethereum the same way where if if this is a good year for bitcoin i would expect ethereum to to also have a very good year and you know in all likelihood probably outperform during the bull market of that phase i wouldn't be surprised and so i i don't really know where the the end of the year looks like i just think it's it's probably north of here by you know probably a notable amount if i were to guess okay yeah again i've used exactly this the same way we look again none of us know exponential assets are really hard not any of us not a single person on earth would have guessed how big amazon got or its share price none of us would so we're going to undershoot some years and we're going to wildly overshoot other years trying to figure this stuff out and again who knows all right let's talk gamestop i just want to hear kind of what your main thoughts are around everything that happened and either of you can go first i'm actually more on the fence about it than than many it got all the tribes up with the hackles out i love the democratization of financial information trading i love the fact that people are now not going you know we started real vision for this exact purpose the democratization of information you don't give it to a wealth advisor who you barely meet once a year he takes all your life savings and at the end of it you get outcome it's it's madness so people are now taking an active involvement it took a while for the millennials to do that because they had a lot of debts but now they're in it whether it's stimulus checks or it doesn't matter it's great it's great to see and people like it's you know david against goliath well they're actually just doing what everybody else in financial markets does i mean hedge funds will look for every single short position if they think somebody's really crowded short bunch and will get together and try and squeeze the other one out that's financial markets that's how it works that's how you try and extract the values um so you know i think a lot of that was normal i think robin hood went about everything in a unfortunately ugly manner firstly most people didn't realize and you know any of us have been in markets for a while knew that if the product's free you'll you're the product and that'll be the same with the new strike network as well you know don't forget there's a bunch of fx transactions in the middle of that somebody gets paid so in this you've got that whole robin hood them the millennials not realizing it because many of them still don't really realize with facebook that they were the or or instagram that they were the product um so there's that learning but and robin hood also didn't have enough capital that was the actually the issue for them actual margin trades that went through so when volatility went so extreme because of so much retail option activity everybody got tapped on the shoulder but people like interactive brokers had plenty of capital they're 10 billion of capital but robin hood didn't and that in is where lies the problem because they created their own settlement system internally to net off trades and that's what created the problems so outside of the philosophical battle of david and goliath and the democratization and people against the hedge funds and other hedge funds crooks all of this stuff it's actually a story of broken financial plumbing so what you're saying is that if robin hood had outsourced that function then most likely that third party would have been able to put up enough margin collateral my guess and i don't know is the reason they have their own netting off internal clearing is it lowers margin so which is why prime brokers use hedge um hedge funds use prime brokers for a similar reason because you net off so they net netted off so they didn't have to post as much margins and have more free capital in their business um so what happens in times of stress they didn't realize that this is what happens but the actual issue is here you know within the story is the story that short position potentially was larger than the entire market cap whether that was actually the case or not i'm not sure but it's the story of plumbing what actually went wrong is the plumbing blew up well so and so lynn i do want to hear your thoughts but i actually just want to ask ralph because um i was trying to figure out you know when i was looking at all that you know obviously i also spend my time looking at defy where a lot of things are over collateralized and then when people don't you know that they can get liquidated when they're when the value of their collateral falls belief below you know what they've or the ratio of what they've borrowed so you know i was just trying to figure out well would any kind of smart contract like that solve this issue or not solve but prevent it where you know instead of just a blanket nobody can buy anymore then like individuals maybe that don't have enough collateral will you know not be able to do something but firstly to have stopped the leverage on the hedge fund side which was extreme and on the option trading side by individuals again a lot of this could have gone on blockchain technology so at the core of the custody system which is the dtcc is where some of this problem had evolved and who owns what in a situation where there are more short sellers than there is market cap if that was the case none of that should have happened it's because there's no recorded ownership at a trusted level we saw that with gold foods we've seen this numerous occasions with lehman brothers in the 32 times real qualification of certain assets so all of this is the big mess that that when i first saw bitcoin i realized that actually the blockchain is an answer to so much of this to verify transactions and all of that in terms of smart contracts without question can you build in auto margin liquidation right now what happens is you get margin called you get an email and then a phone call and then you have to make post margin and then they might liquidate your trade right this is nonsense and i lost money in mf global which is one of the blow ups and this kind of thing and i tried to pull my money out i couldn't none of this should really happen most of this should be just an algorithm yeah um one other thing that i was going to say oh um so caitlyn long also always i mean long before the robin hood thing has talked about the ability for companies to or for investors to buy more shorts than there are even existing shares and so i saw also senator cynthia lummus the new bitcoin supporter in congress also tweeted about it and now she's on the banking committee so who knows what we'll see with that um but yeah in this case the hedge funds had shorted 136 of gamestop which you know obviously if they were to try to cover the shorts they wouldn't even be able to buy enough shares so and the problem is again i spent a long time on this because i almost went after 2012 when europe was one time but almost tried to set up the world's safest bank with a group of investors and then i discovered bitcoin and realized there was probably a better solution i had the dtcc euro clear the new york fed and i'd spoken to the ecb about settlement right custody what almost happened in europe and what almost happened why why aig was not able to go bust but lehman was was because one was a triple-a collateral and there were 32 times rehypothecated by the system oh no there was 32 claims on that one bond now when lehman went under the ecb injected 50 billion dollars quickly into euroclear which is a custody entity and what euroclear did was pledge collateral to the ecb for the loan normal i found this book and there is the collateral the customer positions because there is no segregation of customers at central euro clear level so then i went to the dtcc and there's a whole bunch of us were there with the new york fed and we said hey listen guys is there segregation they said of course everybody segregated i said okay let's say one of the counterparts let's see jp morgan goes bust or a collateral let's say uk guilds go bust and somebody's pledged them as collateral what happens well if there's if nobody can figure this out we'll inject we'll lend money to the dccc we can't let them go bust so great what are you going to take and they said collateral i said what's the collateral they said whatever they give us i said this is customer positions and it's non-segregated at this point they went yes so what it means is at the very core nobody's protected from anything and the system overuses assets and we can overuse assets fine as long as we have a chain of who owns what at what point but in this situation you have no idea because then there's a derivative layer on top and this is why this whole problem is much larger than this robin hood story it's actually the problem of a system that's not able to cope with the amount of leverage that's within it and claims on it right like simply just the it's like a lack of visibility so in that sense the fact that blockchains can make the data transparent is actually literally pretty much the major advantage is that it trusted ownership it's the basic essence of the blockchain is a verified trusted owner ownership structure that's what it gives and we don't have that in the securities market at all you don't have it as a brokerage customer you don't have it as a brokerage house you don't have it as a custom clearing nct you don't have as a custody entity you don't have as a bank nobody has trusted ownership of anything which is why people store gold in a gold vote and you have to make sure that the paperwork says that they cannot reuse it because you can put it in a gold vote and they can still reuse it it's extraordinary well bitcoin i own my bitcoin it's in my name all right and so lynn um yeah why don't you just give us any other thoughts that you want to add about gamestop i know there's so much to unpack here yeah i think overall i mean it was a giant advertisement for blockchain for you know self-custody uh it could have been a better one for that in many ways because you know uh people had all these kind of issues about the counterparties they're working with whether it's robin hood or you know their lenders and then you know like people just not you know rehypothecation of all these things like more shares short than the market cap and that goes back to you know like raw said having gold in a vault or having bitcoin in your in your cold storage wallet and so that's a very different environment than all this kind of counterparty trust that happens and it also it opened up questions i think to the broader market of what exactly is market manipulation because you know again as rao said you've had this going on for a long time with hedge funds attacking each other all the time and even in this case there were hedge funds already kind of outlined in some media outlets that did profit a ton from it so you know at the end of the day it's still the hedge fund that it ended up kind of making a ton of money from this uh and whereas you know in an environment for example where some firms can pay millions of dollars in exchange to literally put their their server inside the exchange data center and basically have a faster advantage than anyone else what what is the what exactly is market manipulation what is kind of the limit what's what's quote unquote fair in the market and so that that you know it kind of tied into the populism of the day and it it kind of just ended up being kind of this focal point that opens up just kind of a lot of issues that i think have been building up for a long time and it shows why some of these technologies are being built and and what some of the genesis was for all of this like what made satoshi nakamoto you know all those years ago back in in 2008 or maybe before then when he was when he was working on it what what made him or them or they uh start putting this all together and it's exactly these sorts of issues and the same types of things that happened you know back in the in the subprime mortgage crisis the global financial crisis and then again all the same stuff that happened here uh over these past several weeks all right and um one last thing uh which i just when i was thinking about and it goes back to the philosophical point that you were making lin you know it's that question of well how do you define market manipulation because i don't know if you listened to chimoff paula hapatia's interview on cnbc but he was like hey what they did in a you know a subreddit is no different from what hedge funders do when they go to a dinner in the hamptons he was like all that was different was that it was like public and so in that sense it's you know even less insidery and um you know then i saw other people just saying well because so i mean i think you know what it is is that a lot of people you know do feel like okay well clearly what happened with the price was divorce from the fundamentals of gamestop at a certain point you know you could argue about like in the beginning whether or not um the the low price uh you know that that the wall street bets crowd was kind of railing against whether that was also like artificial but but you know at a certain point obviously once it started going to like 70 80 90 you know 450 whatever um then it just it became like something that really didn't have anything left to do with gamestop so um you know i was just curious how do you think a regulator like the sec should handle this there's another there's another precedent here is we talk about market manipulation many of us have all referred to this one by a different incident that happened in the past which is the volkswagen squeeze so i don't know if you remember this no what happens is porsche launched a takeover of volkswagen which was a much bigger company and they bought a bunch of call options and then bid for the stock and they ramped the stock to the moon because they created all the hedge funds had a different position on which was there's these two types of um volkswagen shares so they basically forced it was a gigantic position the hedge funds had on it was a really safe one of the safest long-term kind of arbitrage positions they forced every hedge fund to lose all their stock borrow they all got false outstanding and porsche owned the call options and suddenly at one point were making a ton of money and then eventually by forcing vw and eventually the whole thing collapsed and vw ended up reversing into porsche it was this huge drama but it was the biggest manipulation of all time it played out publicly in germany of all places and everybody kind of got away with it a bunch of hedge funds went under it was in the middle of 2008 bond deals collapsed because there was a run on collateral because of the mess that it caused in pride brokerages so this stuff as lin said goes on and on and on and what was happening before is insider trading was slightly different but that still happens in certain respects but this ganging up with a group of like-minded people because you think something has a different value that's a market trying to push it to extremes that's probably foolishness because in the end value value always ascertains itself in the end or asserts itself in the end so you know that's why we've seen the mean reversion of value so who knows it's not an easy question um but the the playing field was leveled because people now have information look at the information we all get from twitter it's unbelievable the number of people we've all met i mean i met lynn on twitter you know we all meet there and we exchange information right that's democratization before i'd have to go and find an investment bank and if i wasn't a customer i couldn't speak to that guy or girl it's ridiculous so the world's change is good all right any last thoughts before we say goodbye on this whole gamestop thing and how it relates to crypto because i think for me what was so fun watching it was i was like i recognize this behavior this is like the crypto market any last thoughts i think it's the same crowd it's the same people they're discovering price discovery opportunity um you know things that nobody understands i mean nobody understands any of the d5 projects that they're trading the tokens of or any of this stuff um but that's okay people will lose money people buy money but what you're actually doing is giving people the testing tools to test out how to invest and how to figure this stuff out and you know bitcoin had its s curves people will have their s curves in their learning cycle of uh of investing but i think what it's actually done has empowered people overall yeah i think it's one of those important narrative moments where it kind of goes down as a moment in history where people kind of realize a lot of things were wrong with the system you know we had that like you point out with the volkswagen incident back a while ago volkswagen briefly became the most valuable company in the world technically for that brief moment it was worth over like 400 billion dollars if you look at the market cap and so i i think this this kind of this this sort of same uh event here it kind of shows some of the the plumbing issues of the system and showed why so many people are kind of working so hard on building other systems other platforms uh to fix a lot of these issues yeah i think for me the other last question that i'm left with wondering is what is going to happen to robin hood you know he's going to be a vlad 10 of the sea is going to be in the hot seat in front of congress and um clearly you know i think people are are going to be uh you know putting a magnifying glass to what happened on the day that they stopped the purchases so the question is is did he actually do wrong or was he given by the exchange the problem to solve which is their platform had created more speculation in options on four or five securities than anybody else in the world had ever done before essentially and the way they margin it and net it and all of this stuff is you can't pay your bills because the volatility in these names are too high you either reduce the trading in these names or you have to come up with a cash immediately i i get it he didn't go oh i don't wanna i want to stop these guys manipulating hedge fund none of that happened i don't think i don't think citadel tapped anybody in this city all the big boys they've been through everything from the long-term capital crisis to the financial crisis to the european crop so they'll know exactly what they're doing ken griffin that team is one of the smartest on earth so melvin okay they got it wrong they shouldn't have had an open-ended risk in that size and they are part of the equation um stevie cohen as stevie said he's like i do have the right to invest in somebody i believe in he got caught out wrongly and i want to make sure they have enough capital that's his choice he's a trader too he can make those choices um so i'm not sure every there's a lot of accusations of long wrongdoing from everybody and i just think everybody was a victim of circumstance and the circumstance is what lin said to the system itself yeah i think that one thing for me is and lynn and i were talking about this before we started recording i do feel like robin hood probably could have messaged better because the night before is when they would have known oh probably tomorrow we're going to have to shut off the purchases but the blog post didn't go out until the very like right when the trading started and so then you know how you had that massive plunge in price and so i feel like that was just something they you know they could have kind of gotten ahead of that a little bit and like given people some kind of warning but since there wasn't then i think a lot of people got hurt so they probably should have been fine for risk control or lack of collateral or something else because there was a mismanagement there because really they were at risk of going under because of liquidity you know used to say when he was interviewed i don't know if you notice that you like would never say the liquidity word because everybody will bet against you and pull their money out right the only thing you cannot say but we know because they raised one and a half billion dollars in seconds because they had to pay their bills and then another 2.4 billion in the next week because they didn't have enough collateral overall so that they said oh yeah it's going to be for growth guess what it's going into your collateral account you won't have run such small collateral again and and believe in var models right okay okay well we will see he's going up you know like i said to testify in front of front of congress so we'll have to watch that all right well this has been so fun thank you both so much where can people learn more about each of you and your work uh easiest thing is find me on twitter at
