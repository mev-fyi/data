it just seems so angry right I guess that's the one word that I feel like not Bitcoin itself with the Bitcoin sort of community of the Bitcoin Maxi Community it's just they always have something to be angry about and it seems like this is the this is the thing du jour to be angry about yeah I think there's I forget who the quote was from but one of these articles talking about I would a Bitcoin contributor being incensed that people would like use the blockchain for anything then then you know transferring Bitcoin but you know it's like if anything Bitcoin is in such dire need of more transaction fees and more volume obviously to offset the reduction in emissions I think unfortunately this is not really picked up yet but if anything they should be applauding this right like you should want people to use your blockchain and be willing to pay for it to like you know maintain its security and yet like that hasn't really happened yet
