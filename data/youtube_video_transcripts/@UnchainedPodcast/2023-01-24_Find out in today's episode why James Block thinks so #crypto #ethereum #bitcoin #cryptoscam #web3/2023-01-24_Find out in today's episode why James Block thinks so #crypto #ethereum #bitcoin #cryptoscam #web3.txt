interesting part for me is that this is probably the first time in history where you can track fraud in real time publicly right like I can see every transaction they make at least on on chain obviously there's a lot happening outside of that but you can still learn a lot and that's never that's never happened in history as far as I know so there are cool aspects to it but like again what's the activity on the ethereum blockchain doing it's transacting in Ponzi schemes and frauds so like it's basically so like you have software as a service which is a major like category of business to me ethereum and other blockchains like it are scam as a service that's what they're offering but really I mean like let's be fair I mean look at all the tokens listed on ethereum how many of them even even to someone who believes and say something like Bitcoin how many of them have intrinsic value even to that degree they don't and that's what that's what it's used for that's what most of the volume on this that on that blockchain is for so what is it then if you enjoyed this clip watch the full episode now on Unchained
