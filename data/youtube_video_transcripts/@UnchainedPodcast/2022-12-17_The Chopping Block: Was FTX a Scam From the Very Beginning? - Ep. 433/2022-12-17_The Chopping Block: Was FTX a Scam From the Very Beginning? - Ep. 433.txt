not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem all right hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first up we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound next we have to ruin the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet joining us today we've got Laura the CEO of the show and you've got myself a sib I'm the head hype man at dragonfly the four of us well uh Laura we're early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice okay so the FTX story is the gift that keeps giving unfortunately we cannot stop talking about it we really wanted to we were so looking forward to this story just slowing down and people were speculating that it was going to be months until Sam was charged it's very common investigations of this kind of of this sweepingness that they take a long time before any charges are filed because everybody's got to get their case in order before they actually uh file charges this has been incredibly fast so basically yesterday it was finally announced that Sam was arrested in the Bahamas and we had well actually I believe it was Monday night that he was arrested and then uh file uh charges were unsealed first by the southern district attorney of New York uh for wire fraud and a bunch of other stuff campaign financing laws and a bunch of other stuff that they um charge them with as well as complaints uh civil suits from the cftc and the SEC and so uh the the southern district attorney of New York didn't give a whole lot of details um that was pretty sparse but the the cftc complaint and the SEC complaint have an enormous amount of detail that I I want to just quickly kind of skim through for people who didn't actually themselves read the um the the releases so the first thing and I'm kind of cobbling together from both the SEC complaint and the cftc complaint which both go through a full story line of what happened with FTX and Alameda um so first is the claim that fgx was knowingly co-mingling funds with Alameda from the very beginning uh in May 2019 when it was originally founded uh and from the very beginning Alameda had an effectively unlimited credit line from FTX and at one point they in the programming they explicitly set a flag in the code Base called allow negative which basically allowed elevator to go negative uh and prevented them from being margin called in the liquidation engine whatsoever Alameda also had preferred API access to FTX they didn't have to wait in the usual order queue with everybody else and because their account didn't enforce certain checks in the liquidation engine uh they had lower latency compared to any other Trader and so there was a special fast lane for Alameda to trade relative to anybody else um so apparently when Alameda had an eight billion hole in the summer after Luna exploded their liabilities were moved from Alameda which you know at the time you know customer service within FTX could see uh this is the Alameda account after that summer the liabilities were moved into a separate account which they called their Korean friend and presumably this was to obfuscate even from customer service at FTX that this was an underwater account that belonged to Alameda research Sam claimed in many of his public statements that users were wiring money directly to Alameda because FPS didn't have a bank account but FDX opened the bank account in 2020 but users kept wiring money to elementa and those funds were never moved over into FTX uh one of the most fascinating things actually was that there there was a blog post uh that Sam wrote this was this was uh detailed in the cftc complaint if you want to read it it's actually really interesting so he wrote a blog post and kind of prepped a uh a tweet storm about winding down Alameda in September of 2022. um and this is clearly after elevator was already very deeply in the hole and they had a they had a a blog post title which was we came we saw we researched announcing that elementa was shutting down and unwinding and that you know it just didn't make sense after you know animated lost so much money uh for them to keep elementa going now it seems to it seems to imply at least even this fact that they were thinking about winding down Alameda seems to imply this idea that they thought that this was even possible to unwind Alameda without you know basically destroying FTX given the fact that Alameda held customer funds that of course there was no way realistically to recoup them but perhaps at that time he thought that there could be a way to liquidate the books of Alameda you know all the serum all the ftt all the locks tokens that they had at something uh resembling par so we got we got a lot of details here and I'll talk a little bit more about his arrest in a little bit but just going through the the cftc complaint the SEC complaint and the what you saw from the from the southern district attorney of New York um curious if you guys have thoughts Reflections on everything that we learned just from what what came out over the last uh 48 hours I I mean the interesting thing right is like almost everyone who's been in crypto since 2019 has always kind of heard the like rumor of like I mean almost what at some point it wasn't even really rumor like there was some like timing data you could see of like certain trades where I was like clear if someone else was getting liquidation preference but there was always the rumors of like hey Almeida always had this like extras low latency thing I think the question of them having this unbounded account was never that was actually something no one ever said everyone was like oh well you know if they're allowing cross margining they have to be extremely aggressive on liquidations including to themselves uh because they were the first exchange to offer cross margining which is like I can put up bat and ZRX and soul and like use that as my margin asset instead of putting up stable coins or BTC right so like bitmax only let you do BTC Finance at that time I I don't remember I think they do do cross monitoring now but I don't think they did then um and so that was their shtick of like they were the first ones like whatever they supposedly had better risk management they would always brag about it that's why I like listening to the sob story tour of Sam of the last couple weeks like oh like I was just bad at risk management like well you were telling everyone in the world publicly the exact opposite for years you think people are gonna suddenly like just be like poof that didn't happen no no way I think like it's interesting that like crypto people who are Traders like knew half of the story but like never could figure out the other half which I think that was kind of the impressive part of it right it's like everyone like I mean if I ask both you Robert and Steve you guys have both heard that right like the Alameda yeah people yeah people always speculated that elementa had something special people have some pretty good data of like latencies of timing like when they of like transactions they sent and stuff like there was like quite good evidence of it like it was clear they weren't even really hiding it that much no one thought they had unbounded accounts though that that's yeah and to be clear I doubt that even really came into play for a long time right like I mean Alameda especially last year had the ability to borrow whatever money they were borrowing you know de facto and FTX and so I think there was no way to really even see what the consequences would be until Alameda blew out as they did you know when FTX ultimately imploded well I think the idea of an unbounded account that can have negative value and negative value in the billions of dollars was is so outrageous that nobody would even create a rumor of that whereas everybody in like their guts sort of would always suspect that like Alameda might get their orders to The Exchange a little bit faster because that's like an advantage you would expect to exist on an exchange that you know doesn't have a wall separating the entities of that are owned by the same owner but like nobody would have expected or guessed something so outrageous as oh this one account has been given extremely beneficial unique permissions such that you can violate the laws of financial physics whenever it feels like well well it's also crazy that most of the company saw like Newton's equations of financial physics like looking normal there was no negative accounts like everything was fine and then there was this like Multiverse that you hopped into that was like I guess the Gary and Sam show that had you know like the the crazy huge negative balances the crazy thing to me though there's no way Sam did this alone based on all of the allegations and the real question to me is like who else and when will they kind of like will it be on Earth that like they conspired because like I I think even this like political conspiracy thing this seems a little too big for just like the eight people well so there was I think a reuter story yeah there was a road story that broke that that uh Reuters got the code base or FDX and they found the code commit I think that Gary I think Gary uh but but I just can't believe it's just two people who did it and also rewrote all of the front-end uh interfaces to like hide this from everything like it does seem like there's certainly other people who have to have yeah yeah yeah for sure for sure at least in that meeting from like right after everything collapsed Caroline um or at least the reporting from that meeting said that she what she said the meeting was that only four people knew and it was Sam Gary nashot and herself do you find that credible or do you think it has to be more Beyond those four I mean yeah I I agree that it's possible I think it depends on like you know all the things you had to know at the same time to have a clear picture right so in in the way the code base was written it didn't say you know Alameda specifically is not allowed to get liquidated it's the pmm which is the primary Market maker right it's like the primary Market maker could change except except the new account that was just discussed through the leak of the code base which was our Korean friends account like they made up an account for a mysterious Korean whale so given the same special privileges as Alameda to hide billions of dollars of losses of alamitas but instead of tagging it the pmm or tagging it Alameda they just called it like oh it's a Korean whale yeah it's like don't there's a no liquid a flag on the Korean engineering wise it's just really hard for me to imagine all of the systems that this touched that had to have been Rewritten to like there must have been some set of Engineers who had run into some qaing bugs when they ran things against prod where they like found that there there was like this thing and they're like oh that must be just a bug and like it's just like hard for me to imagine conceptually like given how they made um so many other mistakes that they could have like perfectly hidden it in the entire engineering org like so I like I recently did a show with Jesse Powell and Kevin Joe and Kevin was saying that um Sam was often bragging about how a few Engineers he had um something like a team of 30 or something like that I don't I don't know like when he said that so it could have been that up you know later on he had more but do you guys remember anything like that and like maybe that was part of the reason is you know they were trying to hide it from as many people as possible or like or limit the number of people that might figure it out well part of the Mystique of FTX for years was it wasn't 30 used to go around bragging that there was four engineers right oh wow and that they were like and like everyone's like how can you run an exchange with four Engineers it just seemed superhuman that was the pitch deck I I think the pitch deck was literally at the like we only like coinbase has thousands of Engineers we only need four right and then later they were like you know oh we have 30 Engineers everyone still was like you have 30 and coinbase has like 4 000 like this doesn't compute but they were running a lean ship and I actually think that it was possible in that structure for Sam and a small group of his lieutenants to actually deceive the rest of the employees or the engineers like I actually don't think it's that hard to especially now that the information broke about how nishad coded this Korean whale account for one or two people just to like with probably a few lines of code difference just say oh Korean we all can't get liquidated right and then like when someone asked they're like internally you know when they run the query on the analytics it's like how come this account is so different you know Sam or whoever like oh that's a Korean whale we just treat them extra well because they have eight billion dollars on our exchange you know yeah yeah so like if there's some vvip account right like let's say okay well that only goes through the key lieutenants uh you know normal computer you know normal customer service doesn't touch those accounts I think it's pretty easy to imagine I kind of can buy it I just feel like there's so many ways you could slip that up and like make mistakes in a code base it just feels like too perfect like I feel like someone else I mean if they only have like 40 Engineers Cameron you've been you know convinced by Sam's apology tour that like everyone's an idiot and they're all like so like okay okay this is the apology towards I think there's more co-conspirators because of this like I I that's more my my claim is like I actually think there's probably more people who who have known for a while yeah these are evil masterminds and they're not idiots and they didn't make all of these like like oops I made a boo-boo like we somehow lost 10 billion dollars it's like no they like specifically wrote code to hide 10 billion dollars of losses like yeah I mean I think the the main thing that I keep wondering about is like first of all what was even the motivation and like because this appears to have really started so early on like there wasn't even much of an attempt to create a legitimate exchange and so and then but then on top of that to like make yourself so public to be you know like hobnobbing with the lawmakers and to be on Capitol Hall all the time and to have these Partnerships and you know sponsorships with like Tom Brady and Naomi Osaka and Giselle punch it I mean this is like you know Larry David the Super Bowl it's just like so risky like Beyond even just a normal it there's something like kind of deranged about taking that level of risk to do that kind of a fraud but then also be that public like you would you know it was like it's just like um you would just imagine that if someone's like really doing something bad they're not going to try to call attention to themselves you know that's how that's or at least that's that's how I think the vast majority of people think right well I think it's the opposite I mean he was essentially one of History's Greatest con men and I'm using that in the traditional definition of a con man in that his whole scheme ran on confidence that FTX was powerful and like worth like a lot of money and doing everything and having built a great business that Alameda was an incredible trading firm like his whole like game was to inspire confidence in himself Alameda and FTX and part of that is being as public as possible and like spinning as good of a yarn as possible because that was part of the time I guess what I'm saying is that like so many crypto exchange owners are extremely wealthy so he didn't need to do all that and that is so risky and now he's most likely going to be in prison kind of on the order of you know somewhere around the rest of his life so do you know do you know what I'm saying it's like the calculus is so odd it's like you can kind of get in the ballpark by doing it legitimately so why would you risk the other thing that's going to lock you away forever I think the linear wealth thing comes into play here right like literally each time each time he had to double down on this right like Almeda took a double size loss you need to double the customer funds what's the only way to get it you got to spend a lot on marketing because like at the end of the day they had no real organic volume like most of the time people use FTX was like it was some coin financed in list because they were slow or it was like you wanted a margin with some claim that like every other exchange wouldn't let you post this collateral so it's like they had this like built-in adverse collection in the beginning and they were able to front run all those people but there's only so much you can do and if you have even bigger losses to cover you need to get new fish and how do you get new fish do you you get Tom Brady to tell them they're like yeah okay so okay hold on hold on so take a step back take a step back when we first started talking about the story right we were talking about this idea that like Sam had this like vast Empire that he decided to gamble on for seemingly just like a crazy reason to try to save a market maker right and now we're getting an increasingly crisp picture that's not a good reading of what actually happened here what actually happened here is that the whole thing from the very beginning was  and every step of the way he was lying to people he was lying to investors he was lying to customers he was lying to counterparties about the state of all of this right about his involvement in Alameda about alameda's position on the exchange about you know their ability to you know go ahead of other uh customers their ability to get liquidated treated as any other marketing all that stuff it was all it was all fraudulent and so the one I think trying to frame this in terms of like a calculus of okay he was doing this in order to get that it seems very clear from the beginning that if he was actually thinking lucidly about any of this it was very clear eventually this was all going to hit a wall right uh he he stated um publicly so previously I think on a previous show we said that or at least I said I think at some point that Alameda probably made billions last year we learned they didn't make it they didn't make billions last year they made um I think Sam says something like in total I believe he said somewhere they made uh between FTX and elevated they made a total of like 1.5 billion which means that element made a billion dollars last year I I think Forbes reported that Alameda lost money yeah I think John John Ray also reported that they had net lost money like when the post bankruptcy file it yeah after the bankruptcy file yeah obviously after the bankruptcy no no he said last year they also lost money yeah yeah I believe someone said they followed like a tax return showing like billions of dollars losses how is it possible yeah my old colleague at Forbes Jeff I'm just pulling up his article I'll skim this while you guys talk but I'm pretty sure yeah they lost money last year as well uh how could they have lost money last year it was like yeah December was like pretty close to all-time highs as far as I recall I skimmed this article pretty sure it said it was 2020. let me just keep going okay that's that's fascinating anyway okay well regardless completely like the story now with of Sam is getting completely reformulated as more and more facts are coming to light um that in fact he was never very competent this whole thing um this whole idea that look wow he did this like I mean the tournament I'm kind of pushing back on you this whole idea that like oh Sam like did this effect of ultra's calculus to like bet this thing to win this thing it seems like actually the better reading is that Sam was just a  psycho and that there was no way that any of this was going to eventually work right he was just getting deeper and deeper into a hole of lies that eventually he was going to that was going to spit him out one way or another interest rate phenomenon where you could keep doubling and hope hope to get more cash like at the end of the day and like we did inflation kill SBF are you saying that really we can trace this all the way back to technology leading to higher interest rates unbelievable collapse of FTX it was Biden it was Biden in the end wait wait wait can we can we can we some for on the conspiratorial event I think I want to start indulging some of the conspiracy theories right now yeah let's do it yeah which are um who do you think the cooperating Witnesses are in this trial because like there's no way they they pull this off so fast and Caroline but you I I'm wondering if Trabuco who is you know he he I could imagine he's actually secretly uh but why would Trabuco cooperate like he's not anywhere near the epicenter I mean he might just go through the letter the like hey maybe we should shut down Alameda research notice that happened like a few weeks after a Trabuco left or and probably that they're very closely timed together I think he probably knows a lot more about skeletons in the closet that other people might not and if I were the government I would definitely try to go get him this thing because you know but I mean subuko I mean look fair enough but Trabuco was not pictured as being in the Inner Circle right he was a traitor and from the perspective the problem he caused all the losses though maybe right but that's not illegal yeah but that's not illegal no no no he knew that there was some bracket going on to cover those right like I I feel like sure but yeah as far as I understand Trabuco didn't have uh ownership in FDA he wasn't one of the core team he was a Trader he was uh you know at elevator from the beginning and he kept you know there's nothing illegal with making bad trades even if it's with someone else's money now he knew that you know this money was illegally being funneled from FTX but I I think in principle like FTX making a giant loan I I doubt Sam was like Hey Trabuco these are customer funds please treat them characters I think I think though if you're trying to pin this idea that's you know Sam's been trying to be like oh like I was not involved with Alameda whatsoever Trabuco can be extremely valuable there to basically say actually no he was really still the CEO basically even though he's like claiming he didn't know anything and like I think that's actually going to be extremely valuable for for the this case like proving that he actually for sure right yeah so wait before we keep going with the conspiracy theories let's go back to uh you know how much money Alameda lost and I so I was pulled up the wrong article but now I found found it so the entities 2021 tax returns collectively showed a net operating loss carryover of 3.7 billion dollars and so this is from um something filed in the Delaware District Court which is where the bankruptcy is happening and it said that means spf's businesses which primarily consist of Alameda and FTX had posted a net loss of 3.7 billion dollars since their Inception that's their Inception didn't even have that much salute wait how can you leave that much Inception if it's since Inception they never raised 3.7 billion dollars there is a lot of money but they didn't raise 3.7 billion dollars it meant that fundamentally they lost money that didn't belong oh no this math doesn't make sense this must be like they acquired things that had tax losses that they were then able to carry there's no way they acquired anything with billions of dollars of like tax loss carrying forward just look at their look at their balance sheet right they had they had SRM they had Soul they had also how could they have lost that much money they were marking everything to Market so like there is some weird fudge fudgy thing that could be going on here where like it really they're marking things that they claimed they lost a billion on which were marked incorrectly to whatever but if you have an asset let's call it let's call it ftt or Sierra more maps or any of these things if your starting cost basis is zero and then it goes up to be worth five billion dollars and then goes down to be worth two billion dollars right I don't think you have like a cumulative loss of three billion dollars yeah you can't have a cumulative loss yeah exactly yeah they made up all this right yeah no it has to be acquired like if you just look at the June 30th balance sheet right there's enough on there to show that clearly they had a bunch of stuff last year they only acquired Ren as far as like they have like two or three other like Aqua hire acquisition in in 2020 well okay either way look I don't think we'll be able to get to the bottom of the accounting on a podcast actually let me just read the last bit on this um or the meat of the article it says the leading theories on why Alameda lost so much range from Big bets gone wrong to having god-awful accounting records those theories might explain why Alameda lost money in 2022 when crypto was crashing but its losses through 2021 remain a big mystery from an accounting perspective it's unclear whether they were realized or whether they represent a snapshot of his businesses and their asset values at that point in time says Steve Rosenthal a tax lawyer and Senior fellow at the urban Brookings tax policy Center then it says if bankman freed was using a mark to Market approach to accounting then it would represent paper losses at that point in time which would still be stunning yeah how could you have had that loss when like you're at all time but it's the tax it's the tax return so I mean there might be other things in there that are explaining that like them acquiring some tax losses yeah something crazy if SPF lied not just on those tax returns but in many other places yeah sure yeah it feels like there's something else happening there's something else happening I don't think it's that simple someone on YouTube has one of the best comments unfortunately you know Tom here otherwise you could highlight it but it was QuickBook license cost 3.7 billion dollars so one of the other one of the other news items of the week was that it turned out they did all their Accounting in QuickBooks which notoriously doesn't support any like crypto or even like mildly Advanced equities accounting so you know maybe that's the source of their in fact this QuickBooks thing actually by the way a tiniest side I'd actually talked to some like people who worked at endowments and they were like the way that funds invest in FTX might actually be liable to LPS who could sue them is that this QuickBooks and Excel things suggest that like they didn't even ask for like real accounting statements and uh like people could actually go after some of the investors for for like as a fiduciary not even checking this so wait wait but but what they kept for their own internal books was what they were given as Financial audited financial statements like I don't think I don't think they like the investors would have gotten the audited financials from that shitty accounting firm um even if they were doing their own internal books with QuickBooks like the Auditors need independent verification but you should also be checking how what software and control mechanism they have for how they keep their own books before they send to an auditor that's that's a form of liability of like a fiduciary should be checking that so there was some interesting there are some interesting claims from people who are LPS that like there are there's like rooms for room for more lawsuits from some of these things that keep coming out yeah but this goes back to my earlier comment about how um just the more details that come out the more I'm like whoa this is like a scam like right from the very beginning and then this goes to that thing about how he loved to get people to invest by having that spreadsheet where like the earlier the for you know it's um it's just like a race to the bottom kind of situation where or he's creating it where it's like the earlier that that you are the cheaper your um terms and all that and like you know people are just like oh he loved loved loved this way of fundraising and then that just is a way of being like don't do your due diligence just get in right now you know and for anybody who actually took the time to like make sure that everything was on the up and up they would be punished by having bad terms so you know it's like all those things that's like you know Alex pack talked about it um I I think it was on my show or I don't remember where anyway sorry um that he you know was he that's one of the reasons that ultimately he didn't invest it was just like this weird you know situation where he could feel that anytime he was trying to do his job he was getting this pushback so anyway so yeah just um every time I'm learning more and more about all this I'm just like whoa like there was tons of stuff also though historically you could have found I mean haseeb's partner at dragonfly is the other person mentioned in Alex's story who was like also just like I had all this kind of like they both got different like accounting stories and like oh like we're spending all this money on like this type of trade but that is actually funding The Exchange being built stuff like that so yeah damn Sam very clearly thought VCS were idiots and to be fair like maybe he was right because the VCS were invested in saying yeah but he had just a tremendous disdain for the entire VC process then you can also see it from the way that he ran FTX Ventures is that he thought VC was super easy and you just like you know fire up your guns and you start shooting in the direction of things that look interesting um and as a result they have this ridiculous web of Investments of just random stuff they have no idea about anything like they're diligent the FDX Adventures diligence is some of the most ridiculous diligence I had ever seen and so I think it carried all the way through when you're using stolen money you have a very different attitude than when you have a fiduciary duty to people that you've raised money from yeah that you're generating if it's stolen customer money like yeah you're gonna be like shooting it everywhere well even forget about even The Avengers and and you know I love I I take any chance I can on this show to to take a hot shot at EA okay go for it no no no no back at the uh FTX future fund there was a Forbes article about how the FTX future fund was also just trying to spray money at people like people who didn't even apply for a grant it's supposed to be a non-profit Grant that's supposed to give like mccaskill is supposed to like have some thesis of like why they're investing in some particular thing they literally just sent people money who didn't even want it and people sent the money back and like they they they like basically kept sending them money if you read this article it's unreal basically the FTX future found was like how do we ship sell give out money as fast as possible and it's like wait there's supposed to be a non-profit like vetting these organizations because they're effective and it's like if you want something that like is the biggest egg on mccaskill's face that should be this like that is just embarrassing for anyone for that entire ideology that you did that ineffective altruism I mean it's not data driven foreign well I guess that's the one other thing that's so confusing to me and maybe it shouldn't be maybe um the effect of altruism thing was just a front as well but you know if his goal really was to make a lot to give it away then again you would have expected he'd actually like literally try to make the money rather than just take it because it really almost feels like it was more of a campaign just to like burnish His Image because you know when you read this whole thing about it's the sports sponsorships and the political donations and you know and then like the the supposed like philanthropic things are yeah like really bizarre weird not um impactful things like the anthropic thing or you know what I so it's just like I I just don't understand like the more that I'm kind of looking into it the more I'm just like what was the point of doing this like you're risking all this stuff for what exactly like like if he was actually doing something like buying you know a gazillion uh what are those malaria bed nets like okay then kind of maybe but how many how many mosquito Nets do you buy with a Tom Brady sponsorship I see a lot yeah you could like probably eradicate malaria with that yeah you know yeah so that's why you can actually house at least 50 houseless FTX engineers right exactly homelessness exactly the 50 houses after effects Engineers so so but but I just this is why like psychologically I'm just like what was in his brain like that is so confusing to me because I just any other person like if he if you were so let's say that we were all at like some party and we were drunk or something and one of us was like oh you guys like I have this idea for how to you know kind of just um Swindle people or whatever and you you spun up some idea of like what Sam actually did like everybody would would be like you would be found out so fast you will end up in prison for the rest of your life it's not worth it like do you know what I'm saying and so that's why I'm just like how did he think this was a good idea Well here here's my read on this is that he thought he was going to get away with it first and foremost because I think everyone who's caught in this Web of Lies and digs deeper and deeper and deeper thinks that if they just lie a little bit more and steal a little bit more eventually they'll make it all back and yeah but that's what I'm saying like how did he think he was going to get away with losing eight billion dollars of money that's it's just weird to me if you're betting bigger and you keep on doubling the size yeah yeah yeah it's I mean Bernie Madoff this is ultimately a Martingale between trabuco's tweets and Sam's tweets about betting bigger all the time I mean they did tell you what they were doing yeah it's true it's true and look like the the implicitly right like if if FTX was a levered long exchange which like why the hell is an exchange levered in any direction but if FDX is levered long exchange that means that if prices went up they would have been in the they would have been declare they would have been solvented yet and so that's I mean the same thing the three arrows was doing at the end of the day which is that they were levered long and if prices went in the right direction they would have been okay wait are you serious but like they don't they don't they still don't fundamentally wait okay but wait this only makes sense if you can like somehow double the number of units that you have because the line like what you owe your customers is also going to go up at the same time like so let's say that I put two b2c and then put it into Solana and SRM and all the that they were buoying in the markets right they were buying all those standpoints and so the same coins had to go up right but the amount that they owe customers also goes up in dollar terms because like well a lot of the liabilities were in dollars right a lot of a lot of people just have dollars something like that liabilities weren't like Bitcoin and ether and whatever they're not in dollars but the eight billion dollars that was wired to alameda's bank accounts in order to deposit money on FTX there's a very clear eight billion dollars there right right but those people when they wired the money it's to buy you know whatever they're not like literally just like I'm in a perfect McDonald's yeah yeah so from the beginning from the beginning right the the assets that ended up on elementa's balance sheet were dollars and those dollars were supposed to be uh basically you can think of it as Alameda owed eight billion dollars to FDX not 8 billion Bitcoin not eight billion ether if there was Bitcoin or ether that ended up on FTX it had to come from somewhere else right no but what I'm saying is that um for cut so you're saying that you think that Sam probably thought he could make it back and give customers their money but what I'm saying is when I thought about it but okay right but I'm saying so when a customer sends in money the reason they're doing so is to buy like let's say a Bitcoin so then they are owed to bitcoin so if they buy a Bitcoin when it's ten thousand dollars and then Bitcoin goes to twenty thousand dollars then they're going to be owed still a single Bitcoin but it will be worth more in dollars right so that's why like you're saying oh the prices just need to go no no because then you still owe the the the the like the liabilities in dollars also increases I understand the point that you're making um which is that yes the total value of all the assets goes up and the total value of all the liabilities go up exactly um but the assets and liabilities that were on elementa's balance sheet as far as we understand right now we're dollar denominated they were not crypto denominator as far as I know um and if in fact they were dollar denominated then that means that the assets and the liabilities of FTS had were probably more of the crypto and the the the more of the cash was with Alameda right so that meant that the cash was not going up and down in terms of its value that was on the FTX side but they were given so much of that cash to Alameda that FTX is ultimately in the hole so that means Alameda is um you know they are short dollars they're not short crypto right but FTX is short crypto and so when you keep saying that the if the value of the crypto goes up then they can pay the customers I'm saying no no no no because the liabilities of FTX also go up because if the prices are crypto are going up then what FTX owes its customers also goes up so you can't it doesn't make you still can't do it that way correct ftxt Exchange likely had liabilities to its customers in Bitcoin there's literally no when all was said and done and we peeled back the thing there was no ether there was no Bitcoin left at FTX and all the people thought they had balances of Bitcoin right ftxc exchange was short crypto to its customers Alameda was short dollars to FTX and used those dollars to buy stupid coins like ftt and SRM and maps and oxygen and all this stuff and make Venture bets that were extremely eLiquid right Alameda was levered long on weird stuff FTX was short on good stuff and in a bull market I don't know which one would win well definitely the good stuff not not the coins it depends on the bull market right in the last bull market it was it was the weird stuff that outperformed the good stuff like Doge and yeah well but also SRM and you know yes all the same coins were were pumping last year because he was converting the customer's Bitcoin into the coins he like fundamentals yeah so then the only way that it could have worked would have been if they had if their coin strategy had actually worked but then also they would have had to sell at the top in dollars but then also buy Bitcoin and the other good coins that were also then at that point at an all-time high and still somehow make enough to send back to that like that's so convoluted you have to do three things correctly like do you know what I'm saying it's like it's that's really really hard this is why it didn't work this is what Sam's in a prison that's right it didn't work you are absolutely correct you nailed it Laura this is why we should put you in charge of the next big exchange uh I think you probably wouldn't make the same mistake hold on I want to go back a little bit because we skipped one of the pieces of the story which was um uh tarun alluded to so okay first things first um so Sam was arrested in Bahamas he was then arraigned uh brought in front of the judge and he asked for bail because he didn't want to hang out in a Muhammad jail while he was awaiting extradition and potentially he signaled that he wanted to fight extradition that he didn't want to be extraded to the U.S so you know he's lived in Bahamas the last two years presumably so the the judge was not very excited about the idea of him uh getting bail uh he offered to pay 250 000 which supposedly was more than his net worth he's claimed that he only has a hundred seconds to his name but it's about 250k bail is no big deal has anybody done a search you know for Hardware wallets I'm a little bit like you know can they search his premises for that they must be able to use it anyway of course at this point they can well look we had billions of dollars in rescue money coming in I'm sure somebody you know seriously went missing like in the middle of the night you know when they declared bankruptcy like where is Gary there's in aggregate like 10 plus billion dollars of stuff missing everywhere like I'm pretty sure Sam has more than a hundred thousand dollars right yeah yeah I'm gonna own a single Bitcoin to his name like come on also it is crazy that like they they it's issued so much sobtc and it was like completely unbacked today what's sobtc so BTC was like a Solana wrapped Bitcoin though issued by by FTX and they like had so people like these Bitcoin whales would send Bitcoin there and then get sobtc and then go like take their svtc and use it and defy and so on it right right that that last part just did that Bitcoin didn't exist at the end that was like wild to me that like that basically they somehow had like completely run out of Bitcoin wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait where do you say People wrap their their Bitcoin for the Solana thing but then actually there was no Bitcoin that was being wrapped that somehow by The End by the end after that they spent their Bitcoin to FTX FTX wrapped it kept it on the exchange as like a special account for the wrapped Bitcoin it's kind of like what coinless does with wbtc right except it was FTX instead of pointless uh or no it sounds bitco right they just it was like with all the other bankruptcy assets they had no Bitcoin when they went there in fact I I actually have this this slight theory that of the six billion dollars of withdrawals bitcoiners were probably the most paranoid because they've like lived through the most exchange they were withdrawing the first and so they had everything so much BTC that day that they basically had none and then they couldn't do any of the Solana withdrawals and the salon the the Solana token then lost its pay oh wow yeah I actually now that I think I did know that I totally forgot about that yeah okay so rewinding a bit Sam uh trying to trying to make bail uh no dice uh and so Sam is now in a jail in the Bahamas known as Fox Hill which apparently is one of the worst jails in the world uh it's it's supposed it's like rat infested with maggots it's got horrible treatment of apparently your toilet is a bucket um it's a really terrible place where he is uh being held right now um basically awaiting extradition to the U.S and uh supposedly from what I've been reading a lot of people think that he's going to stop fighting extradition if he can't make bail because he can't make bail it's a lot better to be in American jail than to be in a Bahama jail no he wasn't even granted bail he wasn't granted bail as far as correct he wasn't Grand the Bell yeah he wasn't but he's trying to stay to fight this extradition thing and right right yes extradition so there have been cases where extradition Court battles have taken up to seven years out of the Bahamas if huge for whatever reason was able to stomach life in Fox Hill which by the way like I think Sam is the greatest con artist of like all time like he's horrible like I still don't think any human being should like live in those conditions even temporarily like it's horrific like unhumanitarian conditions like I don't don't wish upon anyone even though I wish L for Sam like if he can stomach that environment like he could probably fight this for years um just from that cursory research into like Bahamian like extradition law like there have been cases where it took seven years for them to x-ray people unlike simple stuff like if you keep on appealing it and going through like the British court system and like all this stuff it's like so he could stay there almost indefinitely wow I I don't see any world where he'd want to yeah like it's horrible commissions yeah yeah this is careful this is sort of a very weird aside but uh so after after Sam um after all this stuff with FTX went down like I tried to message Sam to see if I could convince him to come on the show he was not interested because we're not a Twitter space he's been only 20 the most random Twitter faces no-name Twitter space but anyway um and so uh so anyway it doesn't matter I don't message a lot of people on Facebook messenger and so the few people who I do message I message him on Facebook he would like show up all the time I could always see when he was online on Facebook which is very weird because he was like doing this apology tour and he's like one of the few people who are showing up at the top of my thing and then yesterday it was like I didn't I didn't see him all day because I usually see because he's online a lot I didn't see him yesterday and then I read that he's in he's in jail and I'm like okay I guess he probably doesn't have access to Facebook I think I I think his uh I've heard I've heard his Facebook is filled with posts of people being like you remember you robbed me uh which is like funny just because it's like it's like his even his friends are going and posting like you know right so this is like funny that you just happen to mention his Facebook account because I can't remember where I heard this but it must have been some interview he did or something I don't know and somebody must have asked him something like you know what's something that you you know like don't wish you did all the time or I I don't remember what the question was all I remember is that he said that he finds himself scrolling through Facebook oh all like all the time like a lot sort of like you know compulsively and then I was like so just like Facebook like you are you are not a crypto personally through Facebook all that I was just so confused by that I was like Facebook like what crypto person is like constantly scrolling Facebook it was so so weird I remember I had this call with him in 2020 I think it was like right after comp farming launched it was like July 2020 and he was like calling me to be like asking me what layer ones some question technical questions about layer ones and I guess like I was the only person you knew to ask or something and I remember he was like telling me all the reasons he loves Solana and I was like but like here are all these other problems like the bft might not work you might have these liveness issues like blah blah blah blah blah right and he was just like unable to understand any of these concerns that like crypto people have about like what a blockchain is I was like oh I see like you literally are just like going to everyone and you're like what's the block time okay next what's the block time okay like you didn't even like care about any of the like safety conditions like how the wallet interactions work like any of that stuff and this is not a knock on sauna right like the team has in a lot of admirable ways like somehow patched it together to to not totally fall over but it was just like kind of funny that the like savior of this thing doesn't even understand why anyone would use a blockchain he was just like he was just like how can I make this thing less and less and less and less and less like a blockchain and like that's all he wanted it's funny because I had a similar experience Sam uh I remember um you know after that initial uh when when when uh dragonfly passed on the uh Sam Seed round super early on well you were you were also you were the Alex Pack story also that was dragonfly right yeah yeah that Alex pack was originally dragonfly but I wasn't there yet right so that was before I joined that was before I joined um and so yeah so Alex pack and Beau passed on Sam's seed round Sam got really pissed and Sam basically was like I'm never gonna work with dragonfly again uh and he refused to invest co-invest into any rounds the dragonfly was in and I I didn't know that at the time and I didn't know Sam very well you know I sort of knew of him but I never really spoken to him at any length except the first time I met him which was years before he even got into crypto um and so um I remember I I reached out to Sam because I was like hey I heard that you like are really mad at us and I don't really know why look I was there um like let's talk let's I just kind of want to understand more about what you're doing because you're obviously building something really big and so we got we got talking and uh she I remember we were chatting about defy and we were just like exchanging trading notes on like what things we like and defy and uh I was like oh yeah you know make her that was great like really excited about make her now we invested in maker now and she hated Maker Now and I was like what's wrong with makeup that was so great how could you hate maker now he's like it's just so inefficient right like it's so the collateral ratio is so high it doesn't make any sense why would you waste all this capital and he was just so anti-maker it was like very surprising to me I like I very few people encrypted like a lot of things people don't like almost everybody likes maker you know like even if you have your issues with it by the way I I owe the maker folks including ruin a correction for something I said last time which was the the the the the the the insolvency they they had were completely not related to Gemini and it just happened to there was some gusd there's it's like completely it's completely safe there's that was that was me ant falling for fun and not understanding and I talked to ruin about it I told him I would uh give a on-air oh there you go correction good direction yeah and since you brought it maker as a great time okay so anyway all right uh we we have a little bit more news to get through um because it has been kind of a crazy wait do we talk about the should we talk about the block we have to talk about the block one more example of SBF being evil okay so all right tldr the block secretly got a financing where uh SPF basically gave a massive loan to the block um and that loan both financed the block itself as well as real estate for the former uh CEO of the block um the loan was two it was too impersonal McCaffrey directly yeah yeah the loan was to Mike who did basically uh private Equity buyout of the block from its former team and owners using spf's money to personally own the entire the block which is like which was hidden from all of the team members at the block it was hidden from the people that he was buying it from and it was hidden from the public right it was SPF taking what was most likely customer money to buy out a media obligation in the space right right which he then did like a bunch of those after right like but it was like kind of that was the first yeah I did it more explicitly yeah I did it more explicitly I knew Mike quite well and I I actually had gotten drinks with him right around the times he did that and it was like some like hey we'll celebrate the block going private and like I was like where are you actually does the bot make enough money for this happen I I was just like I don't really get how this is working out but like apparently the block made decent money um they know they sent me something like 30 million last year or something right so so so like revenue or that must be just Revenue not profit right yeah they have like a hundred something people and like I I just was like I tried to do the mental math in my head I was like I don't really see where this is coming from but like all right congratulations I guess you've sold a lot of Enterprise subscriptions uh and so like I kind of was always a little bit like oh there's some something is a little fishy and he kept going to the Bahamas all the time I was like why are you going to Bahamas too much and then it turned out he got this like other loan to get a a apartment in the Bahamas uh which was also I guess hidden from everyone's block uh but you know I I I do believe Frank uth and Larry that they like had absolutely no idea and like I definitely you know support them in whatever Endeavor they do next because I I really feel like I feel like they just seem to have like gotten sucker punched and I I feel bad about that for them because they're some of the best you know journalists I think in this space yeah I agree I mean from my perspective so Laura I'm curious to get your take as a journalist but I'll say from my perspective as just like a passive Observer of all this no dog in the fight whatsoever um it felt um okay clearly this Mike McCaffrey I don't know I've never met him um seems like he was a dick and he did something he shouldn't have and then he stepped down and he he was he wasn't he wasn't a dick I I will say he it's just that you know he got greedy okay apparently he wasn't a dick I don't know uh but what he did was a dick move and ultimately the people who were at the Block who do all the work you know from my perspective like their work speaks for itself right like some basically the best coverage in the industry on a lot of subjects including on SPF and including on FTX and this whole collapse like very often the first place I go to try to read the best take on what's going on is the blog and so I don't think it in any way did any of this seem to seep into their coverage of anything the thing that I guess I found a little too much about this story was that I think the block played it very well in everybody who was at the Block just openly gnashing their teeth and cursing the skies and saying oh my God I can't believe this happened as a way of like answering like look where we really believe in journalistic Integrity it's like I know you guys like look I'm still gonna read the block like I don't really care who got alone to wear like it's good content I I'm not a journalist so it doesn't hit as deep for me that okay the CEO Finance this secretly from some guy it's like okay fine yeah but Hasiba I don't know if you saw like there were a lot of tweets that then became immediately suspicious of them and were attacking them and so like this is just a huge betrayal that Mike did on the journalists because you know when you're when you have this kind of you know referee role you're trying to be the neutral Observer report whatever the facts like just anything that either you reveal or someone reveals about you that like allows people to attack you in any way that that's not helpful for your job right so to have like the CEO of your company completely undermine your ability to do your work in secret behind your back that's like a total betrayal so like I don't know if you thought their tweets were like performative or something but like I'm sure they weren't I'm sure they felt like no I believe that they were feeling very you know very betrayed by the CEO and so like them asking the CEO the UFO and a sword he left he's gone now they're gonna figure out how to recap the company great and to me I'm like okay yeah but so I I it's great that for you you recognize that yeah there wasn't any malfeasance on their part but like I said if he looked at the replies in the tweets and stuff like a lot of people started attacking them you know like oh back in the day you you know reported blah blah blah and you didn't say did it and I mean you know that's exactly what Mike set them up for and um you know they didn't sign up for that and it wasn't it had nothing to do do with them he did this on his own so that's why they were so upset and why it's such a betrayal and frankly why I felt absolutely terrible for them and just you know I I really actually think it's like a really really bad thing that happened and and it's going to be something that will probably dog them for a little while just because like you know whatever there are certain people um speaking of conspiracy theories by the way I just want to address that you know before spf's arrest like so many of the conspiracy theorists were like oh because he made so many political donations he's not going to pay at all he'll never be arrested he's just gonna keep going on living in the Bahamas whatever and I was like wait like do you guys know what's what he just did and like you know I kind of was like if anything the fact that he kind of like made all these people look bad is gonna is gonna mean that it's gonna be much worse for him um but there were so many conspiracy theories I saw like that and I was just like you either don't know how this works or you don't understand how bad it is what he did or you don't understand how like people that have like egg on their face because this guy you know what you know what like basically um cozied up to them and then what was perpetrating this uh fraud like you don't understand that like this is actually gonna make it way worse for him and like he is gonna end up in the slammer no matter what so anyway I just need to call out that those conspiracy theorists were super wrong which I knew from the start and I just thought it was even weird that they could entertain the idea that he would not pay for any of this yeah yeah yeah for sure I I just think it's like if I were in their shoes I would just try to like make a new company and like wait their their shoes so much brand value why would you make a new company no no no no you can keep you know I I feel like they the the the people are still there like hostile takeover because like it would kind of suck to have to work there and like you know you're stuck in this situation I think this will blow over I think this will blow over no no I I saw that they tweeted something like they're trying to buy the block from Mike or so they're it's like gonna be I forget it was something like like that they're coming together in some way to try to to take ownership yeah there's some Syndicate or something that they're performed yeah it'll be great if it happens the block down okay well speaking of CZ speaking of CZ okay okay we should we should cover this before we wrap the show um so speaking of conspiracy theories um so we've we've learned fairly recently that um it was reported I think by it was it by Reuters or was it by Wall Street Journal that um the uh the doj is contemplating bringing charges against finance and so you know that there was a doj investigation into Finance Reuters thank you we know that there's a doj investigation into binance for quite a while it's been going on for years and apparently they've collected enough evidence to be able to bring charges but there's a debate internally within the doj whether it's wise to bring charges at this time or whether it makes more sense to sit on the case or to try to settle and just have them pay a fine or something like that instead of trying to do this big kind of dog and pony show given how much damage has been going on in the industry lately I thought that it was that half the team thought they haven't had enough evidence and half the team thought they didn't have enough evidence wasn't that it I think it was particularly about concerns around uh like just damaging the industry unnecessarily around these charges right so the question is clear to me a blockbuster are these charges I don't think the doj cares about damage yeah they don't care no I think more is correct when I read the article and I don't know who leaked this or why or you know whatever but when I read it it was something along the lines of internally they're split on whether or not they have a case I'm sure someone's sympathetic this easy probably leaked that I I actually think um one thing that's funny is like why are all these leaks happening like in the last month I feel like is is it just me or does it feel like there's just been like a insane torrent of leaks since like November like it's just been like because of FTX well no no but even even leading into that I feel like they were starting to be a lot more rumors and and like then it's just like cascaded but like I mean it's yeah this whole year I mean it started even at like the Supreme Court you know Roe v wadeley i mean like yesterday there was the CPI print which was a major event which got leaked early and people were trading on it like I feel like the US government's control over information is becoming fragile and cracking and there's more and more leaks coming from different branches of government they're having the past that is the hottest take this show has ever had that's a very large scale take it is interesting though yeah I kind of I I don't remember like obviously like the problem is you're you know you're not quantifying this perfectly when you and you could maybe go retroactively do it but there's this quality of feeling that like yeah the leaking rate just seems to be like growing a lot yeah from judicial the executive and the legislative you know it's like there's leaks like coming from everywhere like it's sad and weird but one thing that I did want to talk about was how we were all like why would doj care about doing something that would damage the crypto owner like I when I read that in the Warriors article it was like wait like what like stop when people on the doj are thinking about because that doesn't make any sense to me I don't know if the person got the facts wrong there or what but I just was like I don't think they're thinking about that in fact I feel quite certain they're not thinking about that it's to my mind it would be either like they think they have enough evidence or other people are like no no we we don't quite have a strong case to make that would be I that's what I would guess yeah so I I misread the article what it says here is that among binance's arguments a criminal prosecution would wreak havoc on a crypto Market already a prolonged downturn the discussion included potential plea deals according to three of the sources um and at the very end of the article it says binance is hired a former Chief of mlrs uh engage in discussions with the justice department they met with just officials in Washington in recent months three the people said officials discussed with date a possible resolution to the case of Port whereby subjects would potentially plead guilty or pay a fine the resources said they did not comment can um can I say one thing that's kind of a funny comment I I felt when I read this story which is you know normally when people talk about like the revolving door in government and like people going to finance or going to like Tech from government jobs it's like always viewed as like this like negatively connotative thing then the binance case the interesting thing is they've been advertising it as this like positive thing that they're like yeah that they're like taking advantage of the revolving door and I think that's like a funny flip narrative wise relative to like the normal one about the revolving door being like in their kids they're like look revolving door means that we're more legit which is like no no no no it's because the revolving door is bad for government because then it makes government look less neutral right but the finances marketing of this like tweets is like the opposite no but that's because they're taking the legitimacy of the government and now pulling it toward binance so it's good for binance to be like hey we have these people that were in the government for like 10 years 15 years whatever like one of the top investigators for CSI at the IRS like so it's good for them so it's not a weird spin it's like they want that the articles I mean sorry that like cover this don't write it that way right whereas like when they do when they when like someone like say an SEC commissioner goes to Goldman they'll be like oh the revolving door of government like happening again so I think that that's like a funny funny thing that that this artist I think it's it's that the I think it's a journalists are surprised to see that happening in crypto you know it's newsworthy that that is also happening in crypto it's like oh wow cryptos kind of like any other kind of weird financial industry um it's a sign that we're growing up a bit uh but so because I think in in one part accelerated by this uh League from uh the the doj contemplating bringing these charges against binance but also from binance's kind of proof of reserves where they you know sort of didn't do a very convincing job of uh showing their liabilities Beyond just you know some some nebulous amount of Bitcoin that they show that they have assets against um there have been and the fact that they represented their approval reserves uh as being an audit which of course is no such thing because binance has an enormous number of assets and liabilities outside of just Bitcoin but that's all that they actually uh produced it's caused a lot of fun around binance people believing that perhaps binance isn't solve it and then that was exacerbated by um one there being some delays in withdrawals of usdc on binance uh that those were since uh ameliorated um due to some some I think they had to move a bunch of UCC around but we've seen actually um we've seen all-time high net outflows from binance I think uh I believe it was like yesterday there was like billions of dollars that died in a billion something like at the peak yeah right right but you know to be clear that's a very small portion of binance's total um assets and liabilities so there's still I mean there's 60 70 billion something like that in total um so it's a it's a fraction of what they have but this is probably the biggest case of outflows that we've seen from binance um in a very very long time so um the question that is now circulating is like is binance the next FTX um I I personally think that this is pretty questionable um I think by an interest in a very very different position than FTX but that being said the risk of the doj bringing charges against binance is a very different kind of risk than the risk you might worry of just a vanilla Bank Run so here's if you guys have a perspective on all the fear uh around binance right now I mean I think fixes just because the idea that there would be two of those is like as crazy as you have a hard time believing it as crazy as the whole FTX episode has been I kind of yeah I maybe I shouldn't discount the like really wildly impossible but everything so far has been so wildly impossible who knows I guess it could be but as long as we're still not like a full-on clown World mode I would imagine you know binance hasn't been using customer funds for some other purpose so I would guess yeah and it's like correction I think the weekly outflow is around five billion so it's actually even less it's less than what FTX had to do in the day where it was like six and then they shut off yeah and Larry Cermak tweet uh tweeted an image of um the binance Bitcoin reserves and it's like you know over time this thing that goes up or I guess since I'm doing it for the audience I should do it this way and then it shows like a very very very slight decrease recently and it but it's this huge amount of Bitcoin they're on so you know um whereas you know obviously with FTX you couldn't even find their cold wallet so yeah I think the other thing is that in in absolute terms I think a lot of people are now conflating FTX was like every exchange and the reality is that FTX is pretty unique FTX didn't make a lot of money as we're now increasingly learning the all the ways in which they didn't make a lot of money um the one thing that you can say about binance and then now people are even even in Congressional hearings people are saying about binance is that binance was evil because they they weren't doing all the crazy that FDX was doing a buying distressed companies the binance has been you know if anything they've been impressively financially prudent in not trying to catch any of these falling knives they just keep the business running and so you know up till up till today binance has been incredibly profitable um to the point where I would be very surprised if Finance were in anywhere near a similar position to FTX much less really any other Exchange in this industry so now that being said that doesn't stop there being fraud doesn't stop there being violations of anti-money laundering statutes which is essentially what the doj is focused on um but you know as for them not having the money uh that seems pretty that seems pretty wild to me like unlikely so yeah but um tarun was mentioning this in our chat that um that doesn't stop the Congress from pointing fingers at CZ and claiming that somehow the FTX collapse was cz's fault uh there was some there was some uh because we we got to like we gotta like properly slice and dice this like okay we'll play back a clip next time yeah okay great great yeah I didn't actually see it so I don't know what happened oh my God it's and it's so crazy I I I I I was sad for Humanity watching that yeah but it's weird to me that like Congress would invite somebody who was like an investor and then also this paid spokesperson for Ft like like I I just was like oh that needed to have been like Congressman does clickbait turns out you know they just need they just need eyeballs no but what's weird is like you would imagine for Congressional testimony there you would need to have a fact basis with what you say you know they're like the the notion that you can get up there and then just say didn't Sam testify in front of Congress well yeah but I I so yeah okay but he was doing yeah so Kevin O'Leary all I'm trying to say is even after the facts have come out Kevin O'Leary is saying things that are like just not true whatsoever despite the fact that like all the the facts have come out so it's just very weird and and but it's weird to me that like even with all the information the facts coming out that they would invite this person who is then just the Congress yeah like he's just like like he's a paid spokesperson for FTX and now he's spouting this weird conspiracy theory that has no basis in reality so it's just like okay whatever I mean the entire witness list of the Senate was designed to allow everybody to participate in grandstanding like across the board whereas the house the two witnesses that they had planned were the people closest to the FTX drama to would be most equipped to actually speak with authority on like what actually happened the Senate hearing had people that were quite far removed from FTX who have no more information about it than you or I or anyone on Twitter fundamentally maybe Kevin has the most because he was a paid spokesperson but no one else there had any access to any information whatsoever the idea of him having any information that isn't just like Reddit the witness list it was like it's like calling a witness you know to a I don't know a murder trial that's somebody that wasn't at the scene of the crime yeah but but it's like paid by the murderer to Advocate and with that I feel like we put the final dagger in okay perfect all right well we're gonna open the next show with some clips from Kevin O'Leary's testimony and then we'll we'll uh get the full the full treatment there all right we're we're at time so we're gonna go ahead and wrap for this week but I'm sure there's gonna be more juicy news next time um thank you everybody for tuning in and we'll see you all soon hey
