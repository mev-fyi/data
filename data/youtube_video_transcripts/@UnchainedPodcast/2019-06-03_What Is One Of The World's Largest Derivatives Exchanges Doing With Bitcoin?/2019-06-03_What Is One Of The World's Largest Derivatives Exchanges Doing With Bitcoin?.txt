london-based industry organization with over 40 institutional members focused on bringing together regulators with cell side and buy-side firms to collaborate and discuss the impact of blockchain and distributed ledger technology welcome to the show Sandra Thank You Laura for having me today so let's start by telling the listeners what it is that you do now so what I do today is run digitization initiatives at cm e group my background is actually in technology and capital markets I began my career as a financial services financial engineer structuring FX derivatives solutions for institutions to manage FX and M&A risks I joined CME Group about five years ago out of the London office as you mentioned to head up FX research a product of Ella meant we started researching cryptocurrency Bitcoin a few years back and that's evolved to now earlier this year where we formed a group called digitization and for our listeners who don't know that much about CME what is its history and its role in financial services so CME Group is where the world comes to manage risk we are a company of exchanges dating back more than a century that started as a place for farmers to lock in prices for their crops and today we cover every major asset class and you can access our markets in 150 different countries worldwide and how did Bitcoin and cryptocurrency get on the radar of CME so a friend of mine back in late 2012 I believe actually introduced me to Bitcoin he was an FX algo trader who had just started trading Bitcoin and said that hey you should read this white paper you should research bitcoins and I did so I read Satoshi nakamoto's white paper on bitcoins and that's how it all started in terms of my interest in the space and why do you think it captured your imagination well I think I was immediately taken back sorry taken by the revolutionary potential of basically a Global Payments network based on a completely decentralized peer-to-peer you know open source protocol for me that just represented a way to move money or value faster cheaper and more efficiently than the mediums that are available today and I think if anyone is a user of cross-border payments you know it's clear there's room for improvement because the mediums today are costly and slow in terms of what you were doing at CMA at the time how did you start to make a connection that this could be relevant for the work that you do so as I mentioned I was writing FX meta FX research and product development and obviously we were focusing on FX products and when Bitcoin came into the picture we researching what the impact of that could be on traditional effects markets but I think what we really thought was truly interesting about this particular crypto was the fact that it could represent a new asset class and that it actually had attributes that are very distinct and different from traditional asset classes today and what are some of the indications that you had that that was the case well the three major attributes I think that would put you know crypto currencies or Kryptos under is the fact that make them unique one is as investable products which you then could say all the other asset classes are that way - will you buy and hold absolutely number to medium for payment but in this case not backed by any specific sovereign state so Bitcoin used for example to pay for a service or a good but I think the third attribute is the most interesting and unique which is the use of cryptos as a technical mechanism within a network to move around value so the example that I think of is when XRP or ripples token was created to move around euros and dollars for example using X RP as a technical mechanism or rail what you're describing here is sort of is how people describe blockchain technology but you are attributing it to cryptocurrency and you know you're relating it to the way that X R P moves value so when you when you do that are you really saying that the value does reside in the cryptocurrency or in blockchain technology what I'm saying here is that you have a now network that is able to tokenize either brand-new assets or create token versions of physical world assets and move them around in a virtual world the blockchain piece is very important because obviously it's the underpinning or the rails that will move these tokens around but what I'm highlighting here is that for the first time you've got eventually quote-unquote tradable assets which are representative of different attributes one in particular the technical mechanism that it could have value as well okay and we started this question by you talking about how the the cryptocurrencies themselves were investable assets but I know you're also very active in blockchain so could you just sort of break out for me you know the two different effects that you think that these you know cryptocurrencies and then the technology itself will have on a company like CME or similar companies in the financial services sector sure I mean I can't I cannot speak for other financial services companies but I think this is a new digital asset class from a tokens perspective or a cryptocurrency perspective and we're beginning to see Bitcoin as the first but not the last and there will be tokenization of physical world assets as well that is different from the discussions that are happening in the financial services with regards to blockchain and particularly its implications for let's say for example post trade processes post trade services and what that will shape the technology could shape over the next few years in terms of how that evolves and I think that's a very big piece that's gotten the attention of you know a number of financial services companies and what do you see as some of the most exciting applications in that area from our perspective as a you know with one of the world's largest clearing houses we are definitely looking at various aspects of how the technology itself could help solve problems for us for our customers our customer improve our customer experience and you know offer potentially new business opportunities or services that we may not offer today that could be offered tomorrow what are some examples of current processes that you feel could be improved so when you look at what positive attributes the blockchain technology can offer sharing of information is one that you know I like to highlight because that's where you could have information that's been traditionally siloed you share it across let's say between a CME and our clearing member or ourselves and you know an end user client these are all basic siloed information which may be siloed today that could actually be shared tomorrow and I'm not saying that it's shared information across the board there has to be guidelines around you know which information is shared but with blockchain technology this becomes a lot easier to do and that golden source or that golden copy that's often discussed is possible where everyone could have a golden copy of specific set of information transactions records and that when their changes and updates made to a specific set of Records that will be readily available to that subset of network and you also mention that the technology gave you guys new opportunities you know in terms of products and services that you could offer what would be some examples of those so you may have seen a couple weeks ago we launched the Bitcoin reference rate and Bitcoin real-time index it's something that we had publicly announced back in May and we've now launched officially a few weeks ago in November and this is exactly the sort of thing that Sammi does which is to bring transparency and price discovery to markets this is what we've done for a wide range of asset classes for more than a hundred years so the fact that we've launched two bitcoin pricing products is right in line with what we've done in our history so let me explain a little bit more about the bitcoin reference rate and the Bitcoin real-time index the brr aggregates the trade flow of major Bitcoin spot exchanges during a specific calculation window once a day is transparent reference rate against the US dollar at 4:00 p.m. London time the real-time index it calculates global demand to buy and sell Bitcoin aggregated into a second solid ated order book and it reflects the current fair price of Bitcoin and US dollars in real time and it's published approximately once every second well how did you choose which exchanges to use for the for the reference rate so the exchanges which are currently part of the data which flows into our technology partner crypto facilities who calculates the rate and then pushes through to see AMI those exchanges are BitFenix bitstamp g dax which is the former coinbase name it bit Kraken and okay coin out of Hong Kong and how did you decide which ones to use so the decision-making process was actually a very long vetting process whereby there were extensive back testing done review of the methodology interviews with each of the exchange member potential exchange member management and an iterative process where we looked at the trading history their methodologies and we're given insight into some of their governance and and corporate procedures now we have an oversight committee which is available all that information is available on our website seaman group comm stroke Bitcoin and you can see who is on that Oversight Committee as well as documentation on governance and they've just completed and will have available exactly how exchanges will be evaluated as new exchanges are added or exchanges are removed from the methodologies and just to be clear the brr and the BRT I have two very distinct and different methodologies which are also available what are they as I mentioned one is about aggregating trade flow over a specific calculation window once a day and then the other one is actually calculating global demand to buy and sell on an aggregated basis that's reflected at current fair price once a second so why did you decide to launch these two products and what impact to you believe they'll have on the ecosystem sure there are a number of Bitcoin index products out available in the market and we've looked at a number of the current offerings the reason why we've decided to launch the BRR and the brt eye is that we felt that not only is it important to have a sound methodology but also really taking into consideration that these products are pricing products which need to also have a certain level of governance and oversight and so these products follow IOSCO principles and even though they are not regulated benchmarks we're very much treating them with the sort of care and you know high standards that we would expect for any of our benchmark products and for our listeners who don't know explain IOSCO so the IOSCO principles were published and this is all publicly available on alko's website which basically delineates the metric not the metrics but the principles that should be followed for any pricing product out there in the world so that's across asset classes so these guidelines are principles that we've taken from their documentation and applied to our pricing products and one of the you know conditions is to look at having an oversight committee and an administrator these functions are again guidelines but these are things that we've chosen to adopt for the to pricing products so when you look at these products who do you think will be the main users of them so the two pricing products will attract actually wide range of users as you can imagine there will be crypto traders and crypto currency users today who will want to use the product for the Bitcoin reference rate in particular will be attractive for those who want to build products on top of a sound reference rate and so anyone who's marking their books you know mark to market anyone who is looking to do let's say an OTC product on top of a rate who's looking for a rate the BRR is it's definitely the choice to look at and be RTI is going to appeal to anyone who obviously is trading crypto or sorry Bitcoin today and needs to have a lice live price feed you have a unique perspective because obviously your firm is you know planted and kind of like traditional financial services and yet here you and you know tell me if I'm putting words in your mouth but it seems that there's sort of like a new ecosystem in a you know developing out of these blockchain based assets so what are some of the products and services that you feel are needed in order to to grow that ecosystem sorry Lord I didn't catch the first part you mean in a digital assets in general well more that um you know the CME Group obviously has a long history and it's really implanted in the traditional financial services sector but then here we have a new world growing of financial assets and so I'm curious you know from your perspective what you feel like that ecosystem needs to grow there are a number of different things that you need for any market to grow and this is still in nascent market I realize bitcoins been around for eight years but or nearly eight years but the adoption of it mainstream has yet to come and you know there's some challenges around on and off ramps right now I think when you look at how easy it is to access for example Bitcoin there's still frictions and I think when some of those frictions are taken away and it's easier to go in and out of Bitcoin as a user that will help a lot and further to other digital assets coming I think you will see more and more digitized tokens coming on to the market and that includes announcement that we just made with regards to our partnership with the Royal Mint to launch a digital goal old product so let's dive into that a little bit more what is it and how did it come about sure happy to talk about that so we've been working with the Royal Mint for some time and we just announced the partnership and that we will provide CME Group will provide the technology infrastructure for the role meant and to realize what they envisage for the Roman RMG product which is called Royal Mint gold it's really extraordinary time I think to be at the forefront of this technology and we believe that our mg will appear to appeal to many sectors of the gold investment market so let me talk a little bit about how it works the Royal Mint itself is in a thousand-year-old institution a hundred percent owned by Her Majesty's Treasury of the UK United Kingdom and basically we've partnered seeing erm as we call it the Royal Mint has partnered with C AME group to build and launch a digitized gold product called Roman gold RMG and we anticipate that royal mint will change the way traders and investors world trade execute and settle gold and the RMG will be issued as a digital record of ownership for gold stored at TR Em's a highly highly secured on-site bullion vaults storage facility and that is where the gold will be held so for every RMG there will be gold to back that RMG that will be fully reserved cm e itself will develop implement and operate the products digital trading platform and we do plan to operate that 24/7 very similar to the way Bitcoin or some of the other digital assets trade and unlike the traditional physical spot cost model for investing in gold with management fees and ongoing storage charges RMG's will actually offer ownership with the underlying gold with the option for conversion to physical gold which zero storage costs and that's significant from an investment standpoint how does that work exactly I now with this new product you know let's say that I want to purchase some how is the process different both for me and then on the back end so for day one as we're calling it which is mid 2017 launch we are actually expecting to have a small number of institutions and investment intermediaries to participate so in terms of direct access by retail that will not be available for the first issuance but there will be secondary trading available with which through intermediaries an individual may open an account if they have if they're able to open account with an intermediary who is participating in the first issuance can you continue a little bit like how does the technology work on the back end in terms of you know what what used to be the process and then what will now be the process so let me I can talk a little bit about the way the current OTC bullion market works which is it's largely OTC over-the-counter bilateral market that is traded by the banks so there's a number of banks who trade in that market and it is not for the most part not done on the screen so what the difference here is that you're seeing digital gold RMG use in this particular instance traded on a screen so you get price transparency with a electronically traded training or digitally traded trading platform the back end is where we're going to record the direct ownership of the gold and that will provide the transparency of the ownership so again I'm going to use the word transparency because what you get is pricing transparency pricing discovery on the front end with a digital trading platform and you get the record of ownership transparency on the back end with the blockchain technology because this is something that's backed by a physical product how does the technology connect to the physical items like you said that you know you could actually redeem this for the gold so how how does was that connection made so one RMG represents one gram of gold and the Royal Mint will have the ability and there'll be procedures for how this will occur but for those who wish to transform their RMG's into physical gold we'll make a request to the Royal Mint the Royal Mint will convert that request into physical gold and will be delivered to whatever location the delivery curves now of course there'll be charges with respect to that but that will be possible this you know aside from the reference rate and the index is you know one of the first blockchain products that you guys are working on why did you decide to use this as one of your first to launch the opportunity came as we have a long-standing relationship with the raw Mint and we spent a great deal of time once we learned that they wanted to launch a digital gold product to see if we could help work with them to develop and and turn this into a reality and this is a real production-ready product that will be tradable mid next year and for us you know this was an opportunity to grow and build a market alongside what we you know do today it's an extension of innovation and applying a new technology as well as going into the digital asset space for us it has many attractive attributes for why we've decided and also the partner the Royal Mint is it's a venerable partner and a very close partner that we are very happy to build this with I'm just gonna pause you right there to bring in a word from our sponsor the

marketing strategy on ramp will get your organization strategically poised for the future you can learn more and see examples of its work at think on-ramp comm you travel a lot around the world and have met many of the players in cryptocurrency what geographical differences are you seeing in cryptocurrencies in each region it could you know be anything from usage to the entrepreneurial and developer communities to the regular regulatory environment so Laura you are correct I spent a lot of time traveling around meeting with lots of different people in the network from the FinTech firms who develop the cutting-edge technologies to my industry peers who are working on various projects or regulators who are obviously in government entities who are focusing on learning more about this space it really is at the moment a big learning process for many of the institutions that we've spoken to many of the financial services firms are definitely working on proof of concepts I think you will begin to see in 2017 more visibility around perhaps pilot level production ready products the universe of potential applications is so wide I think it's hard to say whether one dominant use case is prevailing over another but between cross-border payments between reporting up use cases you know derivatives as well as equities swaps there's just a whole myriad of different discussions that are happening and I think the most challenging that is keeping on top of what are the latest technologies that are evolving even from earlier this year when you look at January to December of this year the advancements estimate that have been made you know a pretty phenomenal there's still a lot of development work and and you know problems to be solved but in a 12-month period it's been an awesome amount of development around the world and and likewise I think there's a big challenge for regulators and government entities and industry to keep up with all that information flow and also to understand what the true implications are well so in terms of geographical differences you know I know that there are some in terms of regulation then there's usage differences in you know the amount of trading we see of Bitcoin in China versus you know other regions you know what are some of the the trends that you've noticed as you've gone to the different cryptocurrency communities around the world well I think actually we can go back to data to actually say that we've seen some real support around correlation between when there's government uncertainty or sovereign currency issues to Bitcoin usage look at what we've seen in recent weeks in India since the government's D monetization efforts of getting rid of their 500 and 100 bill rupees that you've seen a surge in the interest and usage of Bitcoin as well as the premium between Bitcoin onshore and Bitcoin offshore prices skyrocketing this is also occurred in countries like Venezuela Argentina Ukraine you know list goes on I think there's statistical evidence that shows that you know in the eight years that bitcoins been around that surge occurs when those types of issues happen in them in in in government's where there's either instability or the currency itself is having issues and that you know shows that Bitcoin as the most prevalent current crypto is is an alternative that people can turn to or do turn to and when you say that I also know that in the past you have spoken about how you don't really think that cryptocurrencies are currencies but more like their own asset class so when people are turning to them what do you feel is appealing to them and yet at the same time how do you feel you know their their choice of bitcoin differs from like if they you know where to choose a rupee or you know a Bulevar or whatever yes so when times are stressed and there aren't many alternatives people turn to things called safe havens and gold is considered a safe haven and over the years it looks like because bitcoin is an alternative there is the potential for Bitcoin to be considered a safe haven as well it's it's an alternative and we just look at what's going on in these countries I think you know I think I would say look at the data do you feel that at some point Bitcoin could become a safe haven similar to gold or is it something different well we'll have to see but I'm you know I think it's difficult to say but there are limited alternatives when countries are stressed at the beginning of the conversation you talked about how cm II you know did see that there was potential for cryptocurrencies to become investment products and yet you know obviously it's still somewhat early but I at least think that so far the only people who seem to view them that way are really other cryptocurrency enthusiasts so how do you think we get to the point where that becomes more of a general interest where you know that everyday investor receives this as is something that should be part of their investment portfolio I think I mentioned this a little bit earlier about ease of access and ease of on ramps and off ramps I think there's some still big challenges to the user experience I think a lot of people in the community have mentioned there's no killer app yet I think that's true from a just usability standpoint besides the fact that you know obviously they're technologists who are working on Network issues around Bitcoin network itself but I think you will hopefully see that we will have companies like you know startups or incumbents coming up with better and easier ways for things to become user friendly and when things become more user friendly then the adoption rate usually increases as we've seen with previous technologies I mean look at the smartphone you know twenty years ago compared to the way smartphones are used now it's very different because apps came into play and I think you know we we need to have an easier way for people to adopt new technologies like this one and it's not quite there yet still nascent for an earlier question you talked about how right now bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency do you feel like there's anything that could happen that could change that and make another one more popular it so early days I think it's hard to predict any winner but what do you think could could change kind of that first mover advantage that Bitcoin has look at all the frictions that are there today and if you were able to create something that didn't have any of those frictions and was just as an appealing then there could be something to supplant the current leader and when you talk about frictions are you talking about the usability issues that you mentioned are you talking about how there's you know some disagreement or attention over how to you know continue developing the protocol and building out new features now I'm focusing on really about the usability aspect of it like is it easy to get is it easy to use is the user experience really easy although I guess a lot of that it comes from more like apps and stuff so write it like or is do you feel that there is a cryptocurrency that could be launched that would have those features built in rather than having them built on top by outside companies it could be I don't think we have one yet so there's plenty of room for improvements you know there's this is so early days in this space that I think it would be difficult to say who is a winner and who isn't and are there any new currencies that have caught your interest I know that there's a not only launching every day but if ones that have already been launched in you know garnered a fair share of investors we are doing our research and evaluating the more prevalent ones that obviously exist today ether and sea cash being you know - that others that come to mind but also you know as I mentioned before with our armed G product we are looking at the tokenization of real world assets and that is potentially far-reaching interest across not only the crypto space but as well as to the traditional investor space and what would be an example of another world real world asset that you think could benefit from being moved on to the blockchain so the tokenization of physical assets again is a nascent area where there is interest and I think has a long way to go gold is the first but there could be many others if you took a look at what's traded today and can you tokenize any of those and what does that do in a digital world where trading can occur there's a lot of possibilities what are some examples of things that you think would be right before you know being tokenized in this fashion tokenization doesn't reside just in metals it can go across agriculture can go across energy it can go across many different areas and when it comes to regulation is there anything that you feel would need to happen to make digital assets more commonplace I can't speak on the behalf of regulators and what they're thinking about you know crypto but there you've seen in the press they are researching and working on this space and some of them have come out with some white papers and views okay but from the perspective of CM e in terms of but you know an industry player trying to launch products and services in this area is there something that you feel would be helpful again I can't comment on you know what regulators should be doing or not doing but what we are you know is a highly Gallade identity who needs to operate in the parameters of our regulated status so we engage and have you know discussions but again the regulators will decide for themselves how they're going to look at this let's do a little bit of blue sky thinking let's look five ten or even twenty years down the line at that time what part do you think cryptocurrencies and other digital assets will play in people's lives or their portfolios it has the potential to be an alternative uncorrelated to any other asset class and it has the potential to you know act as another way of expressing holding value and and that's the thing this is about the internet of value and how value is transferred in a digital world which means that some of the traditional ways of looking at the way we store and hold value will evolve and for your work when you look five ten or twenty years down the line how do you think the technology will change the way that your your company or your industry functions there's just so much and this is what's really exciting about this technology that I feel like even though a lot of work is being done right now we haven't even scratched the surface of new areas and possibilities that's really going to transform the way we create new financial products or inspire the way processes are done improve the way processes are done it just could be really transformative and I think when you add the convergence of blockchain plus smartphones and smart contracts which you know I really haven't mentioned until just now what I like to call the blockchain apps and other emerging tech like AI and VR visual reality we're really talking about a world where financial services is a very different face and has a very different potential user experience and I think that's where you can let your imagination you know evolve it's hard to say right now I think what all the possibilities are what would be kind of like an early example of a way that you had combined some of those technologies to create something new and financial services well let me let me go back to my smartphone analogy so I said smart phones came in like 20 years ago and apps didn't actually come along until about 10 years later or so and when you think about what that did for us like smart phones were great but then apps came along and it just completely changed all of our behavior right did any of us really think that we'd be holding wealth on our phones which effectively you do when you're tapping on your phone to check your accounts and you have all of this information sitting there did we ever think that perhaps we may be doing transactions on our phones I actually you know check things and sometimes I actually even conduct a trench with his financial transaction through my phone I don't think I would have imagined that 10 15 years ago so what are we talking about in the future well by 2020 there will be more people with smartphones in the world than people with running water or electricity to me that's very profound meaning that anyone in the world who's got a smartphone will may be able to hold their digital identity will be able to hold maybe their wealth digital financial records and that all has very profound impact I think on not only the democratization of financial services down to you know a much more global level but also an increased accessibility but it also just shows that there's a much bigger macro change occurring which is automation so as all these technologies advance and then you add in you know as I mentioned mobile and smartphones it's going to create massive opportunities but it's also going to create massive structural changes and I think that to financial service is what's going through right now will continue and that's going to be very interesting to see how it plays out I think a lot of people are really excited about the different ways that this technology could transform not only financial services but you know ultimately the world's our lives you know as you talked about it would democratize access to financial services and and stuff like that yet at the same time you know we're all very aware that it's early days and there have been plenty of technologies in the past that have been fervently touted as being the panacea to a number of problems so let's say a decade from now that blockchain has actually failed to transform financial services the way that we imagine why do you think that might happen so first of all you know that I'm an optimist in this sector so I don't think it would but I hear you there are definitely some obstacles and challenges a few that I can think of are relating to the lack of network effect maybe there'll be too many inoperable incompatible blockchains you know another one is you know other technologies may leapfrog blockchain so if you have certain technologies that you know do it better which we haven't thought of today if that emerges over the next couple years that could definitely prevent blockchain from becoming that blockbuster technology and then furthermore this is a global technology that does require a network effect so therefore it will be important what the regulatory and legal framework looks like globally okay and just so we end on a positive note what do you feel like would be the most exciting result that we could see ones trip once blotching has transformed the sector the most exciting things that we could possibly see is a world where a lot of the frictions that we see today meaning things that are very costly like cross-border payments wire transfers or things that cost sorry that that create frictions from a cost and inefficiency standpoint if some of those big financial you know bottlenecks can actually be mitigated that will be good for everyone involved and that's not just financial services so I think what we need to start with is really how do we take existing sort of old decade's old infrastructure that exists in certain areas and how do we make that much more streamlined and bad without completely overhauling everything I think it's going to take time but blockchain has the promise to do that and since we're launching the 2017 year of this podcast with this episode I'm just curious to know also do you have any predictions that you want to make for 2017 in terms of cryptocurrency and blockchain I'll leave that to you Laura I could get in big trouble for making any kind of predictions about you okay well where can people learn more about you and your work or get in touch with you anyone does want to get in touch I do have an email address it's sa ND rho r o @
