not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to a special episode of The Chopping Block so normally this happens every couple weeks with uh different cast of characters but today we had a very special episode for you because there's been a lot of drama lately in the nft world that we thought it'd be great to bring some people together and do a live debate about uh the pros and cons of the situation so first let me introduce the characters I'm going to tell you the backdrop of what it is that we're debating about today so first you have me I'm haseeb I'm a managing partner at dragonfly Capital which is an investment firm uh actually have Laura who is the CEO of the show of Unchained podcast uh well-known journalist and podcaster uh then we have joshun he is one of the co-founders of magic Eden which is the top nft Marketplace on Solana and then we also have Legion Lee is one of the co-founders uh or the general Partners at variant and it was previously one of the popularizers of the term Creator economy at Anderson Horowitz and so it's very Central to the question of how creators are viewing the world of nfts so the topic for the day is around nft royalties so last time Laura and I got into it about the pros and cons of nft royalties and weather nft royalties were going to be long for this world and the world was rocked a few days ago when uh joshun among his team at Magic Eden announced that they were for the first time no longer going to be enforcing nft royalties and this kind of rocked the nft world so first let me explain very briefly what nft royalties are and then we're going to get into the meat of it so nft royalties when you trade an nft um you know before going back you know a few months ago back when actually royalties were still the norm um if you trade in nft on open C every nft collection can specify its royalty meaning that anytime that a trade takes place on the platform like on openc um you know let's say five percent is the number that the Creator specifies five percent of the sale price goes back to the Creator and this is a concept that's been very popularized as one of the uh by many people let's say as one of the key selling points of nfts but we've seen the increasing rise of new marketplaces that do not respect the concept of royalties or do not enforce I should say the concept of royalties so magic even to be clear announced that they were no longer enforcing royalties meaning that users could opt in whether or not they wanted to pay the royalty but we also have new platforms like pseudo Swap and these uh automated market makers that do not directly enforce royalties and we've seen more and more uh digression from the norm that more and more people are finding different ways to approach the question of of royalties so the debate is really how do we feel about the the rise of the decline of royalties and do we believe that this is the way the world is going uh and do we believe that this is good or bad for the world and for for nfts and for creators so uh on the on the pro side of pro royalties is going to be Laura and Legion and on the anti-side or at least that the royalties are going to go away are myself and Joe Shun from Magic Eden so with that as backdrop uh Laura why don't you start with your opening statement about royalties so my first thought upon hearing the news about magic Eden and just in general my thoughts around the zero percent royalties or not enforcing royalties is that this is really short-term Thinking by the platforms and um I think most crypto people would probably have heard this saying by Naval where um he talks about how short-term thinking or prioritizing short-term things leads to bad outcomes um so for instance like choosing to eat whatever you want versus like following a healthy diet or like choosing to not exercise versus exercising or you know whatever spending you know like crazy versus like spending within your budget um and so I think essentially What's Happening Here is that the platforms are deciding to prioritize um one half of their constituents which is the um the purchasers of the nfts whereas the creators are the ones who are actually more valuable and they're not realizing that and and the reason for this is that the people that are purchasing the nfts okay they're like you know giving income right but they're like income like money is fungible as we you know you know very well know in the crypto world and the creators as we all know are offering something non-fungible very unique where each individual person only has that you know that they're offering something that like no one else on the planet can offer it's really like a very valuable thing in that regard because it's like you know you can't find someone else who's just gonna like offer that same thing that Creator uh you know has to give to the world so um you know when I think about like how they're prioritizing that essentially the creators Are Gonna Leave they're gonna be like okay we're not interested in working with these people who are kind of screwing us over and not only that but it's like a weird prioritization thing where it's like you know you you can get money from a lot of different places there's a lot of different you know participants in the market you cannot get like you know certain valuable nfts they're just unless that Creator works with you so like to my mind it's just like it doesn't make sense from a business perspective and then the other thing I would say is like we're still early in the nft space that I feel that this is going to reverberate out into the mainstream world and it's going to turn people off of the crypto world is going to turn creators off of trying to get involved into nfts and web3 because you know that was a big selling point around nfts which is CPU and I talked about before apparently not you not all VCS but this was something that was sort of promised to creators and now now you all are pulling back and like prioritizing what the speculators make off of this so in that regard I feel like that's just gonna kind of delay the progress of the nft space and the growth of it because all these newcomers that might have been interested in coming and they're going to be like oh forget it it's the same as web2 there's nothing different it was just all you know like smoke and mirrors and they're just gonna be like okay we're not gonna do this it doesn't make sense for us so in that regard that's another reason why I feel like again this is a bad business decision like it literally to my mind just doesn't make any sense and I guess the last thing I would say about this is that so I see from your last from our last discussion I totally take your point that um it's sort of this race to the bottom and um you know you can't enforce it uh on chain or whatever and so people are they're just not gonna do it but like I mean you're a VC you work with entrepreneurs and the problem that creators have and you know I've been in the Working World for 25 years I'm heading to my 25th College Union very soon I've been a Creator this whole time and I have seen like how the internet has rocked my industry and I have seen that this is like a really long-standing problem and I have a lot of friends who are not writers like me but they're musicians or they're artists or you know I've seen this problem across all different types of creative Endeavors and I feel like it's such a huge problem that if an entrepreneur could solve it I mean it would be like a big payday for them and so you know your arguments last time I was a little bit like oh is this like defeatist attitude of like like uh we can't do anything about it therefore we won't whereas I would challenge you to say hey what could we do to solve this like really you know big problem that a lot of people suffer from so those are kind of like I I have more points but those are my Top Line points and like probably my my main arguments oh actually last thing I want to say just about my personal experience with this is that like you know I my first job in journalism was at Newsweek and I kind of joined it a hot time because Newsweek had broken all this news about like Monica Lewinsky and blah blah blah and so it was like you know like a cool thing and when I joined there you know the top editors they like took cars they had nice lunches and they're probably very well paid okay like roughly maybe 10 years later Newsweek got sold for one dollar you know like things like Craigslist took you know classified advertising away from newspapers um this whole idea that they were just gonna give con to wait for free like I don't know what they were thinking they were idiots but anyway that all these things kind of decimated revenues for um media when I talk about like my experience with this like I just have seen so much of people and so much suffering and like so many people who had to leave journalism and do other things so that's again like why I think we shouldn't just roll over and be like okay there's nothing to do forget it I think this is such a big problem and that if we were to solve it it would unlock so much creativity and like lead so many people who actually want to do creative work for a living it would enable them to do it and I think that would be like huge huge because think about this all the most popular things in our society they are cultural things you know like look at all the most popular like actors and actresses you know whatever just celebs they're all like kind of cultural people like maybe athletes is you know another one but like by and large you know it's not like you know unfortunately sorry vcues or you know what I mean um it's like it's not money people I'm just saying like people really do value culture so it doesn't make any sense that we would say oh you know what it's too hard to do this we're not we're just gonna forget it and like not not reward the creators okay Lawrence you made I made a lot of points some of them which were directed straight at me it's true it's true there's a continuation of an early conversation um so let me let me start by kind of the high level my high level view because I think a lot of people on Twitter kind of took something that I wasn't intending to say as what I was saying so there's there's an old saying show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome to me this characterize exactly what I'm saying about nft royalties is that there's such a massive Chasm of difference between something that is enforced by code and something that is enforced by norms and nft royalties have been up until now enforced by Norms like literally the way that you encode a royalties I don't know if anybody knows this but I just want to explain the way that you tell uh nft marketplaces what your royalty is is that so you can think of like a you can think of an nft collection as like a big bundle of data and some of that data is like here's where the images here's some metadata here's the name of the thing and it's all this big bundle of data right like a big zip file okay in that giant zip file there's a little piece of text that says I want the royalty to be two and a half percent that's it there's no there's no enforcement mechanism there's never been an enforcement mechanism the whole idea is that this is like imagine that I I uh I was selling a book and I put my book into bookstores okay and my book says on the back cover it says if you sell this book at a store please you know venmo me five bucks every time that you sell this book right like okay that doesn't work like it even for a while maybe some bookstores will be like you know what I love haseeb so much he's such a great writer I want to make sure it's sustainable for him I'm gonna I'm gonna enforce you to venmo him five bucks every time you buy this book but in reality that is not a mechanism that's not enforceable right so to me saying that isn't it so much better in a world where nft royalties are enforced on chain yes I agree with that that would be a better world that is not the world that we live in the world that we live in is one such that nft royalties are kind of like I sort of analogize them to Mev uh with minor extractable value which is that you know for a long time nobody extracted Mev it was a norm basically you know back in 2017 that was the first time that we saw like big mining pools start to play around with the men pool and mess around with stuff in front of people and people freaked out they were like oh my God I can't believe that a mining pool would mess with the transactions in a block and miners learn okay never do that again that's totally not okay and this Norm just got enforced for a while for a while and the thing about anything that is enforced with Norms is that eventually somebody is going to stop enforcing the norm and when that somebody stops enforcing the norm when people start front running when people start extracting Mev then all of a sudden you can either say look what guys please please please follow the norm and just yell until you're blue in the face or you can say this is where the competitive Dynamics are going to take us blockchains are built on the ideas of incentives on the ideas of code enforcing rules rather than humans enforcing rules and if you don't have that then you need to come up with something else you need to innovate right so to me the idea that we're going to stick to royalties because we had to say you know people were doing this everything was Kumbaya open to get a monopoly and so nobody ever had to complain about you know something that openc still enforces royalties right but they're in many ways they're the biggest one left X2 Y2 has moved from non-enforcement royalties to then letting the holders decide whether royalties are enforced pseudo swap is not enforcing royalties now magic eating is not enforcing royalties we know where this is going we've seen this game play out a thousand times so making a moralistic argument is not going to get you there you need to innovate that's always the answer when the market structure doesn't go your way you need to innovate not you know yell at the status quo wait so we agree then on what on the need to innovate I mean I I agree on the need to innovate but I but I don't think look I don't think the answer is going to be that creators are going to find a way to get back the royalties right now I was pulling some data on how much different collections are getting from royalties compared to how much they're getting in in primary right and for a lot of the biggest collections it depends on when they launched if they launch later they have less from royalties they launch earlier they have more from royalties because it kind of depends mostly on where you were during the nft crazy bull market right if you're if you're if your collection was around for a lot of the NFC bull market there was so much velocity to these things that you've made a bunch from royalties um if you launch relatively late then a very small percentage of your Revenue came from royalties and it's trending down as and a few volumes are printed down first so it ranges from like 20 to you know for for board API Club it's like 80 percent of their revenue came from but you know when they minted they were tiny so obviously primary was so long ago and so much secondary transaction volumes happened since then but for most of these things it's a significant portion that they're getting from royalties but the amount that they're paying to marketplaces like how much revenue how much fee Revenue are they paying to marketplaces versus the royalties um for a lot of these it's like three to one they're making way more royalties than the the marketplace are making in fees which means that right now you have a situation where what you're talking about is bargaining power how much bargaining power do the creators have versus the marketplaces this is not a moral question this is an economic question I don't know the answer to it but I'd be very surprised if the answer is it's exactly what it was six months ago let me let me jump in and Pile in yeah we need to finish our opening statements so Steve do you feel you're done with your uh I'll stop there I'll stop okay I have more to say believe me but I'll stop there yeah we all do at the risk of um yeah going hard at Lee one of our investors at Magic Eden let me uh preface that uh make this a friendly conversation but I think uh there's a few things that I think are just important to like reframe kind of up front right I think that number one this is this is by no means the end state this is and that's a view that magic Eden has of course it is a decision that is happening today but this will not be the end State and I think generally maybe we all align on that because like there is some Innovation that has to happen I think statement number two is that magic eating is not anti-royalties and I think that the debate on crypto Twitter in general is very very typically two ends of the spectrum and obviously the most extreme ends of the spectrum and the reality is often somewhere in between Point number three which is kind of being a little bit related to this is that being optional royalty and being procreator those two concepts can Concepts can co-exist and that is our view at Magic Eden as well uh which is why I think we can get into the details of some of the things that we announced uh on Friday I really really do want to be a massive plus one to haseeb's point earlier that it's all about like kind of a market structure incentives question at the end of the day in that long term long term we were always going to have this conversation whether that's on Friday when magic Eden dropped all this news whether it's next week whether it's two months from now whether it's a year from now this conversation would have had would have had to have happened and then long time there has to be a balance in an equilibrium right I actually think the bull market basically distorted everything it distorted the fact that it's okay to pay uh 12 13 spread on something because it didn't really matter right it didn't really matter at all over the last sort of nine months or so and imagining to be fair has only been around for 12 months right we saw a very very gradual trend towards you know to haseeb's analogy like people starting to extract no it's not Mev but in this case starting to extract value through uh not paying royalties in some way and to be fair you could do this in many ways before magic Eden decided to hear optional royalties right there was OTC and OTC volume was picking up and then maybe three or four months ago there was actually three or four marketplaces on Solana that did go zero royalties so this has been a trend that's been happening for some time but it's a kind of Classic Market incentives question in our opinion and the statements of being optional royalty and being procreator can co-exist and that's why I think we made two kind of really big things happen on Friday one is obviously that we went optional royalties but the the key thing that I want to point out there is that we did it on the buy side so royalties are being paid on the buyer's side and why is that distinction important it's because there's no incentive for a seller to pay the royalty because they're exiting the community or they're exiting the project on the buy side the person wants to get into this community or wants to play this game or wants to enter this project right so there is more of an incentive for them to actually do that and and a perfect opportunity for the Creator to say if you do not honor this royalty these are the things you're going to miss out on right whether it's access to the game or something else or access to this Discord Community or access to staking rewards whatever it is that's like important Point number one important Point number two is that magic Eden is also putting our money where our mouth is in that we think that Innovation is going to solve this whether it's some Unchained stuff like harbiter taxes whether it's off-chain stuff like surfacing data information about entity holders and and the actual entities themselves to let creators you know create sticks and carrots to incentivize and disincentivize behavior so we're putting up a million dollar uh Fund in hackathon to incentivize projects whether it's nft creatives or just developers in general to work with us to basically come up with a bunch of different ideas right which we will then happily Implement to help creators uh protect and enforce royalties if that's the business model they want to go but yeah there's a lot of nuance I won't take up too much air time for this for this opening statement there's like a lot of nuance here and I think the framing of like Pro ante is is like generally a pretty unhelpful one there's many many layers of you know types of entities types of creators types of business models that I think is actually at the heart of this question right it's not whether it's Pro anti-royalty it's like what is the sustainable business model that works in a market equilibrium structure okay Lee bring it home for the pro side [Laughter] sure so I have two main thoughts um one is the creator Centric argument that is per royalty and then the other argument that I have is the collector-centric argument that should be in favor of royalties so I'll start with the Creator Centric version I think the raison d'etra of nfts in general is to support the Creator economy nfts were very much envisioned as this new monetization method for the Creator economy that allowed creators to tap into digital scarcity for the first time ever and to be able to monetize based off of something that could actually be scarce and so it's like the entire Market's appeal has been to creators to Independent creators um because of this and I think undermining Creator royalties is kind of like biting the hand that feeds you it's undermining the reason why people are there in the first place and over the last few years a lot of web 2 platforms have realized that they need to be more Creator friendly because they've they realize that the entire value chain of their social networks of their content platforms start with creators if you don't make creators happy if you don't feel if creators don't feel like they're being taken care of then ultimately they turn and that leads to the demand side the user side churning as well and so I think the entire value equation here in the nft world also starts with creators obviously and so we need to do everything in our power to ensure that creators feel like they're playing a fair game that they're being taken care of that the marketplace isn't just skewed towards the incentives of the buy side so that's my first argument and I recognize that a lot of listeners might think okay that's like kind of a moralistic argument yeah it's great to support the greater economy and yeah we want to build a Creator middle class but like how does that impact me and the fact that I'm spending money and that's why my second argument is really Around The Collector argument for why they should also care about Creator royalties and so I actually want to Echo what haseeb said about show me in the incentive and I'll show you the outcome and I'll argue here that removing support for Creator royalties is actually a trade-off between short-term incentives and long-term incentives where you're optimizing for what's short-term best for your own you know financial gain but at the expense of your long-term Holdings and that's because I believe Creator royalties are actually the best mechanism to align the incentives between the creators and their collectors it allows collectors to benefit when creators Works appreciate it provides an incentive for creators to continue maintaining the health of their communities and the desirability of their collections because they stand to benefit as the value of their Works appreciate in the absence of Creator royalties if you play out the incentives of what that entails ultimately my fear is that removing royalties means that creators are incentivized to just do as many primary mints as possible because it's a one-time transactional thing and that ultimately leads to collectors seeing their Holdings being devalued or diluted because there's just so many works out there and so ultimately I actually think paying out Creator royalties is the best thing for collectors because it helps to maintain the scarcity of the Creator's work a comp here might be thinking about like a company's Equity so the way in which Founders are aligned with their investors is by you know having exposure to the same thing which is the value of their company through the equity and as the equity appreciates investors are happy the holders are happy and the founders stand to benefit as well another cop might be SAS Revenue Enterprise businesses that are selling software as a service which has become the most prevalent model for selling software versus one-time transactional software sales which used to be the norm and SAS is a better business model for selling software for selling services because it aligns the incentives of the company that's offering that software with the incentives of the customer the company that's offering the software has an incentive to continue maintaining it upgrading it making sure it's as best as possible so that people will continue paying and similarly in the nft space I think greater royalties aligns the incentives such that creators want to make their collection as desirable as possible they have an incentive to add additional utility to make sure that there's always that purchasing desire on the part of the demand side of the market nice job Lee yeah that was great um nodding in agreement with you I was just being friendly while I was getting ready so okay so two points I want to make one in response to the points that both you and uh both Lee and Laura you both made about um the you know needing to Value creators but the second point I want to make actually make the second Point first you know Joshua struck a very diplomatic tone um I'm gonna be less diplomatic than him I know I was like he's like The Peacemaker in the group yes yes he's he's a little he's a little too generous uh but I'm gonna take a former stand is that I think I think royalties are absolutely doomed part of the reason is that I think royalties strikes something that's really at the heart of blockchains and how they work right which is that you cannot have a system that is open permissionless and that allows anyone to do anything and also enforce this idea that if you sell this thing then I get a cut okay now why is it why are those two things incompatible so when I when I was posting about this a lot of people were responding to me in DMS telling me like oh you should just list them on immutable okay and I was looking into mutualize wait why is it why is it mutable special so immutable um if you use the immutable blockchain okay immutable blockchain is not turning complete meaning you cannot write General smart contracts unimutable immutable only lets you have an nft transfer an ft sell an nft that's it there's only a few things that you can do on immutable okay now if if you create a Marketplace or create a blockchain that the only things you can do are those things right you basically get all the functions even that is still not enough to enforce royalties because as long as you can transfer an nft to Joshua's point you can always do an off uh sort of off-market OTC sale which is something that's been growing like I know a lot of nft collectors more and more they are doing this they are not going on openc they're not going on Magic Eden they're going into their own communities and selling uh to each other because why are we paying this tax right like if if this is exactly what you should expect to happen if companies are extracting too much revenue then customers will find other venues like that's just how every single Marketplace works if the market is free and crypto has always been about this idea that the markets are open and totally permissionless now so on immutable you can kind of force it if you push enough liquidity into the on-chain order book or whatever but on ethereum zero chance on Solana zero chance because anybody can do anything that's the whole concept and as long as that's true it's it's kind of you know to me the idea of enforcing royalties it reminds me a lot of um uh do you guys know John Deere the company that builds like tractors and you know a lot of farming equipment so there have been a lot of famous Anti-Trust cases against John Deere because John Deere what they do is they force your tractor to only be used by you which kind of destroys the resale value of your tractor right so if you have a track you want to stop somebody tough  like you have to do all this stuff I believe this is how it works right there's all the stuff that that John Deere forces you to to do in order to actually resolve the tractor which makes the resale value of the tractor plummet right because you just can't sell it as easily as you could if it was just an unbranded uh you know piece of hardware this is the exact same thing that empty royalties are nft royalties are a way of saying you cannot buy and sell this freely if you do I will extract the tax now if you can enforce that fair game okay fine you can enforce it but if you can't enforce it I know exactly where this is going every single time which is that people will find a way to to win out of this pressure that you're putting on them in the market great but wait let's see but I'm confused because earlier you said that you felt the solution was to innovate and I thought that you were in agreement with me that this was a problem that was worth solving and that entrepreneurship I agree but what's the problem yes the question is what's the problem to me the problem is not that people aren't getting royalties anymore that's not the problem the problem is the core problem which is how can you create alignment between creators and what they create after they sell it that is the problem the problem is not okay well people don't have royalties anymore how can we get royalties back in their hands I think the concept of royalties is not going to survive but I think but I think the thing that royalties do is valuable which is you know to to Lee's point when you sell something you should have an incentive to make that thing continue to be valuable how can you do that you know on a previous show we talked about a couple ways that I think again none of them are perfect right like the idea of if you're doing a collection you keep back 20 and you you know mint them over time or you invest them over time such that you continue to get you know you can be able to sell your nfts into the future over the next three four years kind of like you would with a company and then you sell those over time as the value of the collection increases or alternatively if you're selling a 101 nft you could tokenize the nft keep back 20 of the tokenized nft style 80 of it and now you have economic exposure to the part of the nft that you didn't sell now are these perfect no of course they're way far from perfect right but neither are royalties royalties don't get you there either so I I do think you have to be creative but I don't think you're going to get back to the world where okay we just all go back to enforcing royalty is the way that openc does yeah I think one thing I'll be very explicit about is that the only ways to innovate at the enforcement level if you truly want to technically enforce it there are strong trade-offs around centralization and permissionlessness that's basic that is just fact you cannot have true enforcement without making that trade-off and I think at that point it's like how much is the value prop then of entities do we even you know really even value anymore right tradition in the traditional sense so I think from an innovation standpoint it has to come from yeah I agree with haseeb number one it has to be business models and monetization or number two is some off-chain kind of incentives right that the Creator you know makes decisions on whether it's to allow or disallow some stuff in terms of like true on-chain Innovation here there's there is a lot you could do you could you know Blacklist a bunch of stuff you could uh restrict and free and use like freeze authorities there's a bunch of different solutions around that front but people have to understand that if you want to go down that path it truly cuts at the core of why we even have nfts and why we even want to use nfts as a interesting type of asset right on the on the business model side I I do think that I can't I disagree with with Lee on royalties being the absolute best way to align incentives I think is a is a decent way to align incentives and I think it's a it people understand it right that's actually the reason that this thing took off because it's just easy to comprehend I believe the true way to align incentives is the creator should just earn some of their nfts that's the true way in my opinion over time you know basically that they're the same as their holders right which is exactly the same way that like that's a truer form of owning Equity so to speak right of how VCS and companies align incentives it's a truer sense of you know it's sort of similar to how project and projects and fundable tokens also align incentives right like projects who launch tokens also own part of the token Supply um so on and so forth so I think that is a more direct way of actually achieving that incentive uh there are other ways too I think there's an article by a Fubar a while back who and he talked about maybe anchoring on market cap right rather than rather than true just like trade volume and and being and royalties based off of that but that's where the Innovation I think needs to be focused around less so around like on-chain enforcement because that's generally not going to be possible I agree that royalties aren't the only way to align incentives but I think we need to start with the psychology of a Creator so to joshen's point around you know you could this could lead to creators reserving more a higher percentage of their collection and just holding that as a way to gain exposure to appreciation I think that's infeasible for a large majority of nft creators out there because creators are people they have economic needs if we sort of rewind the tape back to like why why do they care about royalties and secondary Revenue it's because they have recurring economic needs and earning secondary Revenue helps to be a source of ongoing Revenue to them it's kind of like how as a founder of a company you're not only getting compensated in equity you also have a salary that helps to pay your bills you need both things you can't just have equity and no cash flow coming in to pay your expenses and I think creators I mean yes value capture is important and withholding a portion of their nft collection helps to do that but they also need some mechanism to generate cash flow on an ongoing basis and royalties accomplished that in a really clean way I want to push back on that because we've seen royalty we've seen royalties plummet right just because of the fact that secondary trading is positive right so when velocity is super high royalties look like this beautiful magical way that creators get to get paid forever now we're seeing that primary is a lot bigger than royalties for most creators and so it before it looked like it was like 50 50. half your Revenue coming for royalties half coming from primary it seems like it's probably going to look more like 85 15 something like that that a very small portion of what you make is going to be in secondaries yes I acknowledge that that is what is happening but I think that is actually a very dystopian path for the nft ecosystem basically where that gets us to is a world in which creators are incentivized to constantly put out additional work constantly be minting make the initial mint price as high as possible because who knows if they'll be able to you know achieve a secondary sale or they have no incentive for there to be secondary transactions so they're incentivized to have high mint prices and just put out as much work as possible and so what does that look like for the nft ecosystem that looks like a world in which nfts are only accessible by a small number of affluent individuals who probably get diluted down the line because the supply is just ever increasing and so do we want that to be the future of nfts like personally I think that's kind of like a dystopian future that's that's where the lack of Greater royalties gets us to uh dystopian is a strong word like whether whether or not mid prices are low I mean you could just say okay one tenth of the one-tenth of the mint is going to be a low price for like random punters but yes like you know right now most of these mints are basically lotteries and if you're lucky enough to get in the lottery and you like win a bunch of money because you got into the mint good for you you were awake at that time you were you know jamming the button on Solana or you took it down maybe that doesn't seem to me like that's the primary thing about nfts you know like that that seems like an artifact of the way in which nft hype played out in the cycle but at the end of the day like the reason why nfts matter is not because of secondary transactions it's not like these are all very minor parts of the nft story the main part of the nft story is that it is a digitally native way to own stuff from people you care about and the people you care about can sell those nfts to people who care about owning that stuff right none of that is impaired by saying that royalties are not enforceable on chain and that we have to find some other way to align incentives between creators and their their their fans so like at the end of the day the other thing you know you point out like look what wouldn't it be terrible if the prices of nfts go up it's like well yes that will happen absolutely because the price of energies will go up because now you are not enforcing these secondary skimmings off the top on resales when the resale value of something goes up the primary value also goes up right because it's it's worth more because you can sell it for more so and that and that selling chain extends all the way down if you if the velocity of this thing is like 10 people are going to trade it by the end of the year then that's like five percent ten times that you're saving for the last purchaser who's willing to pay for it right which is the eventual holder so all these people who are trading hands to get to the eventual holders they're all willing to pay less along the along the chain until they find the eventual holder if you just say no royalties then the first person who buys is willing to pay more so if you value creators I don't know why you would say isn't it terrible that they have a high mid price like that rule ruins the value of nfts I thought we just said that creators are valuable and that we should be willing to pay them what they're worth yeah but hey but you don't know what it I like I just every time you talk uh your perspective is always from the side of the buyer like you know the way you framed it like oh nfts enable you to buy something from people you value you know you talked about it as a tax rather than you know income like like just every single time you're thinking about this you always think about it from the side of the Speculator or the buyers and never from the side of the craters okay so that's a great point so you so you brought this up earlier you said I don't value like basically our side me Joshua we don't value creators and that if we really value create I don't think I said that at least not yeah I I wrote it I wrote it down I wrote it down I wrote it I said you're undervaluing the creators if we're not Creator friendly enough then the creators are going to go elsewhere uh oh the short term okay yeah I I was saying that that was not sure yeah okay right right um so I I look I understand your point right I I do think creators are obviously super valuable nfts were not built around creators they were built around speculators that's why all these people are here they're all here because they want to make money people don't come into nfts For the Love of the Game I mean some people do obviously but most people who are here who are creating are here because they want to make money but I don't think nfts were created for speculators they were definitely billed as being something that could solve problems for creators that was definitely the billing it wasn't I mean the reason why so many creators are here is because they know there's a lot of Rich crypto people who are spending a lot of money on nfts and that the the the idea of you know hey we need to appease the creators because if we don't they're going to go elsewhere like to me I think it's very simple if there are buyers creators will come and sell to those buyers now the market structure of that depends on like the really specific details about how this thing is enforced whether it's enforced if they're going to be a small number of companies that can just you know do these handshakes and decide you know what we're all going to force royalties and anyone who doesn't we're going to freeze them out right there are there are ways to to potentially enforce something that's not enforceable on chain but at the end of the day creators will come if there's a market for them to sell to I I don't think you should be thinking about this in terms of you know creators want this and if we don't have this they're going to go away I I would be very very surprised and I'd be willing to make a bet on you bet with you on this do you think that after royalties go away that creators are going to go away as long as nft prices I do I do because the lesson of social networks and social platforms over the last decade has been that the demand side the audience side the fan side follows the creators to wherever the creators decide to go like the entire content ecosystem is led by creators fans just go to wherever the creators are and so I don't think we've seen that in FTS though I think in nfts what we see is that there's a small number of like there's not a small number there's a medium-sized number of nft Die Hard like you know very very wealthy collectors who trade with each other a lot and signal with each other a lot on on Twitter and on these different spaces and they're the ones buying most of the nfts there's a group of like a hundred thousand people and they're not being brought in by Snoop Dogg they're not being brought in by you know whatever random new person that comes in they are the they are like when when I talk to a lot of creators we're like man I should really get into nfts it's because there's all these crypto people who want to buy them not because my audience wants to come with me and start buying nfts yeah and I I don't know just you know what I I would challenge you to do is I would challenge you to interview a lot of creators about their finances and about like how you know what their financial problems are and what their problems are like working with you know the different intermediaries that help get their work out into the world both in the traditional world and um and you know we could you could ask them about nfts too but there's just like a lot of like sometimes when you talk I'm like wait like if you know kind of an actual person who does this stuff like this doesn't it just doesn't make sense for them like this thing about holding back some of the work to resell later especially for me when I was younger like a lot of creators when they're younger like you are literally like either going into debt uh which I did multiple times or you just you don't know how to pay your bills because like it takes you a long time to produce one thing and maybe you get like a couple hundred bucks from it like you know it's not enough to like pay your bills and like you you know it's like that thing that Lee was saying about like just having kind of a revenue stream like when you're a Creator like you have to put in the time to like create the thing and it takes a long time and then whatever amount of money you get from it which when you're young isn't going to be a lot like that is supposed to somehow pay off all your debt or whatever like it doesn't work and so um there's no like they can't afford to hold back their work and you know when I solicited Arguments for this debate somebody wrote me and said oh I'm a musician and actually sometimes I you know make a song and I don't begin to see like real Financial rewards from it first until like seven years later and um you know so they'll like put in all that time and then like maybe they're lucky seven years down the line it becomes valuable so like just it's just a lot of what you say like I just feel like it doesn't really work financially for them I feel like if we if nfts aren't offering this extra bonus that the web 2 platforms don't then yeah I don't see more of them coming here it's just kind of like why would they and I don't think a lot of them are like oh I'm going to sell to Rich crypto people they don't think about it they think I want to make my work and I want to get paid they don't think I want to sell it to Rich crypto people I've never heard a Creator say that Laura I think the well so I'll share some data that we have that we crunched it on the magic inside the the 50th percentile Creator so just the average creator makes eight percent from royalties eight percent okay but a typical Creator eight percent is really significant that's yeah like one month's rent sure but yeah for sure but to haseeb's point it's 92 like a very very large majority is coming from the primary anyway so I think there's no deter I believe that there isn't going to be that much of a long term there may be a short-term deterrent right because I think generally yeah it takes time to adapt to different things that are happening from a market structure standpoint and a different way of thinking about monetization that's going to take a long time anyway for the nfts because we're still so early in in a general sense but there is still a large opportunity to come and monetize much more effectively through a primary dropping entities than the next best most viable alternative right that's still that that thing is still true and then whether or not there's an extra 10 you can collect over royalties over the next 12 months 24 months however long that is uh I I do think that there's going to be way more ways to do that not just through royalties the the second thing I'll just say on the royalty side is that they're not going away right royalties are not going away it's just it's optional at least for us optional on the buy side which means that if there's enough reason to do so and if buyers feel compelled and creators feel like hey there is a bunch of really cool stuff that you get from being part of this community then I I do believe that people will pay that and it just sort of feel it felt very distorted over the last six months because over the bull market royalties went to 10 12 15 percent whereas even for the ayc when they first got going it was two percent two and a half percent so there's a question of like what is a a a a a level of royalty that is you know generally accepted right I actually do think that some some minimum royalty whether it's a few percent is probably fine it's probably reasonable I think most people would pay that to be honest but when you're talking a difference of 15 and 2 I think that that's really really significant for the buyer yeah I want to hone in on I think a sort of unspoken thing in this debate which I think is that we are speaking about the nft market today versus the nft market in the future so to haseeb's point I do acknowledge that I think a lot of the nft market today is extremely financially driven it's people flipping selling for profit treating it as a financial instrument as a new asset class and just wanting to make money no matter how no matter what the collection is and in that context I understand the incentive on the buyer's side to want to strip out any part of the take rate as possible in order to maximize profits my argument that is Creator Centric and collector-centric I think is necessary for nfts to expand beyond that current market which I believe is Niche and going to remain small in the future so for nfts to become pervasive for them to become a ecosystem that every Creator in the world wants to participate in I think there needs to be Creator royalties because I think that is the most Creator friendly way that this technology has Mass Appeal to the most to the greatest number of creators out there if we just continue treating nfts as a new Financial Market a new thing to flip I just don't think that that has mass appeal to consumers or creators and thus like is going to limit the market potential of nfts so I want to I want to get back to this point that Laura made of that okay well if I'm sort of that making an argument that's anti-royalty is basically saying that I don't care about the plight of creators or I don't care about people who don't have enough money to make rent okay like if somebody can't make their rent my heart goes out to them like that sucks and I know what that's like I've also been there that being said like royalties are not the way in which we're going to figure out how to make rent um like you know to Joshua's Point royalties have become very small they become a very small part of how people make money from nfts and if anything they're they're trending smaller right like he's averaging out that data from the time that they've been in operation we're now in a bear Market royalties have gone down and at the end of the day um the other thing of course as I was mentioning earlier is that when royalties go down primary is going to increase in value and so there's a very good chance that that eight percent gets made up in the increased value you make through primary right now as as a Creator if you can't hold back your uh your some of your collection and say look I can't I I just can't afford to hold something back and like make a bet on myself because I just have to make rent like that sucks that's a terrible situation to be in as a Creator you should basically have the right to be able to do that right imagine that we had your royalties and we tokenized them and we said okay now you have tokenized royalties right the royalty stream to you is actually in token form well if you're a Creator you probably sell that too because you're like I need to make rent and so you'd sell off the right to your royalties and say well you know where am I now like look we haven't done that yet nobody has tokenized their royalties but if they did I would guarantee you a lot of people who have very short-term needs would be selling off their royalties to another third party in which case you end up in the exact same place as you would with like at the end of the day somebody who has very low time preference who can't afford to make a bet on themselves is not going to make a bet on themselves but I I I think in the long run these things are not that different from each other we had it today that basically people don't do this people don't tokenize their royalties they try to tokenize other kinds of royalties but they don't tokenize on chain royalties with enough time if royalties were enforced and they were enshrined eventually they would and you would see that happen too so you can't force somebody to take a bet on themselves if they don't want to whether or not whether it's with royalties or whether it's some other mechanism if they don't want to if they want to sell off their ownership in order to get paid today there's no Market mechanism that can stop them and so the other the other side of this is that like uh go ahead Laura I'm just laughing because again I I feel like um it's this like oh well too bad we can't do anything about that attitude whereas I like I said I would want to see from you like oh hey I hear about this problem why you know maybe I should try to look for an entrepreneur who could solve it like maybe there's a business here that's what I'd rather well maybe there is and I think this is one thing Kyle actually put out a good tweet storm earlier today about yeah yeah let's talk about that yeah yeah so so Kyle suggested that like look okay let's say that the large platforms are moving away from enforcing royalties right obviously open C still is but you know that's the last Domino to fall if all the large platforms move away from this then what's the what's the new equilibrium well his claim is that well you could have these virtualized platforms which actually I mean Joshua knows as well because that was kind of what magic Eden was doing a lot in the early days basically say they're like look uh what if Board of Yacht Club has their own Marketplace and they compete it's kind of like Shopify versus Amazon right like you sort of have your own Marketplace and you compete with the Amazon everything store you say no no you should buy on my Marketplace because it's branded it's more Community you get perks whatever but when you do it on my Marketplace you pay me royalties right and really royalties are really just a platform fee if it's your own marketplace right it's not even royalty anymore it's just if you trade on my platform I take the full fee instead of open C taking the fee these things are isomorphic right it's not we think about it as a royalty it sounds like some special magical thing it's just saying I'm bundling this with a platform fee and if you're running your own platform then you get to have your own platform fee right you can take the fee instead of magic eating or instead of openc taking the fee and this seems like a good equilibrium if you can convince people this is the best place to buy and sell my asset you want to buy and sell it from me and there's extra perks there's extra upside there's extra whatever or just it feels better to buy it from me rather than to buy it from this third-party Marketplace um then kudos to you that's how the market works is that people innovate people have to be entrepreneurial if they want to capture more value but if people if magic Eden or openc are doing a better job at captivating your community than you are then maybe maybe it is right that they should get the fee yeah I mean I liked Kyle's um tweet thread which by the way I'll just um give some Exposition for people but essentially he was saying that um you know the bigger some of these collections can get the more that they can kind of control how they're sold and like really build the marketplace into the community and actually the way that I read it was that you know that could end up being the only marketplace where those nfts are sold there's probably not a way to enforce that yeah that would then encourage on the kind of the whole centralization permissionless thing that we were talking about before exactly so you could theoretically do that yeah I think there really just needs to be Innovation at the standards level to make it possible to enforce royalties as part of the contract itself and I know that there's various ethereum Improvement proposals to do that I think that is the viable path forward not appealing to Goodwill or this you know sort of moralistic argument to support creators which I agree is insufficient I think we need to appeal to just like code and standards um as well as the collector incentives and then I think moving forward um looking into the future tying back to something that I mentioned before which is like all this has roots in what creators need which is that they need recurring Revenue I think there can also be innovation in terms of new Creator business models to make it possible for them to earn on a recurring basis mapping to what their real world needs are that extends Beyond royalties as well so perhaps there's areas where we can innovate in terms of providing other types of products or services that they could sell or new types of business models that that do provide that recurring source of Revenue can you talk more about the token standards because actually I feel like I feel like this came up when haseeb and I were talking last time where I said why don't we create a new token standard that does enable this and he made me feel like this was completely not possible um but I made you yeah yeah but yeah like now that I hear this I'm like oh so it is possible to create a new like nft token standard I don't think it is yeah there are two there are two eips um one is 2891 the other is four nine one zero that both pertain to enforcing royalties as part of the smart contract um I don't know if there's much traction I haven't looked into it super deeply I do acknowledge that I think it is really difficult to innovate on standards ones they have taken root and become really popular this was the subject of a recent newsletter issue that I put out on my sub stack called the token Innovation Paradox about how tokens not standards in general technology standards in general at first actually help to catalyze Innovation because they give they give the ecosystem something to Rally around something to adhere to but ultimately once they do gain adoption it becomes really difficult to actually innovate on them because everyone now conforms to the existing standard and has you know you have to solve like a chicken and egg problem to get everyone to move to a new standard but yeah I mean this this is an active discussion that is definitely underway I think there's a hard and possibility result here like I think if you want turning completeness you want enforcement of royalties and you want uh decentralization so no like surveillance State no like complicated apparatus that does Market surveillance for every single trade and tries to figure out who is selling to what whom and how did it work if you want all three of those things you're screwed like you at the end of the day as long as you can do anything as long as you have full Turn completeness full programmability right there's no way to prove that a transfer is not a sale there's no way to prove that and then second is that even if the the nft token contract itself has some way of saying this is the cell function or this is like the transfer function and so if you do this then you have to put in tokens on this side and you have to you know and then it transfers the ownership um you can always just you can always just fake it right you can always say okay well I'm gonna sell this for zero but then actually there's a broader smart contract that sells it for a thousand and then I don't pay the tax or for a transfer right like for a transfer you don't even know if if some somebody else is getting paid on the other side of that transfer so there's no way in principle I mean we we saw this a long time ago with tokens long time ago people try to do this with tokens erc20s right and say every time that you trade in your C20 you pay a tax okay well what happens when you transfer it from one wallet to your multi-sake what happens when you transfer it from one address to your own address and you're just rebalancing as an exchange well then you have to pay the tax and that just breaks everything like that it doesn't work unless you live in a world like fortnite where basically you know that it's one account one person and anytime that you're sending from one person to another you can basically track whether or not money moved unless you have that simple of a model of what people do and who they are um there's no way that you can enforce royalties in that way like there's always a way around it judgment I don't know you're you you're closer to this than I am I'm just like an armchair spectator like honestly we we were thinking about doing this like a month ago and we've been putting it off because we wanted to explore every possible technical option right and to his heaps point that trilemma is a real thing and that's why I think in the short term The Innovation that I expect to see is more around like uh creators employing and this could be in conjunction with marketplaces like carrots and sticks right basically sticks to say you do not get the stuff if you don't pay the royalty and carrots to say like hey these this is these are some some incentives or reasons why or or things that promote that behavior because anything at the and there's already Solutions on the Solana side that effectively allow like uh wrapping of tokens and freeze authorities um but that again it not only breaks the standards from like a adoption standpoint so it kind of fragments the standard layer but it also then introduces additional centralization and that to be fair that may be something that some creators want and I think as a Marketplace we should also adopt those standards right and we can eventually have you know as a Marketplace application at the app layer we can talk to basically two different contracts and say like if you want the royalty respecting thing that's more centralized sweet we will honor that if you want the normal one on like the current standard that is optional that's fine too I don't think we eventually want to be in the business of you know basically saying like hey Creator you have to go one way or another but I do think that today it's it's very very difficult to actually it's not possible to enforce everything on the current standard you guys made that tool I forget I forget the name of it that was like sort of the market surveillance thing yeah yeah I was just gonna explain this like about a month ago when we were thinking about all this stuff we actually created a tool for creators called metashield and we got you know 10 creators uh some of the largest collections in Solana to get behind it you know we'd plan all this up in the background basically what the tool did was allow creators to identify which nfts and addresses were not respecting royalties on the on the marketplaces that were optional royalty and then it allowed them to basically update metadata on The Entity because on Solana I don't know if people generally know this but the majority of entities on Solana are mutable right so you can change um bits of the metadata uh the Creator can at any point in time right the Creator can update metadata anytime so did they degrade those nfts Yeah so basically this tool allowed people to blur you know the images right if they did not respect royalties and yeah we we this is what happens Laura this is what happens yeah so we we built this with another Marketplace Coral Cube um who who now we actually ended up they ended up joining our team uh just recently but we built this and put this out there and the general reaction was like oh my God entities on Solana immutable that's crazy I can't believe that's a thing and then number two was um how did how dare you know you've educated or you you know the you know the Creator uh Tinker with you know my image that I own right so I think by my learning from that was that the the underlying foundational mechanic there around identifying which nfts were royalty respecting and not respecting that is solid and I think we I expect to see a lot more just little tools spring up that effectively repurpose that part of um of that product but the the additional step of the marketplace being involved in whether or not something is being changed or being blurred or whatever the outcome is is is not something that actually the marketplace in my view should have a say on right that should be a create a decision on how they want to enforce that stick but I do believe that today that is the probably the easiest most adoptable version of royalty protection that creators will have today yeah I mean we built that it put it out there it's open source if people want to use it they should go and use it I think we don't have a view on it but I think uh it was probably too severe of a solution for a Marketplace to introduce at the time but we went that just to give you guys a sense we were thinking about this a long time ago and we wanted to avoid the scenario of magic even going to optional royalties we really wanted to avoid it we explored every possible technical social contract like any kind of part possible uh but I just ultimately feel like to my earlier point and to haseeb's point this is inevitable and over time we would either be having this chat today or we'd have it six months from now it doesn't matter it's going to happen and we obviously consider the trade-offs and obviously knew this was going to be a ton of fun for us to take But ultimately the reason we did it was because I I would say I would say it's criticism not fud but anyway sure yeah criticism for sure I definitely we definitely have a lot of criticism but what is happening now is that at least everyone in the ecosystem is coming to the table to talk about what are the best ways to actually grow the energy ecosystem and I think that's actually very very important um this was an elephant in the room otherwise and wait so what is the reaction from creators now that you've said this that announced this yeah it's it's quite varied which I think that's why the Nuance of this chat is important here like for certain types of creators um they didn't really feel like anything really changed so for example we serve a lot of games on Magic Eden right we've launched maybe 50 60 gaming projects and um for the most part A lot of them have different revenue streams a lot of them are in the business of building a game right development wise and like royalties were only basically a small part of what they would ultimately make money from so this doesn't really change any of their roadmap I think some of the larger pfp collections um also feel like there's ways for them to basically now invest in diversify you know build other ways of monetization I think smaller creators may not have those resources to do it right so I think for them it becomes what is it's a different strategy to approaching nfts now and I think we talked about this it's like thinking about how to maximize on the primary instead of relying on some secondary and then there's obviously a large category of of ought one of one that kind of stuff that yeah generally I'm I'm absolutely more like empathetic and um supportive of royalties for for them because it's a different type of nft or different type of Creator uh and that's why I think the broad brush Strokes of like oh Emmy is is anti-royalty it's actually not not true at all I think we are generally very very Pro like whatever the best way is to for different creators to make money and to support themselves I think it varies depending on the type of entity I I think it's very complicated yeah I was gonna say I feel like this policy is definitely going to be the worst for kind of like more of the those higher end creators whereas like the lower end Mass Market ones like I feel like it's not going to be as big of a deal for them um because they can just make like yeah 10 000 whatever and you know make a lot of money from that um but yeah kind of more of like a yeah just like an artist artist uh is gonna have a a lot harder of a time with this I think it's also one thing that I'll just throw into the mix here I agree with a lot of what Josh and just said um I think it's also interesting to note that what we've seen in the market is that a lot of times buyers actually do want to pay royalties like when x2y2 um made the change to being optional royalty instead of actually settling at zero percent royalties paid to creators instead I think the historical average has been one and a half percent so buyers are actually paying more than they actually need to in order to pay Creator royalties and so I think culturally culture is another variable in here that we can use run X to Y2 I thought actually why too they let the holders set the royalty rate yeah there's two there's two mechanisms on x2y2 it's um it's one it's paid on the buy side so similar to Magic Eden and the two is they let holders um eventually you have a governance vote at certain time cadences or epochs and say like hey I can't remember a time period maybe it's a week this week holders have voted to to turn on optional royalties or this week holders have voted to to not have optional royalties and then that basically decides what the royalty model is on that collection yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so I mean look there's a lot of experimentation now right people are trying different models I I do think at the end of the day like look any if you are a student of History even just in blockchains I think it's very easy to tell where this is going right which is going to be that um creators are going to have to find enforceable ways to monetize like if it's not enforceable in the long run it's going to get forked out and that's basically what you're seeing is happening now like at the end of the day like okay there's thinking from the from the perspective of a Creator I think from the perspective of hey wouldn't it be better for the world if creators were aligned if they were able to capture more of the value they create like there are a lot of good reasons to like royalties at the end of the day all the stuff is built on blockchain technology and the the technology is poking out from under now like that's what's happening it's peering through the the surface that we thought oh nfts are this like magical thing that do all these wonderful things and align incentives and now the technology is poking through and say hey not so fast actually you guys didn't do what you thought you did you didn't make this enforceable unchain you didn't make it that the code enforces this stuff and in fact it's impossible to do so and unless you actually solve the problem unless you actually solve the incentive alignment in a deep way it's going to fall back to the the the natural thing which is that competition is going to be the primary force that affects the way nfts are bought and sold so like look to Laura to your point like I would love to see people who innovate on more models and I think we're seeing that happen we're seeing more people come up with different ideas about how to think about royalties how creators can monetize um there are a lot of people working on fractionalization which again I do think is potentially part of the answer for how you you might monetize one-on-one collections I mean look it's complicated the nice thing about royalty is to to Lee's point is that religions are really simple really simple to understand really simple story everyone loves that story um but the story was like the story is is not going to just magically enforce itself unless everybody just shakes hands and all agrees yes we're all going to do royalties forever and we've already seen that's not going to happen you know obviously there was a time when music was like seriously pirated by you know tons of people and then now everybody pays for it right well but I mean is it like maybe I'm just yeah under streaming I think there's less piracy well yes yes in in the US but you know BitTorrent is still one of the largest sources of Uplink in the world like lots of people still pirate stuff just not in the first world so much okay but I think you know still uh most of us probably have seen either a shift on our own behavior or people we know from stealing music to paying for the music right so um you know hasi when you keep talking about how these uh royalties have been enforced by Norms previously and um since it's not possible to enforce by the technology that's why this Norm is going to go away like I just wonder well why why isn't it that you know music um streaming that became a norm as opposed to piracy so like why why isn't there a norm in this direction you know in what is the morally are you arguing that you think that the idea of streaming rather than downloading was a norm that users decided you know what we're going to all agree to stop pirating and do the right thing by streaming instead is that what you're claiming um I mean I don't know if I'd phrase it that way so much as just like a lot of people change their behavior and stopped pirating and instead started streaming and they're paying for money so art for music yeah so I think Daniel lack the CEO of Spotify explains this very well because he actually originally before he started Spotify he ran a Bitcoin company uh called uTorrent which was like literally one of the best guitar clients way back in the day um and then he ran Spotify and he had this idea that the problem with torrenting is not that users like really hate artists and they want to punish artists and they want to do all these terrible things the real thing is that users are lazy and they don't want to think about this stuff they don't when they're sitting around clicking on okay I want to buy this nft they're not like they don't want to sit around and think oh you know this artist can be able to make the rent they just want to buy the nft when somebody's going around clicking on Spotify they don't sit around thinking oh how much of a royalty is the artist getting am I hurting them by downloading this thing or not interesting to the patreon they just want to listen to the song and so if you just make a better experience people will use it and that's that was the vision behind Spotify is that you don't need to make this big moralistic argument you don't need to get the riaa to sue teenagers in order to get people to stop downloading music just make a better experience and people will come and that was the genesifying Spotify I think it's exactly the kernel of what I'm talking about is that like the way that creators win in the long run is by creating experiences that work if royalties don't work then fine kill royalties find the next thing but it's not going to be by saying like look you guys are bad and evil because you're not paying royalties like that that's not going to get you anywhere and if you look at the history of Technology that's never how these things have advanced yeah I still think though that um when you get rid of royalties then it does change change the incentives for creators and so even if um buyers don't like necessarily see up front some kind of uh degradation that over time that's really that's actually what's going to happen um but it's like something where it's too separated from from like their economic activity so they're they're not going to realize that that's the cause of that sure that's fair okay well I want to give JoJo the last word since you were kind of the man of the hour with everything happening with magic Eden um so do you wanna do you want to give us a nice little wrap up with a bow on this whole discussion The Peacemaker also yeah we shouldn't have an end on me or hasi because then it'll be first pretty much yeah I apologize for how much I've been monopolizing yeah I mean my our view is that um yeah again let's not have a super extreme you know two ends of the spectrum kind of discussion going forward I think that's the thing that we are trying our best to to kind of change that narrative a little bit because we are absolutely procreator we we like royalties as a business model they're just not enforceable today so that's just the reality and are there ways to encourage people to pay royalties yes uh do we want that to happen yes do we think that that could still be a viable business model in the future yes I'd encourage you know any creators who are willing to actually try out um new things to either try and protect or try new business models just give us a shout because even though even when we went to this model of optional royalties we had plans to basically launch projects with uh 20 plus collections in the next month and the vast majority of them still want to work with magic even and find ways to build the longevity of their project right and we want we are in that business too and we that that's a commitment that I think we have that we can absolutely say is true today but I'm glad this opens up this conversation to be honest it was bound to happen sooner rather than later and at this point we have always prided ourselves to be pro-innovation and trying things out and building in the public this is the rarest form of that and yes we got a lot of criticism and and lots of different perspectives but I'm excited for the future I think I'm as bullish on nfts as I ever have been and wait I am so curious I know you have like practically no data points but since you made that so did this take effect immediately uh yeah this this happened on Friday okay so in like the last day and a half since it kicked in what percentage of trades paid a royalty uh I don't have the data oh okay I'm so curious yeah because like we'll have to do a follow-up conversation yeah yeah that's right I'll tweet I'll tweet it yeah yes please do because the optional bit makes me think like it's probably not really gonna happen because like um you know I wrote uh about like the Dao incident in my book and like one of the things that always struck out at me or stuck out at me was that these people like that the white hat group that just like kind of gave over their lives basically to try to rescue all the money for all the different Dow token holders they I mean they were working like 14 16 hour days for like a few months and it just really was like super stressful for them like they there was so much Intrigue and weird stuff going on that some of them were like you know they had all these legal threats I mean it was like a big super super stressful time for them and at the end of it uh when they created the contracts where you could get your refund there was an optional donation and they ended up making like 500 bucks each basically for their like months of kind of like sacrificing just like their whole entire lives over to doing this for people and that was all I made and it's like just kind of sad and I don't know uh so that's why I'm like I feel like the optional thing is not gonna be lucrative for people but anyway I think we should Circle back in a week and check the data because I'm actually more optimistic that yeah hopefully buyers will want to pay it seems like from for me he's like I'm gonna go all in on Magic Eden I'm not paying spoiled yeah I I think I'm on the low I'm on the lower side I have very low confidence in humans but generally that's a dispositional thing I actually hear Steve and Joshi and I have a question for you and it's something that I actually don't really know the answer to so I know that my argument in the beginning was more moralistic as you guys called it do you guys think that creators do deserve royalties but just like it's impossible so it's like not worth going there is that your position or is it that like they don't even deserve them I I don't like the concept of deserve I think royalties are a better way to align incentives but I don't think they're enforceable and if you can enforce them then great but you can't enforce them yeah exactly I agree so I don't really know what your answer is but no I mean I like the concept really who do dude creators deserve well like what's the royalty right like yeah like meaning right what's the Velocity in the market like what was the primary price like I think all these things I don't know what let's give that example of the musician where they made this song and then it wasn't until seven years after they produced it that actually finally it kind of was making money for them so obviously at the time they initially released it they only made x amount and so do you feel that once it became valuable and people were interested in it that they shouldn't share in that in this uh Financial value of that song in the future do you think that they should or I mean look there's a we have a really strong intuition around fairness that like somebody who like later becomes discovered is being great should be able to make some money from that and kind of like it's very much the American Spirit right like if you if you end up becoming successful you should get you should get paid you should get your payday um now that is not what most people who have royalties are like most people who have royalties are not somebody who gets discovered five years later and like their nft collection takes off most people it's just like they're getting you know I don't know 50 100 bucks a month and it's not a material amount of money especially compared to their primary where they made you know tens of thousands or even maybe a hundred thousand dollars um like to Joshua's Point that's what the math looks like and it's gonna it's trending more in that direction right but for the people who would fit in that category yeah I think for people who would fit in that kind of like that sucks like that's such a that it's so disappointing like it's like a Herman Melville type person right who like was undiscovered and kind of ignored in their time and later becomes like a Great Hero to many people like it pulls out of heartstrings to hear those kinds of stories but I don't think you can make decisions about an entire Market structure by appealing to really sympathetic stories and saying but isn't it so awful for that person who got royalty seven years later like we should have loyalties okay okay you're just a lost cause um I mean because you can try you can try but like it's I'm we're telling you it's not gonna work like you need to come up with something else so the last story that I want to leave you with is that um one other story that came up in my research was that there was this artist who worked uh hard to you know ensure that there were royalties included in secondary sales of nfts I think his name is Matt Kane and he told me that like when he kind of initially tweeted about his campaign that a 70 year old artist who's like pretty famous uh messaged him and said oh my gosh like this would have been a game changer for me you know I'm in my 70s and um when I produce work I'm competing against stuff I created when I was like 20 30 40 50 60 that now goes for like millions and I don't I obviously didn't he you know didn't sell it for those Millions but now other peop the collectors are making those millions and um he has to keep working because he doesn't have enough money to just sit back and rest on his success because other people are making that money from his quote unquote success well he doesn't actually have the financial uh rewards from that success and so he actually has to keep producing in order to like make the money but you know like I said like just anyway so the point is that um again I just feel like there's a problem here it can be resolved somehow and I I it just surprises me that um yeah you're you're like so realistic to the point of just being like it just you know it's gonna happen too bad and I'm a little bit like no no no we should really really work to you know use this technology for but whatever anyway yeah look at the Lord I I I I I I could tell the thrust of this is that like okay I'm heartless and you care about the plight of creators and I don't um I mean look I I I I just don't think that like royalties are your answer like royalties if they worked then amazing they would be your answer but they're not your answer like they don't yes it'd be wonderful if we had this beautiful little mechanism that solved all those problems and dried all those tears but that we don't have that so we can't just sit around wishing that it existed if it doesn't like I agree with you I wish there was a better way to align incentives for creators who later become discovered even if they're you know they you know whatever the the idea of a of an elder artist who's competing against himself in his 20s that is a heartbreaking story like that sucks and yes I can imagine with that I think a possible outcome that reconciles all of our views is that the market basically bifurcates and it bifurcates into like speculative flippers and just like kind of thousands of pfp collections that get traded for very no royalties um and then on the opposite side of the spectrum there's like the Fine Art visual are like more independent Creator type of Premium Creations for which the buyers are a like more intrinsically motivated to support the Creator and be less price sensitive because there is a collectibility aspect what they're purchasing and in that latter Market I think royalties are still going to continue to be a prevalent part of that market so I I think that's a that's like an outcome that I see probably happening and my bet is on the latter side growing and becoming bigger and that being what attracts more consumer users into web 3 in in the first place um but I do think like both outcomes will happen in tandem you know what I think I agree with that I agree with that yeah it's pretty reasonable yeah I think it's very likely that um because in smaller communities you can police this stuff right like that like you know I I gave a lot of criticism to Magic Eden for uh what was it called meta medicine Shield um yeah I I on this show we were we were criticizing magic eating because I thought like look this is not the answer is to create this like Market surveillance thing and like we're talking about what what is realistic creators to do creators like monitoring every single send of their tokens like that's obviously not a realistic thing that the average musician is going to be able to do nor should they want to like that seems like an awful way to be spending your time like at the end of the day if you create a tight community of people who believe in you people who care about you people who want to reward you for what you're doing right like it becomes more like patronage and and less like a pure consumer transaction now in the larger scheme of the market most things are not patronage most things are just consumerism right most people are just buying stuff because they want to buy stuff like for Spotify somebody who's clicking a song on Spotify yes they are paying a very small royalty to the person they're streaming from but mostly it's a it's a uh it's a commodity right it's a consumer Behavior they're not building a relationship with the artist if you want to build a relationship with the artist if you want to join their nft Community then yes you you sell it you buy and sell in their Marketplace you opt into the royalty and you show other people that you are giving your patronage to that person the same way everybody else is I I think that that is a stable equilibrium but it's going to be it's not going to be every Marketplace enforces this for you you have to as an entrepreneur you have to as a Creator you have to figure out how to do that yourself how to cultivate the community where people want to do that for you oh wait I just had another idea I I thought I bet um if this gets bad enough that there could be entrepreneurial creators who decide to kind of band together and create their own Marketplace and um and do it in a way that you know honors royalties or whatever and then they would probably get a lot more of the really good creators on their platform than the other ones and so that could be and it could be like some kind of decentralized ownership where creators can like you know vote on whatever anyway so it would be a Marketplace that is more creator-centric that kind of caters to what they want and that you know as Lee and I have been saying like when you when you have that when you're you're the one offering the unique thing that isn't the same thing that everybody else offers like it just makes you so much more valuable so I could see a bunch of them Banning together maybe you know maybe I'll uh tweet about it I think that's possible definitely like if a new Marketplace or an existing Marketplace um starts to like enforce royalties and then becomes a magnet for creators then I think it starts to force everyone else's hand as well just like you've seen the proliferation of like create our funds platforms coming out with multi-billion dollar Creator funds to pay their top creators like I think the market ultimately is going to be Creator driven and do what is most Creator friendly because that is going to be the scarce side of the marketplace yeah I feel like they have leverage it's just that you know creators they want to create they don't necessarily always want to be entrepreneurs so we haven't seen it yet but I would I will look out for that in the future and if any creators making such a thing want you know to pitch me about their project I'd be interested in learning more and featuring it on my show very cool very cool this conversation doesn't end here it continues on Twitter and in the metaverse so but I want to thank uh all of you for coming up and showing up for this pseudo debate I think we got a little bit of uh convergence in the end which is which is good but not intended um but uh until until next time and hopefully Joe should we can get some of the data that you promised us and let's see how this experiment plays out yes all right thanks everybody thank you bye bye [Music]
