legal advice my guest today is Nidal Hollander founder of Dharma protocol welcome to dothis thank you so much Laura it's good to be R what is Dharma protocol so Dharma is a protocol that enables borrowing and lending of crypto assets on block chains like aetherium so you can basically kind of think of it as this infrastructure layer that sits on top of the etherium blockchain that enables any internet-connected application to programmatically tap into a line of credit or a vehicle of savings in the form of crypto assets and so kind of our general goal here is to build the infrastructure today that in you know five years or so will power the financial services of the so-called open financial system so how does Dharma work walk me through an example of how someone might borrow money using the Dharma protocol so so there's a couple of things that are worth clarifying so first of all Dharma is a protocol and not an end user application in and of itself right so are our users aren't necessarily borrowers and lenders per se but more so application developers that kind of tap into our infrastructure and build the actual online store fronts for these experiences now if we're going to kind of walk through this from the the borrower perspective like what it was look like for them to tap into a line of credit that was originated via Dharma basically at least today the majority of volume on the protocol is sourced by what we call real layers so essentially like if you're going to have a debt agreement there's kind of two things that need to happen right on one hand you need some way of administering that debt agreement so you need some way of actually kind of tracking how many repayments have occurred of making sure repayments are sort of funneled to the correct beneficiary at any given time and then you also need some way of actually like essentially like bringing that debt agreement into fruition like somehow matching the borrower and lender finding a essentially a source of credit for that borrower and so in order to solve that latter problem we've introduced this concept called as essentially real layers which are these kind of like centralized actors that host some sort of order book online that you can kind of imagine is looking like a bulletin board where borrowers can essentially post requests for different types of loans and then if a creditor comes in and decides that they want to invest in one of those loans then that relayer is going to earn a fee essentially this might sound very familiar if you're familiar with the with a 0x protocol it is a highly analogous concept and basically the idea there is that anybody in the world can start one of these real layers you don't need permission from from Dharma Labs if Dharma Labs is to go like bankrupt tomorrow this mechanism could still function essentially yeah for listeners who have not heard my episode with will warn of 0x you should definitely go back and check that out because he did describe very similar concepts so what problems are you trying to solve like what problems in debt or lending can be resolved using this protocol rather than a centralized service so yeah I mean first of all I like a higher level I'd say that just in general if you've been in the blockchain industry for a while basically like there's always been this concept of quote-unquote banking the unbanked that's been very popular as a supposed use case for blockchains ie like building financial services that are fundamentally globally accessible and equitable and transparent etc realistically like that utopic vision of like you know we're gonna bank the two billion on baked you some crypto currencies like that's probably a little far right now but if you kind of start there and work like backwards in terms of the things that we need in order to enable that there's a lot of fundamental building blocks that need to be created this includes things like stable coins Akay tokens that are in some way a pegged to a stable fiat asset or this includes things like having like good derivative markets or good mechanisms for actually trading tokens and crucially one of those pieces is having a robust decentralized credit market because you know if if we zoom into the future and imagine one day that a you know a borrower in Ghana is on an application on their phone and they press a button and they're instantly able to access some sort of line of credit in the background that like application needs to somehow be able to tap into a decentralized credit market in order to actually source that liquidity and so essentially the problem that we're trying to solve is basically to fill that gap we're trying to basically build a both a decentralized manner of matching borrowers and lenders for credit liquidity and a decentralized manner of actually administering a loan throughout its lifecycle without having to have any sort of intermediary standing between the borrower in the lender and there are actually a lot of FinTech companies now that do this kind of thing you know maybe a lot of the ones I'm thinking of actually mainly serve the US markets but I do think there are ones that are maybe more international as well so why is it better to do this in a decentralized fashion rather than on some of these really big services like Lending Club or sofa or whatever it might be so I think it's crucial to to remember that like while the internet has kind of evolved in a manner where it's kind of it has no real conception of borders and is kind of like globally accessible you know with an asterisk there for like certain despotic countries it's not like if you're in Ghana or in Karnataka India or in you know name x-country it's not like you can go to Lending Club calm and take out a loan from that website right and and the reason for that is that while the internet doesn't necessarily have like robust concepts of borders the banking system which pretty much any sort of financial service today is heavily coupled to very much so has a concept of borders and very much so is kind of coupled to geographic locales and so that means that it's like it's it's not like if you're if you're a Lending Club and you're trying to expand operations it's not like it's trivially easy to turn the lights on on you know enabling support for like Ghana or something like that right because there's this like highly friction Laden bottleneck at the point of the actual banking infrastructure and so the argument that I would make is that with something like a decentralized credit market where there's no sort of centralized institution that needs to kind of stand as a cog in the middle there's so much less of a regulatory burden that needs to be undertaken by some sort of central party that's going to kind of bring together the world's credit markets because there is no central party right and it's kind of like it's kind of like imagining like what would the internet have looked like if like instead of being created on top of open standards it looked more like an AOL or instead it was kind of like this like closed network that you know people had to be permissioned onto and so I would argue that by having a decentralized network for actually sourcing credit liquidity you kind of it's almost like a regulatory arbitrage in some senses well in that regard if there are certain regulations around like who can lend to whom or under what conditions then could those be circumvented using this and so in that sense is this a way around those regulations like is this you know basically going to lead to illegal lending I don't necessarily think that that is the express purpose of it and I don't think that that's like what will represent the majority of what happens on this platform look in general when you're when you're touching crypto currencies the whole the whole idea of this asset class is that like with permissionless innovation a lot of use cases become a lot more user-friendly and a lot more globally accessible and that's great but permissionless innovation is very much like a double-edged sword and this is you know I'm sure you've been in this industry for a long time this is discussed and pretty much like every every use case that's ever been discussed and cryptocurrency has its dark side I feel like this is like a question that comes up in every one of my podcast yeah definitely and I think that's like it's something that that us as technologists in the space have to like wrestle with which is like what are the negative consequences of what we're building I would argue however that much like the Internet itself which had its terrorist chat rooms back in its heyday and back in its salad days rather and that was an easy way to write off you know a permissionless information networks capabilities I would argue that as a nice heuristic like empirically these things tend to turn out net positive and so I think that the amount of people that would benefit from being able to access a line of credit online who may not have previously been able to will outweigh the you know the drug dealers and traffickers who may be able to access credit when they were probably not unable to one thing I thought you might say there was that the underwriters and the real heirs themselves could kind of like impose those you know regulatory restrictions but but you but they actually can't is that they actually can right so I mean that's that's actually a very fair question so I think it's worth like taking a step back and perhaps like giving them much more like step-by-step overview of how the protocol works I think I gave a very glossy high-level explanation earlier so so maybe I'll dive into more of the nuts and bolts so essentially there are two different actors classes of actors in the protocol right there are what are called underwriters and real layers and so real ayres as I explained previously are essentially these centralized actors that that host orders from from borrowers and essentially match them with lenders in some capacity and earn fees for that now naturally the question that comes up is like okay like who like how am I supposed to know as a lender on this network that a borrower's credit worthy an address of letter numbers with no kind of prior history and so this is essentially where the concept of underwriters comes in underwriters are centralized actors that basically vouch for their belief of a borrower's likelihood of default so essentially a borrower is gonna come to them and the underwriter is gonna say I believe borrower X has a Y percent chance of defaulting of their loan and they're going to cryptographically attest to that and the idea is that similarly to the real ayres they could they would look like earn a fee essentially if that loan is filled so so taking a step back to your question yes that is correct as in like like the the real Ayres and underwriters if they were to have somehow facilitated you know a transaction let's just say to an oaf acts action individual like somebody who's like in Iran let's just say then yes they could face legal consequences to that and so so it's it's likely that they would have to implement some sort of check to make sure that doesn't happen but I think in the abstract like if we're talking about a network in which anybody can build a relay or anybody can build an underwriter that doesn't necessarily categorically mean that every relay and underwriter is going to be benevolent and compliant I find this to be kind of analogous to just like Bitcoin in general right it's like you can buy and sell a Bitcoin on many different exchanges those exchanges very much lie on a spectrum of how much they respect the sanctity of you know various money transmission and securities laws huge spectrum in a very very large spectrum right so I think that it's it's it's a similar sort of dynamic and our philosophy is that it's like these like like jurisdiction specific compliance protections don't necessarily belong at the core protocol layer and that it makes a lot more sense for those to be essentially enforced at the application layer instead let's go back to the underwriters how do Dharma underwriters assess potential borrowers credit worthiness is it just each has their own method of doing it or so yeah I mean we don't necessarily define now they're supposed to do it the whole the whole idea is that it's basically there's this marketplace for underwriters right and these underwriters are kind of like known centralized institutions and if they do a particularly good job of underwriting loans then that will be like markedly visible on chain right because you let's just say like I am considering making an investment in a loan that a certain underwriter has vouched for I can look up all loans that are associated with their address I can see the sort of predictions they had made as to the borrower's creditworthiness every single time and I can compute kind of a heuristic score of that underwriters like quote-unquote trustworthiness and so at the protocol layer we don't necessarily define like you know the underwriter has to pull a FICO score or they have to go and you know like I don't know like get a blood test done on like the borrower or you know use some crazy data points like you know these things like these things like completely undefined at the protocol layer because essentially the incentive mechanism is set up such that like underwriters buy whatever under like by whatever magic method if they're really good at their job they're gonna get more business and if they're really bad at their job they're gonna get less business and do you imagine that the underwriters will be like existing underwriters or new types of underwriters that that try to take advantage of this protocol so I think that's a really interesting question so I you know like I find it less likely that these will be kind of traditional debt underwriters and much more likely that these will be up start lending businesses particularly trying to underwrite classes of debt that don't really even exist in the real world right now and I'll give you a couple examples so there's there's a lot of like use cases for lending that are like highly specific to the cryptocurrency industry and wouldn't have made sense in a sentence like if you were to you know talk about them ten years ago so so one example is like there's this emerging class of crypto collectibles right the most notable example being crypto kitties but you know there's there's tons of these nowadays I think I think if you go on open sea which is an exchange for buying and selling these there's something like you know like a million different NF DS listed on there it's something crazy and so something that something that we're really interested in is like these these non fungible assets can become extremely valuable right and essentially with Dharma you can actually take a loan out against one of those assets so you could like almost in the same way that a mortgage is a a loan backed by a house like you can take like you know you're extremely rare crypto kitty that's worth a hundred thousand dollars and take out a line of credit against it now you know you might be wondering why I'm talking about this in the context of underwriters what's kind of funny about that is that if you're in an event if you're a creditor and you're thinking about investing in this kitty backed loan per se somebody needs to appraise the value of that crypto kitty right somebody needs to like come in and actually be able to like a sign like what would be the fair market value of the script okay t-today and insofar as that's the case like what is the likelihood that you know this lender would not be made whole if like the borrower defaults it and so and so I give that example because it's like you can imagine that an underwriter emerges that focus is essentially on appraising the value of digital collectible assets and personally I find those sort of niche classes of crypto native debt to be much more likely to emerge than for a kind of traditional underwriter of like you know unsecured personal loans or like you know credit card refinancing or what have you jumping into this market because like it's you know like the UX in the space is so difficult like all around right like it's like like like even just even interacting with the D app in any capacity requires you to like do crazy stuff like install meta masks and you know save your seed phrase and all this sort of stuff so we find it much more likely that the use cases that are going to be compelling in the short term are gonna be people who want to borrow crypto assets and are like comfortable interacting with the assets and so I think naturally as a result of that that means that the sorts of underwriters that will be attractive the network will will similarly be kind of crypto native what happens in that case where someone puts up a crypto kidney as collateral but then the value of the crypto Kitty falls what how does that work well it's interesting you say that so we were actually at the moment working on adding margin calling functionality to the network we're essentially like this is perhaps more relevant with like like fungible assets like with like say something like if you have ether up for collateral and you know you have like a regular spot price for that ether so so with a cryptorchid it's a little bit harder to say but but I can tell you that in the concept of that that if you're talking about a loan that is backed by a fungible asset essentially when the collateral drops below like a certain threshold than the the collateral becomes eligible for liquidation and so I guess you'd have to in in the crypto kitty example you'd have to get some sort of like rolling notion of like what the crypto Kitty's value is but that's kind of hard to do because it's a non fungible asset and not necessarily like something that you can pull a spot price on like either okay so what happens if a bone if a borrower defaults so this is very case-by-case right intentionally we've built the protocol to be like very flexible and on opinionated and so essentially you can kind of think of it as like there's like an open-source set of loan templates that people can use in the protocol and they define everything from like super simple unsecured loans to loans that are collateralized with some sort of non fungible token to loans that are you know very like very much oriented towards speculative use cases and are like you know intended for say like Schwartz and things like that and and essentially like the each of these classes of loans has their own sort of default deterrence mechanism associated with them so right now you know we've been live on maintenance and some around May the vast majority of volume in Dharma is represented by like loans that are overly collateralized by some other asset right so it'll be like I put up $100 of Dai and borrowed like $50 worth of ether against it and the the basic default deterrence mechanism there is that if I don't pay back my $50 worth of ether then my die is gonna get seized by the lender so it's very simple but there are classes of loans in which the the the penalties for defaulting it could be very different right like you could imagine that there would be an underwriter that essentially originated the borrower right they kind of the the borrower comes to their website applies for a loan the underwriter approves them kind of assigns a sort of score them and then in addition to actually you know taking their order and forwarding it off to a relay or in order to kind of complete the lending process they actually have the borrower sign like a meatspace lit like lending contract right like a a real legal contract that has some like real legal stipulations as to what might happen to them if they were to default on the loan and the underwriter has an incentive to do that because they are you know they're they're going to get compensated on the basis of how good of a job they're doing because if they you know if they underwrite a lot of good loans they're going to get more business right so so you know in short we've intentionally kind of left that portion undefined and instead try to define the incentives of the the protocol at large such that if you're underwriting an originating good debt then you're going to get compensated more by the market okay and to take a step back how are debts paid back so they're so this is actually kind of like one of the the beauties of the protocol is that in in the traditional financial system there's this construct of what are called paying agents right we're essentially like if a loan like let's just say you take out a mortgage that bank like now owns like that loan right they own the right to be repaid or to you know foreclose on your house and what tends to happen in the financial system is that they're gonna go and then you know sell that loan to some other bank and then that bank is gonna go and you know package that loan with a bunch of other loans and then take that package and sell it and so on and so forth and the problem is is that if you're the borrower like you this is totally unknown to you in the background and it's not like you know who like the end user is that actually is the the final beneficiary of your loan at any given time all you know is that you need to like you know pay back a certain you know through a certain portal on the bill that got sent to you in the mail and so the person who's taking that buck is a paying agent right they are a person that's whose job is to basically take the money and in you know by some way shape or form funnel it to it's correct beneficiary as stipulated in like various legal contracts now the way that Dharma works is that essentially we do away with the concept of there being any sort of individual that has to keep track of who owns a loan and instead we have a smart contract that administers the entire lifecycle of the loan so so you can imagine that in the Dharma example if Alice were to lend a hundred dollars to Bob and then Alice were to go off and sell her loan to you know Charlie Bob doesn't need to have any sort of knowledge of that if Bob wants to repay his loan he basically sends his money back to like the loan smart contract and the loan smart contract automatically routes it to whoever is supposed to be the given beneficiary at that time and so essentially you kind of get to add a lot of the efficiencies of essentially like cryptocurrency trading but to the world of debt capital markets and so basically the borrower needs to put the payments into whatever address it is that is part you know Delany and the smart contract to make those payments from and if they don't then it goes into the default mode and whatever happens in the default is determined by the underwriter not it's determined by the loan contract itself okay and that can sometimes be adjudicated by the underwriter but often it can be some sort of penalty that has nothing to do with like any sort of underwritten agreement right like the majority of the loans and Dharma today there is no underwriter even involved in them it's just a contract that holds the collateral and that if the borrower does not repay then the collateral will get seized okay and earlier you talked about serving these kind of like unbanked populations but you were mainly naming ones abroad or like can you just tell me all the populations you think that could be served by this protocol now that are not served by the traditional credit markets yeah super good question so I think I can answer this in like kind of like two tiers like one which is like more realistic like today use cases as in like you know not pie in the sky sci-fi sort of stuff and then like the kind of like five years out or ten years or whatever the whatever the time horizon is that we think it is that's realistic so so in in the long term I think like yes like there are you know something like two billion unbanked people in the world and all of them are rapidly coming online and though they can go onto Facebook calm and make a social networking account they can't necessarily go onto Lending Club and take out a loan so is I think like in the long term like these are the people that were really excited about there's a lot of credit markets in the world that have just like totally insane conditions that aren't even necessarily like third world countries per se that would benefit a lot from things like this for instance Brazil has some of the highest APRs in the world and you know is solidly like a developed country the very technology technology literate very modern but just because of just the way they like like socio-economic reality on the ground has developed like APRs they're just like totally insane now that's all like long term stuff and I think like it's you know it's it's fun to think of that sort of stuff but like realistically until crypto currencies are more scalable and easy to use that's like probably not what's going to happen I'd say in the short term the the people who we think most about are either people who are like very much on the margins of the current Western financial system or are people in the cryptocurrency industry specifically who for some reason need to access a line of credit so so in the latter category the kind of lion's share of it is basically people who are trying to ball and lend for speculative purposes right it's people who are essentially like I need to you know I I feel bearish about a certain token and I want to short it and so I'm going to borrow that token and then sell it and then purchase it back later and return it or it's people trying to get leverage on their assets in some capacity but I think that like that that category of crypto native use cases actually has a lot of facets debt that aren't necessarily speculative but that just kind of like solve problems that are niche to that actually crypto ecosystem right so I'll give you a certain example are you familiar with what plasma is yeah so so plasma is this this kind of framework for scalability on top of aetherium and essentially like the the way the concept works in like a really high level is that you take your tokens on the main chain you deposit them on to a plasma chain the plasma chain is you know presumably much more efficient and then once you want to go back to the main chain you need to like withdraw your coins out of it right the problem is is that for a whole bunch of different reasons when you're withdrawing those coins there's kind of like this like 7 to 14 day like thawing period at least in the current designs that they have for it and that's kind of a crappy UX if you're like you know a normal user of any application ever like the normal thinking system exactly and we're trying to build things that are better than the normal brain right and so I think there's like this is an example of somewhere where there's a really interesting use case for dead right because essentially if you had somebody that just fronted you the money you know like right off the bat and kind of what was able to like by the risk of that you know of you defaulting essentially because of you know XYZ technical reasons in the plasma specification then we can make UX like much much better right and so I like to list that as an example of like they're being crypto native use cases for borrowing and lending that aren't even like underserved now they're just entirely unserved right now because they like don't exist and they aren't even necessarily speculation related themselves now and before I forget I wanted to go into the kind of other category of what I view as being use cases that are viable in the short term which are like people who are kind of on the edges of financial system even in like the Western world today and this is like a really interesting category of people right so so one example would be like gray market businesses so for instance like if you are a marijuana dispensary right it's not necessarily you can go over to a Wells Fargo and take out a loan from them because they have you know a million-and-a-half diff compliance requirements that are going to forbid them from doing that and so I think it's really interesting to imagine a world in which the sort of like this emerging cannabis industry which is projected to be like bigger than the wine industry and is just growing at this like unbelievably rapid rate is able to access credit financing in a manner not unlike how people raise icos right now right and so I think a lot of use cases on on the kind of margins of the financial system like that are interesting as well interesting yeah I feel like every conversation I have is somewhat similar where people are saying like speculation is when use case and then sort of these kind of regulatory gray areas we're gonna discuss why Dharma doesn't have a token and how Nidal got into crypto but first I'd like to take a quick break for our

about all the things you can do at Durham and there were a couple things that you had written about or spoken about on podcast that interested me and I just want you to like briefly describe them yeah initial debt offerings or a token I staffs yeah trustless savings accounts and tokenize municipal bonds yeah definitely so okay what was the first one on there that organized yeah so something that some this is something or like pretty interested in we haven't seen anybody do it yet but basically it's like like the the ICO boom that happened in 2017 was almost entirely based around like selling tokens to the public that had like equity like properties to them right like you know people buy these things because they think they have like a certain chance of going to the moon or they're gonna go to 0 and what's kind of interesting is that in the real world like equity like assets are actually a much smaller of the global economy much smaller portion of the global economy than like debt right like I think like the beam you know I'm gonna pull these numbers out of my head right now and they might be a little bit inaccurate but I think like the global market cap of like equities is like somewhere around like 70 trillion whereas like the market cap of global debt assets is like 210 trillion or something like that and so it's kind of interesting to imagine of like what if we could take the ico model and apply it essentially to like debt fund raises right so essentially you could benefit from selling tokens that like plug natively into this kind of infrastructure for this global infrastructure for either custody or trading or you know building on applications on top of or whatever crypto assets and have them be debt assets like you know that look much like say a corporate bond would so so one use case that we're pretty excited about is just really like allowing companies of all shapes and sizes to be able to like raise debt from the general public in a way that has a very low kind of initial fixed cost to get set up and what about I I'm interested in these trustless savings accounts and they tokenized me municipal bonds as well oh yeah okay so so trust the savings accounts so again this is this this probably falls into the bit more sci-fi category but we're really excited to see somebody build this out essentially if you have once you have like a good decentralized credit market right and you have all these different like classes of debt that an application can kind of go in and source liquidity from you can imagine that we created a savings account that was entirely administered by a smart contract and so you could imagine like savers would put their funds into this smart contract and the smart contract would automatically invest in certain classes of loans of a certain risk threshold from the Dharma credit Network and so it's this really interesting concept where you're like you can imagine basically like banks existing that have no person at the helm of them and have no marketing budget and have no compliance budget and there's no person that's to like sit there in a suit and shake hands with you and so like a tremendous amount of inefficiency is kind of like shaved out of the system and so we're really excited about seeing that that concept come to fruition though I would argue that it's kind of like that's like that's like we're at step one right now that's like step five or six right yeah and the last one took a nice meanin tokenize municipal bonds yeah so I think this is a really interesting concept there's there's a lot of municipalities in the world who aren't necessarily so so sorry let me take a step back for a second municipalities raise debt all the time right like municipalities need to like build parks and they need to like invest in schools and they need to invest in like public infrastructure in different capacities and so they'll often go to an investment bank and have that investment bank help them issue a municipal bond and you know this is how some like the most like iconic infrastructure in the world was built and that's great and this system functions fantastically but it doesn't necessarily function equally well for everybody right like there are a lot of people a lot of municipalities particularly outside of the Western world that may not have access to the same friendly credit conditions that say a San Francisco might or you know in Oakland might or what have you and so it's interesting to imagine you know the concept that I kind of outlined earlier of like a business doing a debt ico taking that and kind of extrapolating it to the next step where you have a municipality or even a sovereign nation issuing debt on chain and selling it as a token so it's you know again this goes back to like the double edged sword conversation because like there's a lot of you Nyssa pala T's and sovereign nations that like rightfully so we don't want having access to the financial system right but I would make an argument that I think that if you open up this market more the benefits will outweigh the cons yeah that's been a theme in some recent podcasts because we've been talking about like what's been going on in Venezuela and stuff right right exactly yeah it's like what happens when I'm in this way like tries to like raise the bond on the blockchain right in addition to their petrol yeah yeah I'm speaking with an tom hollander founder of dharma protocol if drama protocol takes off how will that change the way people borrow and lend and what other impacts do you think it could have you know maybe on the size of the debt markets or anything else like that yeah so I really I pretty strongly feel that if Dharma is gonna actually kind of like you know if the rubbers are gonna if the rubber is really gonna meet the road and we're gonna have a lot of traction I I don't necessarily I find it less likely that that the use cases that will take off will be like the traditional sort of like use cases of debt that we imagine today right like I find it unlikely that like that the way people are taking out mortgages is going to like entirely shift on to Dharma's infrastructure in the next like five to ten years because at the end of the day like in in the Western world like credit markets function like pretty well like it's a pretty saturated market already right and so I think that if we are successful it's going to be in use cases that are initially very niche and are very specific to the crypto world and as that world expands and kind of bleeds its way into various aspects of people's day-to-day life then I think we're going to serve use cases and classes of debt that are really really hard to imagine right now but that make a lot of sense in that sort of crypto or digital native context and so it's kind of like you imagine like yeah like the the the borrowers who I gave you the example of like collateralizing a crypto kitty earlier right and a crypto kitty is a type of non fungible token another type of non fungible token is is you know like this there's this project called D central land where they they're basically like they basically sold like plots of virtual reality land on Shane which is this kind of kooky concept but if you kind of take that and you look at what one of those decentraland plots are like that is similarly a non fungible token right and so you can imagine like literally borrowing against that decentraland plot in order to finance like a you know virtual reality real estate development on top of it and then to sell you know tickets to people who want to like put on their headsets and like walk through it or something like that and so and so like I give that example because it's like it's like I view that as like a class of debt that makes like no sense in the current like real world but makes a lot of sense and they totally digitally native or crypto native context and I think that there will be many of those sorts of use cases things that it's that are very difficult for us to imagine right now and I would conjecture that that means that like in the future like the market cap of global debt will be much much larger because that will essentially kind of bleed its way into markets that it previously has not because we never really had the ability to like super cheaply spin up a debt assets and super deep cheaply raise debt for different use cases interesting you know what you just described it was like monopoly meets VR a couple of things I wanted to ask you about you know you talked about zero epsilon you talked about how the real Ayres idea is you know very similar to 0x I know also Dharma is built on aetherium what is the relationship between Dharma and thing Erikson etherium like could you switch to another blockchain how or how easy would it be to add other block chains and yeah yeah that's a fantastic question so so I'll answer first of all the question about 0x because I think I think there's kind of two answers here about like our relationship to something like a 0x versus our relationship to the etherium blockchain so 0x I would put them in a category of like a you know being a crypto financial primitive as in like sort of a basic primitive operation that is a building block for a whole lot of different types of financial instruments and eventually financial services and I would put us in a kind of a similar bucket in that like we're kind of like this building block of that will eventually be used likely alongside things like 0x or dydx or a set or you know there's a whole bevy of these different crypto financial primitive protocols in order to construct financial services that are globally accessible and fundamentally transparent so yeah so that's kind of how I describe our relationship these of these 0x as opposed with respect to the ethereum blockchain right now there's not really any other lecture in the game in terms of like like a blockchain that you could meaningfully build an application on top of that will likely change and we are not like dogmatically wedded to being like built on top of the ethereum blockchain it's just like extremely unclear what the multi blockchain future looks like and how like how these sort of meta protocols like 0x and Dharma will be structured in that multi blockchain future right because you can imagine on one side of the spectrum like that you know there will be many different block chains and that these block chains will kind of have a distribution like like operating systems right it's like it's like Android and iOS right and so like every application developer will make their Android app or their iOS app so if you know if you stretch that analogy to block chains you can imagine like every zero X or Dharma will have a deployment on Definity and have a deployment on aetherium and have one on tezo's and you know so that could be the way that it pans out but it could also be the case that these kind of entertain interoperability protocols really take off and the whole concept of individual blockchains is just so heavily abstracted away that it doesn't even necessarily matter that like you know that a 0 X or a Dharma basically sits a layer above that and operates across blockchains and there's not really any sort of concept of like what chain you're on at any given time because these interoperability protocols make these seems so things so abstract it and seamless and so in summary I'd say like I could try to like you know prognosticate here and like tell you like what exactly is the way that this is gonna pan out for like a Dharma 0x but the truth is like nobody really knows and at this point in time like really the the only viable option for building on top of is etherium okay yeah it sounds like a wait-and-see type of answer yeah that's not a cop-out I think it's smart so you guys could have easily done a token sale you know in the height of the ico mania last year but you chose not to why not yeah so I have always I've been I've been very fond of the token kind of model in general I do think there's a lot of promise to it I do think that it's very possible that tokens are kind of like the future of capital formation and yada yada but circa back when we were you know potentially considering doing something like a token sale everything was super murky and everything still is super murky right now and when I say everything I mean like not just you know regulatory aspects like that's that's one issue but even if we're going to put aside the sort of regulatory murkiness of these things it's like it's not entirely clear yet how and when tokens capture value from the project's that they you know espouse to be tied to even either mind you and the the kind of economics we use to explain these things are highly highly unproven and I think like like cynically we could say that like right now like the crypto markets are much more reflection of people's kind of like loose thoughts of like how successful a project or protocol is than it is actually like some sort of valuation of what these assets actually are and so from our perspective like we didn't really want to like raise money on a token if we in our heart of hearts didn't even really know if that token would accrue value if like what we built was successful and so our approach is similarly to the kind of wait-and-see approach that I mentioned earlier is like you know we're not automatically opposed to doing a token maybe one day but right now the market is just so nascent and young and it's just so unclear how these things operate and how these things accrue value that we think it just makes a lot more sense to focus on just building a core ecosystem and getting a lot of people essentially borrowing and lending on Dharma and figuring out our value capture later down the line and do you do you make money now or do you have a plan for how you will eventually make money we do not make money right now no so there the we aren't taking any sorts of fees in the actual protocol level we have no plans of inserting fees at the protocol level at any given time even if we wanted to insert fees the protocol layer everything is open source so it could just be forked away as for what our plans are in the future like you know we are not a non-profit we are a for-profit company so so we do intend on in some way shape or form capturing value we just are very much like we kind of take a a deliberately ambiguous approach to it now where it's like there are many different routes which we could take to capture value in the future ranging from you know providing basically like consulting services to enterprises who are trying to build on Dharma Allah kind of like the the Red Hat model with respect to to their open source distribution or it could take a route of us essentially building products and services that in some way serve constituents in the actual ecosystem and that you know give us revenue in some capacity that way and I think like a a analogy I like to use is that like imagine if the you know SMTP the protocol for email right so so SMTP is the protocol that makes it so that if you send an email from Outlook to Gmail you know the it's all going to go through fine you can imagine like if Google had developed smtp originally and then built g suite on top of it and kind of monetize it in that capacity I think that's like a great example of like what it could look like for an open-source protocol to be developed in a manner that's totally free and then for a company to come and build services and products on top of it that serve users of that protocol in some capacity yeah I imagine your your PC's like polishing capsule and Y Combinator and some of the others will will be interested to know yeah I think we've been lucky enough to have investors that are quite comfortable with the same big you 'ti and we think that it's just we're at a point right now that's too early at least in my opinion to try to shoehorn a business model onto this when we're really just kind of like getting getting the race started right now okay yeah I want to let people know what your background is because when we first met I was shocked to find out that you had chest graduated from Stanford in 2017 and it's similar to when I you know first discovered how young Joey Krug was I could not believe it he was recently on the show so what was your background and how you got into crypto yeah so I got into the crypto so I used to be a student at Stanford and I was you know studying computer science and it was like 2015 and I took a class or I was sitting in on this talk that Eric Schmidt from from Google had given and this is like really at the peak of like kind of like blockchain not Bitcoin stuff and and at one point somebody in the audience asked Eric Schmidt about like Bitcoin and you know he basically gave like the blockchain not Bitcoin should be able it was like yeah you know bitcoins interesting but like the technology behind it is like super super interesting bot and so I kind of came away from that being like huh like bought chain like what does that mean and lo and behold in the fall of 2015 was 2015 in 2016 so I'm getting mixed up anyways in the fall of what was then my junior year I took a class to Stanford called Bitcoin and crypto currencies and it was the first time that it was taught and I just totally fell in love with the space and just like just completely just thought that this was like the most anything happening at technology ended up meeting Fred from coinbase because he came in and gave a talk at that class and kind of as a result ended up working at coinbase for a while as an engineer kind of as I was finishing up school and then on the side I'd started working on Dharma and as soon as I graduated I kind of turned that into a full-time profession and how did you come up with the idea for Dharma so when I was like coinbase I was pretty struck by the fact that Columbia's just like sits on so much crypto assets like then like for the most part they're just entirely stagnant like it's not like when you put your money in a bank account it's you know accruing interest for you because the bank is presumably lending that money out to other people whereas if you put your kind of Bitcoin in coinbase it's just kind of sitting there riding the waves of the Bitcoin market so you know in my head I was like wow you have borderless currency like how cool would it be if we had like a borderless Bank turns out that's like really hard for a centralized institution like coinbase to do because there's just like nine gajillion different regulatory issues that they have to be concerned with and this is like not their number one priority but this had kind of jiggered the idea of like wow we have you know a decentralized borderless currency what if we had like a decentralized borderless credit market and so I kind of started tinkering with that idea there and and it's evolved into what it is today and why the name Dharma like I you know I am a former yoga teacher and I'm interested in meditations like that's a Buddhist word I was like what does that have to do with anything well I mean it really depends on how you cut it is it's both a Hindu and Buddhist concept so the reason why I chose chose the name Dharma so I'm like deeply fascinated with Indian culture it's been like a good amount of time living there and and I think like Dharma is this concept that doesn't really have like a single English word for it but at least in Hindu culture generally refers to like acting in accordance with one's like obligations and duties and I thought that that was sort of fitting to the kind of concept of what a debt is and not a debt is basically like an obligation and so if we're talking about like kind of like creating a universal comprehensive system for settling these obligations I thought that Dharma would essentially be kind of a fitting title interesting I like it I actually want to go back to Stanford now and just ask one question yeah you kind of mentioned sort of like what the atmosphere was around like blockchain versus Bitcoin back in 2015 yeah just out of curiosity how did the attitude around bit coin and crypto change within Stanford during the years you were there oh man not tremendously but I also like literally graduated right before this whole explosion of interest in in crypto currencies happen so I know now things are different and that like like you know I've gone back to campus now and like there's you know a big like blockchain clod and there's you know like all sorts of people from like the GSB and stuff that are like trying to like get into like blockchain and cryptocurrency so you know it's very much like it's changed from this thing that was like a bit of like an off-kilter technical curiosity to being like very front and center which I'm sure is the case in probably most universities yeah Katie Hahn and Susan a they taught a class at the GSB DOE and the in this spring and I think it was like oversubscribed oh yeah yeah so so you guys recently launched what kinds of volume and behaviors have you been seeing in terms of the loan activity on on Dharma yeah so so there's been around something like like almost 150 K and loans that have been issued by a Dharma since we launched in May the vast vast majority of these I'd say fall into the kind of like speculative camp as in like they're basically people who are trying to either like leverage their existing assets or like short certain assets and because right now there's not for a lot of ERC 20 tokens is not really a good way of doing either those things like I think that that's kind of the primary driver volume right now but we've been seeing a lot of really exciting and interesting development interest and in terms of like companies that are like in the pipeline right now for use cases that aren't necessarily speculative per se and you know we can dive into some of those if you're interested but you know they kind of fall into a lot of the buckets of the things that I that I'd kind of listed earlier in terms of things like NFT based loans or or even like you know credit to facilitate plasma withdrawals and things like that okay well because you started off by talking about people in the developing world yeah do you have any plan for kind of extending this out it sounds like it's probably a lot of Westerners that are digging this speculative mania right now that are using it but you know how do you plan to kind of reach the the audience that you feel they could really use this yeah I mean I think like the the sober realistic answer here is that it's like I think that like that will those use cases will come but there are a lot of other bottlenecks that kind of need to be ironed out before that happens and a lot of them are kind of like outside of our general control like you know we just came back from India actually we were we were there for the eath India hackathon and we were talking to people on the ground there who were interested in building out you know like you know microlending underwriters or something like that in the Dharma protocol and the fundamental problem that they have is that it's like okay unless the people are totally willing and able to accept cryptocurrency they're gonna want to convert it back to rupees and currently that's really hard to do in India because like the Indian government has like heavily clamped down on exchanges and so and I think that's like just an example that's indicative of like there's just a lot of like bottlenecks and making crypto adoption happen in like the third world that are just totally out of our control right now and so like you know we can academically talk about the things that we can do to like make make Dharma like more accessible for like developing world use cases but I think that realistically in the short term as I kind of stated earlier it's going to start with very crypto native use cases and kind of expand concentric aliy from there yeah yeah that makes sense so are there any other developments that are forthcoming or new apps or anything that are being built that you're excited about oh man not a lot that I can share publicly but all I can say is that if you are interested in building a business in the cryptocurrency industry and you're looking for to get involved in a way that doesn't require you to have deep technical knowledge we think that building a relay or underwriter and Dharma is a very low hanging fruit in terms of being able to capture value from this nascent industry and so we'd love to kind of get in touch if you're interested in support you well great this has been a fabulous discussion where can people learn more about you and Dharma so if you go to dharma io DHA r ma io that's our website you can find our blog there you can find all of our technical materials there that should kind of walk you through what it's like to build an application on top of Dharma and we'd love to have you join our telegram telegram channel it's you know the most classic cryptocurrency statement ever but um that's kind of where you can find the whole team and pick our brains on anything and yeah that's that's it okay great well thanks for coming on Unchained awesome thank you so much Laura thanks so much for joining us today
