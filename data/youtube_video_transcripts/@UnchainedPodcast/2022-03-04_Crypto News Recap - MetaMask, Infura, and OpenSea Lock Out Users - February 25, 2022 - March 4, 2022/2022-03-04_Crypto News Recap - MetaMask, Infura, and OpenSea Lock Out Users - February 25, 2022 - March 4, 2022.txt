[Music] thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap are nfts securities that's what the sec wants to know according to bloomberg the u.s securities and exchange commission is probing nft creators and marketplaces to determine whether certain tokens qualify as securities and should be regulated as such of particular importance to the sec are fractional nft platforms where an nft can be subdivided into many units that are sold independently of the original nft be it art collectible ticket or meme citing sources familiar with the matter bloomberg noted that the sec had sent subpoenas to both creators and exchanges requesting information interestingly crypto friendly sec commissioner hester purse aka crypto mom had set to coindesk in december given the breadth of the nft landscape certain pieces of it might fall within our jurisdiction people need to be thinking about potential places where nfts might run into the securities regulatory regime the sec's look at nfts did not shock many crypto lawyers for example anderson kill law partner haley lennon tweeted that it was not much of a surprise and stephen paley described the regulator's exploration as predictable as herring in brine the news comes just a few weeks after the sec fined block fi 100 million dollars for offering a security product via its interest earning accounts consensus has a messy lawsuit on his hands a group of 35 employees at the joe lubin-led ethereum development company consensus filed a request for a swiss court to review a previous deal between consensus and jpmorgan the 35 employees who make up more than half of consensus ag shareholders claim that a 2020 transfer of assets from consensus ag to consensus software incorporated was illegal the deal saw jp morgan take a significant stake in both metamask and infuria two major assets originally owned by the ag without the ag's minority stakeholders being properly notified in addition the deal offset a 39 million loan from founder joe lubin according to the claims published by arthur hayes who is heading the suit against consensus ag the transaction was to the detriment of the minority shareholders of cag and to the benefit of joe lubin personally the legal request comes shortly after a consensus fundraising round of 200 million dollars at a 3 billion valuation the company refutes the claims found in hayes letter telling the block mesh aka consensus ag refutes the allegations underlying the legal action as well as this contained in the factually inaccurate press release that was self-authored by one of the former employees mesh looks forward to formally refuting the allegations and accusations in swiss courts core crypto products block international users in related news metamask and infuria both consensus products updated their support pages to reveal that services are unavailable in certain jurisdictions due to legal compliance this update accidentally led users in venezuela and possibly iran and lebanon to being locked out of metamask for a brief period of time in changing some configurations as a result of the new sanctions directives from the united states and other jurisdictions we mistakenly configured the settings more broadly than they needed to be explained in fura metamask said that it and infuria would be unavailable in certain jurisdictions due to legal compliance going forward but did not specify what areas iranian users of the nft marketplace openc are also claiming that they have lost access to their accounts with multiple verified collections allegedly being removed from the platform the irs won't take no for an answer the u.s internal revenue service filed to dismiss a lawsuit by joshua and jessica jarrett a married couple who claims they should not have paid income tax on staking rewards while the irs offered the jarretts a refund in december the couple refused in an effort to force a federal court to decide how staking income is taxed in the u.s however this week the irs filed a motion to dismiss the case arguing that the jarretts could not refuse its offer of a refund in related news during a march 2nd panel carolyn shank an irs official

about-face on crypto kenneth griffin founder of citadel securities and infamous winner of the us constitution bidding war told bloomberg this week that his once negative sentiment regarding crypto has since shifted he calls crypto one of the great stories and finance over the course of the last 15 years he added and i'll be clear i've been in the naysayer camp over that period of time but the crypto market today has a market capitalization of about two trillion dollars in round numbers which tells you that i haven't been right on this call according to griffin citadel securities which handles 25 of equities volume traded on the u.s stock market each day and executes 35 of us listed retail volume will most likely get into the crypto market making games soon despite saying in october that the company would not due to regulatory uncertainty to the extent that we're trying to help institutions and investors solve their portfolio allocation problems we have to give serious consideration to being a market maker in crypto griffin explained it's fair to assume that over the months to come you will see us engage in making markets and cryptocurrencies the news comes almost two months after citadel securities made headlines by taking 1.15 billion dollars in capital from two venture firms sequoia and paradigm a cryptocentric company that has backed compound cosmos sky mavis and uniswap this week in crypto adoption in a week filled with headlines about ukraine russia swift the eu and more it was easy to miss a slew of major companies adopting crypto in one way or another here are three examples kpmg purchased two nfts this week the canadian arm of the major accounting firm bought women 2681 for 25 eth or 75 000 from the world of women nft collection it also minted kpmgca.eth an ens domain charles schwab filed with the sec to create a crypto economy etf that would give investors exposure to companies developing and utilizing cryptocurrencies bracketin group launched an nft marketplace last friday that will allow users to purchase sports and entertainment digital collectibles along with ip minting capability time for fun bits kevin the meme green pixelated money printing machine pixelmon a blockchain gaming project released a collection of 9999 nfts last week generating 70 million dollars in sales during a mint that saw collectors pay up to three eth per nft the mint sold out quickly however collectors were immediately disappointed with the quality of the art which was later described by pixelmon's ceo as unacceptable the nfts grant holders exclusive access to pixelmon-based land and token air drops boost in-game earning potential and grant access to the alpha release among other things however the price floor for them has already dropped to 0.299 eth on wednesday night meaning that some mentors nfts are worth one-tenth what they paid just a week ago however as this is crypto one particular pixelmon nft a species called kevin caught fire on social media and saw the floor price skyrocket due to its ugliness at one point kevin nfts were selling for over twenty thousand dollars kevin nfts spawned an entire meme culture on twitter with the green bowser-like 3d character taking over crypto twitter and even receiving its own song from song of dayman aka jonathan mann kevin became so popular that a derivative project called kevin punks was minted and instantly became a hit with 549 ethan volume after just a few days of trading and a price floor of 0.88 eth unchained tracked down a kevin investor via openc and asked them essentially why they would spend 8.6 eth on a meme john bisu co-founder of seasons.io seemed to think it was a good fit for his nft platform and told unchained that he might donate his kevin into the trash pile on trash dow where users can swap nfts from qualified contracts in exchange for trash tokens which govern the deposited nfts however if kevin continues to grow in value bisu might fractionalize the nft on seasons so that everyone can have a piece of memetic history because as bisou explained to unchanged there is a kevin in all of us alright well thanks for tuning in to
