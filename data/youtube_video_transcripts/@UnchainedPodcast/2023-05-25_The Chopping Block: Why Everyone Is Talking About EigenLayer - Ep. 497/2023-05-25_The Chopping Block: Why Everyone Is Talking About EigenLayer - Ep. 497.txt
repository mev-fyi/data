not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like that either D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intro is first you got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound then we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Pub Comet and today we've got special guests sriram the luminary leader of eigenlayer and finally there's myself obviously the head high man of dragonfly so we're early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping block that XYZ for more disclosures so Iran it's great to have you uh for those who don't know sriram is a long time professor at uh UW at the University of Washington and he's also a crypto founder founder of one of the hottest new projects called eigenlayer full disclosure I think robot Ventures you guys are investors in eigenlayer dragonfly is not but eigenlayer right now is kind of the Talk of the Town like everybody is talking about eigenlayer to the point where you even got shouted out by vitalik yesterday so first question moving from Academia into being now like uh like full-on crypto founder center of attention you know in in the center of the Maelstrom how has that been for you transitioning from the academic world to the crypto world it's been Auto craziness uh I think I've nothing I could have done would have prepared me for this um it it is I think one thing to be a startup founder where you're basically off and you're quiet startup trying to go build your thing it's a completely different thing to be uh founder of a crypto project which is much more Community Driven have start to interact with a lot more people much early on in fact so much so that that is critical or essential to the success of the project even before you bring anything so I I learned these lessons through doing a project where it was only technology focused four years back when I know hasid knows the story with a couple of other professors and when the feeling was exactly the opposite it was pretty much similar to my professor life where we were just inventing new protocols algorithms and making them work and I think this is a very different experience for sure maybe you want to give people a bit of your your background of how you got to crypto because obviously you have a unique story in terms of like all the different fields you worked in and stuff yeah totally my my PhD was in uh information Theory but particularly we were looking at how to build peer-to-peer Wireless Systems you know Wireless usually has infrastructure like base stations or access points can you build a kind of infrastructure free wireless networks just notes talk to each other you know found connections on their own and multi-hop and send information across so that was my PhD and at the end of which I realized that this was a pretty cool academic project we ended up solving some theoretical problems in it long-standing problems but I ended up not having any real impact I didn't even know what I was expecting that you know suddenly we all give up our infrastructure and now move to peer-to-peer violence because we were doing purely theoretical things at that point but after doing that I got into uh computational genomics because you know I was looking for what what are some of the most impactful things that we could be working on and this is around 2011 and 12. and you know worked on algorithms and uh computational genomics or several years had a bunch of really good collaborators several of them went on to when prices like the Breakthrough price but I got a call from my advisor in 2018 uh around hey you know this peer-to-peer thing that we were working on that seems to be a thing again you know there's this thing called Bitcoin today I've heard of Bitcoin and I was very much concerned that previous time we worked on peer-to-peer it was all likes you know been nowhere and I didn't want to enter into another thing like that so it took a long time to actually understand what was going on even though it was very good fit for me technically it was not something that I wanted to enter without actually having a long-term belief in and the thing that clicked for me is that crypto is our coordination super highway just like the internet is the information surprise you need to coordinate across individuals you need mechanisms for long-term memory long-term enforcement you need mechanisms for just like you know we say bitcoin's main role is to prevent double spend right civilization is one of the main goal is to prevent double speak I say one thing to you and another thing to somebody else I think I say one thing to you today and one thing to do tomorrow and essentially crypto is a commitment engine that can actually info you know keep people's commitments because I see as kind of like a basic evolutionary Advantage for humans because if we coordinate better together we can actually build a lot more things together so that was my core thesis and once I kind of gotten into that I said okay now I'm okay to give up working on genomics and work on um so that's the that's what I got and you know it's funny because as you're telling that story I was remembering you know when I first got into crypto full-time in 2017 I remember so much of the context in which I was taught about all the ideas in crypto we're around the history of peer-to-peer Technologies BitTorrent like you know Mesh networking all that stuff was kind of part of the soup that crypto was was uh born in people don't talk about that stuff anymore right it's sort of become I don't know sort of pass a to like make comparisons between crypto and between or something it was very much a moment in time when this very direct line was drawn between these those this lineage of Technologies but now it's you know cryptos kind of become its own thing people don't really talk about that connection much anymore what do you think the pivotal things that cause that that break were because at least to me it's not so obvious why that happened because yeah 2018 I feel like people were still saying things like that but I think this last bull market 2020 kind of was like the clear cutoff Point like maybe D5 was the thing that like it feels like the fact that we have applications now is probably the defining difference is that in 2017 you really had to just tell stories and the stories could be like oh well this is just like remember peer-to-peer file sharing was so big this is like the money version of that that maybe had something to do with it and I think also it was just that the tent got so much bigger that you had to tell a story that resonated with a much broader set of people especially young people right if you're you know 20 there's a good chance you don't even know what Bitcoin is like you just you're you're past the generation you're like you don't even remember iTunes if you're 20 today I asked some some gen Z crypto person who joined like last year or something if they knew what a rice Stone was and they just gave me a blank they gave me this blank look like are you a [ __ ] alien like what what language are you speaking if you don't know the reference you should Google rhinestone I back when I got into crypto ever you could not be in crypto without knowing what a rhinestone was that is probably the single biggest calling card of what generation of crypto you came into is that in crypto professors are rock stars like it's a very different kind of thing than in most other technology Fields right it's not just like oh you're very smart and there's an annual you know Nobel Prize ceremony thing for the smartest Professor it's more like no no the the biggest professors are just awesome and they command hordes of people at will and they fight each other and these you're an AI too I don't know what you're talking that's that's true that's true in biology okay but actually I have the precisely opposite feeling here is that right uh yes I think you know uh my my own experience is basically that you know it doesn't matter you're a professor or anybody else it almost is a negative credential to be a professor so I completely don't play it because you know the in fact I got asked in another interview where they said oh you remember 2018 like there was this whole generation of Prof coins you know first I thought Prof coins must be like something he falls to do and then then you remembered algorand right like come on hey above the belt yeah so you know the and then I I um my my reaction to that is actually that professors build infrastructure and infrastructure unfortunately needed to go with creating both new ecosystems and new tokens of value otherwise you couldn't build infrastructure and I think particularly what I'm addressing in our project is basically how to get professors or innovators in general build new things without having to build profits so that is a short summary of what we talked about this a little bit last time when we talked about Bitcoin and religiosity is that every new project in crypto is part technology part movement and you kind of have to build both you have to build the movement and you have to build the technology which is not always necessarily done in the same person but it's most effective when it is in the same person so you're getting into now the movement building part of your your career it is okay that is the crazy part yeah yes yes well you've done remarkably well at it so far because everybody is talking about eigenlayer so I wanted to so a lot of people who are listening they probably don't know what eigenler is maybe they've heard of it they have a vague idea what it is um and so I wanted to do an exercise um you know those videos where it's like those BuzzFeed videos or something where it's like you know this physicist explains quantum physics and five levels of complexity um so we're gonna do that uh and so we're gonna go around and we're gonna explain eigenlayer to a five-year-old to a high schooler to a day trader to a developer and then we'll have you explain it to a crypto Professor okay and we're gonna try to keep these relatively short just so that we sort of build up in understanding so I'll start um how I would explain eigenlayer to a five-year-old so if I was talking to a five-year-old I would say on ethereum we have policemen who protect the town and uh those policemen they only protect the government buildings because they're only allowed to protect the government buildings but with eigenlayer they can use the same badges to protect all the stores in the town and that's why eigenlayer is so useful right all right that's my explanation to a five-year-old when's your children's book coming out I'm working on it I'm working on it right now please don't leak anything I just I just I just bought my uh my niece uh a book by the Stanford Professor called algorithms for babies so I'm looking forward to comparing for movies do you have an announcement to make no no for a nice right okay of course of course of course all right Robert uh explain to a high schooler okay if you remember back in the days if you are when there was this concept called merged mining for all of the different shot 256 cryptocurrencies that came out people were mining for Bitcoin and while they were mining for Bitcoin they were taking the same hashes and they were mining all of the other Bitcoin clones they were mining Litecoin and feather coin and purecoin and all these things that don't really exist anymore and the same concept applies for all of the new generations of blockchains which is while you're validating ethereum you can also be validating new l2s and optimistic Roll-Ups and sequencer based things and all these other additional blockchains using the same validation resources pretty good it's a very Advanced high schooler that High School knows a lot about merge mining that's merge mining yeah high schooler knows about merge Mining and feather forking but doesn't know about the rice Stone yeah we we might be hiring if you're a high schooler and you know about feather forking and feathercoin all right Tom uh explain it to uh I'm gonna try to work some some Queen kind of stuff um all right there's this chicken and egg problem when you want to start your new coin if you want to start Tron or Tom chain or whatever where if you're using proof steak or some sort of stake based consensus you want your token your coin to be valuable but it's not going to be valuable until people are transacting on it but people are going to transact on it until it's safe and you have some sort of weight securing the network What If instead you could use something like ethereum which is already live and mature and has a lot of stake behind it to bootstrap your own network or maybe even replace you know some of this some of this coinage and that's sort of the idea with eigenlayer okay tarun explain it to a Dev medium Dev yeah suppose you're a developer you've made a smart contract before you've deployed it the smart contract acts sort of as like you have this sort of like magical service in the cloud that is ethereum that runs your contract and ensures that the state transitions that you want to have happen happen or don't or the ones are forbidden don't happen the problem is not all contracts work exactly the same in the ethereum environment then on the environment you completely control and that's because you know the validators who are putting up sort of some stake have some extra rights they can add transactions they can reorder transactions they can move transactions they they have some extra rights that don't guarantee you exactly what you want now in order for you to do that you would have to run your own infrastructure create a new L1 that you had to run nodes for and then have those rules enforced in the consensus for those nodes but suppose you don't want to have a new L1 but you have an application whose security relies on these guarantees that have to be enforced at the validator level eigenlayer is a way for you to have economic guarantees that the validators enforce these covenants that are stronger than the ones that your contract itself enforces by giving the validators extra rules and they get economic rewards if they uh kind of enforce your rules and they get slashed or have penalties if they they don't okay can you explain this to an academic leader a very a very crypto knowledgeable academic colleague yeah at the root of everything we do in a blockchain whether we think of something as a crypto solution or not I think the boundary position boundary is whether it's based on decentralized trust or not based so you can think of decentralized trust as the raw material of like everything that we built in crypto and what blockchains like ethereum do is to take this decentralized trust and refine them into particular products for example block space they'll take decentralized trust you know you have a group of nodes they all work together they arrive at consensus they run a particular scaling and a particular execution environment and everything and then out comes a block you know every block there is some amount of space and what happens in typical applications that build on Smart contract platforms is they consume blog space which is they're consuming this refined version of decent electrons and then paying for it so the economy is if you if I'm an application and I want to borrow trust from say ethereum I'm basically buying blocks case or my users applying block space and therefore paying for the decent pledge trust that is being shared but this trust you know the the reasonless trust underpinning ethereum has been refined in particular ways using a particular consensus protocol using a particular execution engine and so on uh using a particular block limit all of these together give rise to the particular economy of of the block space What If instead we can go all the way down and get you the raw decentralized trust and create a Marketplace for it so what do I mean by raw decentralized trust decent less trust emerges out of the combination of really two opponents in most platforms one is staking which is I'm putting down a bunch of capitals node validators put down a bunch of capital and make a credible commitment that they are going to run this ethereum block Production Service according to the rules and the covenants laid out in the protocol and the second aspect of decentralized trust is decentralization itself which is that not only I'm putting down a bunch of one guy put down one billion is still different from thousand people put down one million dollar each so in the second attribute of decent voice trust is decentralization which is how many different nodes out there how many different perspectives have been integrated in coming up with this block production so eigen layer is a mechanism to allow anybody to consume raw decent less trust so imagine instead of having the ability to program ethereum at the level of I can write an evm contract what if we give you a hook and say that you can go and tell each ethereum node what particular node software they should run very low level programmability so you have full control of programming the entire distributed system so eigen layer is a Marketplace for decentralized trust it allows you allows validators no validators on ethereum to opt-in and use their same stake they already put down 32 eth and then committed to validating ethereum blocks they think take the same 32 eat and then say Oh I am going to now take this study to eat and I'm making a covenant or a commitment not only to validate ethereum blocks correctly but also to validate a new service you know Tom chain correctly or like haseeb's Oracle correctly or Robert's data storage service correctly right so I can make all these covenants and since I am the one who is actually running the node software for all of these different things I can hold to all of them equally well because I know I'm running this I'm also going to run that in the proper way so I won't break any of the comments of these many different software so essentially eigen layer is a marketplace where we let the trust suppliers which is nodes who are put down stake stakers right meat trust consumers which is for example distributed service Builders like you want to go build a new bridge a new Oracle a new chain a new service which requires end nodes to come together to consensus and have some amount of Economic Security backing it now anybody who wants to build any of these Services instead of going and wanting their own new decent less trust ecosystem can just borrow aspects of decent plus trusts from this common framework that off DX so serum we were having a conversation a few weeks ago and the the obvious objection which led to a very interesting conversation between us was that okay the idea of restaking it's very beautiful it's very elegant you know it's very efficient this idea that instead of having 5 000 tokens there's an oracle token there's this token in that token and all those tokens are all getting staged separately instead you have sort of one uh group of stickers who are the most trustworthy and they have a lot of stake and they're all using the same stake it's a re-hypothecating across multiple protocols the the obvious objection to that is like well look we're VCS right four of us here we invest in protocols and if you are starting a project it's really hard like what do you raise money for if you don't have a token if you're like well I'm gonna pay ethereum stakers to do this and then like my thing will just like I don't know collect a a toll on layer one every time you use it it's like what does the token how do they raise money like where's the [ __ ] coin like you kind of need this [ __ ] coin economy don't you in order for this stuff to work what what is your objection to that objection yes the my objection is that it doesn't stand empirical evaluation why do I say that like you go back to 2014 2015 and say that hey you know you could go raise money and instead of all apps starting to congregate around like a platform like ethereum they could all go and do the same thing and start their own chains and we you know we talk about dab change today but dab change about the only thing that were possible before ethereum like you just had a bunch of tab chains and ethereum by creating a Sharp Security substrate by reducing the actual cost of security actually made it more viable for all of these different services to be built they were all built on a par security standard like everybody's sharing the security which means they inherit several aspects of composability and all of these effects basically made more and more people build on ethereum till to some extent people realize that oh ethereum doesn't have block space anymore for me to build new things that's the only reason you could go start a new L1 is the story has run its course oh you know there's no more block space to build on top of ethereum and then you say oh no I'm going to create a new blockchain which is doing the same thing but now like produces block space in abundance and then go and create like new layer ones like you know all the other layer ones that you know of but to me the logic of aggregation is much more powerful than the logic of segregation so but to actually answer your question in more practical terms we have thousands of apps that you guys have funded we have maybe like 10 layer ones that you get so Thunder like you know why is that that's because it's much easier for adapt to establish its use case and value and there are many more dabs that are likely to to be actually viable and there are like layer ones that are likely to be viable more Slayer ones like our own my own previous startup called Trifecta which which was Dead on Arrival right that on arrival not because that technology it's there are arrival because the bar to how layer one is pretty high it's pretty pretty steep job to build that so another analogy that I would like to draw on here is what happened in the internet in 94 if you want to go build your own like uh you know internet uh web application you need to build your own server you need to build your own identity stack you need to build your own payment stack you need to build your own DB and then you build whatever application you were building that's how like all the old applications were like Hotmail or whatever but in 2023 if you want to go build your application and you go use AWS you go use oauth for authorization you use like a stripe for payments you use some other DB for just tie all these together and then you're really focusing on the thing that you really value and if you look at it if you look at if you think of things like middleware nobody really made money on middleware but like all the VCS over the last 20 years made money on SAS why because SAS is SAS services that built on top of AWS were highly profitable because you can focus on one narrow thing and kill it and it's much much easier to predict whether some somebody can focus on a narrow slice and kill it than it is to figure out if they've solved the whole monolith from like top to bottom so I think the modularity that is that eigenlayer empowers basically makes it feasible for many people to come in and focus on narrow slices and kill it like I come in and come up with a secret sharing that's just a secret sharing layer somebody else comes up with a data layer somebody comes up with an oracle layer somebody comes up with an authentication layer we now if you're building an application just tie all these together and so as a VC it's much easier to calibrate on Sharp focused bets this is the best team to build the secret chatting player this is the best team to build the arc layer and top tap tokens exist in plenty and they they're also valuable and because they provide valuable services and so that's the same thing I would say this just because the tokens used for security doesn't mean it's more valuable and also if you build two systems one system has a much higher cost basis and another systems actually has a much lower cost basis Customs the lower cost basis just wins in a free market you can't wish it away the existence of a shared security system means that the cost of security has gone down and that means that systems building on top of this leverage an economy of scale that's not available to systems that have to emit a 20 emission annually to keep their security going so that all those factors together are lean towards actually building an aggregated systems and we are very friendly to tokens like you can design very complex token incentives even inside you know something like eigenware you can have the tokens absorb a portion of the fees that go into your system you can have your token be used as the payment token you can be you can use your token as an additional staking token in order to ethereum giving rise to dual staking models so you can build all kinds of complex things and it really depends on the applications in use case rather than a one-size-fits all yeah I guess uh another tiny thing I'd add is you know if we if we look at the last five years um one of the things we've seen is sort of like the unbundling of how transactions are propagated and how transactions move between chains and that unbundling is like a one-way function right it's like second law of Thermodynamics of blockchains of modular modularity right like there's always some extra complexity that comes from hyper specialization uh and in some ways bootstrapping that specialization as these things get more complicated from nothing is much harder than trying to build it on an existing Network I mean can the simplest example is comparing you know extra value value extracted on ethereum versus value extracted everywhere else and how that entire supply chain works it's just it's just actually easier to do it at the place where there's the most liquidity and the most volume and versus trying to restart and you know you could argue that you know namecoin failed but ens succeeded right this is like kind of in the same vein like a bunch of l1s May Fail but the Roll-Ups that proceed May succeed and it's not that like all other ones will fail but I think there's a lot of l1's whose value prop over ethereum Roll-Ups is just a lot lower one of the things that was an aha mode for me in our conversations we're on was this idea that you alluded to again that look um the the sort of 100 IQ take is off I'm a founder and I use restate eth instead of using my own token to secure my chain then I can't really have a token my token has less utility and therefore you know I'm gonna get punished by the market because my token is going to be not very useful and I think in a way the market is kind of conditioned right now to think that way is that like look if this token is not used for security then what the hell is the point of this token throw it away you know this thing's not worth anything but that it's kind of a nonsensical view because ultimately in in a world where you use restate teeth instead of using your own token like your own token can still be the governance token that ultimately governs the protocol and and in some ways you know attributable whatever you know Boons the protocol ultimately accrues go to the uh the token holders in one way or another if it allows you to reward those stakers with less marginal inflation than you would otherwise need like at the end of the day the only thing that really matters for the value of your protocol is how valuable it is in terms of how much money you can make how much rake you can actually take in as a protocol and then two how much you're paying for it like how much emissions you're getting out and like those two numbers are really the only numbers that matter which is sort of the you know the cost of administering the service and the the price that you receive for giving the service you know if you want to really dumb it down at the at the lowest level and ultimately paying for security with re-hypothecated less volatile collateral like ether as it was paying for security with one single use collateral that you invented that's super volatile you're always gonna have to pay more in super volatile low liquidity collateral um which is I think to me that feels like the most robust non-obvious argument for why it is it is a better equilibrium for how people buy security right now with tokens people are bundling I want to buy security and I want to govern my protocol using the same token but you don't need to bundle them there's no reason in principle why they should be bundled just because they are bundled for other layer ones and for many other protocols but at the application layer I feel like if eigenlayer succeeds at this Mission it's going to do so by breaking that link in the mind of of um honestly many Traders this idea that oh well that's what gives a token value which is that it's used for staking which doesn't really make sense yeah I think we're already starting to see this with the layer twos commanding some value right like the layer two tokens have you know are not necessarily the security tokens and don't even have a path to be staking tokens for some of these but still people have started I think there's a flipping in the mind or the narrative which is that okay you know that is these tokens have value because these systems create value and there's some fees that gets attributed eventually packed to these uh these top numbers so I I completely agree with that in fact that was the dominant way in which we ended up with the protocols in fact that is that other like perverse thing with that uh on link that you talked about haseeb which is that the total amount of security you can buy is bounded by your token market cap like what is this thing this is a very weird thing this is the total amount of if you stake your own token for security the total Economic Security you can buy it's bounded by your tokens market cap those two things should have no relationship there's no web 2 company which cannot serve a bigger web to company like because there is no relationship between the the your company's market cap or value or whatever and who you can sell but when you rely on things like Economic Security the smaller you are the less people you can serve because you don't have much security and kind of like it's like shooting you yourself in the foot on day one when you're starting a protocol you might as well like if you're you know if you're successful in building a protocol even with sweepstaking eventually you may decide not to use mistaking because of whatever reason and you can go ahead and pee around like layer one or like just your own security token or whatever it's like these options are all available if you know the marginal advantage of using a lower cost of security is not dominant at that point but I think for most protocols there is a kind of like a bootstrapping problem the Tom unloaded to earlier which is that like you can't even get started because if your token market cap is like 100 million like your Economic Securities at most hundred million if everybody Stakes this seems to be like a very bad Association and apps have created clearly avoided this and I was just thinking about like how did Dax avoid this fit like Taps have the entire ethereum's Economic Security even in their Market capacity right uni systems not as secure as the uni token and like that is roughly what we want to emulate for all these other systems okay so speaking of security that brings us to the the post that I was alluding to earlier that vitalik wrote earlier this week to the title of the post and I'd love to just get everybody's reaction to it title of the post is don't overload ethereum's consensus so there's a few kind of big themes in the post but uh the main thrust of it is basically to say there's a lot of experiments that are taking place of trying to leverage ethereum security model and ethereum security through all of its takers but also some implicit assumptions about ethereum's social consensus meaning that when things go wrong is ethereum potentially going to Fork is ethereum going to favor one thing or another is it going to do a soft for it is it like are is it is it reasonable to expect ethereum to do to bend in certain ways uh in order to protect its overall ecosystem or protect individual players um or even if you're doing something that's not directly affecting the normal operations of ethereum applying certain kinds of pressure to sneakers and making it but stickers should be a little bit more likely to do X or Y or just even be thinking in a certain direction more uh maybe ultimately deleterious to the protocol being neutral and being unopinionated about the applications that are living underneath it um so what were you guys reactions reading this post it got it got a lot of attention a lot of conversation going uh before I before I jump over to sriram well my super super high level take was that I think the post only focuses on the risk and not the potential benefits the risk being hey this is a total distraction for ethereum validators and if you I'll use this word corrupt them with outside economic incentives it could maybe mess up the economics of ethereum at like the core foundation without saying hey if this supercharges ethereum validators isn't that a really good thing for ethereum if like there's even more use where like this is the like super collateral like I you know so I think it just focused on risk and downside and not I feel okay let me give you a sort of counter analogy is like somebody's like yeah okay you might be worried about money in politics and that sounds really negative but what if you gave so much money to politicians that all the best people became politicians maybe it's like on the upside I think what photograph's pointing to is like the risk of corrupting validators it's like you know valid uh something like you know ethereum is a public good if we throw too much money at it it is kind of like money in politics right it's sort of corrupting by its nature now you can't stop it right like how do you stop it I don't really know other than just like writing you know kind of upgrading posts like this yeah it's um it reminds me of uh I think it's like in Singapore they have some of the highest paid uh sort of public servants kind of forward this reason I mean they're not politicians but it's like you track really great talent and it sort of reminds me of um sorry about like the Trump quote like I'm too rich they can't bribe me I think there was like some kind of Merit in specific applications but like um I don't know I think a lot of it the poster focuses on on consensus and overall I think I agree with the design philosophy of like keeping core consensus very simple I think a lot of other chains have experimented with sort of adding a lot more at the base layer but at the same time I I guess I sort of zoom out and think a bit more like application sort of social consensus capture and I think you know see if you had this post from a while ago around ethereum being unforkable because of D5 and specifically talking about usdc and I think that in my mind feels kind of similar here where it's like people don't want to use ethereum they want to use the applications that are on ethereum and if there are fundamental problems with the applications that are on ethereum of course social consensus is going to direct it to a new Fork like if there's a vulnerability in uniswap and all the value is drained I think people are going to move to the fork of ethereum where the the you know the the bug is fixed and you know immunoswap's not drained and so I I like I I empathize a little bit with sort of the you know sort of design philosophy uh point of view here but like I I don't think it's it's like it it feels kind of like a again like a moot point like people are going to go to the chain where there is stuff that they want to use and so if that's stuff that they want to use and here's is going to use ethereum consensus like that that is kind of uh the end of the the show I think I think in some ways ethereum already made sort of the falcian bargain by moving to proof of sake in the sense that you can't get a lot of the same uh risk guarantees anyway uh you know there's this availability trade-off there's kind of the idea that people can't join and leave as easily as you can in proof of work this idea that geographic distribution is much worse dot dot right there's like a ton of known trade-offs those trade-offs probably have higher economic value than a lot of the application Level risks in my mind uh and you already made those decisions uh so I from my perspective it's like well you Cho you chose a system that has these that allows this extra functionality takes on this other risk uh you can't really stop it from happening in the same way that you know the last time there was a don't overload consensus style post it was like Hey we're never gonna allow delegation in ethereum lo and behold what happened was Lido so I just think the the inevitable hand of capitalism and Market forces will inevitably drive these things into existence whether decided or not you know desirable or not because validators are not really honest they are rational and those rational validators want more money it feels okay that feels very fatalistic true and I and I don't I don't totally agree with it because I think let's use the analogy of like money and politics I think that actually is a relatively good analogy because it is in a total free market you would just be able to bribe politicians to do whatever you wanted right and like people talk all the time about bribery attacks being one of the fundamental issues in any kind of a democratic system that has to be overcome in one way or another through you know anti-bribery mechanisms such as strong laws against bribery uh in in crypto obviously we are in a permissionless system or you know whatever modulo more or less permissionless and that sort of means that you can you can take the view of like okay well then because permissionless you know whatever there's going to be bribery attacks and there's going to be you know people just you know making validators do they're just gonna be feather forking there's gonna be all the other stuff for the most part we actually we don't see a lot of these behaviors and I think the reason why we don't see a lot of these behaviors is twofold one is that uh a lot of the people who are actually running the big validators on ethereum um they're not purely Market oriented like they are actually relatively ideologically aligned with ethereum just because like look if you are a total ruthless capitalist you're just not gonna I don't know it's like a weird line of business to get into you know it's not the most profitable thing in the world to run ethereum validation Services you know it's like kind of a weird nerdy uh business to get into maybe it's a little bit more true in the proof of work mining days but in the world of uh proof of stake uh validation you know there's no like random guy who just happens to have a you know retired power plan next year next to your house like you're you're you're in the same footing as everybody else since you just love running validators and those kinds of people don't want to watch the world word on the other hand on the other hand the reason you have staking derivatives and Mev is redistributed to many people who could never capture it themselves is because they're because of the ruthless nature of the led to the securitization that securitization LED less sophisticated actors gain access to those returns for a small fee totally and some excess risk right and I'm saying that this is just the same March we're going in the same direction and that's I the the question the question is not is it marching in that direction totally agree with you that all markets tend toward efficiency over time but the the difference is in what way are the institutions behind ethereum and the culture that is enshrined in ethereum in what way are those things modulated by the institutions that are held up by ethereum and vitalik of course has a large role in that because he's like kind of the religious leader or whatever forefather of ethereum and I think the like what he's doing in this post is not just saying like guys please don't be totally self-interested and you know but I know you're going to anyway it's not just like a uh it's not like saying hey guys please don't extract any V like if you do that it's really going to hurt ethereum like why are you hurting me that's not I feel like that's it's very different than what he's doing what he's doing is he is advocating for a certain set of institutions and that set of Institutions is enforced collectively by almost everybody like I think it's very clear that ethereum does have institutions right and these institutions have been conveyed through both leaders like vitalik but also just like the kind of ever-present culture that is everywhere in ethereum that like even random people at Devcon you will find them and they'll just have these beliefs and they'll be walking around with them even though they also want to make money and they also are self-interested in different ways and the maintenance of those institutions is really subtle and complex and I feel like that's what this piece is ultimately about if it was really just hey you know don't extract any V because like it you know that makes you an [ __ ] then it wouldn't work and I would say okay well this is Doom this is obviously just a futile attempt to uh delay the inevitable but I I wouldn't say that that's true of what vitalik is doing here I'm not saying that the post said that as much as like there was a little bit of like uhness to it right they had this tone of like a like little like you shouldn't have done that you know like yeah I find I find that to be the part that I'm like well this happened before like I don't know what you're you're you know fool me once I'm the idiot pull me twice what is your take on this whole thing okay I have somewhat different take maybe it integrates all of your things and adds a different image into it I think the first thing is the title of the post the title of the post was do not overload ethereum consensus but actually if you read the content it is do not overload ethereum social consensus it's do not overload ethereum social consensus and he's basically trying to do what you know hasid was pointing out I think in my view is basically saying to take the government type analogy what he's saying is don't build a bank take too much risk and then come to the government for a bailout that's what he's saying you go do your thing you go do build restaking you go build crazy things don't rely on ethereum is going to fork and save your ass if something like that's not basically that's the selling point he's trying to kind of get everybody to agree on you know that may be a big project there may be you in a swap there may be Comfort maybe I can let us pick doesn't matter if you get screwed on a different layer go deal with that layer we're not 14 ethereum for you that's the boundary the boundary is basically what is the core concerns of the protocol so to answer like haseen's analogy of politicians and bribing politicians right like you can pay politician to to write computer programs in audition to whatever they're doing in their office so the concern of the government is to make sure that when they're in office they do the thing that they're supposed to do and that's why we are slashing at the ethereum code layer to protect it and the slashing of ethereum core layer protects against safety faults and protects against lightness faults will force and safety files are like programmatic right assigned to blocks you're going to get slashed it's programmatic but blindness Falls are non-programmatic and that needs the use of social consensus he's basically saying we're reserving social consensus for the one fault that is at the core of the protocol not for all the other things that you may want to use it for and I think it's a really good really really good boundary setting which is what are the concerns of the protocol and what is the concerns of the free market concerns of the free market and don't externalize like Risk from the free market into the core protocol right that is basically what I think the the article is trying to say and I think the the shelling Point are the the equilibrium that it's trying to set is when somebody comes and claims that oh we are so big that if we go wrong like ethereum is going to come for for us that's not going to happen like I think it's a really good good demarcation of boundaries and if you look at the article in read casually like he's explaining all the things that are low risk things like staking uh for a new chain he's saying it's low risk right specifically called or like take deutschka and run it and validate it so the way we view it in fact we have internalized all of these inputs for the last like 15 months the way we build our protocol is already assuming that this is how things are going to be we cannot rely on ethereums like social consensus so all mediations happen in protocol and this made us like you know think much more carefully about the various risks and how we handle it all in our layer we can't say like throw our hands up and say like ethereum's gonna handle it for us and I think it's really good that he wrote this up because now like when other people look at restaking they're like oh it's such a simple idea like maybe you know it's it's as simple as just take a liquid sticking token put it in Fork salon on build it on ethereum right and where do you know this like you could have done this like one year back we took a lot of efforts in minimizing all kinds of risks and externalities to ethereum we have to worry about what are the slashing risks and how it affects validate us we have to worry about what are the centralization risks to ethereum how do we minimize that we have to worry about what kinds of slashing can we allow on on protocols how to make these slashings all objective and attributable rather than subjective and you know let ethereum deal with it so all of these things have been internalized into the construction of the eigen layer protocol and how we approach the services that have been built on top of eigenveer but somebody else on the outside may not know or understand that these are the boundaries that we've tried to maintain but so that's why I was actually quite happy to see that kind of a boundary setting as to what is the concern of the protocol what risks have to be internalized into the systems that are being built whether it's externalized into broader ethics so I love that analogy especially given how timely it is given all the stuff going on in the banking crisis of this idea of like hey it's almost in a way a self-fulfilling prophecy that if you build something and you assume that ethereum is going to bail you out right if you sort of you get this culture of people thinking in their minds that ah we're gonna get bailed out if something goes wrong um then you get Collective risk taking you know you get basically this sort of moral hazard where everybody takes on lots and lots of risk and then when things blow up the pressure to try to bail something out becomes really strong right if anything becomes almost self-fulfilling that people kind of expect that this thing will get bailed out because everyone's been saying that it's going to get bailed out um and so in some way you need to sort of stop that spiral before it begins and say hey guys just so you know we're not gonna bail any of this [ __ ] out if if this thing fails you guys are on your own and you're [ __ ] now that being said you can say that all day long if optimism gets hacked or if let's say God forbid uniswap gets high all the money unit swap gets drained like I think there's a good chance that I think before dude 100 yeah 100 nothing but I think that's exit but it does serve the purpose that you exactly said which is does not encourage excessive risk taking this is basically you know by setting the selling point you know is basically driving people towards be more conservative and then like of course something happens then we figure out what to do about it right but but you can't go with the a priority assumption that everybody's going to get bailed out so you go do your fun stuff although although I I think there was even some more stuff written that says even that might not have might not happen or at least intimated that when taught when um vitalik talked about the difference between Tycho which is like a small L2 and optimism arbitrum and like with the argument that like hey the developers and optimism arbitrum overlap more with the ethereum core developers than Tycho so they will in theory have this ability to kind of cause this their Fork their preferred Fork but you know we have to resist that I I thought there there was a very distinct thing that even in this year I'll say that right that's the thing is like you know if you're Janet Yellen you've got to go up and say we're not going to bail any banks before the bank failure start but then once the bank failure started you're like all right let's go [ __ ] let's build you know let's bail the banks you know I I you know I wouldn't compare the two of them okay so do you think that if optimism was hacked all the money was drained that ethereum went for where would you put the place the odds at 55-45 it's like more likely than I would Fork no more likely it would Fork but like not by much I think it would actually be quite a contentious issue I don't think I don't think it's like a hundred percent chance thing at all I think the best historical context for this is the Dao right the Dao happened to be roughly the only major application on ethereum when it was hacked so it's not like it was like one of many it was roughly the only actual application with like substantial assets and it was consequential enough that it was the first and only crisis response hard fork for ethereum and now we have ethereum classic and it's years in the historical rear view mirror I actually think of something like optimism or hacked or a different L2 right I don't know if it's as consequential as the doubt to be honest you know that that was one of one it's not one of five and I just think like the total impact is less it would be a brutal brutal brutal learning experience but like I actually don't really think ethereum would Fork I think it's like a three percent chance really and obviously it's all you know spitball but I I don't think the magnitude of the event would be as serious as when the Dow was hacked I think that's definitely true uh interesting variation of the question is whether it'll for for light up you know just in terms of percentage tvl of like you know what is going on I think you know the Dow was 15 of all eat right like that is the the level I don't think we have any applications kind of reaching that even something like glido is not yet at like 16 draws of uh Eid but it is you know I think that's the number to look at is what percentage of eat is basically you know at risk and whether uh there was any kind of soft or other like assurances that you know we are behind this right and I think so here's the thing here's the thing here's the thing going back to the idea of Institutions and politics I think in a way ethereum would actually be kind of glad to see uh Lido get hacked it's like aha we told you guys you shouldn't have done like this is why you shouldn't play with fire we didn't listen to the protocol for a reason consensus don't overload consent exactly don't start getting too confident in your little play things that you build on the on the beach you know like what it represents for the ethereum core developers um or just not the court of office the intelligence yeah let's say of ethereum what it represents is that Lido is a financialized protocol like rolito is basically like these guys like tarun said look it's the market forces you try to get yield Mev blah blah uh we want we want the state uh but I'm saying this in a positive way right they've literally democratized access to to Mev returns a random ethereum holder had no way of even realizing them right other than thinking which is what they want you to do right they want you to stay well well no no but you needed to kind of use a second derivative because you yourself even if you ran a home Staker right very unlikely would have been a good flashbots auction participant right like my point is they did actually serve this democratizing yield thing which is important but my point is if that exists the market will find a way to make it happen I I just don't believe that anything other than that will beat your outcome but let me just change my point is that for for Lino is I think somewhat ancillary to ethereum's goals in a way it's almost like a little bit of a thorn in their side whereas the l2s are the story like that is the point we are we are going to scale ethereum through l2s and these are the anointed ones but basically optimism and Arbitron mostly optimism is Anointed because you know it's all EX people and if that goes under it's not just that like oh there's this amount of money that was lost I think it actually would be less about the overall number like the amount of eth because from the perspective lighter holders like oh you took a 30 haircut oh so what you know boohoo you should have been [ __ ] around with derotos you know whereas with with the layer two is it's like Oh I thought this was trustless there's like all sorts of things on the L2 not just ether the the the the the the kinds of stories would just be so much worse I feel like if if nl2 exploded and that's why I think it'd be different even though in monetary terms yeah I think I I kind of disagree I think announce who's effectively like a bridge and we've had really big bridge hacks and we have not done a fork and so like you know whatever whereas lydo 30 of all uh you could cause some serious Mayhem with consensus and overall uh chain stability again I I do feel like this is kind of like young manuals at cloud like you know it doesn't actually matter because let's say light it was hacked someone is going to try to do a fork that reverts the hack the question then is well which chain are usdc and usdt going to accept withdrawals on or that's application value capture and so you know no one really cares what vitalik thinks it's like uh uh who can basically anoint the chain and there's there's other actors there's application Level actors uh that can do that that's it it's your point no no I know I know I know no no it's bringing around full circle it's very true it's very true so again I guess the reality is that we're all under the cult of Jeremy Lair uh whether we know it or not he's ultimately he's he's behind the scenes pulling the levers to decide end of the day I think I think the metallic like any religious leader as you pointed out who's successful has to write sermons this was a good sermon right in some sense I just some more pointing out that I think I think there have been a lot of platitudes and diatribes about and like on both sides of it whereas I just feel like it's just saying kind of the obvious thing of like well this is probably going to happen here's some Road Rules don't do the bad ones exactly I mean that's kind of the role of a sermon right it's like you say something that's already been said Aesop's Fables for proof of stake you know the point the point of it is you gotta say the sermon at the right time right it's like the perfect moment to give your sermon which is the the characteristic of a good preacher is not that they innovate on you know the the source text right they don't they shouldn't uh but rather that they pull out the right lesson at the right time that the congregation that the congregation needs to hear uh at that given moment and I guess this is the time that we're all messing around with consensus so it's a good time for us to get those rules of the road read back to us wait wait sure I have one question I've wanted to ask you but I figured since since now it's recorded I can make other people have to listen to the sensor which is why does your your logo looks like a you know like 2D error correcting code but it's too correlated like what is this tree thing is that forking is that something up closer so we can see yeah like how would you describe that I don't even know how to describe it it's like an L with like a pixelated y sticking no this is not uh uh this is uh it's an eigen layer it's an eigen layer oh obviously uh but what we did is actually this logo goes with how the symbol is written the word word Mark is written and there are many ways to write this word mark because you know we want to just eigen is you know in German means your own segmental is your own layer you can make many things out of it so you can write the eigen layer word Mark actually we have many many ways of writing the word Mark and there's an algorithmic relationship between how to write the word Mark and how this symbol automatically changes so we have a family of symbols and they're all like but there's an underlying principle behind the column down yeah shot security modularity open Innovation you got the beginning of religion going I like that that's very important you know it's like you know Christianity there was like 17 different simplify yourself as a Christian uh Calvin's uh brainchild I mean you guys are Calvinists destination I think it's time for us to wrap up but um is great pleasure having you on the show and looking forward to see uh it's not live yet right uh when when do we get to see mainnet uh we're going through a staged mainnet uh where we are basically going to turn on just taking first then we turn on delegation and node operators and then we turn on new services so we expect the first uh turn on to be in the coming months okay sounds very controlled very Pious I'm glad to hear that I'm sure I'm sure daddy vitalik is uh appreciative of your guys uh conservatism awesome all right sir it was a pleasure thanks everybody thanks everybody thank you so much [Music]
