cap our Ryan sulcus founder and CEO of Masari and Matt lysine Berg reporter welcome Ryan and Matt thanks Laura thank you having me this may be one of my most anticipated episodes because of an incident that happened on Twitter before recording I want to give listeners the back story so they can understand how this episode came to be back in January I tweeted a few articles critical of XRP afterward Ripple's CEO Brad Garlin house emailed me unhappy about my tweets I said to him let's talk it out on my podcast he said his PR person would give me an answer which turned out to be no the day after a friend of mine emailed me and said any chance you want Brad Garlin house on a podcast they asked me to ask you dot dot smiley face I said what and explained that the we stay they had declined me she wrote this is not what I heard at all perhaps his team messed up as he really wanted to be on your podcast last I checked I'm tracking down the info for you back to you soon I responded I think they are unhappy that I tweeted some choice quotes from articles critical of XRP but if he really believes in XRP then he shouldn't be scared of some tough questions by me he should be able to handle the answers easily if it really has the potential he seems to think it does she wrote back agreed 100% triple exclamation point I never heard back over the past few months I tagged Brad in some tweets saying I wanted him on my show and got zero response I finally decided I would do a show anyway and scheduled to non ripple guests I chose Ryan selcas because he's working on token standards and has written about XRP and mad because he's done some writing and reporting about XRP and interviewed Brad since the show was about XRP I emailed ripple beforehand to get their answers to some questions so they can have a voice in the show they wrote back proposing instead two of their executives chief cryptographer David Schwartz and chief marketing officer Corey Johnson when I realized they were willing to participate I requested Brad they said Brad had an insane schedule however I would like to note here that Brad has appeared on at least one podcast with a fraction of my listenership because the issues I want to discuss around XRP aren't really about the technology and also because I don't let anyone dictate who comes on my show I decided I would meet ripple halfway and take Corey the chief marketing officer with one of my original guests Ryan ripple kept insisting on their two guests but no one decides who goes on my show but me friends or sources I'm friendly with have found out the hard way that I will bite the head off of anyone who tries to dictate or even influence oh I have on the show I told ripple that if I couldn't have Brad I would do a show with one of their execs Corey the CMO and one of my original guests they would not agree and solely on a Monday afternoon they said they weren't going to participate the next morning the PR woman emails me that they've changed their minds and will let Corey come on the show we booked everything I'm happy I was traveling that day and was not on Twitter for a few hours when I logged in later I saw that I had 99 plus notifications because ripples chief cryptographer Dave Schwarz who has 98 thousand Twitter followers had tweeted at me quote Laura Shen heard you weren't interested in having me join Cory on your upcoming podcast about xrp bummed because I think your audience is smart enough to follow along and I could add to the conversation in a meaningful way are you sure you can't make room for one more first of all when I started podcasting I learned two guests Max's best second if ripple is going to participate I want the CEO I always get the CEO I got the CEO of shape-shift poly Chains APOBEC oh my crypto chain but paisa 0xb TCC and others i only make exceptions for cases like IBM or Nasdaq where my guess where the more blockchain focused than the CEOs if ripple was was not going to give me my top choice I was not gonna let them dictate exactly who is going to be on the show plus in this case it should have been a lay up for them since they already had a bunch of questions in advance so I decided I would leverage this tweet from David to get what I have been asking for since January Brad I told the PR woman I was taking the option of anyone but Brad off the table so their two choices were either Brad or no one from ripple I thought there's no way they're going to prefer a podcast of two non ripple people discussing XRP over a podcast featuring Brad talking about XRP but the next day they refused I asked the ripple comms person you would rather have two non ripple people talk about XRP on my podcast than your own CEO he wrote back I prefer to have two XRP experts and c-level executives from ripple who are moving mountains to make themselves available to you come on your podcast to answer your questions I wrote I told you the two options were Brad or tune on ripple people and you are choosing tune on ripple people he did not respond then I asked him and you were not going to send me the answers to the questions I sent previously no response so here we are folks I gave them the option of Brad or tune on ripple people discussing XRP and they chose the latter and they didn't even give me the answers to my written questions for the record I put ripple on the Forbes FinTech 50 list for three years straight they were the only company I cover to send me a holiday card last year just weeks before Brad refused to come on my show they also invited me to interview Brad at their company off-site last fall which I couldn't make and now here we are from invitations and holiday cards to the cold shoulder now that you have the backstory let's dive into the discussion with Ryan and Matt Ryan why don't you start with a brief discussion of what you do and how you came to write a long article titled I see you XRP well that is quite an introduction you know I've been in the industry for about five years and I've ever worn a few different hats was on the founding team at digital currency group which as a disclaimer was an investor is an investor in ripple Inc Iran coin desk for 18 months led the restructuring the company before leaving last July and now I am working on a project called Masari which is building an open-source data library that should serve as the industry's Edgar like database and we're really working on disclosures and compliance frameworks for token issuers so that's you can easily compare apples to apples and that's anyone in the industry that's purchasing these tokens has access to the same information that the insiders have ripple has been in some ways an easy target to kind of pick on as an example just because of their size and because of the outsized influence that ripple Inc has over x RP and that token treasury and if you go back to my January Post I started to think just top-down in terms of large projects that have control over their Treasuries and and outside control over the code base that's their networks are actually operating on and the goal was not necessarily to pick on them but to highlight some of the things that they're doing well in disclosures and some of the areas that are a little bit say pushing the envelope in terms of marketing language particularly given that X RP is held by a pretty large mass of retail investors and in the initial article that I wrote I highlighted a few things one ripple net and the messaging systems that that ripple has created for enterprises that are thinking about cross-border payments that doesn't require XRP and then the XRP currency which can be used as an addition to ripple net in order to boost liquidity for less liquid currency pairs and ultimately serve as they say as a potential bridge currency for institutions that are facilitating payments and in corridors that have less liquidity than something like you know the US dollar and euro and what you found from ripples marketing language quite consistently was there was a marginal benefits to using XRP in addition to ripple net versus just using other fiat currencies and at the same time you heard about a lot of bank partnerships where the insinuation was crawl walk run I think is it one of the lines at Brad Garlin house uses essentially suggesting that if banks are trialing and piloting this software they would ultimately use XRP in the future once they saw the additional benefits and and that's where I think the line starts to become a little bit blurry between how XRP is marketed and positioned and who actually buys and owns xrp it's not the institutions at this point it is very much a retail driven phenomenon in terms of the price action and it is still largely controlled and held by a very very small group of insiders and otherwise retail speculators that are buying it on exchanges particularly in Korea and Japan and other areas where ripples made inroads with large institutions like SBI which is a shareholder of ripple Inc and has said and tweeted some favorable favorable things about the currency for good reason because they have a vested interest in the company so I'm sure we're going to go into you know quite a bit more but I do want to say that it's actually not all bad and and if you read my initial critique of the company I said as much that in many ways you can disagree with some of the tactics you can you can wobble over whether they're over marketing the currency but out of the token issuers out there I believe that their quarterly market reports are among the most helpful and useful things that any token issuer puts out with respect to transparency over how they're managing their treasury tokens so there's I think good and bad and I'm sure we're gonna you know parse you know much of what ripple does and much of its you know behavior and and you know we can only conjecture about some of its strategic plans as you noted in the intro in large part because it's very difficult to secure an interview and ask and answer some of these tough questions but I think you know I and I'm sure Matt and you may end up leaving this podcast with more questions than answers my goal is to ask some of the questions with the hope that this gets enough traction that ripple will respond and and maybe even ultimately do a followup with you Laura yes well you're giving a preview of how I was going to end this interview but but let's get through all the other questions first so Matt tell us what you do and what your history has been with writing or reporting on ripple or XRP yeah sure and yeah I agree quite an intro big big lots of lots of stuff to unpack here I've covered market structure for Bloomberg News for about 13 years I was first in derivatives and fixed income and futures markets but in about early 2015 I understood blockchain finally I had sort of dismissed Bitcoin to my chagrin but when I got blockchain I understood that it would probably change the way that I write about these other markets the traditional financial markets like the bond market or futures and so I started reporting on it it was really aware the the intersection between market structure Wall Street and blockchain and in the future sort of dynamic that that all represents as your listeners know it's been a wild three years since then and I don't remember exactly how I started writing about Ripple but I do remember visiting them in San Francisco if Brad was not the CEO then it was mr. Singh yeah I was Chris at that point and I remember my first impression was that Wow here is a blockchain you know app or service is actually working you know because so much of what I was writing about and reporting on were you know ideas and sort of proof of concept stages and I felt like oh look ripple is actually moving helping to move currencies around the world but then at some point I think I started to dig a little deeper and I started asking just it started with myself I'm like well who who are the banks that you know they all the the announcements to come out sort of periodically about there's new banks joining the ripple Network and you know we now have a hundred more than 100 banks who are our customers and I I realized that I never you know if I started looking back and realized that almost in every single one of these statements it was that they were gonna test Ripple they were gonna they were entering a pilot program to see about XRP and so I just started wanting to answer the question okay is is there anything in the real world that's being done here and so that led me to one of the bigger stories I did and this was with my colleague at Robinson and we used our contacts at the major banks around the world who are you know basically the the market for cross-border payments and we went to them and we were able to talk to seven executives at these different banks who would only talk to us on background so I can't tell you who they were or the name of the bank but you know these are large global institutions that everyone would know the names of and it turned out that none of them were willing to use XRP and you know so we just sort of built on that and kind of came to you know we just wanted to sort of do what a reporter should do and sort of just check out what people are saying about you know claims that companies make and you know you know you you don't know if it's going to be positive or negative when you start but it's just it's just the journey you take as a reporter is to try to you know be a check they're on you know whether it's a politician or a company or or any else who is in a position of power so that's that's sort of you know that's what I would say when my reporting not real about ripple was you know sometime late last year and what were the reasons they were sighting for not wanting to use xrp so first of all it's a multi trillion dollar business correspondent banking and cross-border payments so it's a huge revenue stream for banks they have spent millions of dollars and hired hundreds of thousands of people around the world to staff these trading desks you know in far-flung regions of the world like you know in Thailand or down in Colombia and so that you know they're their customers who are you know global corporations who have you know supply chains that stretch over continents and need to send money all around the world need their their customers rely on the banks to be able to move money from New York to Bogota to you know Thailand and everywhere else in the world so there's a huge vested interest in that the banks already have in the sort of resources they've poured into it and the money they make from it on in the revenue sense then there's also the idea that XRP is rather volatile and is is new and it does face regulatory risk no one is going to come out and say the dollar is an invalid means of currency or Fiat but there is a risk that XRP could you know face regulatory scrutiny if that was embedded in your you know trans-national sort of cross-border payment system that would that would gum up the works then there's also the the companies themselves like let's say it's Toyota or John Deere or harley-davidson they're gonna be okay that if XRP this digital currency that many of them might not know much about is now in the middle of their their payment system and their supply chain so these were the reasons you know the main ones that we heard over and over again and it was striking how consistent the answers were from the different executives at these banks so we felt very confident that you know this was sort of the state of play at this point about whether XRP was was were working it's way into the banking system for the rest of the purchase I want to just make a few distinctions and let's just start with the basic one which is will it just to make make things clear going for it we'll call the company ripple and the token is X R P and let's also now differentiate kind of like what ripple does and how it's doing versus how X R P is doing I actually mentioned earlier that I had put ripple on the Forbes FinTech 50 list for three years in a row my take on what I know of the company is that I personally think they may be the leading enterprise election company or at least one of the leading ones from a phone tech perspective they made such huge inroads they have real traction with I think their website says 100 plus customers and 75 plus commercial deployments the investors I believe gave it a valuation of 410 million dollars last fall which I think if you contrast that with the 34 billion dollar market cap of x RP shows some difference there that's another way to differentiate between them and I just wanted to talk a little bit about you know as I mentioned what ripple does versus what X arpita's and one way to think about it is a quote from an article that Isabella Kaminski of the Financial Times wrote last fall she said X RP is entirely centrally controlled operating more like an ETF unit than anything else since the issuer has the capacity to release or absorb pre mined tokens in accordance with their valuation agenda more egregiously though the Tokyo plays little part in ripples central business case for the most part it's just a cute add-on let's unpack those criticisms and start with a question of whether or not x RP is really necessary for ripples products or whether it is indeed a cute add-on do either of you have an opinion on that well I alluded to this a little bit and you know my my opening statement there there was a graphic i'm not going to recall exactly which set of marketing materials that this was located in but there was a graphic that basically showed the cost of cross-border payments and it was something like you know 20 basis points for just using the current system and correspondent banks they noted there was a six basis point improvement from using ripple as just the messaging platform without xrp and that equates to about a 33% reduction in in costs the marginal benefit of adding ripple the messaging system with XRP was only an additional two basis points and again that's from the company's own marketing materials so you could argue that that's wildly optimistic and doesn't really take into account the volatility of the asset and even if they assume that XRP ends up getting much more liquid over time that's going to take quite a while and it's still not a slam-dunk that's using XRP as this bridge currency actually creates real cost savings what is pretty interesting and I know Matt picked up on this a little bit in one of those more recent articles is this is a company that essentially has a negative customer acquisition cost and that's just astounding for an enterprise software company but the reason I say that is they have rolled out programs where they offer 300 percent rebate on integration fees using XRP and this is public right they they outline this in their I believe their October markets report they have seated a 300 million dollar he goes to some development funds or ripple net accelerator they as Matt you know can speak a little bit more to this seemed to have agreements behind closed doors or are at least suggesting that they will lend XRP to market makers and other strategic partners basically at zero cost and the return of that capital could either come in dollars or XRP which is basically a free call option on the currency and you're talking about well money for their end customers their own targets with this currency for them it's funny money right I mean the this this XRP does not become valuable does not become a bridge currency it doesn't you know come anywhere close to growing into its current valuation unless it's properly distributed across the globe and so there are real benefits to getting making inroads and distributing this even if it's for free to institutions provided that those institutions signed some type of agreements where you know they're gonna hold X RP for some period of time you know whether it's a year five years whatever we don't really know and that's something that that ripples a company will not disclose because you know they'll cite confidentiality agreements but you can see just at a high level why some of their targets might also be a little bit cagey about participating in that because there's a very fine line between that activity and and a bribe right those incentives get that very murky very quickly and I would imagine given that retail investors are ultimately going to trade on those types of announcements and and and that type of news institutions would be very wary of attaching their name to that anytime soon that said it is real money right and you're in some cases may be talking about nine figures worth of potential revenue or more for some of these enterprises so it's it's conceivable that you'll get some of these institutions to bite and Matt I you know you have probably a little bit tat on that because of this story that bloomberg reported about ripple trying to get XRP listed on Gemini and coinbase the two crypto exchanges can you tell us what happened there yeah sure that was a story I wrote with my colleagues annie masa and Lily Katz we basically were able to report that ripple had gone to the two biggest maybe biggest her best-known US exchanges coinbase and Gemini and offered them different kind of so they offered Gemini a million dollars to list XRP and to coinbase they said we we would happily give you a loan of 100 million dollars in XRP so it's a hundred million dollars worth of XRP for you to list to list it on your exchange and when you pay it back to us you know you can pay it back either as a hundred million dollars or in a hundred million dollars worth of XRP so one of the things that's that's consistently driven up the price of XRP over the last year or so is the rumors that it's about to be listed on coinbase earlier this year I believe that which shot up something like 20% and that was a rumor just the coinbase was gonna list so I think this is somewhat prevalent and in the external exchange world in different parts of the world that for an ICO that somebody's trying to promote and that you know you want somewhere to have it trade so that the values can can can go up so you know we've seen reports between 1 million and 5 million dollars for exchanges like in South Korea or other parts of the world to list new ICO tokens the difference here is that this is this is X RP and it's been around you know I think since 2014 or maybe even earlier I think 12 maybe yeah sorry I think you're correct and it's got a huge you know it's got a valuation already it's the third largest by market cap in the world so we just found it rather amazing that you know that ripple was going through these lengths to get it listed on US exchanges and I wanted to go back because I think that sort of goes to Ryan's point about how some of this is a fine line between what they are offering and a bribe and I also wanted to ask Ryan something you mentioned rebates but I didn't know what that meant can you explain that sure I believe this might have been from the q3 markets report that's available on Ripple site but essentially what they had offered as an incentive scheme to encourage more enterprise experimentation with XRP was up to a 300 percent rebate for any fees that the institution would incur in actually implementing the system right so that goes back to the you know negative customer acquisition costs you in in in some ways in an enterprise sale cycle like this you'd spend quite a bit of time and resources and money on on this implementation but for ripple so much of what they're covering in terms of costs is going to get covered in XRP which is just this kind of company created currency it doesn't actually you know come off their their real balance sheet and get paid out in dollars so you know that is something that they have repeatedly referred to as a strategic weapon to encourage adoption certainly something that you know a legacy institution like swift doesn't have at its disposal or any other FinTech incumbent and it generally amounts to hey if you're an early adopter in XRP and we can really you know brute force this and create a snowball effect where we get a handful of institutions to experiments and then that leads to more institutions you know experimenting with XRP then then you can kind of fake it until you make it and actually bootstrap this as a true global reserve at least that's the pitch right the I think what is you know very much at odds with that pitch is that no institutions to my knowledge have experimented with this in any meaningful way and again we actually what we don't get from the markets report is a breakdown of who's trading XRP and I hope that as ripple adds other enterprise customers that are using XRP in particular they'll be able to report on a consolidated basis the amount of XRP that's being used in these institutional transactions versus the amount of XRP that's just being traded on on you know retail focused you know speculative exchanges and to go back to the question I asked earlier about Isabella convinced cos article where she called XRP acute add-on I did find a post that the ripple chief cryptographer David Schwartz had put on XRP chat and I'll link to this in the show notes he wrote there's a business that ripple has providing transaction processing software to banks it can work without XRP and without any blockchain tech and so given that what he said there and also what you guys have noted in your comments what you sense is the adoption financial institutions which ones are using xrp and how much adoption does I really have Laura I do think it's worth mentioning in you know in defense of that quote that is the first line of a much longer explanation and and David goes on to explain how XRP could get incorporated into that system and it's actually fairly cogent argument and it's something that I wrote in my initial post ICU XRP so you know as as an introductory line and something that supports what Isabel had written that that certainly seems to you know jive but there's quite a bit more context there about how exactly XRP can penetrate some of the corridors like you know the Euro and and Indian currency I forget but what's the Indian currency I'm Toronto applying everything rupee yeah the root beer right so and you know how ultimately as you get more currency pairs like that more institutions will have an incentive to not just hold you know dollars part of their treasury management but also XRP for the smaller corridors so I I'd encourage hopefully you can link to that full thread yeah there will probably it was probably the best one that I had seen that the company to communicated and it's from a while back and what do you make of that argument because you wrote a little bit more about that as well yeah I mean it's a plausible argument but in practice what that essentially would amount to you is all the correspondent banks just rolling over and saying you can take our business because there's this winning scenario that extra that ripple is as predicted or you know laid out as a proposal essentially amounts to creating a non-sovereign private central bank and putting themselves in a scenario where all of the other correspondent banks just you know adopt XRP and and everybody gets along and and you know they just forget about the many many billions of dollars that they essentially siphon off of the big banks who are essentially government's own businesses at this point so it's just it seems very well articulated as David had communicated it but highly implausible to actually pull off in practice and if this were you no token or currency that was trading you know a hundred million dollars or you know even a billion dollars you might be able to wrap your head around that from a risk-reward standpoint and it might make a little bit more sense but we're many many many multiples above that and and I don't think the company has done anything to tamp down that hysteria and let's not forget I'll just say it again it's not for the most part the banks are not sending money to other banks they're doing this for their customers who are global corporations like I said before so those corporations have boards of directors some of them might be you know entirely conservative and would never want to associate with one of these new digital currencies so even if you got the bank's to roll over like Ryan said which is a huge if you would then have to you know get them to convince their corporate clients like you know caterpillar or Audi or you know whoever you want to think of to to also buy into this and it's also it there's going to be costs if you're gonna inject XRP into the middle here that you can't have the volatility that it has currently that and that's that's gonna be a cost that if you're if Ryan if those figures are right like two basis points if you're hedging your XRP exposure you're you're gonna be blowing out two basis points you know before you even sign the first document by by an order of magnitude yes next we're going to discuss whether or not XRP is even legal but first I'd like to take a quick break to

or not XRP is centralized how do you guys measure that you've kind of hinted at that in different ways but is it who controls the nodes or the monetary supply or who manages the github I want to read this one quote I got from Aquinas article which says an x RP token is absolutely nothing like Bitcoin instead of needing to trust only the math Maddox of proof-of-work you can only trust the XRP token by setting up trust lines that almost inevitably end a triple and while in theory anyone can set up such a server if ripple does not include your server in their trust lines that you're not part of the consensus making process so what do you think do you do you think XRP decentralized I think you can use ripples own words they have a part of on their website about their efforts to decentralize and the conclusion says ripple remains committed to decentralizing the XRP ledger and investing itself of operational control at that point in october there were 25 validator nodes and five of them were managed and owned by ripple so what they're trying to do is as as time goes on here into the future they're trying to bring on third-party validators and they say for every two that they bring on they're going to get rid of one of the ones that the company itself controls I think there's been some cases in the history of ripple that should scare anybody who is you know thinking that that it's a Bitcoin like process where you really it's the the censorship ms is a strong component they had a dispute with one of the family members of Jed McCallum who was one of the original founders the family member sold about a million dollars worth of XRP to the company in 2015 and then ripple froze the funds and tried to get them they froze it at the node level and tried to get them the million dollars they had paid returned that that doesn't sound decentralized to me I also checked the github and I noticed that for the top 18 contributors all of them except one either work or had worked or consulted for ripple and the 18th person who had only contributed 0.2% of the commits of the top 18 contributors I think he doesn't work at ripple so so that was one other data point I wanted to put in there I know Ryan would have what do you think how would you measure this Jackson Palmer the dogecoin creator actually published an excellent site a little while back it's called are we decentralized yet calm and it kind of lays out all of the top 20 or so projects by whether they have minors and and independent nodes that are incentivized to process transactions what number of entities control the majority of voting and mining power what is the percent of the money supply held by the top hundred accounts and a couple of other metrics and out of the top currencies ripple is almost without question the most centralized in in whole ecosystem so obviously ripple controls the majority of validation today through their own unique nodes list according to this research from Jackson it's unconfirmed but I tend to think it was well sourced at least over 80% of XRP is held by the top 100 accounts that actually could be a little bit more because others at the company may have their own independent accounts but you could still argue that that's controlled by ripple and then you know obviously as you just pointed out Laura they contribute almost all of the developments to to ripple net and and and their other systems so I think it is very centralized now having said that I think you know where we are in the industry you know particularly with the kind of broader ICO ecosystem pretty much all of these projects are starting centralized and then gradually decentralizing or at least that's the plan and how that ultimately plays out in practice remains to be seen in that case I don't think ripple is unique and that it's centralized early and will hopefully decentralize over time but what is unique is just the sheer scale and and and size of their treasury which is you know if you look at coin market cap it can be a little bit misleading but on chain FX for instance has the estimate for the fully diluted token supply and by that measure ripple currently is about a ninety billion dollar market cap versus the 34 that's that's currently reported if you factor in their entire Treasury which you know for context puts them about you know just about 15% behind 20 percent behind a theorem in terms of market value so it's it's just stat the numbers are staggering right and that's why you know you kind of laugh at the marks that the VCS are trying to put on their books to to incorporate you know you know capture the value of the stakes that they have and ripple the company because you can make the argument that at some of these early investors and ripple are sitting on you know pro-rata rights to you know a ninety billion dollar currency that could be measured in the billions versus you know four hundred and ten million for the entire company which is the the mark that you'd referenced I think there's another one one interesting thing bit max did a good report on ripple and XRP back in January and it's a must-read hopefully you can link to that too Laura yeah yeah absolutely so for part of their research today doubt they downloaded the node software and they noted that all the five keys that they were assigned were downloaded from ripple so to you know that ripple was basically in control of this consensus system and that the bit Mex researchers also you know noted that they had an expiration so that they were gonna expire in a few weeks meaning that they had to go we would have to go back to the ripple server to get the keys again so I think I don't again that doesn't strike me as a decentralized platform yeah and some other stats I want to throw out there are that currently according to their website the percentage of X are piece controlled by triple is at sixty point eight four percent with fifty fifty four percent of all XRP being held in escrow and back when I reported on the net worths of Chris Larson the former CEO and the current CEO Brad Carling house Chris has at least at that time he had five point one nine billion XRP and his personal holdings and a 17 percent stake in the company and the current CEO had at that time nine figures worth of XRP nine figures in u.s. dollars back in December and he has 6.3% of ripple the company so one other thing I wanted to ask about is as far as I understand this this seems like a permissioned system and our tokens even necessary and permission systems like I was trying to think of other private blockchains that use tokens because to my mind a permissionless system needs a token to incentivize behaviors and they don't have middlemen but a permissioned system doesn't need a token since the actors trust each other and in this case we're ripples system basically keeps the middlemen in place and doesn't replace them I really don't understand what purpose the token has do you guys have thoughts on that you know my short answer is ripples unique beasts because they're the only company that I know of that is truly trying to build a private central bank that's really the only way that you can describe what they're doing and how they're issuing XRP to their partners and thinking about driving liquidity and in this new currency and you know if you think about it from a regulator standpoint there is a bit to like about that because it is centralized and you can you know very easily monitor transactions and you can more easily do ml and kyc on anybody that uses X Arpita currency through their regulated gateways but I don't I don't know of any other project that's you know quite taking this approach where they're very aggressively saying this is a money like currency not a token it's it is a true digital currency and we are going to centrally manage it and distribute it over time I don't know if this becomes decentralized just because they they distribute a certain percentage of the tokens this is still going to be a you know an issue or in a distributor of private money on a global scale if they get it right Ryan I'm looking at that are we decentralized yet website as well and I notice they have a number of public nodes and for ripple they have at 596 now how do you square that with the 25 validator nodes that the company itself says is out there does that mean there's 596 minus 25 that don't actually do anything in the system to kind of reach consensus I didn't source that data so I'm not quite sure but I believe that Jackson had a footnoted somewhere I believe if you click on it it takes you right to the ripple website and that's where they show you where the nodes are working around the world mm-hmm III wouldn't be able I don't know the difference this would be a question for ripple yeah maybe it'd be great to have someone from ripple on like the CEO I would say I mean I think based on my reporting and my colleague Ed's reporting I think ripple has kind of gone back and forth on on what XRP is and whether they need it or not over the years I think there have been times when it was central to what they were doing and then there have been times like when they develop triple net which is just payment or it's a messaging system that will compete with Swift that is doesn't use XRP at all and then I think they last year they kind of came back around to XRP one thing I think we should talk about a little bit is the lawsuit between ripple and r3 that involves an option for up to five billion XRP that was granted to r3 the strike price or the exercise price was it was less than a cent it was point zero zero eight five cent and that was so that the price that was done in September of 2016 what I found interesting I went back and looked at the the price of XR P at that point and and when they entered into this option x RP was closed at point zero zero seven nine six cent so very very close to the exercise price now what they were doing here in my opinion is in the lawsuit says this as well that it was our threes belief that the ripple was was trying to get the bank's that make up our threes Network to adopt it and and they were saying here like we here's X R P why don't you you know take it and and work with us I think they were hoping that that news that the banks that made up the r3 Network we're now you know taking on XRP and testing it and trying to use it in their systems would increase the value what I find astonishing here is that Ripple granted the option through September of 2019 so I don't know what usually an option you know in this kind of situation would have some sort of incentive effect of like let's let's work together let's get you know let's see fifty percent gain here and then this option is going to come into the money they basically granted the option in the money it was very slightly out and then the term that they put on it was astonishing to me because as we know I think it's high XRP went up to like three dollars and 20 cents so and just so your listeners know the reason there's this lawsuit is because ripple just sort of unilaterally said that the the option was cancelled and according to the option you know contract they didn't there wasn't a universal unilateral excuse me right to cancel the option but that's of course what's going on in the court battle which is still under way so I just I feel like Ryan's said it was funny money and I feel like ripple has treated XRP like funny money at certain points in its history and not as funny money and other points in its history one of the things so I'll just quickly end with Brad one of the interviews I did get with him on the record he told us that XRP is absolutely essential to their business well of course it's essential I mean it's got to be the lion share of revenue right now they made a hundred and seventy million dollars in revenue in q1 of this year from sales of XRP and I I would be shocked if that were anything less than 80% of the company's revenue now you know they won't disclose that because it's a private company but I think it's important to understand that and and you know I would love to see them actually disclose how important XRP sales are to the company's bottom line because I think you'll find that even if they had wavered and gone back and forth in 2015-2016 and in some cases essentially writing off extra RP as part of their business now that you know token sales came back in vogue and they recognized that there was this you know huge honeypot that they could tap not just for enterprise incentives as we talked about earlier but straight to the bottom line of their company the tune has certainly changed and I think you know you see that bear out with the r3 agreement right that was back in late 2016 right as they were starting to get XRP markets going and part of the forefront that's right around the time that they had hired Miguel vyas who who heads up back sharp key markets now and was tasked really with quote-unquote building liquidity in XRP and another way to say building liquidity is is increasing the market cap by increasing adoption and you know retail speculation so you know follow the incentives and and you normally get some pretty clear-cut answers yeah and just out of curiosity met Matt when did he say that to you thought it was central to their business because I imagine it was probably more in the 2017 era than like 2015 yes this was a for the December story that we ran okay yeah of course at the height of everything um so we have so much left to cover in a short time but just the two main questions I want to get to the first one is one thing I've always just wondered is why should everyday people own xrp if it's meant to be used by banks I mean this was the genesis of my initial post Laura the reason that a retail investor would buy XRP is is in anticipation that they're front-running stodgy old institutions that are just slower to adopt and and that is something that ripple the company and you know in their marketing they've done absolutely nothing to shy away from and in fact they've encouraged it and they've encouraged the insinuation that if you buy XRP it could be a very good investment because all of these banks by the way are gonna rush in and and and start to use it as a bridge currency and that means that the price is going to go up that means the market cap is gonna you know inflate it into the trillions and and you know you'll end up with a very good investment as a retail buyer they have an explicitly said that but you know you can you can review a lot of their language a lot of the interviews that have been done by executives and that that's the goal right and and you know that's why I use the term think it's you make it that's right now in an up in a bull market that seems to be paying off and I'm working out I I think that the the biggest risk of the company is is if we just have a bear market for crypto currencies in general and all assets start crashing across the board the plaintiffs bar and and you know the the the attorneys that are gonna have their teeth out in terms of class-action suits against all of the tokens and in particular rip will just given the sheer size of the currency and and and scope III think would be enormous so buyer beware I guess I I would agree with what Ryan just said 100 percent one thing Brad I think when so they make these announcements about new partnerships and one thing we haven't talked about is the remittance business or companies like Western Union or MoneyGram - you know you used to send money around the world that's obviously separate from the banking system so when ripple got an agreement with MoneyGram for them Brad you know tweeted out that you know money Graham agrees to use X RP and it's you know money transfer business now it didn't I covered that story and and what my money Graham is doing is it's a pilot program so they're testing it and it's it's these little Elijah pnes that i think are what they add up over time and i think they're troubling and i think if you're not a careful reader of the actual material that comes out you will think that all of a sudden x RP is in the middle of money graham transfers which is not the case so that's that's where i i think they could be more careful and i think i'm trying to let people know about what's really going on that's sort of the genesis of what i started getting into this about was like okay what are the actual real world uses right now so there's two two use cases that they're they're pointing out here one is the the cross-border payment system which is controlled by the largest banks in the world and the other is money transfer you know which is dominated by Western Union and a few other companies where does the retail investor ever have to touch either of those so I I don't have a problem with XRP being created or available but I I do think if ripple was kind of trying to disrupt these two industries or help them become more efficient they would sell directly to banks and they would sell directly to these companies that already have the infrastructure around the world for you to wire money you know back and forth to India or wherever I don't why why could I why can I go out and buy XRP I just I find that I frankly find that troubling I agree and to reference the MoneyGram thing one other thing I noticed is that the press release itself also said that monogrammed was quote using XRP and it was only in the quote provided by the MoneyGram CEO that the word pilot was used and afterward I noticed that the monogram Twitter account kept replying to different people who were super excited about this they were tweeting hello this is a pilot program being tested on internal MoneyGram processes and is not intended for consumer use and then to reference one other thing oat just to go back Matt did you ask Brad why individual why everyday people should own XRP yes and he said basically that they need it they need XRP to be liquid they need it to be available all over the world and they want it to be on as many exchanges as possible so that there's no trouble if for anyone who needs to use it that they can go out and get it which is completely backwards by the way normally normally you'd build liquidity through you know deep pocketed institutional investors in this case you know those enterprise users wouldn't use XRP until the market cap and the liquidity in the system is high enough so you're basically using the retail audience and less sophisticated purchasers to help make the case for the smart money now which is the total inverse of you know how you'd expect this to work and practice he also distanced himself from like he said well we didn't we didn't let that XRP get into the public sphere and I didn't quite understand and he said hey first of all we'll quickly tell you ripple as it exists today did not create XRP that was a predecessor company so they try to distance in sells that way and then he said you know we they some of this has gotten into the public sphere you know the you know over the years and and yet as Ryan has noted they in their quarterly reports talked about selling X RP and and and how much money they make in a quarter from from various sales so yeah again it's difficult to get good answers I wish we had somebody from the company on here who we could talk to you about this okay so we're gonna have to go overtime a little bit because we have not covered the most important question yet I hope you guys have a few minutes because we should unpack this and this is where I was going also what these questions about whether or not it's centralized the biggest question of all is is X R P and unregister six security and I've defined this on my podcast many times but I want to explain again the Howey test which is the main test that regulators use to determine whether or not a token is a security so according to this four-pronged test a security is one an investment contract to in a common enterprise 3 with an expectation of profits for with those profits being dependent on a third-party promoter and it's often this fourth prong where certain investments such as Bitcoin would fail because there isn't one entity you can point to as being responsible for the profits of that investment contract and a recent article that nathaniel popper of the new york times who is a former podcast guest that was a great episode you should check it out he recently reported that a former regulator and head of the CFTC Gary Gensler said that it's highly likely that XRP will be considered in unwearied security he cited the facts that ripple holds most of the XRP tokens and does most of the work to make it valuable as being the reasons it is likely a security so for both of you from your understanding of the Howey test and how it applies to tokens do you think XRP is likely a security well just practically speaking when the SEC and and DOJ go after the worst offenders in in the token economy and and you know the truly fraudulent offerings and the kind of slam dunk cases of unregistered securities offerings where there were explicit promises made to token holders and in some cases you know guarantees or you know proposals that an investment would lead to out size gains the the real easy ones those are the generally the cases that I think the regulators are going to want to take first because the first cases are not ones that they would like to lose so you know if you just look at ripples positioning strategically I you know given the the regulator's that they have on the board and and you know the size of the company and the resources they have at their disposal on a legal side you I mean it would certainly be eye-opening and and surprising but I just find it hard to believe that they would be the first you know easy target that the SEC would look at practically speaking one of my first managers always used to say you know if you go to a party you don't want to be the silver guy you don't to be the drunk guy right you just got to split the uprights and and and and in a token economy right if you if you just wait for permission and you try to do everything by the book when there is no framework that exists well you're probably not going to get very far you're probably gonna be able to push the envelope in terms of innovating the SEC is gonna be going after the drunk guys right and Ripple's certainly much more buttoned up you know we talked about some of the things that they do to mitigate some of their own risks including the markets reports and some of their transparency initiatives and the fact that they have a working Enterprise product then they have these enterprise pilots you know they can make a credible case that you know this is just part of their strategy and part of their playbook and they're doing everything the right way as if they are a money transmitter and and you know XRP is money and not a security so I I would be I would be shocked if this was something that that was handed down from on high and then not-too-distant future I just don't see it I think you know the company is maybe maybe gotten too big to fail in some cases because if you think about who gets hurt if the SEC did come out and and you know issue a C & D or you know try to bring some type of enforcement action against the company it's gonna be all these retail investors all these minnows that that purchased XRP more recently that are going to lose their shirts if a negative you know action came out yeah I would I would say none of my reporting indicates that the SEC is doing anything on our necks RPE being a security I think as a layperson and my understanding of you know just the similarities between the the securities that are coming out in a digital world whether through ICS or something like ripple and and an IPO you know it if you line those up and you think okay ripple created XRP out of nothing there's a hundred billion units and for all intents and purposes as Ryan as also said you know it's using the value of x or p2 for a great extent to to fund its business what you do in an IPO is you buy shares from a company so that the company can raise capital and grow its business continue to operate you know expand go into new areas it just looking at from that point of view where it wasn't it hasn't been mined it was it was pre mind I think and then the idea that there's no way around the fact that that ripple has used some of those proceeds from XRP to continue to function you know that those don't look positive to me of course there's so many other aspects that the SEC will look at and I think Ryan made a great point they are well connected like Ben lossky is on the board and they have you know resources at hand so Ryan is absolutely right the SEC is not going to want to bring a case that it's not you know it's not a slam-dunk and nothing in my reporting indicates that it's imminent it is interesting I think the SEC and the CFTC are considering whether ether is a security so it's just I think there's a lot of unknowns right now and it's hard to say which direction regulators are gonna take okay well we're definitely over time but I did imagine that we will hear from ripple in their own way after this episode so are there any questions that you would have for the company or the executives I would love to see a little more transparency they don't have to do this but you know where are the revenue streams coming from how much of their operation is using sales of XRP how much how much of the investor you know VC capital that they've raised is going to those uses I know they don't have to do it as a private company but that would be something I'd be very interested to ask them about Ryan I'm I'm sure you're gonna have quite a bit that you can cover with Brad after he hears this episode yes yes and he also has all my other questions as well so Brad the invitation is still open all right well
