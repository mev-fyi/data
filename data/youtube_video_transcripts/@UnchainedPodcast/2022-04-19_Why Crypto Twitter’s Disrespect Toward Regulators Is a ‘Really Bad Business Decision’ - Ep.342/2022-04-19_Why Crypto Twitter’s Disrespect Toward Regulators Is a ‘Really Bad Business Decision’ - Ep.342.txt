communicating with washington and how could it improve here to discuss are nikki kristoff founder of kristoff and co and chris lehane chief strategy officer at han ventures welcome nikki and chris thanks for having me really excited to be here thanks for holding this conversation with us so this is a midterm election year and the highest levels of government have been signaling that they are not only paying attention to crypto but have deemed it of high priority plus there's a bunch of new candidates that are running on crypto platforms and a slew of crypto advocacy groups in washington but before we dive into the meat of today's discussion let's have each of you describe your backgrounds so people can understand where you're coming from and what your expertise is on the subject nikki do you want to start sure i'll start thanks again for having me so i'm relatively new to crypto i started working with a d5 company about a year and a half ago and realized i didn't understand anything about d5 and had to get up to speed but my background is i was an attorney i worked in republican politics and i've spent the last 15 years working in tech at google for eight years at uber at salesforce for three years and then hung out a shingle doing strategic consulting which sounds like a fake job but helping tech clients communicate around advocacy issues based here in washington about a year and a half ago awesome uh thank you for having me uh or i know you've been in this space and leading for a while so thank you for both being a a voice but in particular substantive voice uh you know really leading some great conversations and uh nikki it's nice to actually formally meet uh you know over a podcast uh uh nevertheless but i think in some ways we've had sort of um maybe from the left and right at least we were left and right sort of mirror images career-wise so really briefly and i'm happy to get into the story to expect you have any interest but i got into crypto really through my two now teenage boys both one through uh gaming and the other um who had actually done some uh research on how you could use crypto to put a price on carbon and ended up having really interesting conversations with them about three three and a half years ago uh which sent me down the proverbial rabbit hole nightmares on the other side a true believer but my quick background i originally come out of democratic politics like nikki i like to think i'm a lawyer who fell up you know maybe fell down but i i do think i fell up i spent around almost eight years in the clinton administration first term working in the white house council's office and then second term was vice president gore's press secretary i actually went through the 1996 telecom act which i actually think has some echoes you know history's echoes right now eventually moved out to california in 2001 started my own consultancy uh representing did a lot of big ballot initiatives out here in california campaigns around the country and around the world i ultimately did a lot in what is now called web 2 when policies were really beginning to emerge on the washington dc and for those big tech platforms to navigate those a little sports entertainment work um and then ultimately in 2015 made the big leap and went in-house uh as part of the executive team at airbnb uh where i helped oversee the efforts to according legitimize the business across a hundred thousand different markets around the world when we started there wasn't a single legal framework uh really in the world um and uh by the time i left a couple weeks ago there were over eighty percent of our top markets have legal frameworks in them so i think some lessons from that for this space also mainstreaming you know something that was thought of as sort of a niche space back in 2015 you know is today a noun and a verb and so i oversaw the communications and the policy work and worked with an incredible team they're incredible founders uh i'm recording this podcast from an airbnb in my i was gonna i was almost going to ask if you're actually in a great airbnb in miami um and i hope it's treating you well uh that's great to see um it gets the job done that's good that's excellent and uh and at the end of um 2021 katie han who i had launched with christix in one of the early bc verticals in in crypto um and who herself had come out of a government background a prosecutor reached out to me and said she was thinking of launching her own fund we sort of thought of it as she described it as almost vc 3.0 a different sort of model or the next generation of a milo for a venture capital fund thinking of it more as a venture contributor fund her values contributor fund sorry and uh she shared her vision with me i told her it wasn't the best calls i'd gotten all year and anyone who knows katie knows that when you get a call you're going to end by saying yes and um and so formally joined the fund about a month ago maybe a little longer as the chief strategy officer and it's been like jumping on the proverbial rocket ship so really excited to be with with both of you today and having this conversation so thanks for having me so last month we saw that the administration published uh its long-awaited executive order on crypto and that was a real milestone because it finally means the government will try to put forward a coherent strategy for regulation however simultaneously you've got things like the securities and exchange commission chair gary gensler and the commodities future commission trading chair uh kind of jockeying for position and wanting to both bring crypto under their purview um we have people like senator elizabeth warren on what politico called an anti-crypto crusade so at this moment in time how would you kind of grade crypto companies and other crypto lobbying or advocacy groups on their efforts in washington and what areas do you think they're doing well where do you think they're failing how do you think they could improve it's sitting here in washington i'm about half a mile from the white house crypto came out of nowhere as a pay for and an infrastructure bill so really although there are some people in this town who know cryptocurrency stone cold including in the government not just technologists from a lobbying perspective and an advocacy perspective it came out of nowhere and all of a sudden people had to get up to speed people who know washington and i would put myself in this category i'd probably put chris in this category web 2 people and i have thoughts on how we talk about uh web 3 and the language around it but people who know this town had to learn the substance and the tech really quickly and get involved to help push back on some frankly sudden and poorly thought out provisions in a bill a must-pass bill so i think one of the things the industry has done really well is bring in a bunch of talent quickly and so there are a lot of smart people looking at this now from an advocacy perspective and helping tell the story and tell it to the right stakeholders in the right way i think that the messaging needs a lot of improvement the way that the industry is talking to washington needs a lot of improvement and i think often i see people talking amongst themselves as opposed to connecting with the right stakeholders so as far as what's happened like just to set the scene from a regulatory perspective you've now got a couple of republican senators who are going to be make it difficult for anything to pass in congress you do have senator warren on a little bit of a lecturing weekly she's got something to say almost every week the sec is a bigger issue because they can act just quickly through rule making obviously that's really top of mind the white house we recently saw president biden holding in his hand notes that chris probably could have written there were really excellent notes on the potential of crypto so i think we're in a moment where the stakes are really high there's a ton of attention on it you've got a lot of talent come that's new to crypto coming in to help sort it out but a lot of areas to to do a better job in this town and so if you were to give the industry a grade or the lobbying groups are great like what grade would you give them oh that's such i'd love to give a grade okay so i would say a plus in getting involved in washington if you're not at the table you're not going to be able to write the rules and they'll be written for you so a plus on that i'd say f minus on uh the spokespeople that they're using they need much better spokes people and use cases maybe not f minus maybe f um but really making i think the storytelling needs a lot of work to make it compelling to people who are in washington who have a very specific constituency right 435 members of the house of representatives they only care about the 761 000 people in their district and i don't hear a lot of the right stories resonating with that crowd maybe an f is harsh but i'm gonna stick to that as my grades you gotta be careful if you take professor dicky's class she's gonna definitely be a rigorous grader um happy to jump in uh so you know in many respects you always refer to things through your own sort of experiences um so bear with me on this it does feel to me a little bit like and this will tell you how old i am i i am it's a firm people call me the crypto dad so so i am the crypto dad um sometimes i like to think i'm the cool crypto uncle i'm really good uh but uh 2001 that i referenced earlier when you know the big name brand today many of them fangs really began interacting with washington dc had a similar feel even um when i joined airbnb in 2015 and there was you know almost every day massive coverage and conversations about the so-called sharing economy you know there that feels a little bit similar to me but i think the difference is that compared to those two periods this is even bigger and moving even faster those were either you know 2001 tech was not quite yet the actual economy right it was a part of the economy uh today it is the economy and you know even in 2000 and you know 1415 when the sharon economy was emerging it was still more sectoral as opposed to thinking about the entire architecture of the internet and by extension the economy and even you know even if you want to think about society and how society is organized and so i have really three core takeaways to your specific question i think first of all i think important to recognize that that executive order you know what we in washington or those in washington would call the eo you know it's a pretty significant moment uh given the fact that it is the white house under a president planting a flag that the u.s does want to lead on crypto slash web three and that executive order identified three things that are potentially challenges right how we think about financial instability how we think about uh quote unquote illicit transactions uh how we think about consumer protection but it also really emphasized some three incredible value propositions the idea that the us should be leading on innovation the competition um and competitiveness piece for the united states the economic inclusion piece um and so you do have the president really planting the flag and even given the way dc works um and nikki was smart to address this that you've had up to this point in time various agencies including the sec trying to lead on this this was really the white house saying the white house is going to lead on this and so when we can go deeper here if you want but it does remind me a little bit of 1996 before the clinton administration really worked with congress on the 96 where that would eventually became the telecom act which would have created the legal structure for today's internet there was a report done through the white house by a white house aide by the name of ira magaziner and you know ira started off a process that ultimately was a version of an eo where the clinton white house really embraced uh what the internet could represent for the future and took it in a very different direction um ultimately so i do see some some parallels to that i think secondly the political clay here is really still very soft you know what i am really struck by is that um you know both parties you know are ultimately i believe open to the value proposition of what this can represent now i think it's incumbent upon you know this space this movement to really articulate that communicate that and demonstrate that i think that really is speaking to the point nikki was making about the actual language the story the framing how we talk about this how we communicate about this and then the third piece i would say and i think to me this is at least from my perspective the most important and meaningful which is you know both nick and i have been in politics for way too long we both have our scars from it and anyone and everyone who's in politics always talks about the fact that you know they're part of a movement very rarely is there in fact an actual real movement underneath that sometimes it's grass top sometimes it's words only it tends to have a little bit of a cotton candy feel to it this is in fact an actual movement and it's a movement because of the social value proposition that is represented by it and it appeals to people both on the left and the right often for the same desired outputs maybe coming up from a little bit of different philosophical perspectives to enter into it but to me the next four or five months really through the midterms it is absolutely critical for this this space for lack of a better way to describe it to demonstrate in a way that's meaningful to elected officials that there is a crypto voter out there who matters at the end of the day my grand theory of the case and i'm not suggesting i'm necessarily right but it is certainly how i've operated is politics drives policy that drives regulations and that politics is foundational to it um and in the same way that a publicly traded company is evaluated by shareholders as to whether it's making money at the level that it's pricing that's priced at politicians care of whether or not they're going to be elected or reelected and because there is such a significant movement i mean polling shows one in ten voters you know whole crypto those voters are going to vote on this issue so they're in some level single-issue voters and their significant number if they can demonstrate their voice over the next four or five months through the midterms i think that then begins to sort of solidify that political clay in a bipartisan or maybe even pre-partisan way and sets up the politics going forward and so that to me is absolutely critical as we think through the midterms and look forward so but at this moment in time obviously some of what you said was kind of looking forward but right now what grade you're going to hold me to that grade i am benefited i have to say i benefited from having the opportunity to think about it as nikki was answering that question so i will give the proverbial duck i'm pretty blunt but i would give the proverbial duck on this i think it's an incomplete i think we're still in the course and i think that course plays itself over the next semester i'm rolling my eyes at that point in time it's an incomplete you're not he's a mr communicator he's a master communicator he's not going to grade his own clients so my kids go to these you know these schools in san francisco the bay area they give them rubrics you know before you actually get your grade so our rubric would be like you're doing well here you need the big work progress here so one thing that they're doing well with and one thing that they need improvement on then i think what they're doing well with is substantively engaging with what i would call sort of mid-level policy makers you know on the hill and the various agencies in genuine thoughtful substantive conversations as well as with sort of some of the civil society entities you know who are all part of the broader echo chamber um where i think we need to do much better on is you know ultimately the people who are going to be making the decisions here are those people whose names are on the ballot uh or whose party is on the ballot in some form or fashion and those folks knowing that this is an issue that will have a direct impact on whether they're elected or re-elected okay so there's another thing that i've been wondering about there's this whole plethora now of crypto lobbying and our washington education groups there's and and this isn't even a complete list coin center blockchain association crypto council for innovation hotel pack chamber of digital commerce d5 education fund web free forward gmi pack there's others obviously a16z you know has its own kind of powerhouse of former regulators i'm sure han ventures is kind of going the same route what's your sense of whether or not it's helpful or hurtful to have so many groups you know i there's two on the list where um you know one of them clearly was born out of the fact that some of the members were unhappy with what uh happened in that group you know the blockchain association uh allowed binance in and uh then coinbase ended up leaving and and you know launched the crypto council for innovation so you know what's your sense of like whether or not having so many groups means that they end up working at cross purposes or is it that they're um complimentary or what's your sense of that and this might even relate to nikki's storytelling point so i'm throwing a lot out there but yeah what's your opinion about all that so i well full disclosure i just recently signed on with the crypto council for innovation which has a new executive director sheila warren and so you know check me on my grade for storytelling with that group in a couple of months but i think that this isn't so i'm just disclosing that because you had asked about some of the politics between the groups i actually think this is i hear a lot of the group saying the same thing so when the eo came out you could just look at the statements from the different leads and they were all almost identical um which i don't think is a bad thing necessarily i think from a policy perspective a rising tide lifts all ships right so if really there's a lot of alignment i know there's proof of stake and proof of work and people might have slight differences but in general the industry is looking for a set of rules and regulations that are clear so that they can move forward with building their businesses getting their investments done helping move capital in a way that doesn't get you know essentially written down by a regulation they didn't expect so i think from a policy perspective everyone is trying to row in the same direction i think that having a bunch of different spokes people in you know in a perfect world you see like the different industries the mpaa right hollywood they have one association tech which i've worked in for years and years we used to really just have one the internet association which is now gone and there are splintered groups with the industry in a circular firing squad so i think that the number of groups is not really problematic as long as everyone again is rowing in the same direction even if they come at things from a slightly different angle a bigger concern would be if they start aiming at each other and in a way that is unhelpful overall to the industry and i don't really see you see it a little bit but when it comes to how they're interacting with the agencies i don't see a ton of that so maybe that's a little bit of a dodge but i think so you can be more effective if you have one giant trade association for an entire industry but that's just not how this is and it's not even how tech is anymore yeah look i come out of the democratic party which you know could generously or charitably be described as a mosaic on its best days and uh you know the beauty of the mosaic coming together and i do think you know uh if you think about web 3 and you do think it is what the future architecture of the internet is going to look like and as we talked earlier the economy then it is by definition going to be a mosaic um you know i do think uh and i agree with with nikki that you know various entities did a i think a really great job in and around the eo you know in speaking with a consistent forward-looking voice on that i think that is a signal or a function of uh of the space and those who are engaged in policy and speaking on behalf of it um you know really becoming increasingly more sophisticated in terms of how they're engaging and talking about these issues still a lot of work to be done but i do think that that was a pretty powerful uh sign of it and i guess um to mix my metaphors here if you think of this as a symphony you know there's different instruments that can play different sounds and they all come together and i do think um that is probably consistent with with the nature of the space and what i have been struck by and and you know both of you have been nicki a little bit longer than me or you've been much longer but what i am consistently struck by whether talking with founders whether the folks who are involved in policy on this is that there is generally a shared ethos um in terms of of excitement for something that is going to be less centralized for something that's going to be trust based and open and transparent and accessible that allows for people to participate in their own economics in a fundamentally different way and so i do think that that ethos just does course through all of this and i do think that that actually helps bring folks together again people are going to come at it with some of their own philosophical perspectives but i do think generally some of those thematics are you know tend to be you know very much the consensus within the space yeah it's not clear yet if they've gotten all the lawmakers on board with that idea but um one you know speaking of kind of relationships with lawmakers i do often see tweets by crypto executives or even sometimes former regulators who now work in crypto lobbyists and other people in industry where they will tweet things and they'll even tag somebody especially people who are kind of anti-cryptos such as gary genser or senator elizabeth warren and in those tweets they will be calling them names or mocking them and then thousands of people will like and retweet these tweets and it i could just imagine it leads you know the notifications of you know gensler and warren to fill up with these tweets that basically make fun of them or are downright hostile to them what do you think of that strategy first of all i think some of this is somewhat just a derivative of how social media works um and ultimately what your goal is as someone who's on social media if you're trying to you know generate as many likes as possible go viral you know there's certain ways you can do that um that may be really uh constructive for what you're trying to build in terms of a following um but not necessarily always the most constructive thing in terms of the actual discourse um particularly when you think of you know who some of those targets may be in some ways when you engage that way it's actually only helping them with their politics right you always anytime you go into negotiation or conversation this is certainly the case with an elected official or someone who's a high-level political appointee like what is it that they're trying to solve for who is their constituencies who do they care about and yes you can preach to your own choir and your own base but in some ways that actually may then be counterproductive because it positions them with their audience uh in a way that just sort of reinforces everyone going to their separate corners um you know i did a tweet yesterday um at the sec and the gensler you know i began it by saying respectfully and uh and then you know the the thread was basically in response to uh the sec had said that they wanted to ask four questions uh about crypto and i thought those four questions basically presupposed the answers and if you look at the four questions they were asking it was basically taking you know the three challenging uh elements of the executive order the illicit transactions the stability um consumer protection but not the three positives that that the uh that the president had put out and so i said well you know you have to begin with asking the right questions and let's ask questions about what's fundamentally wrong with our financial system right now particularly the sec you know uh when it comes to access when it comes to the underbanked um when it comes to uh you know transparency to deal with money laundering so not to say that my tweet is the the end-all and be-all it's just like i tried to make it as substantive as possible on issues that matter particularly if you have a d next to your name or if you're in a if you're in a democratic party because i do think that there is an incredibly powerful progressive argument here that needs to be made and i do think sometimes there is a mindset in government where you always want to go back to old rules for a new thing where that mindset really needs to be especially if you're a progressive a progressive believes in government making progress for society by definition that means you should not be defaulting to old things that have not worked to the extent that you believe our current financial system is not really serving that broader constituency and um and so i do think that you need to make substantive arguments that actually are filtered through the politics of who you're communicating to and position and frame it as such nikki what about you i'm glad you asked this question about crypto twitter and and some of what we see and i saw chris's tweet that started re respectfully and i note it's notable because i do think a lot of the language used toward regulators on crypto twitter is disrespectful calling the chairman of the sec a vampire or goldman gary or calling lawmakers luddites it's not an that is not an approach that is business advancing so it depends what your goal is right if your goal is to get likes and retweets and attention that might be that might work and i'm not a social media expert but if your goal is to influence policy in washington dc in brussels that language is counterproductive good manners cost you nothing being disrespectful may cost you something and i think it's a really bad business decision now i also have i was going to say something vulgar but instead i'll say echo chamber for how i would describe crypto twitter and i have this hunch that everyone's talking to themselves about the same thing and i actually meant an advisor to this company it's an ai powered data visualization company called graphica and i asked i said i have a hunch that crypto twitter which is this echo chamber is not actually overlapping with dc influencer twitter can you just like pull the data really fast and they did pull it for me and in fact that is the case so whether or not senator warren's social media staffer or gets a lot of notifications is neither here nor there if the tweets that are going out by these really important actors ceos investors venture funds on twitter aren't being seen in an effective way by the right people so there's a disconnect you know only 10 of americans are even on twitter now a lot of reporters are on twitter but again you sort of it's one i think the tone that i see is not business advancing it's not being full adult and it can play into some negative stereotypes about the industry and it's also not even the messages aren't even landing with the right audience and the data shows that so i'm going to do a little more work on pulling that and i'd like to think about it a little more but that was my hunch and it does show up that there's almost no overlap between the people talking and who they want to tell a story to okay i hope that you put the results a twitter thread at some point i'm going to put it in a twitter thread and i'm going to say respectfully comma crypto twitter you guys need to hear some but i am planning to do it because i had that hunch and then i'm i'm getting some data to confirm it because again whatever you're saying needs to be the right message aimed at the right people and i i don't see that on twitter right now yeah if i could just extend out a little bit at least share my additional thought on this which is 100 right you're you're speaking to your the choir or speaking to the um you know a fairly discreet circle um oftentimes on twitter just by the very definition of how how it works but but let me give a sort of what i would think of as maybe a really practical thing to think about which is you can spend an enormous amount of time on twitter and um it may have some impact it may not all the things that nikki said it's 100 right i'll tell you the one thing that you could potentially do and hopefully this does not sound presumptuous but if you wanted to impact um the politics on this which is and nikki will know this and nikki should jump in if she has a different view but you know every august members of congress have a couple weeks off um and they will spend that entire time doing town halls uh those town halls are particularly important in an election year which this is particularly important in an election year where there's five or seven states that will determine the senate and where there's roughly 20 maybe 40 house districts that will determine who controls the house but no matter what every single member even if they're in a safe district for the most part goes back and does these town halls and in addition to tweeting out if you actually showed up at one of these town halls and just asked a question about where member abrc stands on crypto and web three five or ten people showing up at each of those town halls will in and of itself dramatically shift the politics on this because every member will then come back from their august recess they'll all talk amongst themselves and they will have seen that there are people who are literally voting with their feet you know a version of the african proverb to show up at these town halls and express themselves and because there is a real movement that should be something that folks can do and would have a huge impact so i do hope that folks think about that um because i do think that that is a way to demonstrate that there are people who really care about this in the way that actually is meaningful to those elected officials i think chris talking tactics is really smart because um and this is i don't want to seem like overly that i've been observing chris's career from afar for a while but when he joined airbnb so again i'm in dc almost overnight if i stepped foot near the capitol complex i would get a targeted ad featuring a host an airbnb host who lived in southeast dc or anacostia explaining how and and home sharing in dc especially this was a market that was really hostile and remain somewhat hostile to airbnb you'd get an ad of someone saying i'm making money by renting out an extra bedroom or a basement apartment so it was the right messengers the right message and it was so strategic i mean it was you could see it was geofenced in this town like you'd walk you'd step you'd get the ad so it was a really effective campaign chris i mean and i i remember observing and being like damn this is good this is really good um and i think at uber when i was at uber we did things which i would also encourage these companies to think about if you don't want to go to a town hall in person which some you know a lot of people who are active in crypto are very online we would encourage we would just put into the app their their legislators phone number reach out to your member of congress and just get that sort of grassroots movement contacting them directly so instead of spending time on twitter i think you can think tactically to chris's point about activating the politics behind it and if you are going to speak directly to electeds using online tools take a page out of the airbnb playbook which was really effective all right so this has been so fascinating we are going to talk in a little bit about the number of pro crypto regulators who have moved

pro-crypto regulators who have gone to industry we've seen former sec chairman jay clayton acting chief of staff mick mulvaney trump occ chief brian brooks trump cftc chair christopher giancarlo former cftc commissioner brian quintenz obama's ambassador to china and former senator max baucus there's so many and what's your sense of whether or not this just kind of leaves behind all the anti-crypto regulators or in general like what is the relationship that regulators tend to have with their former colleagues who have gone to industry can those people be effective once they are on the outside i don't know that i would describe the people in the buildings in washington treasury sec when you're thinking of the staff as anti-crypto i actually think that there's a lot of benefit in having financial regulations in general set aside crypto financial regulations in general are incredibly complicated other than health care and transportation it's the most regulated industry we have so having people who really understand how the staff works what they need to see what the rules are this is a jurisdictional gray area which is going to take some expertise i don't think there's a downside i think it's fine for people to have been public servants and then go into the private sector and take that expertise and help get the strategy right but i think you're right that's some of these funds are stacked like cordwood with former former regulators but i think there's plenty of people left in the buildings and it'll actually help connect the tissue between the funds especially who have people and people at these companies and who's left in the buildings but there are plenty plenty of staffers still left who are going to need to learn and get up to speed and will they'll be able to speak the same language so obviously as we mentioned before this is an election year and we are seeing a number of congressional candidates that are taking up pro crypto stances and they're generating new donations for themselves as a result but watching this i do remember that in the 2018 midterms the left was kind of jazzed up about trying to counter president trump and they kind of donated to a lot of candidates but then the people in those districts didn't actually vote for them and so it was sort of this conception of like outsiders trying to influence these elections so i wondered you know in this case where we are seeing crypto people trying to support these different congressional candidates does that just backfire because it makes it feel like outsiders are trying to have this undue influence in the local district or do you feel that every dollar or bitcoin or ether or whatever matters no matter where it comes from nikki you want to jump in and i'll go after you matt you and i may have this may be the place you and i may diverge a little bit but this will be an interesting conversation part of the conversation i have a feeling we may diverge and by the way chris is the only one of us who has worked for someone who actually got elected president so uh here's i've seen obviously there's a lot of people who are bitcoiners running for uh or not just that's sort of a nomenclature for a few of the candidates but crypto enthusiasts running for office and you are now starting to see pacs stood up to give to these candidates and but we know 90 of incumbents are re-elected so i think i would think very carefully before i would write a check to someone challenging an incumbent i think it might be a better use of money to write a check to an incumbent and get your message and get your moment in front of that person to make your case because we just know that's just the way politics is the incumbents almost always win and if you endorse an opponent you're going to potentially create an enemy so in general try to give to the incumbent if you can unless it's a race that's up for grabs i think that chris made a really good point about if there are people who are one-issue voters getting that message out and and money is necessary in politics um so again like i think it's fine to give money i think it's a really good way to make sure your message gets out there make sure that people are hearing it but i would be really thoughtful about endorsing so-called crypto enthusiasts over someone who's likely going to retain their seat yeah i think actually we're we're probably pretty close on this uh uh which maybe says something pretty powerful um you know that the building block elements um uh of of campaigns politics you know message uh money masses right that those are sort of the three elements that think about it really in simplistic ways but i think for the for those in web 3 in in crypto you know i said earlier that the clay is still soft here um some have described it as a pre-partisan environment and you know that's eventually going to evolve and i do think there is a window here to evolve from pre-partisan to actually bipartisan which would make this one of the few issues um in the entire country that could actually be bipartisan and that is to me the opportunity that is in front of of all of us right now and so i would totally agree with nikki's point which is i would look at races that i was going to engage in that would either fall into a couple different categories you know are there primaries so it's a d or an r on r or maybe one candidate is perceived as really being pro crypto and maybe the other reason i frankly don't think there's going to be that many uh of those types of races but to the extent that there are great if you want to get involved with with those i think you know better to spend you know time and effort on demonstrating uh to those folks who are going to be running this year that there are voters out there who really do matter that means showing up at these town halls that means you know raising money particularly for incumbents um you know i forget what the last stat is but you know well over 90 i think 95 percent of incumbents get get re-elected um and thinking about you know who those incumbents are going to be that are going to be in and this gets down to sort of tactical brass tacks but this matters who's in leadership who is sharing which particular committees who's sitting on which particular subcommittees and really beginning to think about that in a fairly sophisticated way uh in terms of of who you're supporting and how you're thinking about it uh right there are three open seats that are gonna very likely go republican you know missouri missouri maybe because of some of the primary politics but likely you know why only uh oklahoma like those are three interesting areas to think about um because there's gonna almost by definition be a winner from one party and an opportunity to get in in there uh early and then really using the message piece of this which is you know to really talk about uh why crypto does have a a real impact on issues that those running for office should care about but as nikki has talked earlier to do it in a way that actually an everyday person could be able to understand um right this is an opportunity to actually participate as an owner in our economy for your labor to actually get rewarded in a more fair way i mean that's an argument that works you know i'm more familiar with the left but works on on on the left a more transparent a more accessible system you shouldn't have to be paying enormous fees to even get access to the financial system but but actually communicating why this should matter again i'm talking from the left or from a democratic perspective right now but why that should matter for someone who's running and then i think there's going to be a couple races where there's some interesting folks who are who are running um that would potentially be worth thinking about you know you have um pennsylvania senate primary where you have um you know someone who's you know very progressive who has you know really begun to sort of look at crypto in an interesting way lieutenant governor you know from a former bernie sanders supporter like you're john federer you're getting to see excuse me well i forgot his name it's betterman john fetterman um right but you're beginning to see i will share one story i'm not going to say who it is because i will i don't want to violate any uh any any privileged conversations uh but i was talking with someone who was running statewide um a democratic side they were sort of neutral didn't really completely process what what this represented i shared with them that one in ten voters are crypt i also shared with them that six and ten crypto holders voted for joe biden um and that it over indexes on people of color particularly latino and and black uh voters um and so i put it on your next poll this candidate put on his next poll it popped for all the obvious reasons and um again without revealing too much i think this is a kid that has now really begun to talk comfortably and is embracing that social value proposition for web 3 uh because that person has now recognized that this actually is a winning political argument like i actually think that if we can do the the some version of those town halls in august and get candidates to start putting this on their polls once they start to put this on their polls the raw numbers are going to break through and these are and these are voters who do really care about this and once this starts to get on their polls that then translates into the politics here yeah actually you know i'm glad that you brought up this issue kind of especially in the light of democratic politics because i was surprised to read the following in this recent washington post article in the 2020 elections crypto workers gave more than 730 000 in direct contributions to democratic candidates and party committees nearly nine times what they donated to republicans according to an analysis by the center for responsive politics so this was fascinating to me because i'm sure you're well aware that there's this perception that the crypto industry is more closely aligned with republicans so do you have a sense of like why there is this disconnect or is it just that there isn't a disconnect and democrats just received more crypto donations because it was perceived that kind of trump was losing power um and you know they were it was like a more cynical kind of donation where it's just they were like oh the democrats are rising in power we should donate to them or yeah i mean i'll jump in and then nick and you should certainly share obviously your perspective um i think obviously there's always you know that cynical element right and it's probably less cynical and more just the political reality of who's in power um and who's in these leaders leadership positions but i do think it goes deeper than that you know i do think that you know as i said 60 of of crypto holders are biden voters so i think ideologically and philosophically i think it's fairly well distributed and so it should not be that surprising that people who began as democrats are giving as democrats i also think there's a third thing going on here which is uh there's a generation of democrats and there's a little bit of a generational divide you know in the same way there is just a generational divide on web 3 writ large but you know you see a cory booker or richie torres richie torres congressman from uh new york his district is adjacent to aoc's district um senator booker uh you know really uh a great senator from from new jersey but both of them are forward-looking folks but also both folks who really care about uh progressive arguments when it comes to economic participation for communities that have typically not been able to be full participants in the us economy they have come to it you know through those issues and not surprisingly both of these guys are incredible retail politicians like torrez is in diners and i'm you know walking through his neighborhood you know every weekend you know corey lives you know in these neighborhoods and spends time talking to people who talk about this right they actually have a real sense of it you know both nicki and i have been in politics i think one of the you know in tech they always talk about signals right a b test signals you know the signals for at least the democratic side and politics are where the mayors are right because mayors tend to really be that first sort of early radar sign of issues and it's a single a single-issue voter is that what that means or what does that mean by signal i mean just like a political side like advanced radar like you're getting pings that there's issues out there signals i'm sorry i was mixing uh different definitions but but those mayors are picking up the power of this issue for their constituents as a reason and eric adams in new york are francis suarez in miami mayor of reno i mean urban mayors mayors from smaller towns they're all picking this up because they actually have a direct connection to their constituents and to their voters and so i think there are reasons why you have seen that type of distribution of the contributions and it's not just purely because the democrats are currently in power it is because their voters actually do care about this and those signs and signals are being picked up by those elected officials particularly the ones who are really talented yeah i have to say i'm a fan of cory booker because i have known him since i was 16. i did stanford summer school and he was my r.a and even back then like you could tell he was very special um and i continue to think that that's really funny some my wife who will kick me now but you know she and uh and cory were at stanford together and and certainly friendly at stanford so you guys may have all overlapped and i went to amherst college with his twin brother carrie who is really talented so this is a this is a booker loving right now but uh but you know but yeah but but pretty naturally i mean when you first met him like everyone like you immediately knew like he had that sort of intangible quality yeah yeah no it's it's fascinating because of course now he's such a superstar but even back then when i was 16 like we all knew there was something special and different about it but like any really smart talented politician has the ability to um like most politicians sort of follow where the voters are you know good politicians get a sense of where the voters are going uh and sort of get there at about the same time and really really talented politicians get a sense of where those voters want to go and it helps lead them to that place and i think you know i think he and torres by the way richie torres is incredibly talented as well uh you know both have i think that that quality and that's and i think you're seeing that um and the reason why they've emerged as leaders on this so nikki did you want to talk about whether or not there is this disconnect between this reality of kind of where crypto voters are politically versus um the perception or i would connect this to messaging right and storytelling instead of just necessarily the raw politics and by the way i know the mayors are for it but it's also sexy like it might be that their constituents are interested and then they're like notifications just blow up it's sexy um i'm waiting for saturday night live to incorporate bitcoin into mayor adams's next uh swagger sketch because i do think it adds some not in a bad way i mean it is it's a cutting edge issue just showing familiarity with it is a smart political move it's astute but the three categories of voters i think are really important have to do with messaging and where i think there's an opportunity one which chris mentioned these groups but one is latino voters right so if you have a diaspora community from el salvador people who are working here have paid you know paid taxes on their money and are sending it overseas to family and to relatives they're paying a huge fee for that that's a great use case for crypto i think that's one story that should be told and those are voters hispanic voters really really matter to democrats independent voters so chris mentioned joe biden voters being democrats i'm a joe biden voter i'm not a democrat so i think you get independents who have sort of a centrist light touch regulatory framework who are also really interested in having potentially some competition in the currencies that we can use in my cash app i can choose dollars i can choose bitcoin um and that appeals to me as someone who has a little bit of a libertarian streak and then independence and then i think the third are people who feel that and because it is that the financial system is rigged so i've had to pay bail money for a relative i'm not proud of that but you you're paying a huge fee to western union they're not taking credit cards and so if you've ever had to deal with with bail bondsmen with overdraft fees with all of the ways that the system is rigged in a way that is more punitive to the people who can least afford to pay extra fees that's another really good use case for this situation that also appeals to voters that democrats don't want to lose so i think if you start to tell real stories rather than theoretical stories and you tie them to voting groups within the districts where people are running that's a really effective in my opinion way to approach this midterm election and chris made a great point we're in the thick of it we have four or five months and this is the moment to land that just right because it is going to determine who's on committees and how they talk about this going forward yeah let's tag on two things you just prompted me as you were with your smart comments um the first i think all the use cases nikki described is right i think it's really important that those founders and platforms and protocols are out there that are doing some of this type of work that they really demonstrate it in concrete ways so that these are we evolved from being aspirational to people seeing the actual utility i do think amongst the things that's happened in the last two months and i actually believe um have reason to believe had a significant impact on the executive order was people seeing the utility of crypto in ukraine you know the fact that 100 plus million dollars was you know million crypto dollars got into got into ukraine almost instantaneously more than the you know usaid was able to get in there in that same time period the fact that ukraine had a framework that they could actually use this apply it and then actually buy hardware and needed stuff in the moment the fact that something like our weave created a way to be able to document in an immutable way you know potential war crimes all of those things happened and people sort of saw the utility of that so everything that nikki described as 100 right and how we think about elevating those founders and protocols platforms that are actually doing this type of work so people really see it um and even getting really smart and putting that into some of the districts and states on members who are going to really matter ohio and west virginia are important states you know when you start to think about you know who's going to be making what decisions you know off of the hill and the last thing i will just say you know if you're an elected official or wanting to run for office most elected officials particularly the federal level are coming from districts where the races are frankly won and lost in the primary what's really interesting about crypto is it applies to both those folks running them primaries because they are one issue voters and it does really you know evenly distributed more or less across political lines but because they're also one issue voters in this much smaller subset of races that are genuinely really sort of competitive general election races whether in the senate or those house seats these also end up being actual swing voters because they're going to vote on this on this issue and it's 10 of the electorate and so just like it's a raw tax raw politics of this it matters for the primary and it also matters in a general and that's pretty unique for a subject for a policy issue which then goes to part of the you know the political power that really exists here so many people on the left have been confounded by elizabeth warren's anti-crypto stance since it's perceived that the web 3 ethos would be aligned with her kind of anti-big tech anti-big bank platform if you were to have a meeting with elizabeth warren today on crypto how would you approach that discussion to try to persuade her of its merits do you want me to take that into nicki i have not had yeah conversation with her about this i've been in rooms with her before and i've had conversations on other policy issues and and i would you know begin with the predicate that she herself has identified you know i don't think there has been and to her credit a more eloquent voice and a more powerful voice against both legacy gatekeepers and even some of the newer gatekeepers that exist who have you know created um and contributed to a system where 10 of the country holds 80 something plus percent of of the value of wall street and there there are structural issues that will that have allowed that and will perpetuate that she has talked about it is sort of the center of um it's why she ran for office in the first place um and has been the center of her political philosophy and what she's all about her organizing principle yeah so i i know you haven't talked to her about this but do you have a sense of like why is she let me here's how i would then go to the conversation now then i'll address why i think that that exists obviously i don't know but um and i think you know really trying to have a dispassionate but logical conversation about the fact that you know what web 3 represents is the ability to just use technology to fundamentally disrupt for humans and not at the expense of humans by actually allowing you to circumvent those historical structural blockers that exist if you you know there has not been a meaningful recalibration again i'm talking from a left perspective from an elizabeth warren perspective you know there has not been a meaningful recalibration of the relationship between capital labor government and society really since the new deal and the new deal was developed for an industrial age we're in a digital age and how do you recalibrate that to get the type of results that she wants it is not going to be applying these old rules to this new thing this is the biggest opportunity that has come along to fundamentally restructure that relationship to provide and put in place and facilitate a more fair and more open and more just a more equitable society and i think walking her through that in in a way that could be as dispassionate and logic based and fact-based as possible i she is someone that does care about those issues um now the why i think that um first of all i think there's just generational aspects to this uh i went through this with airbnb i'd walk into these congressional offices and i'd have this conversation and people said it's really weird why would anyone ever want to rent you know their house out and then i would do two things i would point out that probably at some point in their life they had rented out a beach house or a lake house it wasn't any different and then they sort of think about that and then i would say let's ask your staff right and virtually every staff member raised their hand as being active users um and i would say go ask your kids and it would inevitably be that their kids were active users i think there's a dynamic of that generational aspect uh that applies here i would strongly suspect that there are people who are younger generation who are war and supporters who probably have a view that's very similar to the view that i'm expressing and espousing about the power here um and i also just think that um uh that sort of the way that you know the politics are sort of being played here a little bit and frankly some of the um and we talked about this at the very beginning and nikki i think was great on this some of the attacks that have come in and sort of pushed her you know further and for further to really dig in here there was a hearing i think was two weeks ago um where you had i think the ceo of chain analysis um who was yeah right being asked a question about you know whether there was any you know evidence of you know money laundering and crypto being used and uh you know he tried to answer the question ultimately gave a really powerful answer and to his credit you know remained amazingly calm as he was consistently interrupted by by her you know i and she is someone you know in the past who's always approached things with an intellectual rigor and intellectual honesty and and i do hope that we can go back to that place um his answer was really compelling no there isn't any information it's not public blockchain we actually can use this to actually build a much better system than the one that currently exists where there's enormous amounts you know five to ten percent of the global gdp you know suffering from money laundering that's in fiat not in crypto uh so hopefully she gets to a place but i do think part of this is gonna be ultimately stakeholders and constituents entities that are relevant to her politically that she trusts you know beginning to have some of those conversations i think that may begin with some of her colleagues that younger generation engaging on these issues and building conversations that way i don't think attacking her is going to necessarily contribute to that movement it also just may be the case and this happens in politics that you have you know the democrats end up sort of being somewhat bifurcated by generation on this and i think republicans tend to come to this a little bit easier again nikki can speak to that better than i can but but even getting the democrats with some on board some not some somewhere in between you know that's that's progress on this issue because our politics we do live in a liberal democracy and it is based on participation and is based on different views so nikki if you're going to meet with senator warren this afternoon how would you approach the discussion so if i were going to meet with senator warren this afternoon i would probably bring to her a statistic that i find appalling which is that not just a majority of women in this country but a vast majority of women in this country have absolutely no investments none retirement accounts other investments is something else you know i should start posting to twitter maybe i'll start posting my analysis i had a friend crunch the numbers second thread you have two threads now after this conversation but what i'm finding and what i think um would be a compelling argument potentially for senator warren is the idea that there is a risk aversion among women but also there is lack of access to institutional investing through different retirement accounts and otherwise so most women in america have absolutely no investment and if cryptocurrency offers a gateway into something that can earn some sort of return why wouldn't you be in favor of that and there's a paternalism that i hear at times coming out of senator warren's office and and from her testimony and her comments around people shouldn't be subjected to scams and losing money but instead i think really thinking of this as an opportunity to get people who are not in the investing world who are not in the capital markets who are not able to join a pre-ipo tech company who are not able to they're not an accredited investor with the amount of wealth you need this is an opportunity for them to start to touch one of our greatest natural resources in the united states right which is dough and so if they can start making money there are there are disadvantaged groups and groups that are not included in women as a is a really strong use case for this that this might just be a small entry point into partaking in that wealth building and i think that's a really compelling maybe i'm i'm not from the left so i'm probably maybe that wouldn't be compelling to her but i think that there's something to be done on looking at who is left out completely of the investment opportunities in the united states and how this can be one easy accessible way for them to put a toe in that water and earn a little bit of money all right so we've covered a whole range of topics but obviously as we've been discussing you know this is the midterm election year we do have this new executive order the government is going to be coming up with its coherent strategy for crypto what are you going to be looking out for in the next like let's say year or so in terms of developments like what are things that you're watching and um you know things that you're kind of hoping for in terms of crypto lobbying and crypto policy changes well i think i mean again all the action is going to be in the agencies and you've got chairman ginzler i think is uh has an eye toward treasury i think he's auditioning a little bit for treasury secretary this is just a prediction i suspect that he'll when secretary yellen leaves or retires which there are rumors that that's going to happen imminently that would be a position he'd be interested in so i think we're going to look at the agencies i think absolutely we're going to be looking at some kind of digital dollar we've seen as chris said the white house is leading and in a really positive way on this issue so i think we've got a little bit of breathing room to try to lay the framework in a positive way for the industry and the midterms matter because that's going to determine who's on the committee and who's in the game but we have a little breathing room on the substance itself i think and then what i'm personally going to be looking at is the way we talk about things so i'll use one very specific example but we've got to be better with the language chris said based which i love because that makes sense to a lay person but the industry crypto talks about trustless and they mean that in a positive way but no one thinks of that as positive trustless does not seem positive so i'm going to really be doing a lot of work at trying to laymanize things make it accessible there are no dumb questions if people have fears around this we need to address them not avoid them and so personally i'm going to be trying to work on the storytelling with these groups and i think we've got a little bit of time on some of the regulations except for things that might come out quickly of the agencies which as you mentioned laura a lot of former regulators are now on the industry side helping track that closely i'll jump in uh which is like you know as we've talked about i think extensively here um you know playing the win on the politics but playing the win in a sophisticated way so that we make this uh translate this from pre-partisan to bipartisan um and i just can't understand um overstate understate reinforce whatever the phrase is uh enough how important the next four months are going to be on that i mean i think that look i fundamentally believe you know what three succeeds period full stop people want at less centralized internet that architecture always is going to evolve i think how fast that happens will be impacted to a significant degree as it relates to our success and being able to make this a bipartisan issue obviously some of the legislation regulatory activity could be you know very much impacted one way or the other depending what the results are from the midterms and how maturity controls play out you know it's not i think not it's not inconceivable to me that you could begin to see some version of what happened with the telecom act which is both parties sort of see it as in their political interest to actually and this is me being optimistic by the way but it's it's always important to be optimistic seeing that this is actually in in the country's interests and their stakeholder and voters interest actually really embrace this um there may be a desire from both parties to actually find something like that um for their own political reasons on the other side of the midterms again that may be optimistic given the realities of of current politics um and then i just i think nikki is so right on you know the importance of us starting to use language that everyday people can understand i totally get and understand where the language originally comes from but like privacy is better than zero knowledge right blockchain itself is obviously the technical word for it but it's block and chain like those are not necessarily words that people everyday people associate with positive things you know crypto right not necessarily you know many people don't understand what that means and then you know um it's not necessarily positive again i i'm saying this with respect to all the folks out there who are in this and listening and i'm not that's not that criticism it's just a reality of you know if we want to part of the success for crypto and web 3 will be how quickly we can mainstream this uh because it does have this incredible value proposition for people and so let's help them mainstream it by explaining and communicating it in ways that actually matter to them i mean i again not to keep referencing my own personal experiences but when i joined airbnb in 2015 right people thought that was a weird thing we actually spent an enormous amount of time both explain what the value proposition were for hosts who made most of the money but also why this was a really cool experience if you were a guest you know today is the largest depending how you want to look at it the largest travel company in the world and you know airbnb is a noun and a verb everyone knows around the world uh you know this is going to move really fast but the pace of success and ultimate the success of it is going to be dictated no small part by our ability to actually communicate in ways that people understand um so let's just keep giving that thought i totally get that there is a little bit of a club-like atmosphere to this and it's a cool thing to have you know all the language and and and you know i have two teenage boys so i see elements of that in my daily existence when they have entire conversations in the car that i'm not supposed to understand but we do want to mainstream this we do want to win on the politics we do want this to impact everyday people that's why we're all in this uh so let's talk about it in ways that matter to people all right well this has been such a fascinating discussion thank you both so much for coming on the show there were so many other topics that uh we did not have time for so um i will definitely be covering them in future episodes we'd love to have you back um where can people learn more about each of you and your work so actually i'm at you can find me on twitter nikki kristoff uh and there's a link in that to my website my consulting work some of the speaking that i do my background i'm not that active on twitter but it is a place to find it and i've been encouraged to be more active based on this conversation i'm looking forward to what we all can do this next conversation and we can react and respond to the two threads that nikki has now committed to on this this podcast uh you can find me on twitter at chris lehane and also i am as we talked about the very beginning uh at han ventures uh and we do have a website out there we're on mirror for those as we're trying to be very uh very og to that to the space but uh but yeah i'm out there on twitter and and happy to connect and uh and appreciate everyone who is uh who's listening to this and laura thank you for was a really fun fun conversation and i definitely feel like i left smarter than when i came on so thanks for having me yeah thank you so much laura perfect well thank you both so much for coming on unchained and thanks to everyone for joining us today to learn more
