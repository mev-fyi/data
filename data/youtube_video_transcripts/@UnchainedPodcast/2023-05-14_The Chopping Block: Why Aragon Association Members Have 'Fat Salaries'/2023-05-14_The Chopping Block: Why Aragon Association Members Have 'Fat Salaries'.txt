not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so first up we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound then we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Pupa and Gauntlet it's about to call you garoon because it does Rhyme uh and then I received the head hype man a dragonfly I thought you were going to replace Giga brain with Guru that was like well I was like whoa that's like a funny joke I feel like that could be a good second after you actually if you like retire from crypto and you just become like a yoga teacher I feel like the um the Giga brain and Guru of uh you know Kundalini I think I feel like that would work for you uh anyway so yeah I gotta read that the disclosures okay we're really seeing investors nothing we say here is investor advice legal advice or even life advice please see choppingblocks.xyz for more disclosures Robert you are looking incredibly French today what's going on every time I wear a striped shirt you know people assume it's like a French look so today's episode is dedicated to the future of France oh amazing well uh I want to hear speaking of France well these uh both Tom and tarun Tom right now is in Europe in Montenegro tarun was very recently in Montenegro where I understand we alluded to this earlier there is a some I don't know exactly what to call it like a pop-up City it's a intentional Community yeah I'm at uh Montenegro at this uh thing called zuzulu zuzalu and I don't I feel like I'm gonna offend someone in any description but I'll get my my best shot it's um two months different types of people who are trying to do research or uh I don't know contribute in some way get together and people give talks people do workshops people do sort of different things and so they do different segments there was like a crypto AI thing that room is at there's like there was like a ZK research week uh this longevity week right now so it's it's sort of like maybe like you know Burning Man meets um like Ted Talks meets I don't know I feel like that's that was pretty cringy but you know it's it's all right I would say introverts Burning Man like take Osho and sort of like you know like the 1980s like intentional communities they were more about like exercise yoga orgies this is much more in the uh the vein of futurism like biotech changes like whether there exists longevity drugs open source AI so the AI week was actually focused on like you know if we have this huge movement towards you know centralized AI like open AI or anthropic or adapter whatever versus uh you know the stable diffusions and other open source uh AI stuff and so there was there was a little there was like less of the Hedonism of say I would say intentional communities historically like the 1980s 1990s 2000s were much more hedonistic this had like almost no Hedonism like because there was longevity week it was like are you sure you just weren't invited to the orgies I feel like that's a possibility you have to take seriously it could it could be true but I highly recommend reading some some tweets from Ayla about her experience in uh at zizzlo and I would say those kind of suggest uh exactly what I'm saying which is it was perhaps an introvert's Paradise uh a kind of sexless not okay got it I I didn't say that she said that uh but I once I got there after she said that I couldn't not observe that I guess which was very weird but but I I will say the interesting thing is I think that it sort of reminded me a bit of that the energy there was a little bit like what I think the earliest days of bitcoiners in El Salvador was and I think the montenegrin people are very big eth Believers like I I got stuck in pagorica which was the capital for a day and there are like eth ATMs everywhere throughout the capital so it's actually interesting it's kind of like the doppelganger I I wouldn't be surprised if Montenegro becomes like the doppelganger the eth El Salvador in in like yeah apparently vitalik has a uh honorary Montenegro and passport and there's sort of a movement um with this new uh pm to develop Montenegro into more of a sort of digital Nomad new destination maybe a charter City a location within Europe cool interesting okay what what is an actual what is a day in a Montenegro pop-up City social experiment look like like you wake up what do you actually do well it's a little surreal too because you're at this sort of private Resort set up so it's it's very not representative of what I assume the average day is like there's no real town it's like a little food desert kind of thing um but you know there's a schedule so there's people giving talks through most of the day there's a workshop there's people doing exercise classes people doing kind of breath work stuff there's a party tonight that I'm missing but there's you know sort of stuff like that and you can run your own Workshop you can contribute to the the schedule you can do a cooking class whatever so it's sort of summer camp like uh in that way too that that's sort of The Burning Man in the daytime it's burning man in the daytime type of okay that's a that's a very good way to put it actually but with bathrooms with real bathrooms not not port-a-potties okay got it well that's a big difference trust me that is a that is a huge change lifestyle-wise I have to ask uh how uh often do you go to burning man are you like uh okay I think I went six times but like yeah it's been it's been a while I haven't seen how many times have you been zero I've never been to burning man I bet I bet Thomas is gone yeah you've never been I've never been I I don't I don't really you've never been like the whole burner aesthetic yeah I find it kind of cringy honestly not my scene sorry I'm sorry I've been twice so right now Robert it's really you were invited to like the French Camp I was okay yes right part of the future of the France very nice I mean I mean the thing is the thing the thing about birdie man is it like became this like Tech meme Trope uh in like 2015 or 16. and I don't think it was ever able to escape that yeah it just like kind of lost this this like genuineness and so I thought I think I'll give this is all a lot of credit it does seem to have there are a lot of people there who really believe in kind of crazy future Endeavors in a way that I don't think you would have that many people saying that much crazy stuff in one place normally yeah I'm poking fun at it but it does sound genuinely really awesome and I hope they hope they continue doing it's like this because I feel like it is it's really valuable for the community to have these just like pockets of really concentrated cultural activity you know you kind of need those cauldrons especially after covid when everyone scrambles everybody got super separated and everything was happening on Twitter it's nice to have it in one place yeah yeah it's just long yeah but I think that's actually kind of nice you can rotate out it's a fresh cast I think true at some point you said uh you know youth Global hackathons are responsible for the majority of the EF development roadmap and I feel like this has a similar kind of vibe of um you know people people not having structure time and therefore being more productive okay so there's some uh let's start getting into some news this week um it's been it's been a relatively chill week but it being crypto there's always some weird thing to talk about so the weird thing to talk about this week is Aragon so for those of you who don't know Aragon super OG project Aragon is basically like a dow operating system is the way they describe it they were very very early in the formation of Dallas kind of before 2020 and all the kind of down Mania kicked off um so these are like super OG Die Hard believers they did an Ico way back in the day and they have this token called Ant which has kind of been sitting around uh it owns a big pile it owns a big treasury of Bitcoin and ether and a bunch of other stuff uh today that treasury is worth about 176 million the token itself anti which is supposed to give you a claim on the rights of the treasury and everything within it because it's supposed to be a dow because it's kind of the point that token on a fully downloaded basis is only worth 150 million compared to the 176 that's in the treasury so a lot of people have been very disappointed with Aragon Aragon very famously has kind of been sitting on their hands sort of waiting for the world to come around to their view of how Dao's ought to work and some people got frustrated including some token holders namely ARCA so ARCA they're like a fund I don't know exactly what I think they're like New York and LA or something they basically started instigating publicly to ant holders to say hey Aragon has not done a good job of sort of shipping what they were supposed to ship or really gaining market share or gaining product Market fit and they have a giant treasury so we should just have them transfer the treasury into doubt governance because apparently the treasury was managed off chain it was not managed by the Dow directly uh they were like look Aragon should push the the treasury into full-on token governance so that the a t token holders have control over that Dao and uh separately they were they were pushing for uh BuyBacks to basically buy back the token used in the treasury to essentially return value to token holders that they felt was was not being well spent by the treasury so that's the that's the backdrop that's been happening all for a while then a few days ago Aragon published a statement saying that they are under attack so what is this attack this attack supposedly is that ARCA as well as a group called the rfv Raiders uh we're basically trying to essentially act like corporate Raiders um and as activists token holders effectively trying to get the uh ant token holders to vote to basically do a complete buyback to essentially wind down the token and unwind the treasury and give the treasury back to token holders essentially a liquidation more or less of the the treasury and uh and T the I guess the Aragon Foundation which is some Foundation set up somewhere in Liechtenstein or something the Aragon Foundation was like this is an attack and because it's an attack we are not going to listen to token governance because these attackers came into our Discord they were saying things that were instigating uh a Ruckus uh they banned them from the Discord they said that we're not going to listen to the Dow on this because this is a malicious attack uh or rather we're not going to listen to token votes um and instead we are going to take the funds uh we're not going to fully put them Unchained because they're not fully transitioned on chain yet uh we're not going to fully put them on chain because clearly we're not decentralized enough yet Progressive decentralization has not fully completed its course we still need to retain some security here and um we are going to start a grants program which we are going to transfer some funds to that last I recall it was like a few hundred thousand dollars which is a very small amount of the treasury that they pre-committed to a grants program that's going to be administered on chain so this has got the whole internet or not the whole internet our tiny little corner of the internet into a giant shouting match about what what uh what is what is a dow what is decentralization mean what is governancing what's the point of a treasury what's your guys take on the Aragon Raider drama I'll start um just by saying that you know Aragon was extremely early on the bandwagon of decentralized governance and tooling um you know they they were writing Frameworks and libraries and voting systems and all this stuff years before really there was much traction for Dao's in general they came before I think a lot of the use case and what's interesting is that you know since then every Community has sort of had to make up its own mind about what Frameworks to use um you know maker Dow was also an early Pioneer of you know having their own you know approach that was not part of the Aragon stack when compound was designing a governance system we wrote one from the ground up from scratch having looked at Aragon having looked at maker now having looked at other systems um to say oh well you know we want something that isn't those things and in the multiple years since you know we've seen a lot of other government governance Frameworks and tooling pop-ups snapshot has been incredibly popular for essentially off-chain voting using tokens um and governance has really come a long way and one of the things I haven't really seen a lot of traction for at all is the Aragon stack um I don't know of any major D5 protocols or communities that are using I'm sure there are some curve is the curve is the numbers but I I don't see it that frequently um and so you know the thing that surprises me the most is that Aragon the itself Dao is relying so much on off-chain systems versus on-chain tooling like the craziest part of the story you just told is that all of the assets are existing in some traditional legal entity off chain under the control of people that have nothing to do with on-chain governance and so you know I think if there's any one action item for them to do it's to sort of embrace and embody on chain governance more than they currently do so here's the Crux of the question is like is this an attack like what first of all what does an attack mean in this context like somebody's saying like look screw what you're doing this is stupid take the you know take all the treasury out and give it back to token holders is that an attack or is that legitimate the Dow governance yeah I think um to Robert's point it is like you have to appreciate the irony of like the the rfv and ARCA have done this to a few other protocols so like Rook for example they basically forced to dissolve and return most of their treasury um we have to appreciate some of the you know irony in like this attacking happening to a dow tooling company um not having a actual Unchained Tao but I think maybe one point of clarification is that like it was actually placeholder who you know almost a year ago over a year ago put together the proposal to um migrate to a true on-chain Dow managed Treasury and it was passed and it was just like never implemented so it wasn't like from the beginning Arco was trying to force them to do that it was the token holders legitimately wanted this over a year ago and they just never responded and of course now that you know push comes a shove they're sort of refusing to and so um I think in some respects they're kind of acting in in bad faith and that it was not that they're not turning over the treasury because um of this attack but they just weren't doing it in the first place and not really responding to token holders um I I do feel like it's pretty damning for them I mean I agree with a lot of what Robert said like they have kind of missed the boat on a lot of everything that's happened in Dao's and everything that's happening in crypto and effectively the market is saying that you've created you know negative 25 million dollars in equity value and I think at some point you kind of look yourself in the mirror and think about what you are doing versus like continuing to sort of suckle on the teat of the Dow for a fat salary which is kind of what they've been doing for the past however many years so I don't know I I don't think you're uh if you if you want to be a dow and you want to be liable to um token holders then I think you have to commit to that you can't just sort of LARP at his LARP as it and then um you know try to get rid of it when becomes inconvenient yeah I I guess yeah in the similar vein I don't I don't definitely don't really consider it an attack I think if you agree to community-owned assets like this is just you know you can reduce the likelihood or make it more expense offensive or change structure but there's inevitably going to be some way because that's what it means to have you know distributed Asset Management to some extent I think the weird thing about Aragon to me is is sort of there's sort of this first mover disadvantage so I think you know in 2017 late 2017 early 2018 you know governance was almost uh a weasily bad word right like the only Dows that existed were like that had users were like moloch and DX down not to give people throwback Nostalgia and Aragon and at that time it was considered really bad to talk about governance why because of the Dow hack on ethereum everyone would just be like oh you're just doing that again you're just doing that again Aragon to their credit in spite of all of that like kept kind of trudging through and and we could you could argue that like the only two people of the 2017 era who really their entire thing was based off governance that made it to 2020 you know like the promised land of not crashing and burning were tezos and Aragon right and who are really focused on governance that's like a first class primitive and and there's sort of this weird thing that tezos did continue to do stuff I mean they had to as a layer one like you whereas Aragon kind of didn't you know the only time other than curve stuff that I've ever really interacted with Aragon is the thing that people kind of make fun of Aragon for which is Aragon court so like instead of building like on-chain doubt moving their treasury on chain they built this thing where you could vote on like penalties to particular Dow members and like have a court that a jury of peer Dao members who like vote on whether to slash you or take some of your assets it's like I don't know the fact that they were like not only did they miss the plot but they went off this like very weird end was kind of a little bit odd to me but it's also crazy because they did convince a lot of really big projects to use them in 2020 curve and I believe the earlier version of Lido had some some elements and and like they they actually had reasonably okay tooling but then they just kind of went off this like the Aragon Court thing I think thing was very weird it like got rid of a lot of the on-chain niceties so yeah I I I agree negative equity value is negative equity value and I I mean they're unclear if their tokens in equity or security I'm not not making any such judgment negative token holder redeemable value let's say is negative yeah a new word for whatever that is but there's definitely a concept there that needs to be needs to be reappied and and I think it's it's healthy for a market to do this when it's correcting right like reallocation of assets from things that aren't working to things that are that that is the inevitable right like yeah capitalism so like I don't understand how this wouldn't happen yeah that's true it's funny you know crypto in some way like Dows are at this weird intersection where crypto is both very kind of libertarian free market in one way but then Dows are also kind of like this sort of socialist Co-op utopianism um and Aragon is kind of sitting in this weird intersection of the two where the free marketness of crypto is like hey there's a misallocation resources let's like go fix it and the token holder is like you know it's up to their they can decide like hey we think it's not economically ideal for these assets to be sitting in the treasury but then they have this sort of Kumbaya like no our mission is to advance the existence of dows and so we're going to give out like you know 50 000 grants forever and like we'll just sit on this money until it eventually runs out I feel like Aragon reminds me a lot of um you guys know the story of the Japanese holdouts after World War II like there was like some there was like some general who was like stranded on some random Island and they just kept thinking World War II was still on until like the 50s or something and um and they just kept fighting like because they're just they didn't know how to do anything other than fight and I feel like that's Aragon Aragon is like still stuck in like 2019 and the only thing they know how to do is like just hold on to the money and wait until at some point everybody's gonna use Dows and like 2021 and like the DOW market came and went and nobody was you know okay they had a couple clients but like mostly people were not using Aragon they were using like compound stack and they were using a bunch of other stuff but uh they're just still waiting and these guys showing up and say hey guys guess what the war's over let's give the money back come on and they're like no no no no no the Dows must doubts must succeed like you don't understand you're taking away the Dows and uh I feel bad for them in a sense but I I can't remember who was I spoke to um somebody who'd worked at Aragon oh I actually remember who it is um somebody told me they'd worked at Aragon for a little while this was like 2019 I think 2018 2019. and they were telling me like Aragon had so much money and their the attitude there was that basically look we have like 10 plus years of Runway we're basically just gonna wait we're gonna wait until the world changes his mind about the Aragon stack uh and until then we're just gonna like hang out and write blog posts and it was a very depressing place to work for that reason which you know if you're somebody who wants to like build something and do stuff like Aragon just kind of where uh nothing really happens so it is it is a really unhealthy place and I think I can I can see how you get defensive like this where you're like oh my God token holders want us to give the money in the treasury back which like to be clear giving the money Distributing the money in the treasury to talk middlers doesn't prevent you from continuing to proselytize about dials like you can do that write blog posts all day long you know like this stuff is not that expensive to do yeah I think you give them too much credit um in sense of like being missionaries around Dao's I think maybe in the beginning sure but at this point it's like I'm sure a very cushy job I mean I was looking on chain there's like millions of dollars in in usdc flowing out of that treasury you know every month or so and so it's like yeah it's a job with zero accountability you can pay yourself whatever you want um I don't know I think it's uh uh kind of gross fair enough okay I'll give you the benefit of the doubt I don't actually know Aragon people Tom has the strongest opinions here yeah as much as it pains me to support ARCA uh I gotta back him up here um is that also I mean the fact is we're not even really debating um if if the funds are being misappropriate or not it's like you know the vote doesn't even matter it's not even really a doubt like it's it's very different than the Rook situation um in that you know like the vote doesn't even really matter because it's not binding it anyway so the whole situation is kind of absurd also also rfv stands for real [ __ ] value is that right no risk-free value right the idea being if a treasury has a bunch of people in it real [ __ ] value I like this Rebrand I like this Rebrand sorry sorry I I saw I never I I I read some article that was claiming it was that and I was like really like this is like weird that that is very you know it's like lfg you know it's like a kind of a Json um okay [Laughter] sorry apologies to the RFB people for for misunderstanding your name they they have I'm sure they're they're not their feelings are not easily hurt if they're doing this speaking of of of this recently I was talking about this also with the btfp bank term funding program do you think they they intended to make it sound like btfd like it's it's too close and too similar to no I think I think that's a accidental oh my gosh I I don't think like I don't think they're like on like crypto Twitter being like you know what would really cause people like Tom to ask questions like about whether or not we made a meme but btfp but btfd is beyond crypto though it is like uh you know it's like Wall Street bets also writes that so it it it it has her surpassed I'm sure some staffer wrote it up and you know it's it's sort of like a subtle uh uh Thing versus being intentional maybe I don't know I think they literally take whatever words they want to use that like sort of make a maybe a word and like that's a word like do you guys remember tarp like that just sounded so yeah you know and it became in the wrong word that did not suck I I mean you protect you from all the Fallout you know I can see it I you know to be honest when the word tarp um it did give me this feeling of like shit's really bad and you need just something to protect you like all we got is this tarp and then that's all that's gonna keep you alive I mean it and I was like okay that actually what about the uh the covid cares act you know yeah all sorts of cute things totally worked these things very deliberately yeah like whenever you see their program it's always like yes rocket like you know read only you know comma you know but actually imagine imagine if someone convinced the FED officials to go to zuzalu to become intentional about their naming that would be hilarious okay I want to ask you before we move off this topic before we love this topic I want to ask one more question um so we asked like okay is there is what Aragon is doing cool and the answer is no um what about what real [ __ ] value is doing uh do we feel that what rfv is doing is good for crypto or is this bad for crypto what's your guys feeling about well I think it actually brings up a more important point which is whether it's defy or Trad Phi it's Phi it's Finance okay and those people in rfe are just being the Carl icon of D5 yes it's a newer and smaller Market but the stuff they're doing which is essentially just activist investing is extremely old and so they're just taking some like very basic principles and applying it to a small Niche newer Market that really hasn't seen this stuff before and you know I think it's just an inevitable consequence you know obviously someone's gonna be out there creating rfe um you know because the ecosystem allows it you know I think it's far less shocking than the crypto native Financial activity I'll just use activity in this way it's like Mev and things that are far more profitable and far more directly taking money out of users hands that couldn't really and don't really in the same way exist in other forms of Finance but only exist in on-chain finance and so I don't think rfe is really unique or innate to D5 I think it's inevitable and it's really just you know a generic economic activity it's not new well so here's the interesting thing though in my mind is like you know for something but what uh Aragon was doing in defending against this we're defending against this attack was that it it's it's kind of like the closest thing that they could do to a poison pill right so for those who don't know a poison pill is basically a defense against a an activist investor that basically allows you to dilute the active invest investor in a way that doesn't dilute everybody else um so it's it's sort of like a um kind of like a defense mechanism against somebody taking over too much ownership that you don't want them to so famously this is what happened to uh Elon Musk is that they sort of threatened to uh do a poison pill uh Twitter Twitter was threatening to a poison pill against him um now we don't have anything like that in D5 right the closest thing we have is basically what Aragon did which is basically look we we won't listen to the Dow that's effectively what Aragon decided to do now this is a case where the proposals that were being made were actually Equitable to all token holders right so the proposal was let's return the capital to everybody and everyone gets made equally in corporate governance like in normal corporate governance right there are certain kinds of proposals that are just illegitimate like for example you you can't you know to take over a company and then say all of the money in the company goes only to me and to nobody else and then voted you know vote into into passing uh because it's not equitably treating all shareholders we don't have anything like that for tokens that can say look even if you have a majority of the token voting power you say look everybody who votes only people who vote on this proposal get all the money in the treasury and then 30 vote again 70 vote for it now seventy percent of people uh rated the treasury and basically 30 of people got stiffed um there's nothing in Dow governance intrinsically that stops that so it does feel like if we're moving into this world basically kind of you know activist investors corporators whatever you want to call this then we kind of need more robust mechanisms to prevent from basically inequitable outcomes and looking at this I'm like okay well [ __ ] we get we like the proposal I just described could very easily have gotten passed instead of The Proposal that was actually put forward well actually a similar proposal if I remember correctly was either proposed or succeeded or maybe occurred um back during Fey and Rory and their merger their unwind someone who was pissed off said like oh if you do this thing I'll pay every voter in such a way um I don't know if that will end up going through but they basically tried to have this you know economic incentives for voting to build a majority um you know someone on Twitter might remember the details of how that went down but yeah I I know what you're talking about I think there's also obviously the for Faye the concern of like if hacked victims should be considered debtors and you know potentially Superior or uh senior to token holders in the event of liquidation and there's some kerfuffle about that but yeah I mean I I feel you like um obviously that kind of proposal uh would be pretty unpalable but would work you know if they actually did have online governance which again they they don't so it's a little bit of a move uh uh uh point but um yeah I mean I think you know poison pills are obviously in any way self-serving to the current board right like they're not actually thinking about maximizing shareholder value they're thinking about how hey how can I retain this current role and keep doing the thing that I'm going currently doing which I think is kind of the mindset that Aragon has like this is fundamentally about um sort of you know correcting the market they're like people who get you know trying to ban short sellers in my mind this is spiritually similar like they play an important role in pressing things correctly and allocating capital correctly and right now capital is being pretty grossly misallocated in uh in the Aragon Treasury yeah I I think I I'm actually I find this to be a very generically positive development has has nothing to do with Aragon in particular as much as just like if crypto is going to be a real Market that continues to grow it's going to have to just overall improve allocative efficiency there's like no that's just like the second law of Thermodynamics of capitalism right like either you die or you get better at allocate efficiency that those are the two options and like clearly that's not happening here um I do think the interesting thing as a a sort of ironic spin-off Aragon is that there's a whole world of what I would call like what D5 should look like next you know right now we've like really focused D5 spent the last couple years focusing on trading and leverage in some fashion but it hasn't spent much and governance is the the bare minimum of the investment banking automation layer right like like the compound governance stack or Aragon government stack but there's a whole other set of investment banking like things to do for protocols like how do you do M A correctly how do you do kind of these like dividending vote type of systems that in normal Finance you can't do because you can't really discriminate between the different voters or different classes or different things like programmatically like the type of thing hazeb is talking about basically impossible to do with stocks with equities but you could totally program that into governance it's like five lines of code to do that so like I think like the the opportunity I guess maybe future looking is that all of these Investment Banking functions can be protocolized for doing this type of stuff in a more efficient way and I think that's what we're going to see over the next year or two very interesting well I I agree with you guys that this was um obviously the story is not over but it's a very fascinating case study of kind of what happens when uh governance stops being quite so pollyannaish and we start we're coming up against the hard reality of how um how these projects are are actually delivering value so let's move on one of the other big stories has been this uh I think of almost everybody at this point is aware of the craziness going on on bitcoin uh as well as the meme coin frenzy that's been going on both on bitcoin and ethereum but a lot of it today is really focused on what's happening on bitcoin because it's so rare would this be happening on bitcoin so I think we we alluded to a little bit before ordinals and I think previously we were a little bit um dismissive of what was happening in ordinal's land well it has grown to become an absolute force of nature it's driven up Bitcoin fees by over 100x since it began just to pull some stats so the total value so there are two things actually going on now on on BTC so one is ordinals which are the um the you know the the inscriptions themselves that we talked about but there's also this new thing which is using the same um kind of General protocol uh which is called brc20s and brc20s are basically erc20s on bitcoin that are you know using the same mechanism of jumping onto uh Tap Root scripts to basically just encode you know ownership of of a fungible token instead of non-fungible tokens uh which are ordinals themselves so um the total value of BTC ordinals and brc20s uh was basically approaching as of May 8th it was approaching uh over 900 million dollars of total value over 20 000 weekly actives on the biggest Market which is called unisat uh volume spiked all the way up to 18 million which is more than the volume on openc um now today it's down quite a bit so it seems like volumes are coming down um there's a lot of arguing now about what's happening on bitcoin so one it's it's massively increasing fees which for people who are trying to use Bitcoin for ordinary stuff their fees are now in the tens of dollars to interact with with Bitcoin just you know sending ordinary uh utxo transactions um but then the second thing is that there's a big debate now going on within the Bitcoin Community is this good for Bitcoin is this bad for Bitcoin uh this kind of makes Bitcoin more difficult to use for traditional payment use cases um maybe this is good because this allows Bitcoin to become sustainable without fees um or this is just a bunch of nonsense that's bloating the utxo set and ultimately is you know kind of a giant time waster you should put this crap on ethereum so Bitcoin Maxis seem to be quite split on is ordinals good is ordinals bad um what if your guys observations been on the meme coin frenzy going on on bitcoin the largest meme coin on bitcoin is is a meme coin made by Zen xcn which has historically been a gas fee attractor let's say on other chains in that they build protocols that try to maximize gas usage uh to generate fees so it's it's not that surprising that the Zen Community the moment that they saw this they like went in and put up a very gas inefficient on purpose protocol um you might think that that's bad for a particular protocol but the Zen Community like the hex Community is this thing that people don't talk about but is insane if you ever go look at their Discord you'll be like how are there this many people wait is Zen a Rebrand of hex it's it's the hex Community Fork but if I call it a fork the heck of the Maxis will be after me so it's someone who started in the hex community and shares some amount of code with the hex code base and the pulse chain code base the fact that I know this tells you I talked to Eric Wall so yeah it's like it's not like I I I really I the hex community of course is quite gross to me to to steal Tom's earlier word just more the the weird materialism of the it's something kind of beautiful about Eric Wall being like the Taproot ordinals guy and also the anti-hex guy and then Zen being like the Lord knows application like it's poetic it's amazing it's amazing wait I I I'm I totally I do not understand how can Zen run an application and collect fees on bitcoin using no no they write very gas inefficient code that emit has very high inflation or like has these like Ponzi scheme Dynamics and their entire thing is about writing code that costs a lot to use which sounds very unintuitive and it makes no sense their entire Ponzi scheme is helium or this is on bitcoin it started on ethereum but they are now on bitcoin and they are the largest they're the largest ordinal uh it's XF I'm trying to remember the exact four letters is this this isn't vampirics is it like the um yes all that and that that's the reason it's called that's because the goal of this community is they tie their inflation of their token or number of mints to the transaction fees used so the more transaction fees use the higher their token emission and it's like it obviously is unsustainable they just keep moving from chain to chain to chain and and you know it blows up goes to the next chain you know just what sorry I saved let's see if I'm really sorry I see I see you rubbing your head and I'm not trying to I'm not trying to hurt give you a headache I'm having a really hard time understanding why you would do that it's not it's not rational but the hex Community is not very rational they've all lost insane amounts of money and they have this still this like belief that it's all coming back if you need to see the hex memes the hex memes are a way to to destroy your brain cells obviously it's incredibly wasteful that they're basically trying to say the more you waste the more tokens you get it's the same economic Principle as if you just dig a bunch of holes or like break a bunch of glass windows it's good for the economy it's not you're actually like creating a deadweight loss and so they're gonna long term be losers but what's interesting is actually a similar concept if I remember this correctly existed on ethereum way back in the day and it wasn't actually utilized so you know feel free to correct me if I'm getting this slightly off but this is what I remember there was the ability to make or mint erc20 tokens with the sort of like mining like coinbase where like as mine as blocks were made you could like program your erc20 to um mint for whoever the miner was so one of the ideas about how tokens would be created was oh you could piggyback on the proof of work that was already existing on ethereum not creating any additional work or any additional transaction costs but use it as a way of Distributing the supply of a token across the miners of ethereum itself so basically like think of it like merge mining but with zero actual mining um so piggybacking and you could actually Implement and this is like I don't know especially like 2016 2017 era uh the ability to like mint tokens with each block Minds to the minor and I don't think that ever took off no one like ever like launched a successful token they utilized this I assume this code is like still there maybe or like got removed at some point but this was an idea that was popular then and like was part of like the protocol that you could use and like no one ever launched it and if the hex Community was around all the way back then maybe they would have they they are they are launching something very similar in pulse chain which is their um trude how do you know all the like the the road map of all doesn't sleep and he's a member of 490 discords I I I I all I have to say is Eric Wall I I I you know bless his wife another show at some point actually we should get him on the actually we should have him as a guest to talk about ordinals because he is like ultimate expert yeah yeah yeah I'm just parroting what I learn I'm parroting what I learned so we should actually just have him talk about why didn't him and Udi launch something like some they are they are yeah yeah yeah okay think of it's sort of you could think of it as like the open C an Open Sea of ordinals but like in a weird way for handling these brc20s all right I feel like now is the moment for every kind of Bitcoin Maxi to like do their nft drop effectively like we need Nick Carter to drop something and then it'll just be yeah everybody who's got a bunch of social Cloud they haven't monetized yet now's your chance to do it in Bitcoin land I mean the best thing is to read the Bitcoin developer Forum so that's the part where I find more interesting and you just like read the two sides of like the like yes we're generating fees on the oh my God like we need to censor these transactions and get rid of them I know sensor is a bad word but sensor and it's like hilarious to read these oh man oh man yeah it is um it is it's in a way the kind of poetic justice within crypto that Bitcoin which is the most stalwart most sort of August and serious protocol that's like no we're about transferring large amounts of value very efficiently and it's like oh [ __ ] our chain is getting clogged up by like you know random nfts and meme coins um and that's the only way that there are actually enough fees to um be comparable to the block reward and now you know there Bitcoin is now convulsed with this face-to-face with the stupidity of what crypto people actually want to do which is to speculate on Meme coins um yeah it's it's you know this is the world that we live in um now that that said like the Mania seems to be dying down um although you know they're obviously false starts in the in the history of nft so it's possible that this might be a temporary lull but uh yeah I mean the same thing has been happening on ethereum there's been a lot of mean Quant activity on ethereum uh Pepe very famously has kind of blown through like a billion dollar plus market cap uh now it's down quite a bit from the highs what do you guys think is driving this seems kind of random seems like it sort of came out of nowhere maybe it's just like the nft Traders got bored and now it's time to play around with meme coins I heard that CZ invented Pepe [Laughter] um news that is confirmed news it's easy that's right we are um the leader in breaking news that we heard from a guy I am I did see uh it was you know coinbase write these like informational Pages for assets that they list or I think assets that just exist I don't think they've listed Pepe and on the Pepe one they like said oh it's you know affiliated with like the alt-right and like the proud boys or whatever and then Paul grew that the um clo had to like issue a retraction and an apology and it was like I saw you know I apologize to the Pepe Community oh my God that was the funniest tweet of the week by far but by far coinbase the general counsel really won this week yeah uh yeah welcome back to crypto okay well yeah it's been it's been weird well I guess let's see what happens um hopefully we can get Eric on to kind of walk us through the uh the circus that we're currently living in on bitcoin land um so other news so uh there's been obviously over the last few months a lot of pressure on Market making firms uh not just the fact that of course they lost a lot of money and just the market going down and exchanges blowing up and and lenders dying but also uh in many of the indictments that have been brought down or many of the lawsuits that have been filed there's been a lot of references to trading firms basically getting up to no good so there was a report by Bloomberg that both jump which is a large crypto trading firm as well as Jane Street which is uh also you know they make a lot of markets obviously broadly in equities and and uh other asset classes but they're very active in crypto that both of them are starting to pull back from their uh crypto Market making activities in the U.S they're citing regulatory uncertainty and increased scrutiny uh there was also recently a class action lawsuit that was filed against jump with respect to their involvement in the alleged involvement in the Terra deep pegging debacle so it seems like a very tough time for Market making firms in the U.S especially given the lack of clarity that we have domestically in addition to that we've also seen liquidity dry up and trading volumes also dry up over the last three to four months so it's strange although prices have done very well since the beginning of the year Bitcoin is up like 60 something percent since the beginning of the year um volumes are down a lot and liquidity is down you know even more so um so what do you guys think happens from here with respect to the trading firms well just from a very simple laws of financial physics perspective if they all go away liquidity will be less and volatility will be higher and I think it's hard to anticipate what impact that would have on the market as a whole um it's possible that that's like what people innately want they want volatility and they want things to be going up and down wildly and that's exciting but on the other hand like you know it's hard to predict and so you know it could just be fundamentally bad for asset prices imagine if Bitcoin is just less liquid and more volatile like but that was also like you know the days of your when everyday crypto would move 10 nowadays it's like it feels a lot less volatile and I'm sure you could look at volatility over time and maybe it is starting to increase over the last couple days but you know I anticipate that like the average retail Trader might want more of all yeah I uh I think we can see you know you know a lot of that I agree I think um I do have to imagine I mean some of the regulatory stuff is probably factoring in but I suspect a lot of it frankly is just like there is much less um you know uh lend on the market right now um just in terms of overall liquidity and so if you're a crypto Market maker it's like sourcing inventory is going to be harder volumes are down there's probably less retail activities or probably less profitable and so I think you know by and large it's probably more just like Market driven than anything else versus um oh yeah we're scared of trading on finance now and so we're refusing to do so uh another thing is I think this is not just true for crypto if I remember correctly like even U.S Equity volume is down like you know it's like everyone like a lot of people just like went in super risk off and whoever's left has been pushing the price up but like yeah I guess because the the bond market has been so wild there's like been way more Capital there um like the the yield curve is inverted and uninverted so many times this year especially at the like short duration stuff like over you whatever like government debt ceiling every you know the five million things that have happened this year that the rates Market seems to have taken a lot of liquidity from everywhere else and that's like a macro thing that might is also somewhat independent of crypto but I do think that um the regulatory pressure must be high because like all the people who removed were like also heavy on chain Traders and some of them have notable changes on chain which I thought was that seems more regulatory related than other things that's like it was if it was like Tower or some of these other groups I would think okay maybe it's just not profitable anymore jump I feel like it must be it must be deep in their DNA at this point that like crypto makes money so if they're backing off I I have to assume that it's more of a regulatory reasons um because jump was active through the last bear Market as well like they were they've been they've been very very um kind of steadfast in their commitment to the industry and I kind of feel like the the biggest thing that I noticed generally among whether it's trading firms or institutions whether it's in individuals if you've made money from crypto and cash it out you always come back like you you just have this association with crypto that like yeah crypto is a good thing and I like it and I want to be close to it I never want to get too far even in a bear Market I want to like hang around the rim um I think for jump oh my overwhelming sense is that it must be because of Regulation not because of they don't think that they can afford the you know that the profitability is not there right now I I think that they're willing to invest for the long run I mean they made so much money in the bull market yeah I I just like I suspect it's more regulatory stuff but the interesting thing is the nice thing about the global open market of cryptos there's always someone else who will show up you know like I I do think I do think like even if the biggest market makers leave it's there's going to be a new exchange somewhere else there's going to be market makers from that venue that jurisdiction that region of the world and uh you know it's probably my suspicion is it's going to be somewhere in the middle east or like related to that but we'll see I mean right now binance is in the Middle East so that they are and coin based and coinbase right I mean coinbase like Brian Armstrong went there this week right and did a whole like Road show with all their officials so like yeah in the UAE sorry and so like I sort of I wouldn't be surprised if like you see some like some you know there's a ton of government incentives also to move there so I wouldn't be surprised if like whoever is the takes over from the U.S firm's retreating is like gonna just be based there and doesn't leave there ever yeah it seems it seems plausible and I can tell that you know the UAE is really serious about according to crypto industry and they're putting a lot of energy and resources into it it feels like the sort of sort of the Singaporean Mina at this point where they are they're not only do they have the capital and the capital markets but also they have this just view on the space that is just very positive even in spite of FTX and all the other stuff that's been going on globally uh they believe in the stuff it was it's interesting it's kind of adjacent I feel like to their interest in Esports uh and gaming is that they're like I don't know if you guys know this but like Saudi particularly Saudi UAE as well but Saudi is like crazy crazy big investor into gaming and Esports and they're like trying to buy up Studios and convince them to move to Saudi to create like a sort of home-grown uh game development ecosystem because they're just massive on gaming and I heard when so when I was there what I heard was that uh Saudi uh which is it's not a big country right I think like a single digit millions or maybe two digit Millions uh maybe it's like 20 million people or something in Saudi I forget exactly but um they have an extremely high penetration of like hardcore gamers which I guess there's not a lot else to do in Saudi I don't know but there's people just like gaming a lot like it's really intense it's like Japan or something um so they're just you know the whole society is just very very bullish on gaming becoming a huge thing and crypto I think for them feels very adjacent to that yeah so I I think like the US market maker is leaving is probably just you know there's going to be so someone will take up that mantle I I don't I don't have any doubt that it's not like oh it disappeared forever I think like if the US government thinks that then they don't understand the world Dynamics I I think it probably disappears temporarily but yeah when volumes come back I agree it comes back right but right now volumes are low retail activation is relatively muted other than meme coins but I agree with you about the macro Point once macro settles down um I think that demand and liquidity is going to come back but you know a lot of people are just putting their money into you know into into treasuries right now so there's there's not quite as much except Circle did you see that they're like we're not buying any longer than one month um because they're worried about the US defaulting yeah yeah yeah meanwhile he always he tether made a 1.5 billion dollars in profit in q1 and they're they're rolling it into Bitcoin so it's like yeah I don't know it's it's called they're rolling out they're taking the interest income yeah and buying Bitcoin with it wow how are they starting that are they they've been doing that I mean they don't tell people what they're up to that's um wow that's impressive okay well [ __ ] well we are uh we are up on time uh next time we're gonna we're gonna do everything we can to get Eric on the next show so we can drop us through the Bitcoin Mania um yeah so um yeah yeah you you hit up Eric make sure I'm messaging him right now okay perfect all right that's it for this week thanks everybody [Music]
