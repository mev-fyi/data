not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um I named trading firms who are very involved I like to eat the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we've got Tom the D5 Maven and master of memes next we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound then we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet and then finally I receive the head height man of dragonfly so we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice please see chopping blocks at XYZ for more disclosures so we were just freaking out about this new azuki drop that has got the internet completely lit up at the time they were reporting this um Robert please explain for us we okay Robert please explain for us what happened with the Suzuki drop can you just walk us through the storyline here so azuki announced that they were going to be doing a new collection and they did this by you know surprising everybody who held the zukis with some like token some uh a bean uh nft and the bean nft would become a new nft called an elemental and they decided they were gonna give out a bunch of Elementals to existing azuki holders and then sell a bunch more and what happened was they raised a ton of money by selling these new Elemental beans pre-revealed to people in a Dutch auction and obviously almost every Dutch auction in crypto history sells out instantly whatever the starting price is because everyone is so excited I don't know why anyone uses Dutch auction mechanisms anymore it's a facade it's silly to set the damn price it'll sell out but each one of these sold for two ether and they've raised something like 36 or 40 million dollars selling these new Elemental nfts and everyone was excited they're like oh my God like yeah so people the after the uh Dutch auction to the initial holders of the the beans uh which is this previous kind of low value azuki collection uh it was supposed to also go to a public auction so people in the public could also buy it but it never got to that point because it got sold out immediately by the by the bean holders which made the community already very upset about the way this was managed that's right and then there were some issues with the website and it took a while to be able to reveal them but the long story short is once they were revealed the big reveal that like everybody was waiting to see what these cool new nfts were well they're shockingly similar to the original collection of azuki's in fact I challenge pretty much anyone to go on to openc or blur or you know your favorite nft platform and compare azuki's to azuki Elementals basically it's the same collection and so in essence what has occurred is they've I think like tripled you know the number of azukis out there yes they have a different name but the resukis they're basically identical you know Tom's flipping back and forth between azuki's and Elementals and you won't be able to tell the difference and there's a couple differences like there's new a couple new traits that the Elementals have that the original azuki's don't have and there's like slightly more frequency of like cool you know Elemental things like fire and lightning and Earth and you know all this stuff but fundamentally there are zookies and they basically use this as a way of like you know massively increasing the size of the collection and so everybody's up in arms the price of azuki's dropped like 40 something percent pretty much instantly upon this reveal and crypto Twitter is captivated by this new mechanism called you know sell more of the original nft there are two main lessons from this first is Robert retiring from nfts was a psyop here and there I will for disclosure purposes state that I do own two Elementals one that I got for free and one that I purchased below the mid price uh okay very good uh the second thing is if I and I think I saw someone sort of hinting at this but azuki was maybe one of the only big of the large cap nft projects not to do a fundraise so maybe this is like they needed cash and all the other oh they were trying to do a fundraise they were trying to do a fundraise they were they were going out to Market alongside at the same time I don't remember did they close I think they did um but also I don't think they needed the money like I think you know they were making a bunch of money on royalties and even primary events last year so I I feel like it's it's like nfts they're all trying to figure out their business model and how this whole thing works and looks sustainable like do you try to turn this into a media business or like a gaming business or is this just a pure art play and you try to make money on on royalties or you sell plushies I guess if you're if you're Penguins um but I feel like the the the the trick here like the really the The Grail is like being able to do continue continuous new primary issuance like being able to sell 40 million dollars worth of jpegs is like [ __ ] crazy um and in theory you know depending on the market or more true historically you're also getting some residuals and some secondaries uh uh you know royalties on a secondary sales as well um and so it's all kind of a question of like well how can I keep my community going like by throwing events or doing some giveaways or you know doing doing something to sort of allow you to do new primary instruments and like everything is almost sort of a game around around that versus uh any of these other things in my opinion I agree I mean the most concerning thing is that you know the standard playbook for an nft project like regardless of if it's like Media or whatever is make more nfts like that seems to be like the go-to Instinct for almost every single project that's successful and you know there's various degrees of success and credibility in that approach but almost every Project's instinct is like make more nfts you know it's almost like you know there was projects very early on that were like oh what do we do next we'll make another token and like there's projects with multiple tokens like I feel like the instinct is just make more nfts and I think that's the wrong Instinct I think like to succeed you know project will be better off instead of making more nfts and making a more complex ecosystem and blah blah blah you know figuring out things that you could do for the existing nfts not just make more energy I know this uh the show gives a disclaimer about not providing any investment advice but I would love to know what your thesis was for buying one because I don't understand you know okay what were you expecting them to look like when you were buying the Elementals I mean honestly I was expecting them to look like something different from azuki's better than beans I don't know if anyone out there is an nft collector they launched a collection you know at some point called beans and the beans I think are the most ridiculous nfts ever made by like a blue chip ish collection yeah they're not very cool it's like very hard to imagine somebody making a bean as their pfp no I personally think that mutants are extremely uncool like board ape was you know awesome and they made mutants and they're like obviously like very aesthetically unpleasing they're like not cool they're kind of offensive beans were kind of like the mutants of azuki they were like silly looking and kind of stupid and why would you really want beans like it was almost like a joke that they were playing on their own collectors like ah you're gonna want beans right and like the beans were these like little like silly things and okay it was a massive Divergence from the original collection so I just assumed incorrectly I think everyone on Twitter assumed incorrectly that by releasing a third collection the third collection would not be a zookies it would not be beans it would be like some other thing in the universe um instead of just being morizuki's I I just it I really struggle one that they didn't understand that like if you are trying to maintain the exclusivity of your brand that you don't just make more of the same thing right like if role exercise all of a sudden like Hey we're gonna create a hundred thousand of these this year just for the hell of it because you know whatever we need some Revenue um that is such a bad decision although it's kind of obviously going to make money right now um it basically Torpedoes your business it's hard to imagine that they didn't understand that um and I guess the other side of it is uh it it does seem like a bit of a failure of imagination that they're just like they're just more anime characters that are also in profile looking to the left you know like they're they're it doesn't really seem to be that much new like you mentioned there's like there's a few other animals there's like raccoons or cats or something animals yeah most of them just look like an ordinary I would not know those were not part of the original collection if you had not raised it to me that oh no these are Elementals you different I can't I can't believe this is turning into an nft podcast I feel like we have to be the nft podcast now now that nfts are not cool anymore I agree we have to embrace the least cool thing at all times that's right that's right but what was so notable about this collection was that people were talking about how this is the Revival of nft primary sales because this is the largest nft primary sale in like six to seven months when nft volumes have collapsed and volumes were super low and this feels like a dagger in the heart of nft collectors I'm just like why would you ever buy another mint you you fool you missed out on the uh lady maker of fumo mint um which is another notable did I primary uh primary issuance how much did that race I don't know in aggregate but they're going for like 40K now um but it's like a it's very different they're like plush animals or uh uh yep all right okay let me let me describe can't do an nft show without you showing us what you're showing us the jpeg yeah look at that wait wait what anyway they're they're redeemable oh oh oh I see so it's really like a collector's item correct correct and they saw a lot of bonding curve so it's unisock style it's unisex for Milady yeah I see okay got it do you own one Tom I did not I do not I miss the mint and uh too far at the bonding curve now you're no longer as cool as I thought you were sorry um wait wait can I ask a a more opinionated question I was watching some um documentary on Michael Milken the other day because you know I just forgot I forgot he got pardoned or something recently which which I thought happened a long time ago so I was just like oh let me go revisit some Financial history so the real question to me is who's the Milken of nfts to you I have my answer but I wanna I'm curious what everyone else's answers hold on before we get there my first question is like is this what like a Friday night with a girl is this what you like watch a documentary about the history of fighting of like Financial sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do okay got it cool sorry I got Robert guide so I was gonna ask tarun since I've never thought about who the Michael Milken of nfts is ah Machi big brother is uh is is in some ways has a very similar style uh aesthetic in terms of the types of equivalent junk bonds I guess that exist in nft land it's neither a compliment or an insult it's sort of like a liminal third thing yeah I'm like how would you describe the milkiness you know if you were just like that I think it's just that like no like no one else ever sells a ton of things and then immediately goes and takes out loans on the same thing and takes leverage and buys them back it's like it just like reminds me of the uh Ivan boesky and and milk in like back and forth where like boski would like manipulate some price and then Milken would like sell things into that price manipulation and like you know it's like kind of amazing you can people seem to be doing that directly within yeah and so that I I maybe maybe that's too niche of an answer but you know I don't know enough nft Traders I just know him because he's the most famous One I gotta say I'm so outside of every aspect of this conversation I I'm going to vote that we end the nft section for the show but we're gonna bring this back anymore we should open every show anyone has their own notion of who the milk in this please tweet at me I'm curious yeah please tweet it Tyrone uh for your milking of nfts okay um let's so moving on to more traditional Finance Prime trust very much in the spirit of the times there's another big failure slash you know spontaneous combustion in the crypto realm which is this custodian called Prime trust so I knew of prime trust I never really knew that much about it I knew it was kind of out there somewhere in the world this is last week the story was that they were going to get acquired by bitco they were in some kind of distress it was very unclear exactly what was going on but there were some rumors that things were bad in a bad State over at Prime trust um a prime trust to declares a fairly small custodian I think the three biggest custodians in crypto are probably uh coinbase spitgo and Anchorage um so prime prime trust a much smaller player than any of those obviously there's also Fidelity and NASDAQ among these other folks who are launching custodians but Prime trust was always there so bitco was going to acquire them and they sort of pulled the binance a little bit if they said oh we're you know interested in acquiring we said something Loi they kicked the tires and they said oh my God never mind we're not acquiring these guys um and that caused anybody who had money at Prime trust to be very sad now I'm not totally clear who has money at Prime trust because everybody seems to claim they don't so I think um it was it was rumored that uh true USD had money in Prime trust but then they've disclaimed having any money at trying trust except now they've seen they have 26 000 at Prime trust which is basically nothing so just today the Nevada Financial regulator basically said that Prime trust should be put into custodian [ __ ] and it's now reported exactly what went wrong at Prime test so we have a window into how this custodian ended up collapsing uh basically they ended up at one point so initially they had their own crypto wallets that they were managing on behalf of customers um they ended up moving over to fire blocks and having fire blocks manage all their wallets except they had this concept of Legacy wallets which were basically their old wallet system I guess and for some reason you know fireblocks didn't have certain flexibility they wanted and so they were creating throughout 2022. some of these old Legacy wallets using their old system but it turned out these Legacy wallets were not being persisted or something and so they essentially were creating these Wallets on their own interfaces but they did not actually have the private keys to these wallets and so they were telling people ah yes we created a new wallet for you and your Bitcoin is over here according to our internal Ledger but they did not have any of the crypto and so when they realized this they were like oh [ __ ] uh we don't have the money that we keep telling our customers we have let's go use our cash deposits which are being given to us by uh customers who are depositing Fiat in their custodian and let's use that to buy the crypto that we don't have uh to give people withdrawals and kind of keep the keep the party going so this looks like just a total complete circus so they're they're down so they're liabilities they have about um 85 million dollars in crypto liabilities and about 70 million dollars in uh sorry maybe I'm getting this money what's the cash liabilities the other way around it's 85 million in cash liabilities and like 69 mil and crypto liabilities but the crypto is almost one-to-one and it's almost all audience tokens um audio um the rest is like you know some Bitcoin and stuff like that but yeah they only have three million cash and uh you know sort of like 82 mil short and so yeah it's like where did the money go maybe it was all lost and sort of trying to buy back the crypto that they've lost but yeah also I mean their custodian so they should have insurance so like the whole thing seems very uh goofy to me I would be amazed if insurance pays out for something this [ __ ] like this is stupid I mean like I I cannot imagine how it in terms of being like yeah sure that seems like that falls within the bounds of your insurance policy I I mean ditto actually this is a good question though because I thought insurance was actually still hard to get for a lot of custodians I'm sure I'm sure so I'm sure also their deposits are like you know they have like maybe they just like went way over their cap and they they're not now not covered because they went over their their to look at I mean I also think they don't cover fraud right this is fraud basically right they are they are but it was all this problem when they just lost it that was like business practice insurance I don't know like but like when they when they when they [ __ ] up the key management themselves that wasn't fraud that was like incompetence but like that was an accident if you then if at the moment at the moment you realize it you tell your customers and you're like yo we don't have the money we we don't have a crypto yeah we threw your we threw your crypto in the trash can uh but we'll buy something like we'll buy some for you um that at that moment uh yes that that could have been the fraud claim could not could have been averted at that point um but when you keep the show running when you realize and you start buying crypto with your cash that belongs to customers because it's a custodian right this is not their money this is not like an exchange where these uh you know it's all basically an an Omnibus account and you know who knows really what the bankruptcy rules are for a custodian the rules are very simple for a custodian it is not your money it is the client's money period full stop so uh this kind of thing is is you know taking their money and using it to buy crypto's theft yeah it's trading your customers assets without their awareness of it to try to make it all back I mean that's just crazy well to be to be fair yeah all of the 2022 stuff was that so yeah to be clear so like at least FTX there was like some theory of how you made the money back right FTX at least was like oh I'm gonna like go long my [ __ ] coins and like I'm gonna trade it I'm gonna do these brilliant yield farming techniques with these guys I'm like why would you why would you do this why would you not why would you think like this isn't gonna immediately blow up in your face when you just have three million in cash versus 85 million in liabilities now to be clear these are all relatively small numbers in absolute terms this is a small custodian so we can kind of point and say ah these guys are idiots and audio so they're crypto liabilities you know the 70 million in crypto live obviously a lot of it's been already been drained because people heard all the instability and so they were pulling their money out so this might be a pittance compared to what they what they previously were cussing I don't know but the the crypto tokens um as as Tom mentioned 61.5 million out of the 69 million in liabilities are audience tokens it's like something like 30 of the audio supply which means that the non-audius crypto is like eight million dollars of like Bitcoin in ether or something so this is like a very this is very small amounts of money that these guys were holding but also I think the true USD thing was kind of a little bit weird also right because curiosity is one of the they were kept a large portion of the true USD Supply at Prime for us so yeah I don't know what's happening with true USD because like I think you know some of these rumors around and solvency came out like a week ago and then there's a big you know 360 short but then Finance is also like incentivizing for USD like not charging fees on the pair so I I like don't know what is actually happening it wasn't all a Parent Trap so I think I think that's basically what what people are basically yeah I think they claim they took their money out at some point quite a bit quite a bit ago before even in this recent instability they take the money out then they said after Prime trust went under that they had 26 000 at Prime trust which is again like a rounding error for for uh true USD so so yeah all in all um kind of a clown show so now the uh yeah Nevada regulator is saying okay let's put this thing under receivership and shut it down like why is this still operating I don't know but you know again this is such a small custodian uh in absolute terms like this is probably you know like the big custodians are probably 100 times bigger than these guys uh at least at this point I don't know what what they were at their at their Peak but um just go show the importance of of diligence and um you know and also the important thing of just knowing what your uh knowing the the competence Of Your Business Leaders this is one of the things people don't give enough credit to for coinbase or maybe it's been around for how long has it been like eight years nine years since Columbus Inception and they've never gotten hacked and that is incredible and absolutely incredible record of accustoming that amount of Bitcoin being a Honeypot for that many years and never getting hacked like and and people don't I that is one thing I feel like people do not give enough credit to coinbase for is just having absolute world-class opsec and robustness in the way they do things that's part of the reason why they're so trusted by the industry agreed but the bigger issue here Beyond not getting hacked because in essence they got hacked I mean it's they didn't get hacked they lost the assets but like there's the assets go into the black hole and then there's the cover-up which is the consequence of it right like if coinbase somehow had assets go into a black hole which it always could right like there's no guarantee that any custodian can keep all the assets completely safe at all times if the assets go into the black hole you know you're basically saying you would trust them not to cover it up and lie about it and fraud it and so the real problem here the iso Prime trust is not it's hard to safeguard assets because it's extraordinarily hard to safeguard assets right even as a custodian it's how they handled it which is like the truly like disappointing thing like it's so hard to safeguard assets it's hard for individuals it's hard for businesses it's hard for custodians whose job it is like it's just hard right it's hard for exchanges how many exchanges have lost assets Mount gox lost a you know lost assets right like quadrigo probably lost assets you know it's like there's so many instances of people losing crypto assets because keeping them safe is extraordinarily complicated and from there it separates into the good guys who own up to it and the bad guys who cover it up and dig themselves deeper trying to make it all back somehow well I I agree with you obviously the thing that needs to be condemned is that they were hiding it and covering it up and trying to run this kind of Ponzi like structure like this this is almost literally a Ponzi scheme where they're taking deposits from new people and using it to pay out folks who had their crypto uh black holes the thing though that like the core root of it is that these guys had no business custody in crypto if they could not figure out how to make sure that when you send the money that there's a private key associated with the address receiving it but by the way this has happened once before also not even the 101 the I don't know if you remember there was this like stakehound thing which was like an early eat steak or right which also got locked out of their fire blocks PLS Q Shares are much harder than normal private key but if you're going to be doing them then no other BLS know how the [ __ ] a pairing Works do not I there's no way this has anything to do with this no no but you have to understand how to maintain them make sure you understand which share to keep which one to dispose of which one is trusted setup like if you [ __ ] can't understand what a pairing is like you should not be managing key money using yeah no that's right and look I mean ultimately they kind of made the right choice in moving to fireblocks and saying okay we're going to Outsource the technology part of the custody to fire blocks which is wow great move but then they second guess themselves they're like oh wait no we need this other feature who knows what it was and that caused them to just completely screw over all their customers and and themselves now so well anyway my takeaway from this is I always go back to First principles this is yet again one of the reasons why defy has the long-term Advantage because if a D5 protocol somehow black hole assets everybody would know right away and there would be no ability to cover it up there would be no fraud next steps there's radical transparency and this would not happen with a smart contract that is true um but okay there's another conversation to be had here about self-custody right and that custody is hard that's part of the reason why people want to Outsource their custody to fire blocks or to coinbase or to whatever it's extremely hard that's why I gave all my crypto to tarun and he keeps the private Keystone it's still safe right you're not supposed to ever answer that no it's that's the beauty of trusted third parties they solve all no I I mean I I do think I I I hope that stuff like this forces uh people who are aiming to be custodians to not to actually understand how cryptography works is there a lot of people who are like oh this is going to be just like you know running a random software company or like oh this is going to be running like you know like a trading desk I don't have to think that hard about the cryptography stuff like isn't it just like call this library and hit encrypt and decrypt and like it works and I don't have to think about like how what what other [ __ ] files it's generating how I generate the entropy and then like you know I think there's a lot of people who are very over eager and think they already know that stuff without realizing they don't which I think was also kind of true in the FTX case too in some ways it's I feel like it's been a while since we've actually had like a large amount of crypto get black hole like the parody wallet stuff was kind of like the last thing that comes to mind but beyond that like it's usually almost always hacks right somebody's stealing it but like very rarely does it it actually gets stuck somewhere because someone lost access lost the private key or something wasn't there um interview didn't they do something oh with the multi-sig yeah uh that was someone else was able to get their address and take the money yeah they like deployed uh the Nosa safe to optimism to the address that would they sort of deployed to and on the main on mainnet and so yeah okay all right all right anyway but but we were it was but the thing to to Robert's Point earlier that winter mute thing was observed almost immediately by tons of people right like it was not like you found out a year later this Prime trust things have been going on for a while right it wasn't like two weeks ago they started doing that yeah this was this was yeah exactly exactly about 2022 that they were doing this listen every Ponzi scheme starts with someone like losing a little money and being like Oh I'll make it back before anyone finds out that's like Bernie Madoff that's like every it's like half the most hilarious thing to me was like the in 2021 when people were overly bullying anytime there would be a tiny Market downturn people would say that make it back in one trade Meme and like I I sort of think they really like I thought it was a joke and then now I've come to realize two years later that all these people took that [ __ ] seriously a lot of people did not get the job that was a joke I like can't believe yeah no it but here's the other thing too to ruin your earlier point about like custodians should be scared of this industry because it's hard and getting one little thing wrong can mean basically the end of your business or loss of massive amounts of customer funds um it's one of the reasons why you know when we started on the investing side um basically like we you know looking at custodians because there are of course a lot of custodians back in the day that you could uh conceivably custom your digital asset side and now they're even more um the number one thing is just how strong is your Tech Team like how strong is your paranoia how strong is your opsec and um that's one of the things that uh you know despite the fact that there are all these you know great stalwart Financial firms that are now getting into crypto custody for us one of the reasons why we default to the coinbases and the anchorages of the world is that they've been doing this for so long and they take it so seriously like for them it is absolute you know um of prime importance to never underestimate the task that's in front of you which is keeping your crypto safe now not messing it up yourself and not getting hacked and it's it's so easy you get it wrong once this is also why I'm quite negative on some of the traditional Finance custodians doing it themselves I think they're going to end up just buying someone because they like are not going to be able to they all seem so overly optimistic of like oh we're just gonna hire like five people and do it and I always like good luck uh but the one thing that's funny about it is none of this stuff is very static right like if you look at the the choice of like public Keys even through the ethereum merge like understanding like the changes to the curves whether you should be expecting the same public key or not whether you should be expecting like the the signatures to look the same all of that stuff in this space changes much faster you know like in what in web 2 land and definitely in finance land everyone always tells you the following added which is like never roll your own cryptography never make your own cryptography like just use some some other library and cryptocurrency is the only space where actually every [ __ ] chain is writing its own new thing because they're actually implementing some new cryptography that had never been used before and if you the user aren't cognizant of that in and of itself when you're doing it you're just gonna completely [ __ ] up and like I think like somehow Trad five people have this like we already know this we're so smart attitude towards this and I don't think they appreciate like the nuances in in these systems from a math standpoint from a CS standpoint from a engineering server there's like so many layers to it and it's not just like press encrypt and decrypt in the library which I don't know sorry for my little bully pulpit that I thought Tommy were gonna add something yeah I was gonna say I I think obviously having a great Tech team is is important and you know uh all is equal better than not but I think you know independent of that I would actually much rather take a team with like an insurance policy from Lloyd's um over a team does a as a great Tech Team but no insurance any day um and so there is something to just like falling back and having some sort of sort of recourse because uh it is sort of the uh nobody part ensuring nobody's ensuring custodians for like the entire assets no not yet probably not even for like 20 years not until like the science of keeping the assets there is like but this gets the right point of like I don't think we've this industry is not like stationary cryptography right like every single time there's like some new signature scheme there's some new encryption scheme and like that's most of the advantage that's most of the advances in this space versus that are not found anywhere else is that so because of that it's like it were I don't think we're anywhere near some crystallization Point except for Bitcoin Keys like Bitcoin basically is not changing like it's it's plausible that if you have you know a mega player like a Fidelity that they could potentially self-insure and basically say like look if you want an insurance policy you pay extra and we'll use the rest of our balance sheet to ensure your deposit that seems plausible to me and maybe that is a structural advantage that somebody like Fidelity could could Lord over a coinbase or an Anchorage or a bitco but right now um I mean for those for those of you who are not in the industry and don't realize this it is almost impossible to get insurance in crypto like Underwriters just do not know how to underwrite crypto they don't know what the risks are there's too little history the blow-ups are big and dramatic but then like a lot of things are just fine for a very long time it's very difficult to underwrite the space so you know anybody ask anybody who's in crypto trying to get insurance mostly you're just going to get the door slam in your face or you're going to get crazy crazy premiums which for a startup you know just don't make sense right that you can't be paying you know half your runway in insurance premiums it doesn't make any sense so that will someday change I don't know if it's 10 years 5 years 20 years I hope it's not the longer side of that but um the the Trad five players who are very big and have different you know Diversified businesses I could see them gaining an edge there in basically saying look we're going to self-insure but yeah Lloyd's is not gonna be enjoying a custodian anytime soon so okay um let's move on so I we it was a little light on news this week so we thought we'd uh check in with a little bit of a different angle and do kind of a broader examination of the state of crypto and we wanted to talk about layer 2's because there's a lot of conversation going on right now about layer 2 is one of the most dynamic areas within the you know broader crypto smart contracts ecosystem so we wanted to talk a little bit about the state of the market and some of the interesting things that are going on in the layer 2 world so I'll start with a little bit of exposition and then we'll just kind of kick off a broader discussion so l2s for those of you who are not aware of what an L2 is an L2 is for layer 2 a layer 2 is basically anything that Roots its trust in the layer 1 but creates sort of another layer of blockchain block space that you can interact on that's not directly on the layer one itself so the way that I like to analogize it is that a layer 2 is kind of like a skyscraper that creates more real estate on top of the underlying City so um in in the case of layer twos mostly today we're talking about Roll-Ups although lightning on bitcoin is growing quite a bit actually there's a lot of news about that but let's mostly focus on Roll-Ups so Roll-Ups there are today um call it four main players uh there's there's more now but we'll say the the big ones today are uh there's arbitrum which is the leader most tvl I think we've got like five billion plus they've got a lot of daily actives um so arbitrum huge player uh then there's optimism both of those are optimistic rollups and then we've got ZK sync which is kind of new newly on the rise or growing very quickly uh which is a ZK roll up and then there's dark wear uh which is not evm compatible unlike the other three they have their own you know totally separate language and ecosystem um so there's there's a few things that are going on right now and I'll have the first topic of discussion be about layer threes so layer threes have kind of become this meme that's become increasingly popular everyone's announcing their new layer three arbitrum has orbit chains ZK sync is hyper chains Stark x uh they have validiums which they've been kind of advertising for a while and there are some of them obviously already out there um and then optimism they have uh what do they what does optimism call their layer threes is it hyper chains as well uh super chain super chain super chain super chain sorry I keep I forget the prefixes no no but but the reason the reason that you might the is that one of the newest Super chain entities uh used to call everything they built hyper structures so you know recently announced that they're launching their own op stack which is a fork of optimism um and uh they're they're building a super chain on optimism so in layer three simply put my understanding to ruin correct me if I'm wrong my understanding of a layer three is that basically it's a layer two on top of the layer two so you build a skyscraper on top of the skyscraper but there's a fast exit so that basically if you want to go from the super mega skyscraper on top of the other skyscraper all the way down to ground floor you can take one elevator and go all the way down is that the skyscraper analogy I feel like doesn't quite recurse as well how many times have you seen someone build a skyscraper on the skyscraper other than like that failed Hotel yeah yeah go to the Middle East you're going to see a lot of very interesting structures um so yes uh so that's basically letter three layers becoming more popular and the Opie stack has become kind of a meme at this point is that lots and lots of people are not building on the op stack uh one of our portfolio companies called Dara which is like a roll-up as a service company facilitates people launching their own uh Roll-Ups base of course in openstack roll up Zora's open side roll up I guess these are all going to be hyper change oh sorry super chains now what do you guys think of this layer three concept and um the the proliferation of the op stack you guys are I should also copy you guys are investors in yes um I would say you know in the same way that you know in the 1999 uh Tech bubble web van was a good idea but like wrong timing wrong execution arguably like all of this stuff's actually existed in 2017 under the the name of plasma and like a lot of the exit games and stuff are the same but like people didn't understand how to implement these things and where the interfaces were and like which things were necessary components in the same way hopefully the thesis is that cell phones were necessary for these types of businesses that didn't work in 1999 when no one had cell phone and now ethereum is sufficiently strong to be this base piece whereas it was not development wise that ethereum was sufficiently strong why why well because I mean you ate to use as a d a layer to use it as the Final Exit layer of like your assets are really stored there you need to like build all these contracts for doing that it was very hard to do that in 2017 bordering on Impossible and I think a bunch of different other things in in ethereum ecosystem developer ecosystem wise have made but made it a lot easier whereas like in 2017 you could like see the idea but like the idea of implementing it was impossible which is why you saw like the Amisa goes over the world kind of try and fail and stuff like that right there's so many people I would characterize it differently I would characterize it differently so I think in 2017 um so this plasma for those who don't know for those who came in in the last three years probably never heard this term so plasma was kind of the the predecessor of all the layer twos that have taken place you know the optimistic Roll-Ups and all the all the roll-up stuff uh plasma was basically a very primitive version of a roll-up um that had a lot of problems around data availability basically they didn't really have an answer for data availability uh and they didn't have good solutions for General computation so a lot of the initial ideas around plasmas were that you could transfer utxos on plasmas and then you know the exits were gigantic nightmare but as a user you get to track your own utxo and then manually exit it and it was a whole it was a whole thing that was just very unrealistic for users to be able to manage all this so let me say go is one example there was Loom if you remember I think Georgia's used to be uh at Loom and that's how he first became you know Mr Georgios Mr Lair two was from all his work there um so there were some folks that were really trying to launch these plasmas but they weren't really working and I think the biggest thing that was holding plazas back is that there wasn't really a good answer for General uh computation so you you couldn't do a turn complete or do evm right and that's ultimately what we've seen is now massive massive product Market fit is evm if you cannot do evm you're just not going to get use right you know people do not want to build I mean there are there are obviously some you know kind of uh application specific blockchains like you know do idx and so on that that that do have some traction but for the most part the vast majority of block space is evm block space that's what most people care about majority of used block space there's a lot of not useful blocks there's a lot of empty blocks in some places yeah that's true yes the majority of demand for Block spaces for EDM block space so I think the the the so all of this I think what I think the reason why this happened one was that we needed to actually develop the ideas behind Roll-Ups which took a while there were a lot of false starts so like optimism they started with uh the ovm which was like a kind of different like a shim between evm and like their own internal representation or whatever and then they abandoned that they kind of scrapped the whole thing and then just did what Arbitron was doing with the direct DVM compatibility so long story short has been just be evm compatible that's that's number one rule and then the second thing also is that optimism is still not really done right like the op stack doesn't have fraud proofs um and almost all the Roll-Ups are still you know highly guarded right like they're protected by multisigs you know the upgrades upgrade process right now is still not being done through decentralized governance arbitrum does a fraud produce what the fraud proofs are they are white listed so only certain parties can actually submit the fraud proofs so the reality is that you know for op stack in particular you know for bass or uh whatever these things are not even really Roll-Ups because there's no there's no fraud proofs right so there's no there you you are not getting the guarantees from ethereum without any fraud proofs right now it's just basically sidechain that spits out data availability on some other layer uh so I the point I'm making is that I think it really is about r d I don't think it's about ethereum no no no but but they were they were sort of coupled right like ethereum's roadmap at that time with trying to to do uh like sort of full sharding like I guess some people like near did right like was just very different in the sense like some of the design decisions being made were made for that use case whereas like right now it's like very clear okay we need to like make storage blobs cheaper we need to like do all this stuff to make Roll-Ups better right but a lot of that just came I agree it's r d but the r d actually was initially all at the base layer and getting and then that but how but what has ethereum even done that facilitated Roll-Ups in the last three years I mean making developer tools so you can do the the verification contracts like there's like lots of little tiny things that are annoying that like I would say that like 2018 2019 you could not imply right 2019 2018 you could Implement you thought you could Implement compound took a lot of work you had contract limit sizes you couldn't like you had to do all this stuff and the the logic for a lot of the L2 stuff is actually quite complicated uh you know comparatively uh I I I'm just saying like I I think that there was quite a bit of ethereum core development needed and a focus not on charting at the base protocol and the focus on this kind of like almost like distributed sort of form of that um now you know yeah again I agree with you that it remains to be seen that if we get like how do you deal with frog proofs how do you deal with datability and so yeah data availability um for I guess the the listeners who don't understand I know we kind of tossed that term around like three times is the idea that the base chain where your assets are on is the one that's really like providing the data for uh these other chains so these other you're posting the data both to the base layer and to the other chain such that if you wanted to exit or there was some type of fraud which is what a fraud proof or fault proof uh kind of shows you then that way the layer one can say okay well you can exit you can take your assets out like did something wasn't working there and like so your assets are still Tethered to the main initial chain a lot of the earlier designs to to see its earlier Point kind of we're focused just on doing payments right like bitcoin's light name network is just payments um and doesn't really have contract functionality or scr you know putting conditions or covenants on things but you know I think the the idea of like having tightly coupled shards that were each an application versus this kind of you can add your own and you only have to in the average case you don't have to interact with the expensive layer one very often it there's a lot of things that needed to go right to get to this point but I I think the the question to me is like what's the level of interoperability between these chains because you know in Cosmos you do technically already have the interoperability you just have zero demand for Block space basically and the question here is like there seems to be some demand like I guess bass and arbitrim obviously has some of the most highest organic demand optimism has a lot of demand from from sort of incentivized the demand so the real question I guess is you know how much do these things need to talk to each other and if there's 20 of them like are they really going to be all 20 users it's still going to concentrate to the ones that have the most liquidity user apps well I think it goes to the ones with the most liquidity and user apps and reason to be there why wouldn't it like what else is going to do for sure but but we kind of have this like boom right now right and people who are like I'm going to build my own app chain but now it's called uh you know X roll up like op sack roll up arbitrary yeah I think that that is a lot of it frankly is people want their own chain but like you know normally if you're like rolling your own Cosmos chain you can make an argument around oh well here's all the reasons why this chain is going to be Optimizer tailored to my specific use case or these validator is going to be perfect for my specific thing I I kind of struggle with that a little bit more with with Roll-Ups like I don't even know how much customization we've seen amongst you know some of the uh op stack deployments um that have come out so far like it just seems like there's less customizability and so it's like why this thing versus just doing it on sort of the main L2 so one one other element of this that I think is interesting to talk about is polygon so polygon they kind of sit in this weird uh no man's land where they're sort of they're in L1 but they also have other products underneath the same product Suite so they've got zkevm which is there um there's zkvm which was built by uh Jordy um Jordi balina um and uh they they recently announced that they are transitioning they're going to be transitioning the sort of polygon mainnet which is you know ostensibly a little one uh into being a uh a zika evm validium so validium uh basically is a uh it's basically a roll-up a zika roll-up that has the data availability totally off chain um in some other place so it's not you know the bridge is on ethereum but the data availability is somewhere else so they're it's cheaper to run a validium than to run a kind of full zika Roll-Up and um the interesting thing so there was you know Sundeep the founder of uh of polygon was just complaining that people treat them like the ugly stepchild of the ethereum community in that no matter what they do the ethereum community like always finds some way to like poke a hole in it or to tell them that they're not you know they're not uh they're not real they're not really decentralized they're not really a layered to they're not really whatever um I'm sure how do you guys how do you guys see what polygon is doing and how it fits into the layer 2 story because they're definitely one thing is very very clear is that they're not ethereum cool kids they're not the anointed they're you know they're not blessed by vitalik and all these other folks where how do you uh how do you contextualize that into like the everything that's happening in the blockchain world I mean I don't think you have to be anointed I don't think you have to have like some social proof you just have to have a reason for something to exist right and I think it goes the other way where if there's a reason for something to exist some roll up some app change some whatever then later people will say oh it's here for a good reason it's anointed or like blah blah blah blah blah like I would say to any Builders out there you know screw what people on Twitter say if it needs to exist it should exist yes that that is that is true to an extent but like the Roll-Ups on ethereum are unlike a lot of other technology races in that they're very very political particular ethereum Roll-Ups are super political and I think part of the reason why roles are so political is that it is deeply tied with the long-term road map of ethereum right like you turn it down transition was a big deal exactly the Rich story was that ethereum was going to transition into a bunch of shards like a bunch of little baby ethereums that would all talk to each other that was the big vision of how to scale ethereum and then they gave that up because they basically said look doing bunch of Roll-Ups is going to be easier okay so and you know you you guys will be able to move much faster than we as ethereum can so let's just embrace the roll-up Vision that instead of a thousand baby ethereums there's gonna be a thousand baby Roll-Ups on top of a thousand ethereums and we'll just be like the substrate on which all these skyscrapers will get built okay in that vision of the world it really matters it really matters who ethereum Embraces as being like yes we will support you we will you know make the op codes that you ask for cheaper we will you know convene our blob storage around your particular ideas we will tell people like there there are a lot of things that are not so subtle above the way in which ethereum is influencing the outcome of the role of Wars but but but the op codes that they've rolled out benefit everybody you're really talking about two kind of separate things the EIP process for making changes ethereum is extremely politically motivated politically generated but arguably arbitrum's organic kind of very natural success come from the fact that they just like built the most reliable roll up first right like uh it shows the chasm that they had to overcome right like optimism they were so far ahead of it but my point is like technical technical sophistication can like get you past these political that's kind of the beauty of crypto right it's like you built this thing that like was better for oracles and so then the purpose protocols were better so then they get brought there and like that was like completely unrelated ethereum politics but what you're acknowledging through what you're acknowledging when you say that is that optimism was the one that was preferred by the ethereum but I'm saying in spite of that it it didn't change the outcome the outcome was like you built the best thing right like whoever built the thing that found a user imagine imagine if the imagine if the ethereum foundation was like actually arbitrum is better and we love arbitrum and we're going to like pose with them for photo ops we're gonna tell everybody that arbitrum is the way that ethereum is going to scale and they and vitalik mentioned Arboretum in every single blog post our optimism would have no oxygen they would not be able to breathe from how dominant technical advance that was really good for applications that had users like in the case of arbitrum making it having all these features such that perps were actually much more reliable there than the like Perpetual Futures uh D5 protocols were more robust than they were on optimism then you know if the opposite thing happened I still think the same outcome happens because people who are the developers who are building these apps are just looking for particular properties right it's like why do I choose AWS or gcp is my Amazon web services or Google Cloud for my for my uh Cloud hosting it's like oh maybe they have some particular feature or like they have a particular type of GPU so and like it's reliable and I can get it and like I'm always able to what what exactly is that difference between an operation and optimism well I think the optimism Bedrock upgrade kind of fixes a lot of the things that people complained about but like you know the block time reliability wasn't as good like the latency the latency reliability the way the message passing to the end user was for for met stuff was just better um I think it was you know they they kind of like the learning path of going from ovm to to different things so my point is like the there's a there's a sense in which arbitrum did really get a lot of these engineering decisions right at the time that there were these applications that really needed them and had this amazing organic growth story right like they really did have organic non-incentivized via tokens growth and so and and that built up their ecosystem so so I my point is I I think the roll-up Wars are are there is some real politics no doubt right there's it certainly shows up but I I do think your technical capabilities are are the most important thing eventually right like if you find you make the technical capabilities that are exactly what the developers at that time were demanding it's it's just it's going to be hard to compete with that now I think your point about polygon is polygon was sort of started as early and they're effectively their own L1 that happen to be an evm right and then like now they're kind of backing into it so it's just a different gestation story right like they didn't start purely on the mothership day kind of started with this thing that used a little bit of substrate and a little bit of cause like you know like they have like their code base also doesn't look like we are purely in eth you know like and and well I forget what that law is that's like how your code base looks reflects the communication pattern at your company there's like there's like a you know and like I feel like that's actually true in blockchain so it's true in Roll-Ups too it's like how your code base looks is a reflection of your contributors community and the applications that want to build on you and you should strive for that to look like the thing you want you know and I think that that will be the ultimate determinant anyway I'm done ranting well I think Matic started out as like a side chain right and so they've always been like close to the ethereum ecosystem and they've been trying to figure out I think like it's there was not an answer for years as to like how you actually go about building a real business and Company like this and the answer you know for a while it was just Jerry rigged this thing and kind of make something that looks like what people want and it's like yeah that's probably if you if you don't do that and you try to have some sort of you know purity test you probably just die because it's straight up not functional or not even possible to do what you're trying to do so it's like you're navigating this this this weird balance of trying to find something that has immediate pmf but also trying to build for this long-term path it's it's not um I think as simple as uh you know just uh uh you know building to sort of some fewer r d Vision I hope that you know it works several years down the line pmf being product Market fit um so I I I I really like that point Tom and I totally agree with it is that in a way being able to just build Tech that nobody wants and nobody uses and just like hang around and wait for the World to Change is a very is basically a privilege that can be afforded to you in an environment that's a wash with capital polygon you know like I mean the one thing that will give them a lot of credit for they they came from India obviously the entire team is Indian and a lot of their usage is outside of the first world that's where the kind of their stronghold is is kind of non-first world users and um they they had to scr they had to scrimp and scrape for everything that they got you know and I have a huge amount of respect for that it doesn't appeal very much to the ethereum intelligencia but because you know it's not the sort of pristine like wait why didn't you why didn't you start as a roll-up and immediately blah blah blah blah and like look we try to build the things that people wanted you guys are building the things that each other said that each other should want and nobody was using any of your [ __ ] you know two three years ago um we were building the things that people actually wanted people wanted block space they wanted um to have uh I don't know whatever all the stuff that that polygon has launched they always have a large product Suite um and uh you guys said you wanted web 2 kind of traditional companies and Brands to partner and do stuff in web3 well okay we're doing that that's what we're exactly what we're doing that that uh hustle is what I really respect about polygon uh but it is certainly true that they they don't have this um kind of you know pristine uh kind of evolutionary origin story the way that they were the way that so many people in the kind of Western technology world would very much prefer them to so okay last thing I want to talk about on the um you mentioned Mev with respect to uh what was going on with optimism versus arbitrum one of the one of the things we've been seeing a lot of just as VCS getting a lot of pitches about sequencers share sequencers so okay what the hell is the shared sequencer so uh let me see if I can come up with a uh okay I'm gonna use I'm gonna use the skyscraper analogy for this so uh in in so when you're running a layer two um there is some entity that is basically deciding The Ordering of all the transactions in the layer two and they're kind of doing the work of processing stuff they're kind of the CPU of the of that mini blockchain um you can sort of think of this as like the leasing office of the skyscraper right you need some somebody in there who's like kind of doing the work of allocating all the rooms or whatever um and so a shared sequencer is this idea that you can have multiple skyscrapers that are controlled by the same leasing office and the advantage of this um there there are a few advantages of this but one of the one of the nice advantages of this is that you can basically do a sort of do a deal or do like a you know a transfer across your transaction in a bridge um or some kind of cross uh roll-up Mev so basically I want to do this and that across these two blockchains and if if both of them cannot be done I want to cancel the transaction out right so you can get some like Atomic guarantees across multiple blockchains uh or multiple Roll-Ups you can do that through one leasing office right you can be like I want this room in this skyscraper and this room in this skyscraper but if I can't get both I don't want either of them um that can only be done if you have you know one party to negotiate with so these are these sort of shared sequencers these are becoming kind of a new hot thing uh there's also decentralized sequencers which is kind of the story for all these guys that not only are these sequencers going to be shared across multiple uh Rolex but also they're going to be decentralized in some way today they're all uh pretty much centralized um how do you guys think about decentralized sequencers is this an interesting thing to invest in do we think it's going to be big do we think that only you know small um Roll-Ups are going to have shared sequencers or is this going to be the new future I'm sure Tyrone you have very strong opinions I can see you smiling um I think the funny thing that we learned is like a lot of companies we invested in last year started saying they were doing different things and then all of a sudden converged on hey we're all gonna do shared sequencers which I thought was like funny if you when you see like the market pivot into something there's some sort of a lease idea level demand for it um I think this is very hard to get right um you know your your goal is to be as like lightweight as possible without just making another blockchain that's intermediating between all these chains um but yeah the I the idea like the dream is that you know one of the most beautiful things in in crypto and especially in D5 that you don't really have in normal Finance at all is this concept of a flash loan where you can borrow capital and you only your loan only exists if your activity or Arbitrage or whatever your function is able to return profitably then the loan happens and it's sort of a way of like guaranteeing atomicity you know guaranteeing execution in a particular order of the sequence of transactions but it's also a way of doing sort of like risk-free lending because it really is risk-free right like it only executes if it it's these things uh conditions covenants work and are profitable and obviously as the blockchain ecos got much more complicated post 2020 people always want ways to do the same thing they would like some guarantees of that form and there's always sort of this inherent problem where like if you have two machines that are independent in they don't quite have to respect one another and you could kind of think of um you could you could if you think of these chains as Nations um the the idea of the bridges or bridges are like kind of like when you go to you go at the airport and they like check your passport and they're like nope we're denying you there's sort of the sense of like you're you're moving between regions that are different they have different rules and you may be in that new region your assets will have different kind of covenants or lack thereof attitude the goal of the shared sequencer is somehow to pick some subset of things that are free trade agreements at least that's how I like to think of that it's like guaranteeing atomicity over these two different regions is a little bit like NAFTA it's like we agree that these two things and and I think okay I like the leasing office better but I'll take NAFTA I just think the fair trade versus not here this is a very true not fair trade is like you know like the bridges have to handle all possible things handle all the tariffs Fair Trades is like whatever we guarantee you this this will always go across and so I think like there's a sense in which that's sort of where it's hard it does have the same it has some of the same problems of like how do you remunerate the shared sequencer for doing this action of making it feel like a fair trade zone and how do you make it so that it's easy to verify on both sides um but yeah there's clearly a ton of interest in this um I think there's also a lot of debate over uh this you know I think people in you know the land where people don't want things to be asynchronous like Solana they sort of view the shared sequencer as like well aren't you just going back to what we're doing because you're like guaranteeing these atomicity guarantees that we always guarantee because everyone's on the same chain and there's no separation of church and state and uh on the other hand you have you have people in ethereum who are like hey we're a bunch of op stack Roll-Ups we're likely sharing a lot of assets on ethereum that are being used in our chains can we make some extra guarantees on both sides uh and that's sort of this Fair Free Trade Agreement type of thing so the the first thought that I have about shared sequencers is that so one it feels to me like I mean this is it's interesting but it feels a little bit bike shitty like it feels like this is the the amount of interest and attention and energy going into this problem um feels a little bit over overweight to it's like actual importance to user experience of these things um like the reality is like optimism side does not have fraud proofs right like that seems like a really big problem um and but but it's so much so much brain power is being expended on how to create shared sequencers it feels a little bit um like a kind of misdirection of just because it's intellectually interesting um the other side of it of course is that like the the problem with shared sequencer is also the kind of the Noisy Neighbor problem which is that if you are an arbitrom or you are you know kind of optimism mainnet um you're you've got a lot of [ __ ] going on you're very full right you don't necessarily want to be a joined at the hip to you know 20 other Roll-Ups that are also going to be kind of sending their transactions to the same uh sequencer that's you know you know you've got uh the the the sort of the passport you know stamping office uh if you have you know 20 security lines going in the same passport office uh it's just going to be more of a [ __ ] show and like you're going to have latency problems congestion problems all that sort of stuff is just going to wear down on you um and so the biggest Roll-Ups I have to imagine are going to be fairly selective in who they allow to share sequencing with them uh and then these folks who are going to be on shared sequencers are going to be folks who are like well I I really want to be on a shared sequencer with arbitrum be cause that's kind of you know that's where all the action is but Arboretum doesn't want me to be sharing their sequencer and so there is kind of a little bit of like you know uh people want to be part of a club but the the clubs are gonna be invited to are not the clubs they want to be a part of I think though if you have any desire to decentralize the execution you effectively have you kind of have to have this kind of sense in which anyone can do yeah I think that's kind of the bigger Point people make I mean that's like always like kind of the classic criticisms of LL twos is like haven't we kind of just gone all the way full circle right now we have like just a single computer processing all the transactions and like you know we have one point that you know does go down not infrequently and can censor uh transactions and so it's like yeah it's not as bad as as uh you know instead of having arbitrary State writing capabilities but there are sort of you know downsides to having sort of a single um sequencer and so I think that's kind of more the angle that that I I guess I think of this uh coming from in terms of benefits but to your point around like performance like it feels like we're we're so far from um being at a point but decentralized sequencers and shared sequencers are too like totally orthogonal things I Can't Ban I can't say I can't join the club problem and then the other one will kind of be like where mostly income is why would why would these like if if uh if if ziki Sync has decentralized sequencer uh why would that have any impact on the I can't join the club problem right like they can still decide with decentralized governance no you can't join a club I mean theoretically the shared sequencer itself should be allowed to be joined by anyone who's a sequencer member in one like if you had a decentralized sequencer I can't give you any of the shared guarantees unless all the pools of possible sequencers is overlapping because otherwise I'll lose some of those guarantees so so I I think it's like if you actually are decentralized then anyone can always give these elements to guarantees you can't you kind of so I'm saying the decentralized sequence the the desire to decentralize a sequencer will cause the the the shared part to not be as clubbiest as you might think is my guess okay let me understand your mental model here so you're saying let's say that optimism let's say op Sac uh optimism doesn't mean that moves to a uh a decentralized sequence or not a shared sequencer okay they move to decentralized sequencer you're saying that once they have a decentralized sequencer then anybody will be able to say hey I want to add myself to the shared sequencing conduit so that I'm also you know being being entered into the same decentralized sequencer um why would it be the case why wouldn't it be the case that the you know plurality of the people who are sequencing for uh op stack would say no we want to we we strictly only want to have one blockchain that would sequencing only ones have three or we want to have five and we're not inviting you to that five I mean I think if they're doing a free trade agreement with arbitrum like they're they're like sharing like in order to give those optimistic guarantees whenever to any application that requests it to have that like liveness for that they effectively have to let anyone in the arbitrome sequencing pool sequent who is sequencing at that time be providing the shared guarantee on the leg on the other leg right like so so I think I believe our term already does have this implemented for having multiple sequencers rotating like for epochs it's fixed Epoch so like I'm like oh I see I see so if it's your Epoch you could if as long as you're also on the arbitrum like it's your Epoch on orbital and your email on optimism then in that moment that you line up on both um you can be the shared sequencer yeah that's that's kind of where I I kind of think if they really are going to decentralize that the shared part ends up having having to inherit that property kind of okay I see you I see your point sorry Tom I interrupted you no no I I was was pretty much I think it's more like um it feels like we're so far uh from sort of the performance required for these things to be sort of mainstream and successful to get anything consider you know busy performance degradation for the sake of decentralization that um yeah I don't know it just also feels like a thing that yes we should get to in the road map but like not as as sort of critical I I kind of agree that like it's a little bit web Fanny in that you probably need applications that are really demanding it right I think first yeah yeah I I mean the amount of times I've heard the hotel and train problem as an explanation of why we need this is uh telling that that right now this is uh more an intellectually interesting problem than it is like a you know the most important thing well maybe maybe if we step back from this infrastructure kind of conversation what are the applications that you think you're most excited about that are coming in this format right because there's a ton of them coming out like yeah actually wrong well I think we've established that like I am not as bullish on app change as As You Are I mean I look I think uidx moving to Cosmos is really interesting I'd love to see how that plays out I think right now the dydx they have a lot of confidence that they're gonna be able to pull people away from ethereum and move into their own infrastructure um I think that'll be an interesting experiment to see how um how how robust this sort of action thesis is um for you know a product that has really strong brand really strong user base really strong metrics like dydx um yeah what are you guys thinking are there things that you guys are excited about that you think are interesting app chain opportunities that I know I'm hearing silence well let's continue this one on the next show okay all right all right we're over and I think uh I think uh we're starting to flag a little bit okay we're a bit over time so we're going to call it there um but interesting times in L2 land uh we'll we'll this is a story that will continue checking in on as it continues to evolve for now that's it for this week thank you everybody [Music]
