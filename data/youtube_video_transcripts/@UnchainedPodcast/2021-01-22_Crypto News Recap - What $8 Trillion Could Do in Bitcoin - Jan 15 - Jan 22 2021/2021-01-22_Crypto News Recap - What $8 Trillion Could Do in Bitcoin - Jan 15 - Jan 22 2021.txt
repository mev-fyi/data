whether gensler will seek a mandate from congress for the sec to regulate the spot market for crypto assets that are not securities noting that the cftc only has enforcement authority which isn't the same as regulatory or supervisory authority next headline more crypto savvy picks likely to lead cftc and occ georgetown professor chris brummer is biden's likely nominee for cftc chair after the

0.0006 bitcoin which was about 21. however as hasso of darabet explained in a blog post instead of this being the equivalent of someone bouncing a check in bitcoin it was more that a transaction was invalidated but based on the fact that almost an entire day passed between the initial transaction and the first transaction that attempted to replace it it seems unlikely that this was someone trying to cheat a merchant who offers purchases with zero confirmations which was one explanation instead what seems likely is that this spender who hassu calls alice actually made an additional transaction that assumed her previous transaction with a too low fee had already passed and this time the fee she used was enough to pay for both transactions so they both went through time for fun bits why 1

quote astrology can be thought of like a giant mirror or a symbolic language where certain signifiers of planetary alignments are archetypes and they represent themes in the world like growth or restriction or aggression or peace so when she looks at how the movement of the planets aligns with bitcoin for the next few months she says february and early march are favorable but then there will
