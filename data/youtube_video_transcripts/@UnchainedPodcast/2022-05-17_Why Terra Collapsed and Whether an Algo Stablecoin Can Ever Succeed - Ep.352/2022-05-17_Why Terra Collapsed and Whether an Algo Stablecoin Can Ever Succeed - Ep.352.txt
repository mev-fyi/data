and luna here to discuss are nick carter of castle island ventures eric wall chief investment officer at arcane assets and eric voorhees of shapeshift welcome eric eric and nick hi laura hi hello thank you very much so we're doing something unusual as i mentioned earlier uh we're live streaming this podcast episode because events have been moving so quickly when it comes to tara luna that i felt the podcast might be somewhat outdated by the time it comes out on tuesday so let's just start with what opinion each of you had about the terra luna ecosystem and i'm saying like before the dpeg happened or it could even be your opinion of algorithmic stable coins in general why don't we start with you eric voorhees i love experimentation and i i was an owner of uh of luna before i got all wiped out last week with the rest of everyone so i certainly had a vested interest in it i've been following it for you know over a year um i'm a big fan of the cosmos ecosystem and as it was a tendermint chain i've been watching it closely i have to say my my original bias has been that algorithmic stable coins probably can't work i used to think they were impossible but i i've had to open my mind a little bit and realize that like maybe it can be done so i remain skeptical that they can work long term but i want to see people try and i would much rather us learn that they can't work from actual iteration in the market rather than from theory i'm glad to see these kind of things getting built it's awful that this one got so big and then fell apart which we'll talk about but uh yeah i you could say i was a a uh a skeptical and risk understanding supporter before the collapse oh that's really fascinating all right eric well what about you i've been uh frustrated for some time that we so far in this industry haven't really synthesized the good variant of a decentralized stablecoin like i've been looking for that for a long time and in that search luna has been like ust has been proposed as a good example of a decentralized stable coin and when i looked at it originally back in i think it was june uh last year i recognized that this was yet another uncollateralized stable coin the oracle mechanism was was rather primitive and the price was tied to the demand of basically a coin so um my perception of luna was basically if you've seen that movie speed where sandra bullock is driving a bus and keanu reeves is on that bus that's sort of the analogy of the ust stablecoin that i saw and it was in my opinion a matter of time like how far can they drive and how how long can that journey go on for until it eventually collapses and just to make sure i understand so it's not necessarily that you think decentralized algorithmic stable coins will never work it's just that you felt this particular one was not constructed well like i won't take credit and say that i've been convinced throughout this whole time that that is mathematically impossible that an algorithmic stable coin cannot exist but i think that we've seen a number of empiric examples that these examples do not work there are historic examples even before crypto that have tried this before and now we have tried it in crypto look i mean i think i think the intuition that has confused me a little bit is that well if you think about proof-of-stake for example proof-of-stake has the ability to secure blockchain by using the native asset that it can that it conjures itself if proof of stake works then maybe you could uh make the assumption that well maybe we can stabilize the price of a stablecoin also inherently from the asset itself so i didn't exclude the probability of it happening but i think that there's enough empirical evidence to be at least extremely extremely cautious and perhaps you know not be so inclined to assume that we have something that we should just push into the entire ecosystem as people have has been doing with luna yeah well clearly there was some merit to that thinking nick what was your stance on algorithmic stable coins as well as tara luna yeah so i've been uh you know a stable coin enthusiast for a long time i support the institution of stable coins you know defended uh tether on a number of occasions right so i think the fiat backed model is great the fully convertible model works and provides a great service and you know is a great complement to uh to bitcoin you know i don't think it's incompatible with bitcoin in any way the uh algorithmic model i i you know first thought deeply about it on a diligence basis basecoin back in the day look looked at that investment developed a variety of attacks on it and thought it was it would be impossible that it wouldn't work 2020 i looked into tara i wrote a white paper on on stable coins i looked at a whole bunch of different models and wrote tara off i thought it wouldn't work and then i was shocked when it it you know swelled to such a significant scale i wasn't as critical as eric was because i don't really have the appetite to uh to go toe-to-toe with people in crypto like that i don't have the stomach for it frankly but uh i had been critical of luna terra uh and i didn't think it would work and and i think it you know there are a variety of you know mechanics which made it get as large as it did which were irresponsible uh but yeah my current stance is it would be great if there was a crypto backed stable coin uh that was uh you know credibly decentralized and could resist seizure the way that fiat backstable coins can't that has to be over collateralized in my opinion i don't believe you can do it in the undercollateralized way i think we have abundant examples in crypto uh in the history of stable coins uh history of senior shares stable coins we have abundant examples from financial history monetary history uh and so for a while now i've been convinced that senior shares stable coins cannot work so let's talk about what actually happened this week there's been a lot of speculation on twitter and elsewhere that this was a deliberate attack on tara do you think that that was the case and you know explain why or why not i can start i don't think it was coordinated i think uh it is a form of coping in order to think that you've been victimized by a single entity as opposed to just investing in something that is unstable we don't need a catalyst actually for a bank run to occur you don't strictly need an attack to occur for a fundamentally unstable system all you need is you know a few sellers to get spooked and then it catalyzes more and more and then it's rushed to the exits and the exit's too small and so that's what we saw like certainly the rumors of black rocker citadel doing this are completely fallacious you know you didn't need a single malicious entity and i think people are trying to reapportion blame to some fictitious presumed entity which which you know brought this whole thing down in its way of avoiding the reality of the situation which is that it was unstable yeah i just need to comment on that when tara oh sorry when uh blackrock posted an article about how you know they they had this denial the comments back to them were just people wanting to believe that it was them and accusing them anyway i mean it was you know i was shaking my head reading it but anyway uh eric you wanted to add something eric voorhees yeah um yeah i agree with but mostly with with nick said i think more importantly it doesn't matter if there are attackers out there like these systems need to be able to exist and thrive and survive in an adversarial environment so i don't really care if like one entity did a kill shot on this or if it was you know a million market participants acting in their own interests which is i think what the default position should be if if it is one attacker i think that changes the conversation and distracts from it like the mechanism needs to be able to withstand a single attacker and if it can't then it needs to die and go away so yeah i mean certainly it'd be very interesting and scandalous if it was but i've seen no strong evidence to support that and i think people should assume that it's this is the vagaries of how markets work yeah i just got to add something uh to that i don't think that it was uh i think that the timing of the event was kind of suspicious in some sense if you know about the three pull on curve and the four pool that they were moving their liquidity to uh the destabilization of the peg happened at that exact moment if it had happened a couple of hours or er later then there would have been billions in liquidity to cushion the fall of ust so it seems like like i'm not excluding like i i agree completely with what uh eric voorhees said that it doesn't matter if it was an attack or not because we didn't have these artificial pools of liquidity for luna before and it was just that we were moving liquidity from one pool to the other these systems should be resilient to that but i cannot exclude the possibility that there was something related to the timing of liquidity being moved from one pool in curve into another pool because that decreased the threshold that the an attacker would need to mount against terra in order to be successful so i think that it's definitely possible i don't have any evidence i don't have any evidence of that but i don't think that it's at all unlikely to assume that someone saw that in this exact moment there is less liquidity that would cushion the fall of ust so if i attack now i'm going to have a higher success rate so the timing of the the pegging seems to be related to the moving of liquidity on curb in my opinion yeah i agree that the timing is suspicious um kevin joe of galwa capital who has been sounding the you know an alarm about uh what he felt was a risky structure of ust for a long time um i was uh damning with him and he said that he felt that someone could have accidentally kicked it off when they saw the liquidity was low if they didn't know what was happening with the transfer of the liquidity from three pole to four pool and just got kind of concerned about their investment that it could have been something like that but you know to me i i do think that the timing is suspicious a few things i do want to clear up i've just seen so much on twitter and elsewhere where people are saying that this happened when someone first of all borrowed 100 000 bitcoin or they started shorting bitcoin there's like a number of these things where you would only know that if you like worked at the place you know where they did that trade or something like which they're not going to be publicly talking about that so i just want to kind of separate a fact from speculation here you know i mean clearly there there was um actually can somebody describe it with something on curve that basically is what kind of kicked off the d-pad they did a large trade on curve uh can one of you explain what that was um well i can give it my best shot so there was a migration uh that was supposed to happen on curb where there's a so-called four pool where you tie the liquidity of frax usdc ust and i think usdt together and there were they were supposed to move the liquidity of ust from another pool uh into the four pool and while they were doing that migration they're just taking ust out and it was uh we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that they had just taken out which if the four pool which was going to be uh it was going to be billions of dollars in that pool if they would have uh attacked when the four pool was up and running then there would have been billions of dollars that would have cushioned the fall in the for poo but now since they were pulling the liquidity out of the ust pool on curb the liquidity there was much much lower i think we were talking about like 150 millions of dollars there instead of like three four billion so if someone wanted to short ust and caused the the peg the price to the peg there was much less liquidity in curve at that particular moment but i'm i i'm not an expert on like that exact particular mechanic that happened right there so i can't speak exhaustively to it but that's like roughly as a summary of what happened right and then that kind of kicked off the dpeg basically well someone someone started to uh sell a huge amount of ust which started the the d-peg and if there was a curve pool to orbit to arbitrage that the price difference would then that would have cushioned the fall extensively but now that liquidity wasn't there it was just a couple hundred millions of dollars there it was much easier to to make that price uh of ust go down relative to two other stables yeah and i saw people also saying that if all of this had happened once whirlpool was up and running then it would have been even harder so this was just like kind of a weak moment but you know we're we're not saying that we know anything happened deliberately because you know as i mentioned kevin joe had a a really plausible explanation for how could have been accidental but nick i wanted to go back to something you said earlier which was that you said that you felt that um the way the ust ecosystem had been developing was irresponsible you used that word can you talk a little bit about you know what you saw there that you felt was irresponsible yeah i mean if you look at the history of senior and shares style stable coins which is such a mouthful we need a different term for them they never get big because basically people don't trust them right and so that's always limited their fallout when they collapse like new bits was minuscule esd i think was the senior it shows one uh which collapsed basis cash never got big it didn't really get off the ground the biggest probably was the iron titan one uh and that wiped out you know a fair amount of capital but very small compared to this so you know basically like people aren't dumb like they don't park their cash in senior and shares stable coins for the most part if you want to actually use a stable coin in crypto you're going to use you know use it for you know as a medium of exchange or collateral in a smart contract or for settling trades with exchanges or for international trade you're going to use usdc or usdt you know there's like they're just trusted and so you know the question is like why did ust get so big it got to 18 billion i believe at peak it was because of the subsidy in the anchor pool that interest rate was way higher than what the market was paying out yeah the 19.5 interest rate yeah and if you overlay that against other interest rates available on crypto you know you'll get like single digit rates and so you know mid single digits at the time so that is very high and that is like any central bank raising interest rates it sucks capital in right that's like what central banks do when they want to suck dollars into the banking system is actually kind of very similar in a way to what happened in lebanon where um they realized the banking system was was failing and they wanted to draw in as much capital as possible so they hiked rates in like a ponzi-like way actually in the case of lebanon so anchor was subsidized and that caused you know capital to enter the terror ecosystem through ust and and through luna as well right like so it had an effect on the price luna that to me was the biggest mistake because that caused this thing to grow so large and for the safety of the system to be insured you would want ust to actually be relatively small relative to the market cap of luna because all redemptions you know had to be processed through luna and so as ust grew due to this high interest rate relative to the size of lunar the system became more and more imperiled so to me that's if there's one thing i would pinpoint it's actually the subsidy in the anchor pool which i think was the the one biggest mistake that caused the harm from this to be really really high instead of like if there hadn't been that ust creation would have been much less and you wouldn't have had the fallout that you did and one other thing i want to ask you about is you started by saying that you felt like reliable stable coins were ustc and usdt which are obviously centralized stable coins and you know something like ust at least was aiming to be decentralized whether or not it actually was we could debate but you know i think one of the appeals of a ust style stable coin is the fact that it could eventually be stable coin even if it decentralized even if it isn't now so do you feel that when it comes to stable coins it doesn't matter if they're centralized instead of decentralized or do you i reject the framing of ust as as decentralized or as uh having this decentralization teleology where is progressing towards decentralization i think that's false never looked decentralized to me and i don't think they could possibly get there it would always require management it would always require central bank doing open market operations i didn't see a way even if they backed with bitcoin backing something bitcoin doesn't make you decentralized that you know like microstrategy owns a lot of bitcoin they're not decentralized there is no and frankly backing a dollar liability with a bitcoin asset even if they'd been fully reserved that's still an asset liability mismatch so you know i view that as entirely pretextual i think the decentralization narrative was a pretext for um supporting uh you know like rhetorically the importance of ust relative to other stable coins i don't think that there's a way to do a you know so-called decentralized crypto back stable coin that's under reserved the best model that i would want to see there would be the maker model which is over collateralized but that wasn't what they were pursuing so maybe if they'd been explicitly doing that saying they're going to have a a significant over collateralization with just bitcoin then i'd believe it but i didn't believe it i i i reject that framing and do you feel that it's like some people say that kind of the holy grail of of stable coins is to have a decentralized one do you feel that that's like a worthy goal or you just feel it's not even possible to create such a thing unless it's constrained by the laws of economics you know so like i do think it's a worthwhile thing to pursue but i would like to see it pursued in the maker approach although maker itself has problems because it's just a usdc thing now basically but yeah so i agree that's a worthwhile goal like i don't believe we should all be using stable we're just very exposed to uh the us government the banking system if we all use usdc and tether there's risks uh so yeah i think digital cash that should be you know free of the risk of arbitrary seizure but you also have to do it in a way that makes sense and like isn't liable to cause fragility i want to comment quickly on this uh so nick is right that to call tara luna decentralized in the state it was in is is misguided however i don't think it's misguided to say it it had become and was becoming more decentralized than the alternatives of usdt and usdc there are aspects of it which were very decentralized the chain itself the inability to freeze or reverse funds is nowhere in that code whereas you in usdc circle can actually freeze accounts right so there are elements of it which were becoming more decentralized than the alternatives but it was nowhere near sufficiently decentralized for people to to comfortably call it that i think that's a that's a fair point it didn't need open market operations necessarily though the main mechanism that was intended to hold that peg was the smart contract itself that didn't require any human intervention now layered onto that was some human intervention especially when they decided to start partially backing luna with bitcoin that started to require some more people getting involved but in theory and in practice these mechanisms can be set up to be decentralized this one failed i would hope that it can be done better than that eric walls you have thoughts yeah well i don't think that the centralized stablecoin is necessarily impossible i think that the probably the best example that we have currently is rye it's not particularly well known uh but the the trade-off that ry makes compared to dye i mean guy had a problem like instead they didn't want to introduce uh negative interests uh interest rate in die to stabilize the price they wanted the price to be exactly one dollar so instead of having a negative interest rate what they did was they open up for other collateral types so that's why you have usdc in dye which now makes the dye more centralized but there is another way to have a looser peg which is what rye does the reason that rye isn't very successful is that they didn't start out with the with the price of rye being traded around one dollar instead they made the price of right trade around uh 3.14 basically pi so no one understands what the what the what ri is supposed to be but the mechanism of rye itself it's an over collateralized decentralized stable coin that actually works the peg is not 100 you know pegged to an exact price but it sort of hovers around that that's a pretty you know reasonable uh stable coin that we that we can have that would have been way better than than you know putting all our eggs in the basket of something like ust and wait and i'm sorry it's three point one four dollars yeah they started at pi dollars okay so they introduced a new unit of account which was also a mistake okay but but wait i'm sorry because i was so thrown by that i just need to understand so what is it is it over collateralized how does it work it is over collateralized but the pad the the price peg isn't uh like hardly super focused fixed it's a bit looser so it trades around 3.14 it can go up it can go down but throughout its history it hasn't deviated that much so that's an alternative to die so die has the problem that you now have centralized stable coins that are in the collateral mix if you want something that is more decentralized uh one example to go about that is rye that isn't exactly pegged to that doesn't have a very tight peg but has has a peg that works so much and it's over collateralized with crypto it's like backed by crypto not yeah this one is over collateralized by eath yeah that's all oh so so it's like the original maker or the original die original die except um not tightly pegged to one dollar but more loosely pegged so that they don't run into the problem where the problem would die was that the price of dye started to deviate from the peg and then they had to either introduce negative interest rates or they had to introduce collateral types like usdc to bring the price back down again so rice another example to do that without yeah it's kind of complex but yeah yeah i mean just out listening to all this i'm a little bit like yeah so many of these have flaws it i i end up sort of going back to feeling like the more centralized ones are the best sort of like nick was saying which you know is probably a very kind of anti-crypto anti-decentralization philosophy but i don't know that that's my takeaway like what is your big takeaway when you're looking at this whole history of all of these failures and the fallout from ust do you feel that um senor shares stable coins are just sort of dead in the water from now on because i mean the i don't know if you saw that the community is saying they're gonna try to revive do you think that's possible like for me personally this failure of luna sort of puts the nail in the coffin of something that i felt for a long time that we should not uh assume that these death spiral mechanics can be avoided even with the three billion dollar bitcoin reserve uh it's just not like these the death spiral mechanic is so pernicious and is so unstable that it doesn't matter how many billions of dollars you have in a  coin to to sort of stabilize the price or how much bitcoin you raise when the death spiral kicks in it just leads to disaster and i don't think that it is responsible to play around with those mechanisms and i think that we should hold the people who the the industry leaders who vouch for this more responsible because this was not an unknown this was not an unknown attack vector we the people that have studied stable coins we all knew that there was a big inherent death spiral risk there and it was just a matter of time like how long can this go on before it collapses and and i think nick you you gave yourself more too much credit here i think that you were you were the one that more confidently added that this experiment with luna was going to end sooner rather than later i was willing to give it you know i was going i was willing to give it a year you know why not two years so i was like taken at the bed a little bit here like did it actually happen so soon like i knew that it was going to happen at some point but nick was more like you know what's going to happen like soon-ish in the next couple of months or weeks so i don't think that it's a good uh idea to keep experimenting with those uh algo stables i think that we should focus on uh over collateralized stable coins but i don't think that we should abandon the dream of a decentralized stablecoin at all i think that we should give more experimentation to experiments like rye for example i guess i'll i'll say that like the nature of experimentation is one in which most things fail i have a lot of tolerance for failure i have a lot of tolerance for experimentation the byzantine generals problem for example was unsolvable for decades right and had been like kind of given up on by lots of people is just like can't be solved in computer science right so much theory went into that and and then there was a breakthrough and it was solved and bitcoin happened and it changed the world and i think a spirit in which we see big failures and then give up on a line of scientific or economic pursuit that's actually the bigger disaster so i'm i certainly wish that luna had not gotten so big before it collapsed but i think if the industry decides that this line of pursuit is unpalatable that it cannot be pursued and it should not be tried because of the danger and that that is actually a bigger a bigger problem than the losses yeah i sympathize with that but i think that the big problem here was just the cult around though the cult around the quan and how much support he was given and i mean if you want to try and experiment like that i mean go ahead by all means but the problem here was that he was aggressively calling everyone that tried to point out flaws and useless and spreading fud and he had a huge community of greed driven luna shields that were helping him push that narrative and silence critics and harass them and we even had huge hedge funds and institutions that were also backing all of this and i like what you said very much eric that we should not give up on experimentation but i think that you might have heard a little bit in the case of ust in describing it as you know the central like you were you were kind of pushing ust a little bit as well i think not only as you know this crazy experiment but it's more of something that we should embrace and start to use and include in all of our our products so um i think that yeah it's fine with experimentation but we did not treat this as an ex experiment there were so many parts of this industry that treated this as the solution to the decentralized stablecoin problem uh and and partly including you eric i'm i'm i regret to say yeah i mean i've always treated it as an experiment i still treat bitcoin as an experiment i wake up every day and think like bitcoin could go to zero today accept that reality and move forward with it and i've done that every day for for like a decade these are experimental systems and i i absolutely agree that a lot of the way that this got marketed really undercuts that experimentation right like on anchor a website like that should be saying loudly this is an experiment you could lose all your money right like if i ran anchor i would say that that that's absolutely important and there's no one that i ever proposed utilizing ust to that i told them like this is a safe investment right it's not it's risky it has 100 risk of loss that message has to go along with the experimentation so i'm absolutely with you and i think you know i i probably could have done a better job of that with luna with luna myself and i think it's an incumbent on anyone in the industry that as you're advocating anything that you feel is important to sometimes even overemphasize those risks i think that's fair i'll i'll say one thing here is you know not everyone's uh as sophisticated you know as eric voorhees here in terms of sort of taking risks in fact you know very few people are right so what happened with ust like that's worse than some you know crypto asset that you know free floating that you know whatever collapses this is worse because it was advertised as as being a dollar being stable it's had stablecoin in the name and you the free market of information didn't clear right the the uh the information order book had a massive spread because as eric says do quan was extremely hostile to informed critics and he had an army of supporters and it certainly kept me from saying more about it 100 i wish i had but i also didn't have the heart to go toe-to-toe with these people and and uh you know get blackballed from the industry because i was you know critical of what other funds were investing in right so the information market did not clear there was insufficient amount of skepticism the warnings you know didn't didn't percolate and you had products built on top of anchor right you there were neobanks built on top of anchor pitching retail uh pitching anchor yields to retail right unconscionable stuff like a subsidized yield that was uh denominated in unstable coin i mean that's dangerous like you you know big lenders like celsius admitted they were involved in this thing they they put client client funds in this stuff so because it was advertised as a stable coin despite having a huge amount of default risk and because the marketplace didn't actually internalize the risks here properly because criticism was stifled you know the outcomes were bad i got i just feel like we have to separate out two things with anchor and ust because you could have run something like anchor on top of usdt you could have run an application where you say you can borrow usd here if you deposit collateral if you if you over deposit like 2x the amount of collateral that you want to that you want to borrow and then the staking returns of those assets that you deposit as collateral are going to be paid as interests into the people that lend out their ust i mean anchor had real revenue streams they had real they had real interest streams that went to the people that borrowed out their ust and you could have subsidized that that interest that was paid out from a centralized company as a growth strategy there are tons of businesses that that subsidize the utility and the benefit of a product at the la at the cost loss to themselves just to make their product more popular and if that if if they're reserved like the anchor yield reserve which was being topped up by luna all the time if that ran out if they didn't have any more money to to top that up the only thing that should have happened is that well the interest rates on ust should have dropped they should have dropped from being twenty percent down to four percent but it shouldn't have led to an explosion of the whole ecosystem collapsing with even the chain halting that was another problem that was a problem of ust itself having a death spiral mechanic built into itself that was that could easily depend if something happened in the market with the value of usd so i don't think that you know necessarily it's if someone is offering you a very high interest rate on your asset as a growth strategy to make your stablecoin popular let them do that and if they fail the only thing that should happen is that the interest rate should fall you should not have a catastrophic failure that comes from that failure comes from the reckless the reckless experimentation with with with all ghost tables in and of itself so i think it's important to sort of separate out those to do the two things i mean the one thing that makes it sort of intertwined is that the reason that anc that the the terror foundation had so much capital to subsidize these yields for usd with was because uh the the the luna ecosystem was growing and the lunar ecosystem was growing because ust was expanding and while ust was expanding because people were depositing uh funds into anchor so they saw the market cap of ust growing they saw the expansion of this new state stable coin growing the value of luna grew and that gave the terra foundation enough capital to subsidize the yields with which made this such a you know big vehicle that dr drew so many people in and which is the reason that we have now this lehman brothers type failure and not just some small small blip of a failure instead but i think it's just important to separate those things out there a little bit so are you saying that you feel that a decentralized stablecoin like ust could have could work if it grew more slowly and less aggressively meaning if even like it could be tied with this kind of savings vehicle that you know attracts people to the stable coin but if it offered something less than 19.5 percent obviously probably quite a bit less do you feel that then it would have it would work and and frankly do you think people might try that in the future i'm saying like if you take rye for example let's say that rye wanted to pay out a fixed uh interest rate for a while so that people start using ry more that's a perfectly fine growth strategy for them to use if they run out of governance tokens to issue to subsidize those yields with or the the the money that they raised in an ico to subsidize their their yields with the only thing that would happen with rye in that in that example is that they'd have to turn off the the subsidized yields and then perhaps less people would use it but the problem with luna is that when less people use luna uh uh when the less people use ust the the value of luna starts shrinking and then the people are starting to want to get out of ust that the peg starts falling and it turns into this vicious cycle where everyone wants to get out of both ust and luna and the whole system collapses that wouldn't have happened in an uber collateralized system that could only happen to an algo stable like ust and i think that people are sort of conflating those issues with the the the aggressive growth strategy of anchor with the death spiral mechanic that was built into uh into ust so in a moment i want to discuss a

your fiat on off ramp solution now at crossriver.com crypto back to my conversation with eric voorhees eric wall and nick carter so earlier we were discussing how people really uh supported dokuan and he displayed you know quite a bit of arrogance you know i when i had him on my show i remember it wasn't that i felt certain that ust was going to fail it was more that i was very confused by the history of failures of senior share coins and his level of confidence in his system that like was such a mismatch to me and i just frankly didn't understand that but you know there were a lot of very reputable venture capital firms behind the uh the terra ecosystem which i this is why like people have been saying this is similar to mount gox or the dow and the way i think it's differentiated is that you know mount gox was being run by somebody who never should have been an entrepreneur the dow was like these coders created the thing and you know but you had reputable companies like you know coinbase ventures pantera pearify capital um polychain uh i mean there were so many obviously mike novogran's galaxy like these are kind of these places ha to my mind lend credibility and i was just curious why you thought maybe none of them kind of rained doe in because i also felt when i interviewed him like he's a young guy like maybe he just kind of hasn't learned that humility goes a long way in leadership uh which frankly you know after working my book i actually feel that that is one of italic strengths as a leader that he is humble so i don't know if you feel that the vcs either share in any of the blame or if you want to express anything about why it is that they kind of didn't say like hey you know there's what you're doing is risky maybe you don't want to be walking around so confident the few long-form discussions i heard with uh institutional investors in interra they did acknowledge the risk even of the the death spiral concept but that generally only comes out in a long form discussion like on a podcast right um these firms are not going around advertising that there are risks of this portfolio company that would be a little strange and certainly the arrogance looks so bad right like regardless of whether luna worked or didn't the arrogance is inexcusable and that's the kind of behavior that we should eschew out of the community wherever we see it so yeah i mean that but ultimately the real problem here is that the mechanism broke and the focus of this long term should be what that mechanism was why it broke and can it be changed into something that plausibly works better everything else is kind of you know an interesting detail laura i have a lot of sympathy for your view here i i think the uh information sort of uh gathering mechanisms and uh curation failed in this case uh uh certainly the firms that uh were supportive of dokwan and and the tira ecosystem i mean frankly was a good bet for a long time it was the most popular trade of 2021 it was the consensus trade so basically everyone in the industry was exposed to this in some way or or another everyone in the formal investment management side of the industry and uh there was no there's an insufficient amount of uh of skepticism and and certainly this was i think the the way in which this was worse than uh other uh you know ponzi like schemes that failed was because of the credibility of the firms that were involved and uh people outsourced their diligence to them they said well look x and y firms they can't possibly be getting this wrong so of course it's safe right like you know like you assume that these firms do their diligence properly uh the other uh you know stakeholder group i would you know lightly criticize uh would be the press not yourself laura but i i personally reached out to a number of journalists about two months ago and said this thing's going to collapse you need to look into it personally i have receipts to everyone i knew in tradify journalism and uh said like this thing is taking time bomb you need to look into it it's going to be really bad and none of them really none of them investigated seriously and uh doe in his msm appearances like didn't receive a lot of pushback it was mostly like enthusiasm that he was buying bitcoin frankly like that was a huge pr coup like does buying bitcoin you know like that was clever he got the bitcoiners on his side too but yeah i didn't see enough pushback from you know interviewers uh so you know i look nobody likes it when you know some collapses and lots of people lose money and then you know you go around pointing fingers but like we need to introspect at some point like these mechanisms failed this thing got enormous and like the recriminations are only just beginning here i think that the i agree with nick and i also think that we give way too much credibility to these big names these vcs and the amount of credibility that they add is very artificial in my opinion because i don't want to toot my own horn here but many of these vcs when they're doing their due diligence on some of these projects they contact some of the nerds in this industry and they're like hey can you tell me about like is this thing safe what are the risks and in that thing and i'm one of those nerds that they reach out to i get these these kinds of questions where like is there a risk that i should be and i'm talking about the biggest names in in the industry here like that's often how they're do how they do their due diligence they ask some geek who they think is very deep in the weeds and just rely on that kid to to to know the mechanics of that thing uh so i've had those conversations and i don't think that those i don't think that those vc's are well worse versed in the uh structural risks in many of these uh blockchains and many of these experiments and i don't think that you should just because you know that big fur with x much capital invests in that thing you got to understand like many of these vcs they get a deal with like when they're investing because their name is so popular they get a much cheaper deal when they're investing in something than other people in the market do so their risk reward when they're looking at it it's like okay i'm buying it at a you know 50 75 or even sometimes more discount uh this doesn't necessarily apply to specifically luna but in many of those cases they get huge discounts so for them to just you know buy something is still an extremely good risk reward bet for them but it might not be for the people that are buying that on the open market so you have this you know misalignment of incentives where people are looking at the credible vcs who are taking easy low-hanging fruit and they're thinking that that means that they believe in it and they're there it's so credible because of that but the due diligence that they do is often not very good you can look at a number of completely crap blockchains that these visas that have backed that ended up failing that was predictable to to many of the people who are experts in the in in the technology of this field i want to push back on something here which is that the this idea that like because of vc invest in something that means they don't see the risks in it that's not my experience at all i mean like generally these these firms recognize huge risks and their default assumption is that the thing they're about to invest in is going to zero most of the things they invest in do go to zero that that's that's where they stand so when you see a firm investing in something that firm's default position is that that thing is going to zero and if there's this like story going around that just because some big name puts money into a project that means they believe there's no risks where where is that coming from i mean that's a strange myth no i'm saying that the risk reward that they're investing in when they're doing private deals is not the same as the public investors are exposed to when they're investing in the project there's a mismatch there true although generally the public investors are buying it when the project is far well established so the risk reward is absolutely different because they're buying something that has already gotten built and has gotten traction in the marketplace i mean this is certainly a separate separate debate here but i see what you're saying there's one other thing worth mentioning is that like a lot of people's perception of tara you know ust was that it was you know sort of indirectly also backed by the whole terra ecosystem you know like that there is like this uh you know association between like the usage of terra and uh and like the the backing of the peg and that this thing could have a soft landing if the anchor yields evaporated like everybody knew the anchor was subsidized like that wasn't like a secret but the view was like there could be a soft landing and i think that like really misled people because they have these like folk theories of like tokenomics you know where they think oh like it's a vibrant blockchain like it'll uh you know they'll figure it out they'll have like the tools and the firepower to figure it out as long as this thing is big enough there's enough apps there's not enough utility enough usage and i you know like that was also a prevailing myth that i saw it's like okay look ust will survive because they've got all this like stuff going on in the terra ecosystem but the theory like was just on sound let's shift a little bit i i was going to ask a few more questions about dough but i don't necessarily like want to pile on at this moment in time but i do you know i i do think there's like a lot of questions kind of about his behavior um that could be raised actually well before we move on i am curious do people feel like someone like joe or like people involved with terraform just wouldn't have any future in this industry you know there were uh i saw that the community is saying that they want to revive uh the ecosystem without terraform labs and i was kind of curious what your thoughts were on whether that was possible or a good idea possible yeah i mean that that's part of what makes uh luna somewhat decentralized is that like it can actually get pulled away by other people in the community and rebuilt in some other some other way that could never happen with usdc for example so i yeah i have no idea if it has any future at all you know probably not but it it's possible i mean i think the credibility's been lost and uh i think we need a lot of answers before we actually get to the final sort of like diagnosis here which is like for instance what happened to the bitcoin where's the big one like what did they do with it right like the bitcoin was claimed to be used in support of the peg like they they'd several billion dollars worth of bitcoin they're not transparent about that like that is something that we deserve answers for before we can move on like we we're still in a state of uncertainty regarding that and i think if it you know if they sacrificed the peg and let the system collapse and just hung onto the bitcoin and kept it in their reserve like then that becomes like an ex it's already a serious matter but that that enhances the severity but i'm sorry wouldn't that be visible we would see we know that the coins are somewhere on chain they moved from the reserve wallet we don't know what happened to them and uh they haven't said anything about it whether they were deployed in the market whether they borrowed against them we just don't know oh and did they make any announcements saying that they were i feel like i saw some announcements saying that they were going to be working with market makers to try to it's not clear yeah it's not clear yeah though so like the level of transparency has been very poor but yeah they did say something when it was sort of starting to suffer a little bit but nothing since then i think probably the important thing here is to look at the the assets that were bridged into the terror ecosystem they need to be safely bridged out from there and there are um other issues like for example chain link oracles that are reporting on the luna use the price uh because the spec of chain link didn't expect the price of luna to go down so way down into the into the zero digits that uh there's now a mismatch like there's trillions and trillions of luna out there that the like chain link protocol for example can interpret as being worth more because they don't have like the granularity of of digits to describe what is what it's actually worth and there's already been attacks because of that where people deposit you know trillions of luna into a protocol and they get to withdraw some other asset because the product the the these protocols aren't pricing luna correctly anymore so that's one thing that needs to be resolved getting those assets out of luna is also something that needs to be resolved and then there's also like it's so cheap to attack the luna ecosystem right now because it's a proof of stake run chain uh i think that's why the halt did the thing so just getting the thing up and running and not having it be like easily attacked and reversible is another thing that needs to be addressed so that uh like the the connections with the terra blockchain using the ibc protocol in the cosmos ecosystem that's also something that needs to be carefully handled so i think that we're not we're we are not in a in a moment where we should be thinking about how do we relaunch this thing and make this into a success this is all about just putting out the fires that these irresponsible people have have um started and once we've done that like maybe you can relaunch tara maybe you can airdrop a token to the people that held tara and luna before the crash but i mean who cares like what's the what's the credit who's gonna who's gonna give credibility to those initiatives like what is the interest in that experiment right now like maybe some of the projects that we're building on top of the ecosystem they might still want to do something they might want to have somewhere to build but i see no reason like why that should have to be like on a tariff work or something like it can be on some other system now that the stable coin is dead and in general where else do you see a risk of contagion in the rest of the crypto markets because i did see um lido i guess was um talking about some of the i think it was like snake teeth and bondage that had been bridged over to tara i know i don't know if the rest of you kind of know some of the other ecosystems but i was curious if you saw risks elsewhere for crypto yeah so ust was like i think the cosmos ecosystem is at most at risk because they were like trying to make ust their the pioneered stablecoin in that ecosystem so osmosis for example which is a which is a decentralized exchange had lots of uh pulls with ust in it i think uh the other parts of the the cosmos ecosystem that we're leveraging the ust assets inside of landing protocols like that's where you're going to see the these risks i think so the cosmos ecosystem needs to sever its bounds with ust in a safe way and there might be like liquidations happening across the board and that's inside of that ecosystem that's where like i'm mostly worried about i think that getting the like the staked ether uh that was being used as collateral bridged into luna that's just a matter of bridging that back out you know what happens to luna doesn't really matter as long as this chain is working you can worm all those assets back out or you can just use a bridge and get those assets out of luna and i mean the snake ether is just uh you know an iou for for post uh merge ether so like there is sort of like an asset underneath that it's just that uh you know it's sort of indeterminate when when it'll be extractable um the one risk i see is uh certain firms like celsius admitted they had exposure to ust and it seems like they were nimble enough to get out in time but we'll probably hear a little bit more in a few days next few days about lenders whose yields were derived from anchor which is just tremendously irresponsible especially if you're passing through these yields to retail investors so my guess is yields come down uh you know just generally speaking in the stable coin space for a lot of these c5 lenders and you know that's because some of them had it in anchor right so that'll sort of be evidence that the yields come down it's like that's because you had it in anchor the highest yielding most liquid cool i think if any of these things were really going to blow up we would have probably seen signs of that by now so maybe uh you know most of these firms are nimble enough to get out but uh yeah i think that's one you know not necessarily catastrophic thing that we'll see but like one one outcome here is that uh stable coin yields go down and eric voorhees have you followed any um fallout with thor chain um i know you're kind of a promoter of that um and and cosmos so i don't know if you've heard of anything and if you have a sense of what might happen no the biggest issue with thor chain was just that during during the collapse you know which has been ongoing the terror chain has been so clogged that the the fortune terra nodes were not able to keep up with the blockchain and so the the third chain validators just turned off that chain in searching for the time being but you know that's that's a good way of handling that risk yeah i think that the damage here is is largely by the people that held luna and ust tragically it's also going to be held by people that didn't realize they were holding ust right so to eric and nick's points if other companies were utilizing the system behind the scenes and not telling their users about it that's a big deal and that's a big problem i wouldn't assume that we know all those stories yet you know there could be some very uncomfortable board meetings happening right now in which they're discussing these very things and how to communicate it out to the public so yeah that's that's really bad we'll see what goes on there yeah that's that's about all i know at this point one other thing i was wondering about was whether there are any projects that had their treasuries in anchor have you guys heard anything about that yeah i've heard of a couple i don't want to name them on this show but they had some it wasn't catastrophic but you know minimal losses from some portions of their treasury and i think any firm that's doing that with their own money you know that's that's fine that's their risk and hopefully they were doing that eyes wide open the real moral problem the ethical problem is if anyone was doing it with customer money and not telling those customers well i mean in my view corporate treasuries don't belong to the executives they belong to the shareholders so i i think it would have been tremendously irresponsible for for them to put their balance sheet in this thing yeah one thing i just wanted to circle back to a little bit was nick earlier when you were talking about how when uh tara announced that they were gonna use bitcoin as a backstop in their reserves what do you think that this whole story says about bitcoin's use case as collateral i was sort of initially intrigued by it and then i realized that this was going to be net bad for bitcoin because it was going to be sucking up a fair amount of bitcoin we thought up to 10 billion dollars and then disgorging it when the system failed thus merely intensifying uh the cyclicality of bitcoin uh causing more reflexivity this is what happened with plus token if you recall plus tokens scooped up something like 200 000 bitcoins is much much larger and then it spat them back out when it failed so you know these kinds of um unstable systems buying a lot of bitcoin obviously that was a little bit different but unstable systems sucking up bitcoin then spitting it out when they fail is not good for bitcoin obviously anybody can buy bitcoin i can't stop them doing that so whatever it's just i did point this out at the times like look bitcoin is probably shouldn't be celebrating this all of that said like bitcoin does have a great story as a kind of pristine collateral so to speak i would hope to see it backing a stable coin in the rye model i think the reflexer labs people are thinking about creating something called buy which would be bitcoin-backed rye and and you know that would be over collateralized in theory so that i i like i think that'd be great that would have to be over collateralized but yeah i think there's a lot more to be said about uh you know bitcoin uh acting as kind of a species in a free banking model i've been long been optimistic about that i'd love to see more more models like this developed where you have you know interesting charming banks built on a bitcoin reserve things like that i think that's like the long-term fate of both bitcoin and ether is to be more of a collateral than a medium of exchange against which you would issue banknotes or other things like that but i haven't seen a ton of experimentation there on the bitcoin side at least i have a sort of controversial take here which i i think that perhaps the addition of the bitcoin reserve added to the collapse of of ust and i'm going to explain how that might be it's because if you have 17 billion of ust and for some reason it starts to de-peg and people are running through the door those people know that there's three billion of bitcoin that are standing ready to cushion the fall you don't want to be trying to exit the system after all those three billion has been used up you want to be getting out of the door while that big bitcoin cushion is standing to cover for you so it creates an incentive to even be quicker out of the door because there's a a small door there that can cushion the fall very much in a much better way than luna can it doesn't have this death spiral mechanic to it so it creates an incentive to be even quicker out of the door and i think that when luna started to d-peg and doe tweeted that you know he's deployed this uh 1.5 billion of bitcoin to market makers then people are realizing like okay i can't get out of the system now without losing all my ust if i just you know uh use that uh uh 1.5 billion bitcoin extra liquidity but if i'm too late if i if i'm trying to exit after the bitcoin has already been gobbled up then i'm going to have to try to exit into luna and then i'm going to be a second you know a second great citizen trying to exit the system i'm probably going to get a worse price so by tearing up if you create like a tier of exit mechanics where one is sort of premium then you increase the incentive to exit the system quickly so i think that that might have you know if we're talking about timing we're talking about the the for pool and curve but i mean that this three billion bitcoin reserve reserve also was just established established moments before it all collapsed so the establishment of the bitcoin reserve in and of itself might have been additive to the collapse of luna so i don't think that you should uh use bitcoin in these under collateralized packing systems if you're going to do it it should be an over collateralized peg i think it's a really interesting point there there's also like some recursive potentials there where because a lot of people thought that like by backing terra with bitcoin bitcoin was the mechanism that supported the value right which which was a myth number the peg mechanism was the mechanism bitcoin was meant to be sort of a bonus but everyone started focusing on like oh it's bitcoin that backs it it's bitcoin that backs it so when the first problem starts showing up uh people start imagining that all sorts of bitcoin is about to get sold and um humans are bad at scale like there a lot of people felt like their uh dokwan owns so much bitcoin that when he tries to defend this peg it's going to destroy bitcoin they have no sense of scale of like 3 billion of bitcoin is is actually a pretty tiny part of the market cap so there's this outsized influence of what people believe will happen with bitcoin you know so if they're speculating and trading they're going to be selling bitcoin uh just in anticipation that others will be selling it and if the bitcoin market is falling drastically that's generally going to pull down the entire crypto market which is going to pull luna itself down further and so these things can exacerbate themselves i think it's totally plausible that the the bitcoin backing the partial backing made this worse it it's possible that if they had far more bitcoin it would have made it better so this isn't really like a simple question here but um it's an interesting one and probably one that people are going to be analyzing for a while and it's really the same thing when russian central bank was thinking about adding uh the convertibility of ruble into gold if you take just a small part like if you have way more ruble then you have gold and now you add a conver a conversion mechanism for ruble into gold now the people who want to get out of ruble they're going to rush to convert their as much now they have like this by wall with gold that they can just sell their ruble into and that may lead them to now try to dump the ruble more in versus the case where there wasn't an exit mechanism like that at all so it's the same type of mechanic there so i was also sort of anxious when people were proposing that they would sort of partially back the ruble with gold as well one thing that i couldn't help but notice was so i'm not gonna lie like you know after all this happened i just thought algorithmic stable coins are dead and so yesterday i recorded an episode where at the end when the guest said that he felt people would try them again i i was laughing but actually overnight now i've changed my mind and i do think people will try them again but i i did see people saying things like well the us dollar itself is an algorithmic stablecoin and i think what they're saying is both both of these things the us dollar and these algorithmic table coins require faith in them for them to succeed and i was curious what your take is on that they require guns i mean like i think that's vacuous frankly um crypto people love to uh you know try and uh puff their chests out a little bit by insisting that the dollar is also a ponzi or whatever but i mean like there's like genuine uh you know structural dynamics which back the dollar like most debt globally is denominated in it so you need to acquire dollars to extinguish the debt that's the main thing we cooked up this inventive petrodollar scheme in the 70s where you know we price oil and commodities and dollars and we give all these nations guns as eric says like we uh have the bretton wood system we have these gigantic uh you know international financial institutions which uh you know promulgate the dollar give loans and dollars and you know insist on managing uh you know the economies of all these states globally i mean tax liabilities can only be extinguished in dollars u.s securities markets are denominated in dollars you need dollars to buy treasuries vice versa treasuries pay out and dollar like i could go on you know and it's just like a world of difference and and like ultimately nation states have the fire power uh well certainly the u.s does but there have been nation states that have tried to fix these pegs and uh basically say like i'm declaring what the market is i'm gonna try and fight the market and so like there have been these analogies to uh algorithmic under reserve stable coins at the nation state level nation states have lost in the in those cases right so you know like the us is not pegging the dollar and even when we did peg the dollar to gold we you know we we had a trade deficit uh or current account deficit i think in the 70s and like that that peg came under pressure so like if you're pegging it that's different from having a free floating currency be out like the value of the dollars is multifaceted and uh and i can't send it when crippled cryptic people just say it's like a collective delusion or whatever there's like real mechanical things that support its price yeah those are not exclusive i mean the dollar is a collective delusion and there are mechanical things that support its price the main difference is between something like ust and the dollar is that there's no algorithm at all it's up to just the whims of uh you know a cadre of of men that sit around and like decide things and then announce it to the market and a question of scale i think anyone that like casts shade on something like ust but then embraces fiat currency generally should do some deep soul-searching i think when and as fiat currencies themselves collapse this kind of microcosm of the danger and destruction of um of this failed mechanism is going to be writ large across the entire world and we're not going to be talking about a 20 billion experiment that fell apart but the entire global financial system this is the point of building something like bitcoin as an alternative because dollars are themselves the biggest scam and the biggest liability in the entire world right now but ust was not just an algorithm even if we separate out the bitcoin reserve jump we're testing liquidity parameters and how much the spread fee should be when you're trying to push liquidity through the ust lunar conversion mechanism in order to dampen the uh the likelihood of a bank run by creating a spread and giving people less luna for their ust and they were tweaking those parameters so you you basically had like jump coming in and say we tested we've done some simulations can you adjust these parameters so that the spread fee will adjust differently they were also tweaking and adjusting the system all the time in much in a similar way as the federal reserve does when they're thinking about stabilizing their system as well so it's not like i'm not saying yeah i'm not saying they're complete the same but there are also similarities there it's fair but but in in ust's case there there was always an algorithm that you could like find on a github repo right and that it could be tweaked but everyone knows what it is at all times right like so for all of ust's failures and flaws it was still an open system that everyone could see how it worked on a mechanical level the mechanism broke and failed it should have been done better but it's it's an open system and i think this makes it vastly more more meritocratic more valuable more ethical than uh something that is imposed on people through violence in which there is no github repo repo to speak of but it didn't make it work any better in the end i mean this case fails yeah this case fails but the the iterative process of money that can be built through open source software i think all of us would agree with time will produce superior result just want to ask one last question which is i was curious uh what you thought this whole debacle would result in in terms of any kind of action from regulators or or any other fallout yeah what what do you think happens after this ultimately it would have to be a congressional thing in the us that really uh you know draws the distinction between these different types of stable coins to trust and impose a new regulatory regime the sec was sort of looking into terra but in the context of their mirror protocol i think or is that what the one that was called yeah it's like a synthetic yeah yeah and so that's why they didn't like it because of the uh you know kind of minuscule synthetic equity thing which is like kind of funny i guess um you know that they they kind of like didn't you know maybe they were already looking into the other bigger problem but uh yeah they found the piece that worked fine and had a problem with that and completely missed the part that was broken yeah it's a classic sec thing the problem is that congress is not doing much of anything right now they have never passed any crypto really meaningful crypto legislation so maybe this catalyzes them into action and might have to wait till after the midterms i think like long term what's very possible here is that we get something like the stable act does go through and uh you know you your dominant major fiat back stable coins become uh regulated as banks so they're forced to get bank charters and so they move away from the state by state models like the trust charter you got the new york trust charter nevada trust model or or you have the state by state money transmitter like usdc you know the federal government reasserts itself and says okay you can't do this federal thing a federated thing with at the state level you have to get a you know bank charter you have to be fdic regulated the occ has to regulate you and that dramatically reduces the vibrancy of the stable coin system it reduces competitiveness it uh probably increases scrutiny maybe it means that stable coins are less private you know maybe the model where the issuer doesn't track the internals the network they don't track the peer-to-peer transactions maybe that goes away so yeah i i i think it's a shame because uh stable coins generally are great i want it to be competitive i want there to be many issuers uh responsible at least yeah i certainly i think like they'll take a much harsher view of any algorithmic stable coins but also just stable coins generally i think it's uh if we're lucky uh they're going to look at this as just another bit connect failure if we're lucky yeah if we're lucky they're just going to say oh well you know another bit connect failure but if you look at the the sheer magnitude to the size of the value evaporation because of the lunar death spiral we're talking about like almost like an order of magnitude i think it might be order of magnitude's difference here like we're talking about you know how much was it like if was it 40 billion dollars or even more i mean if you count ust it was almost 60 billion isn't that likely isn't that like lehman brother scale failure that we just synthesized here overnight in crypto i mean that collapse if we're unlucky and they don't just look at this as a as a bit connect failure they might look at this as like something that really needs to be clamped down on and it's going to damage parts that weren't even you know it's going to touch all stable coins it's going to touch all of crypto because we heard yellen commenting on this almost immediately as it happened i'm just very very worried that this is going to cause an immense flashback to the entire cryptocurrency industry and if we're lucky it'll just be you know another bit kind of connect failure that will eventually be swept under the rug with other catastrophic failures in crypto it's worth pointing out that of all the devastating losses from this much of the wealth that was lost was first created by luna right so this is a little different than like a traditional financial institution that blows up and 50 billion dollars is gone and that was like people's money that came from somewhere else the majority of the market cap of this whole system was created by luna right and that's lost now and is going to be very consequential to people but that that's important to keep in mind yeah except for the people that put in their life savings and stuff which i have seen social media posts about that but yeah i'm not i'm not saying that this isn't devastating for lots of people it absolutely is but not every dollar that was lost was some exogenous thing that just disappeared in terms of the regulators like their their agenda is pretty clear that they want to move the world toward a cbdc slowly or quickly and anyone that pays attention to this stuff realizes how orwellian and horrible that future would be so they will absolutely use this as an example of why it's so important that we flee to the safety of the heavily regulated cbdc you know ordained by the governments they will use this as an example of that and they will probably use this to bolster further regulation against the industry i think that's all inevitable anyway this is just like something that they they will use to assist in that process really what matters here is the decentralized technologies like we need a decentralized stablecoin whether it's done collateralized or whether an algorithm can be figured out that makes it work a decentralized stable coin is absolutely important and anyone who's working on that right now i want to you know just give a lot of respect to because it's an extremely important part of what what this whole industry is providing and then most
