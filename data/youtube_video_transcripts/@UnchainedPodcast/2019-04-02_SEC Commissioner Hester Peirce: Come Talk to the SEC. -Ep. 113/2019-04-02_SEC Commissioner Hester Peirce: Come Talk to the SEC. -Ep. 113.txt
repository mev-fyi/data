hi everyone welcome to Unchained your no-hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host Laura I had the honor of interviewing SEC Commissioner Hester purse also known as crypto mom at an event held by the NYU Stern block team digital asset forum in conjunction with the NYU Stern Executive MBA program we covered everything from the Vickery TF to icos from stable coins to Dex's plus I asked her about the inner workings of the commissioners and whether or not they generally agree on crypto true to her nickname she did demonstrate a fairly supportive attitude toward innovation generally and toward crypto specifically it was an absolutely fabulous discussion and this doesn't even include the part where we realized that we used to hang out at all the same places in Cleveland anyway please enjoy the discussion now on to the show within months cryptocurrency anti money laundering regulations go global are you ready avoid stiff penalties or blacklisting by deploying effective anti money laundering tools for exchanges and crypto businesses the same tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy welcome everyone thanks for coming I'm so excited to be doing this interview and I have to say it was a sort of little fun detail that came up when we were prepping this which is not only are both of us from the Cleveland area but also Janet who helped organize this or was our Renee who helped organize is also from Cleveland so it's kind of like a Cleveland we're going to event so well at the heart of all innovation exactly and I want to thank you to the New York Stern school for for the chance to be here and thank you Naomi and Renee and Kristen for the opportunity to be here and Laura for being willing to do this interview I do have to start with the disclaimer which is that everything I say is my own views and not necessarily the views of the Commission or my fellow commissioners great good to know because I will be asking you a number of questions where it's trying to figure out well you know where that line is between your view and the the Commission unfortunately often I'm here and everyone else is there but we're working on it you're already answering all my questions I haven't even asked anything all right so wearing one of the sir actually was just with you like your background why don't you tell us kind of professionally what you used to do and how you first heard about Bitcoin that how you came to be an SEC Commissioner so I started out my career I majored in economics as an undergrad and so when I went to law school I really didn't know what I wanted to do but I like the idea of securities law because it combines economics and law and and so I ended up at a firm that did a lot of securities law and at a firm where there are lots of SEC alums and so not ever planning to go into government government I sort of was talked out of that view and talked into the SEC by some of my colleagues and went to the SEC as a mutual fund regulator and then from there went to work for one of the commissioners at the SEC after that went to the hill another job that I never would have thought that I would take but was there during the financial crisis and then in the aftermath of that and then came over went to the Mercatus Center which is a a center that works on financial regulation and it was there that I encountered Bitcoin for the first time and I remember talking to some very passionate colleagues one of whom is Jerry Brito who's obviously continued in this space and coin Center exactly and and so he was really the one who introduced me to to Bitcoin and and then you know coming to the SEC at the time that I did when when the industry was getting lots of attention I think it naturally meant that I and my colleagues at the SEC had to spend a little more time thinking about it and so then I started listening to Laura's podcasts so I can learn something and I'm still I'm still relying on her to learn a lot oh wow okay no pressure so you're known as crypto mom and the industry and I was curious to know how much of that comes from your actual interest in this space or just kind of more like a general philosophy that you have that's you know sort of like you know maybe light on regulation or maybe even libertarian yeah I mean I think that it comes from the fact that I really identify with some of what's driving people in this space which is a desire to look at the world and with fresh eyes and and say are there things that we can do better are there new and different ways of doing things and I'm really excited about the energy in this space and so I think you know like a mom I guess I you know these people are doing things that I personally wouldn't have the technological ability to do but I think it's I think it's a really exciting space you know I am a regulator so I I have to moderate my enthusiasm but I also I think that I can play a role in in looking at ways that we can open the doors to make it easier for people to do what they're trying to do compliant with our securities laws and so you know when I came to the SEC one of the things that I had hoped to work on was in general the agency has not been great on innovation and and so this is sort of a natural area for me to be looking at because this is an area where innovation and the SEC are meeting and not always in a harmonious way so are there things that we can do to make that relationship between the SEC and innovation work better and you know I pick on the SEC because that's where I can have an influence but a lot of government agencies are not good on innovation they tend to be quite conservative because it's safer and so I think sometimes we have to take risks and that might not always work out well so I think that's where I'm maybe a little bit more willing to say all right we'll let you do this but if you get hurt you know the onus is a little bit on you you've chosen to take this risk so we're not going to protect you if you get hurt so I'm willing to be a little bit more on that than some other people and why don't we kind of dissect one of the areas where you sort of kind of let that stance be known which was your descent should the decision to disapprove the Bitcoin ETF why don't you talk a little bit about why it is that you chose to make that descent but also to make it public I know I don't even know how come and a night I did a little search on the SEC website I do I do see there are other dissents but I didn't know you know it's kind of like an old statement you were making or is it just a run-of-the-mill thing or well I'm you know typically many of the decisions the SEC makes are unanimous and so you're not going to see a dissent I mean often it's pretty clear what we need to do in a particular instance you know this was one where so the staff had had been looking at this issue for a long time and I was pretty uncomfortable with the rationale that was kind of guiding the decision I thought that in looking at our statutory authority and then looking at kind of the rationale that that we had for rejecting the ETF which was which was essentially to look at the underlying markets and say oh the underlying markets make us uncomfortable and so we're not going to approve a product that trades in our securities markets based on what's going on in those underlying markets and I think we're limited in our ability to look through to the underlying markets so if we started to do that I think there might be other areas where we would also be uncomfortable because there are lots of markets that are not so neat you know they're messy and so allowing us to sort of go and look through is is a dangerous thing and then I thought there was a wit and again my colleagues would disagree with me on this but I did think there was a whiff of merit regulation in this which was essentially us saying we don't think this product would be good for investors I don't know whether it would be good for an whether that particular product or another exchange-traded product based on cryptocurrency would be good for investors but I I think that investors can make that decision better than I can so my view is if we get the in for me out there so people can make a decision we should we should let things you know let the market try it out and see what the market thinks and sometimes things that are really fought long and hard for buy by people in this space you know they finally get it to market and it totally falls flat that's just the way it is but that should be the markets decision not ours and one other thing I was curious about was when something like a Bitcoin ETF application comes in what is the process for vetting that do you have you know obviously we're seeing that there are these comment letters and you know the different companies get to also weigh in but do you guys have independent kind of like an independent analysis where you're kind of fact-checking everything that's being said or you know how much do you take it based value like just walk us through what happens when there's an application like that I mean it's a that's that's a good question because process really does matter so typically it's the staff that will take the application in and consider it against the statutory framework that we have the obligation is on the applicant for a particular product approval and so in the case of exchange-traded products it'll be the exchange that comes in which is which is a little bit awkward because you've got the sponsor of the product but it's the exchange that actually comes in to our division of trading and markets and tries to get the product through so you've got a little bit of a game of telephone as the sponsor of the product talks to the exchange who then talks to us and then there's a separate process if it's truly an exchange-traded fund it goes through a separate division as well a Division of Investment Management and so you've got quite a bit of opportunity for the staff to raise questions and they do they'll push back as they should they'll ask lots of questions about how the product will work and that process takes a while and then they'll put a notice out you can people can comment and on some of these we see lots of comments some of them not so many and and then a decision when we will be made on that and then sometimes they get kicked up to the Commission then the Commission makes the decision so essentially it starts with staff they do their bedding and then they might make it some decision and then what determines whether or not it goes up to the commissioner so that the applicant can appeal appeal it up to the Commission or a commissioner can pull it up to the Commission oh I see okay and so like when it does go up to the Commission how much of that is the different commissioners kind of working together or is it sort of like the Supreme Court where they each kind of work on their own and then they make their views known and or do they like trying to lobby each other like come to my side how does that well it depends on the issue but I mean we're we all work pretty closely together and talk to each other a fair amount so and then we have councils in our office who are talking to each other so as we're looking at at issues will be talking with our councils and our councils we're talking with each other and we'll be talking with each other at the commission or a level as well we can't all get in a room together and talk about it unless we do that in public we have the Sunshine Act so that means that it's it's yeah it's not allowed for us all to just huddle in a conference room and hash it out Oh interesting so so then a lot of the conversation tends to be more one on one on one or LRC and so when it comes to crypto right now do you feel like there tends to be a lot of alignment amongst the commissioners or even just within the agency overall or is it something where you know there tends to be differences and in opinion um well I mean I think I'm probably not always aligned with my colleagues because again I would like to be a little bit you know I want to see a little bit of action here so so look I mean there are a lot of people at the SEC who are working really hard on crypto issues and I think we have you know Val Stepanek is running our crypto efforts and she's been really out there talking to people and and and I think she's got a good grasp of the technology so she's kind of spearheading efforts and then there are other people in the different DaVinci's in the division of corporation finance and then there are people in the division of trading markets division of investment management who are also working on these issues so you know there's not always as with many issues you sometimes are getting different concerns from different parts of the SEC but I think in general people are all pretty interested in learning and kind of moving forward to the extent possible and also just to continue in this line of questioning how much weight does the commissioner sorry that the chairman have like if his opinion kind of differs from the rest is that sort of overrule everybody else or is it like if the three of you kind of have one view and then it fizzes and the minority you know then do you guys over will him wear how does that well so the staff do work for the chairman and so that's I think an important piece to know and so his his concerns obviously are gonna hold lots of weight when it comes to a vote and you know it's just a question of how the vote shakes out so that he doesn't get an extra vote I see him okay and you know going back to the Bitcoin ETF recently there was this report that was issued by bitwise that seemed I mean it was very thorough I don't know if he looked I do look it I did see it yeah I mean I would I have to say I didn't read every line of the 227 pages yeah I didn't have to read everything either but what I read was very impressive for kind of just how how sharp it was I I guess you know pointing out sort of the differences between what seemed like legitimate exchanges and what didn't but do you think that kind of thing would have any influence on whether or not a Bitcoin ETF will get approved this year well I think it's fabulous that people are providing data right and that people are thinking really engaging the staff has laid out a number of questions in this area and I felt like it was really nice to see someone really engaging with those questions and saying here we've got some answers to your questions and you know that that report has been presented I think or talked about in the media and a pretty negative light as you know there's all this manipulation in this in in Bitcoin and so we need to be terrified but I think if you really look at what the data they present they say look there is this stuff going on and where we've identified that stuff but there's this other piece of the market where we see a really effective well-functioning market and one in which spreads are pretty tight and so I thought that it was a really helpful contribution to the discussion again I don't a pining on any ETF or other exchange-traded product application but I think that we do need that kind of really empirical data driven discussion to go on and I think that ultimately anything along those lines can help answer some of the questions that my colleagues have about how the market works and about concerns that they might have about about the market all right well we will see what happens later this year so let's now talk about icos which is I think the other big topic everybody thinks that one making of SEC SEC has taken these enforcement actions almost sort of like picking off certain categories you know there was like enforcement action against exchange and you know against Isis for or not ideas but it was a celebrity endorsers and then you have the ISO issuers themselves with the SEC sort of seems to be studying some sort of precedent or something and yet you have this whole class of these other ICO issuers that pretty much did the same thing so what's what does SEC plan to do about them well I'm not going to speak to any enforcement action potential enforcement action or you know I can't weigh in on specifics but I will say that in general you know we we took a look and said all right there's some just outright fraud in this space where people are taking advantage of the fact that crypto is really trendy and so they're throwing up white papers that sometimes are stolen from someone else and you know sometimes are completely not consistent with the underlying code and they're just running off with the money to a nice any location and that's the last we hear of them so we're gonna go after that kind of fraud whether it's labeled crypto or something else so then you get to the next group where it's someone who didn't you know the promoters get together they're raising money for a project and probably at the you know as this space is developed people are much more familiar with the securities laws but people weren't really thinking this could be a securities offering and that happens often right people there are lots of things that could be securities offerings that people might not realize are and so you can't rip into our space pretty easily and so I think we sort of sent a message first with with the dow report which was it's it's kind of like a quasi enforcement action but it's more just sort of setting out here's here's something you all should be paying attention to and then after that we went ahead and and brought some specific cases and I think that people should be on on the alert and that if you're if you're doing a fundraising which is the securities offering and it's not compliant with our rules it doesn't either comply with the rules or fall into an exception an exemption then we are going to bring a case because you know we need to the securities laws are there and we've decided as a society to have these these laws and regulations in place and so we're going to enforce them when they're not when when they're broken that said if in this space there there are things that need to change to allow this space to really flourish then I think we need to have that conversation too well but actually just to go back so amongst the money that probably are very similar to arefox and Paragon and whatever I you know I don't think that Suzy has the resources to go after every single one so what will happen to to those teams that really kind of did the same thing but you know just nothing's happened to them yet well I mean some things might happen over time too you know it the the fact it's not like we're doing sort of the Noah's Ark approach where we're only doing two of a particular kind of case you know I think again if if if you've not complied with the securities laws and you realize that now I would recommend that you come talk to the SEC and it's better if you go talk to them first then having us come talk to you first and by that are you talking about self reporting which is why yes Ted so how many teams have self reported well I don't know that and you know part of this part of the the structure of the SEC is a little bit difficult to follow even for someone who's at the SEC but it's certainly if you're not at the SEC it's difficult so the Commission you know we vote on the enforcement actions but there's a lot of work done at the staff level before I have ever even know that anything is going on with a particular enforcement action so I don't know what's in the pipeline and what's gonna come land on my desk next week okay and just to know so essentially when the team comes in self reports and then I guess the the lower-level staff will kind of vet it to determine whether or not it was an advert or certain securities offering and then from there we'll do what they did with Claudius or not or so so they'll make a recommendation or not to us but if they if they think there should be an enforcement action they'll recommend an enforcement action okay and that will come to us there's at least one instance of an IC o---- issuer where potentially at the time of sale it was a security and now it's been deemed sufficiently decentralized enough to no longer be a security I'm talking about a theorem in case you boom that you're good and you know you can't talk about specific cases but I just want to know you know like what would the factors be that the SEC would look at to determine when something is sufficiently too centralized you know to no longer be a security even if it once was well I think that so we try to think of what the problem is we're trying to solve with our securities laws and the problem we're trying to solve is an information asymmetry problem you have a promoter someone who's behind a project who has a lot of information about that project and is trying to raise money and so that is going out to investors and saying give me your money but what we need to make sure is that that person is giving information so the per the investors can make good decisions about whether to give their money to the promoter if you get to a point where there's no particular person or group of people who have that information monopoly then it looks a lot less centralized it looks a lot less like a securities offering you know I think part of the other thing that you have to look at is what are you selling right or you're selling a token that's being used on a functional Network I think that's also a key issue to understand what what the network is doing and what the token is for now to be fair I think what we haven't done a very good job in providing guidance in this space the staff is working on some guidance and I think that'll be helpful but I do think that you know ultimately they're still going to be questions about all right so we've said that some of these offerings were securities offerings but how do you get out of that and at what point are you kind of have the blessing to go on without treating the tokens as securities and that's an area where I think it would be very helpful for us to to lay out some some markers so that people would have a sense of when they're sort of free of the securities law framework and is that something you're planning to do and so again I mean the staff is working on some guidance now staff guidance is staff guidance the Commission can go ahead and bring enforcement actions any way if they wanted but staff guidance does carry a fair amount of weight so so that's helpful but I would like to do something a little bit more formal at the Commission level to provide people a little bit more certainty the problem in in securities law generally is that it is facts and circumstances I mean it's always been so it's not just in the crypto space but with everything it's facts and circumstances so we tend not to be you know we tend to say all right you know think about the Howey test which is a Supreme Court test and think about how it applies in your circumstances and if we don't agree with you will enforcement action so it's a little bit of a you know printed you got to apply the principles to your facts and that can be a little bit daunting especially for people who aren't used to being in our world so earlier when I asked you kind of if something you know is sold and and you know would be considered a securities offering and then later becomes essential as you said one factor would be you know looking at whether or not the network is live but in terms of decentralisation are there any particular other factors which because that could apply you know XRP i know is another token that you've been asked about a time which they didn't have a sale but obviously a lot of people tend to view that as more centralized so what are the factors that would go into looking at you know but there's something to centralized well I think you know I commend to you Bill him in speech when how he met Gary which kind of lays out some thinking on this but you know I think in general you're looking at whether the network is you know whether people are contributing to that network that are not just one core group of people but whether it's lots of people contributing if there's no formal secondary market that's being maintained by the promoters that's also relevant so if you kind of see the the the network just operating sort of from the grassroots up that looks more to me like it's not a security yeah yeah it's it's easy to say and I don't know like how does that look like and I might not even come to the same conclusions you know as some of my colleagues might because I think often you know you're look you're trying to look at well what was the purchaser what was in the purchasers head when she bought a token was she thinking oh I'm gonna make lots of money or was she thinking I'm gonna have a functional utility token I mean that's a really strange road to go down because there are lots of products that you might buy thinking I'm going to be able to sell this for a lot of money somewhere down the line but that doesn't necessarily make it a security and so I think you know if we're candid about this this is an area where we have to be careful and if we go crazy our jurisdiction could expand to include almost anything that that people buy yeah and actually just in our pre-interview phone call you if some examples you gave where some people might buy a watch you know that they expect to go up in value or a car or something like yeah I mean they advertise watches and say look this is something you know they show them a nice picture of the father and the son and they say you buy this watch and this is your legacy for your child I'm thinking well you know that that to the person is saying well and I've even seen people say some of the best investments they've made are things like watches so so if that's the case then you know do we really want to walk down that road I don't want to walk down that road because I don't need to regulate watch us we've got a lot to do on the security side face it regulations can stall or kill a fast-moving crypto business new fa

help keep your crypto business safe and trusted learn more at siphysicians.org seen or not be deemed too security are there any others that you feel like the Commission is sort of zooming in on as factors that would kind of separate security tokens from utility tokens no I mean I think those are sort of the primary things if you've got you know you've got an active community that's actively involved in making decisions and open-source code and things like that I think that all plays into it but I think those are kind of the basic factors now again if you all have thoughts on this I would love you don't have to tell me right now but you know it a lot of you in this room probably have a lot more experience with actual product projects and you probably have given some thought to this solution you should come talk to me you mentioned that that SEC it sounds like I was working on some guidance and then at the same time in Congress I know there there was introduced the token taxonomy Act which kind of proposes to exclude digital tokens from the definition of security and also relieve some like tax burden having to do with social assets so what do you think of the tokens are Tony Acton do you think it's better to have that come kind of clarity come through Congress or through the SCC or can there be both or how does that part work yeah I mean I think it can be you know Congress is kind of is is our overseer so they're looking at what we're doing and because as I said in in the state in in the innovation space the SEC is often pretty slow to act and so sometimes it does take a nudge or a stronger than a nudge from Congress to tell us we need to do something and and so the token taxonomy Act would be one way of getting the SEC to do something on this front to you know put a safe harbor essentially in the statute to say if you're if you're within this framework you're not considered a security so you know one option is is for Congress to spell that out very clearly in which case we go ahead and implement it another is for Congress to tell us to do something so Congress could say to us design a safe harbor for tokens and that would sort of force the issue sometimes Congress is very disappointed with what we come back with when they tell us to do something like that because we say well all right we're gonna design a safe harbor and we're gonna put all these restrictions on it and then essentially we're back to ground you know back to where we started and then Congress has to push us again so sometimes they want to be a little bit more prescriptive and say here's what we're here's what we're thinking of here's what we want you to do and so that's one option but I think it's really I think it's really exciting that people in Congress are thinking about this issue too and trying to grapple with the questions that I'm trying to grapple with a power securities laws interact with with this space last summer I interviewed Chang Peng Jarrell who's the CEO finance amazing episode of XI guys not listen to this I asked him a ton of questions about regulation he really pushed back at me and he's pretty Fame or his company frankly is famous for a regulatory arbitrage and something that was kind of funny that he's said to me I mean honestly so much of the episode frankly was funny with a we were tyrant regulation but um I know were to do I know exactly you know but he he's definitely he has strong opinions and they really came through but one of the things he said was that he liked I mean I don't remember what phrasing he was what he essentially said like Oh things like SEC these disclosures are sort of like theater and and basically said you know I would rather look at the information coming through telegram groups and what are people saying and you know and he was kind of implying that like the information that you can get online about these crypto assets it's like even better and so it's just curious to know because I I know that you I think to have the view that information is like kind of the main reason that regulation is important well I mean I think that that that point is an interesting one and one that we often forget at the SEC so at the SEC we often think well if we don't have a rule in place people are just going to buy stuff and they're not going to even ask for any information and that's pretty ridiculous because I mean yes there is a group of people who are willing to give their money on on a hope in a dream and a little title called crypto and nothing more but I think especially as this space is maturing people are saying wait a minute I gave you know I I invested money in this project and now I have nothing so if I'm going to invest in another project I'm gonna ask a bunch of questions and I think that's a very healthy attitude to cultivate in people which is know don't give your money to anyone without asking a ton of questions and being quite sure that you know who that person is what they're planning to spend the money on and what you're entitled to and return for your investment and so you know I think we've got to remember that there is really sort of a natural inclination on the part of people to seek out information when they need it and I think that's kind of what that point was going to and so especially in a space like this where you've got people who are I mean this is a brutal space where people are willing to rip each other to shreds telle say that each other's projects are terrible say that you know some someone will say oh this this projects complete fraud you know there's a lot of good conversation it's sometimes a little bit you know I can't even listen to some of it because I can't I can't smite my SEC phone doesn't allow me to listen some of those podcasts because the language is too bad but the bottom line is you know people are out there and they're they're talking about this stuff and I think that's a really healthy way to get information out there so you know I don't totally discount that point yes the reason the SEC is where the the reason for the SE C's existence is to get disclosure a good disclosure out there to investors and I think that's a really important role but I also don't kid myself that absent our involvement it won't happen at all so this actually raises another question for me because something else that was funny that Suzy said to me was you know trying to go along with that line about how if if you're serving US investors then you fall under the FCC's jurisdiction and SEC said to me oh well you know because I kept saying like you know are you worried about the fact that you might be running afoul of you know US securities law and he was saying the way you're questioning me it's like you're saying that if I don't like hot weather I have to live in Florida so so I'm so curious to know what your take is on on the fact that yeah you know he's not based in the US I actually you know don't know how restrictive it is like if you're trying to access the by next exchange to me west but I do think people are going on there making accounts and buying at least a little bit I've heard of you know just anecdotally people doing that so what's your opinion well so I think if you look at our enforcement actions not only in this space but in other spaces you'll see that people in other countries can come into contact with our securities laws without setting out to come into contact with our securities laws so you can end up you know if you're if you're reaching out to US investors you can come into contact with our securities laws and you know when I see those kinds of enforcement cases I often say to my colleagues all right do we really expect someone who's you know who's who's based somewhere in India for example to be thinking about US securities laws at all times and I think that's not reasonable but at the same time if you are reaching out to US investors and a lot of people in other countries are reaching out to US investors intentionally I think you got to be very careful because you can easily come into contact with our laws so you know you've got to be practical about this but I think we also need to be practical we have limited resources at the SEC and we're trying to figure out how best to use those resources and sometimes that will mean going to someone who's in a different country who's who's trying to reach into our markets and sometimes that means that we we would pass on a case because we've got more important things to do with our resources I mean one sad thing is that in the securities world because there's money there there are always people who are there trying to rip people off so we have so much work to do and we have to make wise decisions about our resources and so for icos is there any method going forward where you think people can issue tokens in an IC o---- and that it will be compliant I do I mean I think that there are methods of doing offerings under our securities laws and some some folks are trying for example to do reggae offerings which is a particular kind of offering and and so I think we'll see some of these offerings go through and I think that will send a positive message to people that new you actually can do this consistent with our securities laws and here are some examples of how it was done and are you guys also talking with other jurisdictions where we're seeing you know Switzerland has kind of carved out a little I guess area for utility tokens Wyoming has done a similar thing is that something SEC is thinking of doing and have you talked do you talk to other jurisdictions too and if so which ones do you kind of find interesting we do talk to other jurisdictions I mean we we have some pretty formal working groups with other jurisdictions about all kinds of things and so one of the issues that that has obviously come onto the agenda now the international agenda is is this area of crypto currencies because regulators all over the world are thinking about how how crypto interacts with their rules and regs and so we're consulting with one another trying to learn from each other's approaches trying to see areas that you know what's worked in other places and not other and not work it's still early everyone's sort of trying to figure this out but you know one area that's interesting for me is that there is a lot of innovation going on in Asia so are we missing out on something is there something that we could be doing differently so that some of that innovation would be happening here in the US instead and let's talk also now about exchanges we're seeing that this new trend of decentralized exchanges is coming up and you obviously already had that enforcement action against kind of a so-called decentralize exchange but you said actually was centralized but in the case of actually decentralized sort of these like next-generation duck says how would you kind of enforce regulation when there is no one person to target would it be the software developer who created that or well I mean I think this is a difficult area for us again you got to look at our rules in this area are quite precise so you have to kind of you're setting one of these things up you've got to look at how how what you're doing interacts with those rules and I suggest that you before you start trading and again if it's decentralized this is a little bit harder but if you're the one sort of setting this project up I recommend you come in and talk to folks at the SEC to make sure that you're not tripping any any regulatory wires but I I do think that we're going to confront a very difficult situation when you've got a truly decentralized exchange where there's there's kind of someone's written up written some code and then that's being used to do exchanges and I am concerned that we could inadvertently go too far I don't want someone who's writing code to have to worry that you know that she's going to get blamed down the road for what someone else did with her code and I think that's that's an area that I'm particularly concerned about I don't want to outlaw writing code and I know another area that's a deep concern at the SEC is custodianship and obviously that's kind of that wasn't I think a piece of the decision about the ATF so what kinds of questions does the SEC have around you know qualified custodianship of digital assets and how do you think the industry can allay those concerns well so I think it's important just to kind of take a step back and think about custody generally so why do we care about custody at the SEC we want to know that assets aren't being lost or misappropriated when when an investment intermediary is is holding those assets for an investor so you want to know your assets are safe and that looks like one thing when you're talking about standard securities it looks a little bit different in this space and so it's it's you got to be able to show that the asset is there and that it belongs it belongs to you right and so that's that's kind of the challenge because you can see on the blockchain a lot but then you've got to match the private key with the public key and you've got to do that in a way that shows that you're the only one with access to that private key and so I think that's kind of the thing that people are working on the good news in this space is that because institutions are more interested in this area now than ever before there's there's a lot of effort being put in place to develop really good custody solutions and I think there are a number of folks who are working and and so that's you know the SEC has put out our Division of Investment Management put out some very specific questions I would recommend that people who have answers to those questions write in and say what their answers are so we can get some you know some thoughts going around that but I think people are are writing in on it and are thinking about it and are talking to the staff about it having auditors weigh in on the discussion because auditors ultimately have to audit these assets having them weigh in and say yes we can get comfortable there's a way for us to do this that's also valuable so I think that US crypto exchanges are in a really difficult position you know if I were a crypto exchange I could maybe go this super conservative route and only list Bitcoin and ether and that might not be very viable this is model but that would mean you know that then I went pretty much no regulatory risk at this point however you know from the investor standpoint because there is demand for these other other digital assets you could have a lot of the US investors then going to offshore exchanges where they are exposed to even more risk so if you were the US crypto exchange how would you proceed with great care no I think that I think again I recommend for everyone who's involved in this space and has a question in the back of his mind about whether or not there's an issue with the securities laws come talk to us again the sooner you come in the better it's better if you come in before you start doing things but come talk to us and work through the issues with us you know you should have a sense of what you're trading on your platform and whether or not that's a security I think it's really important to do the due diligence on that and I think that's kind of how exchanges are approaching it but you're right I mean there's a business there's a business problem of just you know staying extremely conservative so so I understand the concern but we do have a very prescriptive set of rules around exchanges that trade securities so you've got a be aware that you could trip those and that you could end up in and not a good place and again you know to the extent people are concerned about the breadth of those rules I would say we as a society have made a choice to have some pretty pretty intense rules in in our securities space and so if you think that's not a good idea then we can have that conversation but those are the rules on the books so you know maybe this is the moment that makes us say okay maybe we should ask whether whether we should have a little bit more flexibility here and that's fine but you do have to kind of deal with the set of rules that's on the books yeah I caution conservatism and care and in a similar vein I sometimes talk to some of the different developers and maybe you're not surprised but it surprises me sometimes to hear kind of the different workarounds they're doing really to try to avoid any kind of enforcement action from the US or Italy specifically just this one regulator and when I listen to them I really think oh this does not sound good it sounds like they're doing a lot of work to avoid this situation and you know I know you guys walk this fine line of wanting to protect investors but not stifle innovation so I'm curious to know kind of like how would you grade how far how well the u.s. is doing so far and how do you think the US regulators can do better well I that is I think that's a great point that you make and it's it's sort of a more subtle point which is that a lot of resources are expended and just trying to figure out how you can be compliant with our rules and so I think I hear that and I think wow that's it's it's sad to me that that those resources can't be spent in a more productive way i under you know we again we have this rule book in place so that's a consequence of it but it also makes me want to say come talk to us tell us where the pain points are and tell us you know what we could change so that you wouldn't have to gage and effort that ultimately you don't think is serving investors and so how would I grade how we've done I you know I'm not I don't think we've done a tremendously great job and it's not because you know there are a lot of people at the SEC who are working extremely hard and trying to get this right and they are thinking about our mission which is protecting investors facilitating capital formation and maintaining fair orderly and efficient markets and so that's what's driving people but because you know to go back to a point I made earlier we were just not great at accommodating innovation so I I think we do need to think about ways that we can make it easier for people to get relief so they can move forward with with projects in a way that they're comfortable they're not going to run into an enforcement action and so you know I've talked about different approaches to this I think you could have an office of innovation which would sort of be a central place at the SEC where people could come in with ideas and and that office would help them to kind of navigate the many channels at the SEC I don't know if that's aI don't know if that's the ideal situation but I do you know I worry about the the the idea that people are feeling you know just throwing their hands up and saying we just we can't even deal with the framework the regulatory framework in the u.s. that's very sad so so far no discussion we've been talking a lot about these so-called utility tokens that were actually securities offerings at the time of sale or even actual securities but let's now talk about actual security tokens which are digital representations of real-world or traditional securities how should those be issued and transferred on a blockchain there was this recent report that DTC came out with were you know they talked about some of the different methods and you know one was kind of using like a permission to private blockchain and then I know their other would tokens standards being proposed right now where it would be more like on a permissionless blotching and you could still have some of the traditional actors like DTC or transfer agents and they would sort of you know with these public box chains what's your thinking around that well I think that people are still sort of thinking through different approaches and I'm not sure that that I have the right the one answer I'm not sure there is one answer but I'm glad people are starting to think about how they can experiment because I actually think this is an area where blockchain could be pretty valuable in transforming the way our securities markets operate sometimes you know maybe this is a little bit of a ways off but I think there are some some problems that we see now that maybe you could address through having a blockchain based solution they're not ready unless you mean or well I think even a permissioned system could be could be valuable but again I don't I'm glad people are thinking about permissionless and permission because I will see where things where things land but I think it's an area where you know again a lot of people write this off and say that there's nothing new that blockchain can offer here but I think potentially this is an area where we'll see innovation and we'll see we'll see 10 years now from now looking back saying oh yeah blockchain really kind of helped to revolutionize this space and another area where crypto probably could revolutionize things or is already starting to disrupt at least is when it comes to the fact that are so far when it comes to riskier investments it's pretty pretty much been limited to accredited investors or you know the wealthy and obviously we saw in 2017 that regular mom-and-pop investors were kind of getting in on the ground floor of things which especially in recent years you know private companies have been staying private longer and kind of delaying till the IPO so in this context do you feel like it still makes sense to have these accredited investor requirements or you know do you have another idea on how they could be improved well I don't feel it makes sense to have accredited investor requirements in any context but that's an area where I'm not I think I'm not in the mainstream so I will say I mean I again I think it's great that people in this space have you know they've come up against our accredited investor rules and they wait a minute you're telling me I have to be rich in order to get rich that just doesn't seem right and so I would like people to think a little bit more broadly about that and to think yeah you know is it are these rules even good in any space crypto or any other space is this really how we want to run our regulatory system in this country so I think it's great we're asking that question but I think from a practical pragmatic perspective there is interest and there has been totally apart from crypto in recent years there's been interest in saying all right let's look at these accredited investor standards and let's broaden them out so that because you know the reasoning behind saying you've got to have a lot of income or wealth before you can invest we're trying to protect people right you're trying to say all right if you've got a lot of money you can probably bear the loss better and you're probably more sophisticated but now we're saying all right are there other ways we can judge sophistication and you know maybe that's taking a test maybe that's showing that you've got a particular professional degree or that you're actively employed in a particular space and so I think that we we could well see some changes in the accredited investor standard that would better accommodate more people and enable more people to participate another trend in the crypto space is staple coins and we're even seeing JPMorgan Chase saying that they're going to have a stable coin and there's most ways of creating one there's you know just ones where it's dollar backed and then there's other ones where there's a second or third token even involved that helps control the price in general what's your take on especially in these different types of stable coins do you think that any of them these categories we run afoul of securities law well again I think it's really interesting to hear people talk about this space and think about this space because it's like monetary theory is getting a new lease on life with all these people thinking about it in really going back and sort of thinking to first principles so I think that's interesting I'm not a monetary economist so I give those people lots of credit but you know I think that Val Stepanek again as I mentioned is sort of spearheading our efforts on crypto at the SEC made some remarks a couple weeks ago that got some attention in which she raised the issue that stable coins certain types of stable coins might run afoul of the securities laws or might run into the securities laws so I think it's something people need to think about again it's an area where it I will be sad if if our rules stand in the way of people developing a stable coin that has you know that has investor interest that that people want so if there are things that we need to do to adjust our rules again come talk to us tell us tell us what what you're running into what the problematic areas are and I think it's helpful for us to have specific examples of where where there might be problems all right last question for you from me before we get to the audience questions is an easy one or maybe not I don't know tell me how do you feel about being called crypto mom well you know I've always wanted to be a mom so I'll get whatever for alright okay so um the audience did pre submit questions so I'm gonna ask some of these were running on our time but the first one was a little bit salty and I thought it was kind of interesting to get right here take on this salty quest um like a person who had a pretty strong stance so they have like a lot of a little bit of background which all summarized right now the US regulatory focus on crypto is mainly looking at its implications as a new financial asset but this is the less interesting application advances in cryptography and distributed consensus systems are the underpinning for a new decentralized internet dubbed web 3.0 almost none of the important major projects building web 3 are based in the United States in large part because regulators just don't get it and this focus on financial assets get in the way of innovation gets in the way of innovation just look at what a failure the bit license has been zero all caps legit projects are based in New York question do you agree or disagree that US regulators have completely missed the point in a rush to be the first movers in a new regulatory regime in the process kneecapped the US tech industry's opportunity to compete against Europe and building the Internet of the future well I'm glad I like people who have strong opinions so you know I share some of the same concerns underlying that I'm not trying to you know I'm not speaking to any particular regulatory decision made in the US but but I think generally people people who are in the regulatory community are sort of dismissive of this space in a way that I think misses that point which is there's a real and again I'm not a technologist and I can't see into the future and I'm not I'm not an investor in this space but I think there's a real potential for us to change the way people interact with each other across the globe and to bring more people into our economy which is good for all of us right as we draw in talent from more and more places through this area of crypto and so we do want to make sure that we're not stopping positive development from happening and so you know often though you you in it in an economy like the US we have capital markets that are very strong and part of the reason they're very strong is because of the regulatory framework we have but we also have to think about are we preventing people from doing things that they would from doing things that are beneficial to society that they would do were it not for our regulatory system and that's a challenge that we have to I think confront and and think about so I'm glad that people are asking questions like that this one also was slightly thought to you saucing a little bit less attitude but this person says can you explain the disconnect between the numerous SEC enforcement actions wherein the SEC has stated that issuers need to register their tokens or other instruments as securities an intermediary intermediaries need to register as broker dealers and the fact that not a single registration statement or broker dealer application in the digital assets base has been approved despite numerous applications Penn many overdue I think that we would be on much stronger footing if we had gotten some of these through now you know the staff at the agency is doing its due diligence as it does in in regardless of whether crypto is involved or not I think you know just as I've said in other contexts like some one investors seem ready to jump any time they see crypto and invest but we seem we seem to want to jump the other way when we see anything crypto related and want to just run away and so I think we need to we need to be a little bit more open at the same time we need to make sure that we're that all the regulatory boxes are checked but I would love to be in a position where some of these had actually moved forward and so again I urge people who are in the process to please come talk to me if you're running into problems it's very important for me to hear from you directly so that I can have that otherwise I'm only getting one perspective but if you come in and tell me the problems you're running into it can be very helpful for me to sort of help Shepherd things along you know at the agency and say to two folks on the staff ask them what's going on and to understand better what's going on and again I think people on the staff are working very hard but it's important for us at the Commission level to have a sense of what's going on there so please come talk to me so this is actually a question that I had that I sort of ditched along the way but it's very related so I want to ask it which is that there are these different exchanges that are trying to become broker-dealers and are applying you know to be approved for a TSS for alternative trading systems and as first I would say I think that was supposed to start happening in q1 that there was supposed to be some guidance from the SEC that would enable FINRA it yeah and but apparently it's not happened in the timeline that was initially said so what what's the reason for the holdup well again I think the staff is working on guidance so we've got staff and in corporation finance who's working on guidance sort of dis related to you know what is this an offer of securities offering or not and then we've got folks in trading and markets who are working on those kinds of issues related to broker dealers ats a--'s but I you know I'm hoping that we'll see some progress in that area as well I know there are a number of people who are interested in in having ATS --is that are that are able to trade crypto alright and so on a similar issue somebody asked about potential cases of price manipulation of cryptocurrency in the cryptocurrency markets and they were wondering what are some actions that the SEC is considering to regulate this emerging market to protect average investors well the underlying markets are not ours to regulate so you know I think the answer to that is that that's it's just not in our purview again you know as with anything I'm not giving investment advice but I just I urge people to ask lots of questions and think before you commit money to anything and so I think that's just a valuable lesson and don't assume that everything everywhere is regulated and even if it is regulated don't assume that you shouldn't ask your own questions you've got to ask your own questions all right so last audience question is what kind of foundational principles is the SEC following to regulate crypto assets what kind of foundational principles that's a great question I think the foundational principles were applying our ones of you know traditional securities regulator approach which is we take our securities laws and we ask how they apply which i think is is the right first step but I think the second step and the foundational principle that I would like to see applied is all right let's think about what you know are are we standing in the way of mutually beneficial transactions and if we are then what do we need to do to rethink the framework that we have in place to allow mutually beneficial mutually beneficial transactions to go forward I mean I think ultimately our securities rules are just one piece of a regulatory framework that were you know that we're trying to have in place so that society is a better place and if it turns out that our rules are not allowing that to happen we need to rethink them so I'd like to have the second piece of that foundation be to really think back and say is this a good thing and we too often aren't willing to ask that question and I think a lot of times it's because we're afraid that the answer is going to be you know what maybe something we're doing on the regulatory side is not ultimately furthering societal well-being it and there's nothing wrong with that situations change times change and and so let's have a frank conversation and let's let's change or pare back or modernize where we need to do that and there's there's no shame in saying hey you know we've we've been around as a regulator since the 1930s a few things have changed since then we might want to you know just ask a few questions about whether the frameworks working the way it should and if it's not let's change it so that everyone's better off and everyone has more freedom to make their own decisions and to to and to do things that that allow them to participate better and in society to contribute their talents and their resources to society I mean that's ultimately what our capital markets are about they're about drawing out people's talents and people's resources so that they can contribute to our to our society into the growth and development of our society that's what we want because ultimately that means that people people's lives are better off and that's that's kind of what's driving me and why why I am so honored to be able to to be part of the SEC and part of this discussion well we were so honored to have you here and hear your thoughts they were fabulous thank you so much thank you [Music]
