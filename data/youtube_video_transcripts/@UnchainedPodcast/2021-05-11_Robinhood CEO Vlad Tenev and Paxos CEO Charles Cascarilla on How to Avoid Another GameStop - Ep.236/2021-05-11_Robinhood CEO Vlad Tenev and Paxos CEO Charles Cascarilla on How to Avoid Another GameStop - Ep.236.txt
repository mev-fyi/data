and as a senior editor at forbes was the first mainstream media reporter to cover cryptocurrency full-time sign up for my newsletter where i will soon be making an announcement about pre-orders from my book the cryptopians idealism greed lies and the making of the first big cryptocurrency craze head to unchangedpodcast.com and the sign up for the email newsletter is right on the home page today's episode is a discussion i moderated for paxos between vlad tennis ceo of robin hood and charles cascarilla ceo of paxos the discussion was titled why traditional financial infrastructure is broken and how we can fix it it was an incredibly fun and substantive discussion on one of the biggest news stories of the year why the whole gamestop saga played out as it did particularly for robin hood and how blockchain technology offers hope that it could be prevented in the future we also talk crypto adoption and get into some of the intricacies of crypto trading on the robin hood platform plus we take a peek at what might be coming down the pike in terms of other traditional financial players getting into crypto i hope you enjoy this fascinating discussion now on to the show kuiper's dynamic market maker dmm is the first d5 protocol designed to adapt to market conditions to optimize fees maximize returns and enable extremely high capital efficiency for liquidity providers today's episode

description thanks to everyone for joining our panel why traditional financial infrastructure is broken and how we can fix it it's quite it's been quite the hot topic for this year here to discuss are vlad tenef co-founder and ceo of robin hood and charles cascarella co-founder and ceo of paxos welcome claude and chad thank you good to see you both yeah great to see you both too so before we begin i would want to get a read on the audience and we have a poll that will kind of help us see what your background is so for the attendees why don't you select which of these options best applies to you and your professional background the question is what type of company do you work for and the options are a fintech an established financial services company or bank a tech company or non-financial services tech and then the other two options are a crypto company um and lastly just other so if you can make your selection now we will pull up the results and okay so about half come from traditional financial services or banks and then um fintech and other compete for the second spot at 18 and surprisingly actually the smallest percentage um well the smallest percentages come from crypto companies and then tech companies that are not financial services um which is really interesting okay so it seems like a fair number of you will have pretty good familiarity actually with um some of the meteor and um i guess more detail-oriented um aspects of this discussion um so why don't we just start with the riveting financial events earlier this year during the gamestop saga which really shined a light on how the back office of capital markets really works and at that time as we may all recall this was big news robin hood and some other platforms did stop purchases of certain stocks due to how this decades-old financial plumbing works vlad can you walk us through what happened that caused robin hood to stop its customers from buying stock in gamestop and some other of the wall street bets companies just as that frenzy was reaching its height yeah absolutely and do you notice uh a lot more gray hairs since uh since the last time we we had a conversation you've you've really been through the ringer the last few months i would say um yeah so i i'd say it all started back in 2008. um so 2008 uh there was a global financial crisis and in the aftermath of that there was some legislation passed um uh a lot of people in the audience might be familiar with it uh it's called dodd-frank and the the aim of this legislation was to prevent some of the kind of systemic problems that um that led to the financial crisis from reoccurring in the future so among um among several things that dodd-frank did uh and i've poured over uh some of this documentation uh so this the events of the last year gave me an opportunity to do that whereas perhaps i i wouldn't have gotten very acquainted with it but part of it actually specified um clearinghouse collateral deposit requirements and some ideas and some sort of rules behind how those should be calculated with the idea being that to contain systemic risk uh clearinghouse deposit requirements should be beefed up and we should make sure that all of our financial institutions have capital around to deal with uh unforeseen circumstances and part of what was specified was something called the uh nscc clearing deposit requirement which i won't get into the calculation but essentially uh it uses a value at risk model which has a tendency to to increase the deposit requirements in times of of extra volatility so you saw this happen in march of 2020 a little bit over a year ago for example and you saw it happen uh also in january of this year but for very very different reasons um i think march of 2020 was sort of a systemic market shock that affected the broad markets and you saw the major indices uh suffer dislocations um you know 2021 was something that we really hadn't seen before where um essentially uh a bunch of people on social media wall street bets reddit um had concentrated activity and a relatively small number of names and you saw a lot of uh unidirectional buying activity that also had the um the unfortunate side effect of of spiking deposit requirements industry-wide and robin hood um robin hood obviously had to contend with that and we uh robin hood securities which is our clearing broker subject to these made the call to uh restrict opening positions in some of the securities that were driving uh driving up the high var deposit requirement those uh gamestop uh being one of them but also amc actually uh had an even larger contribution um so i think we can argue about whether the system worked as intended um it's it's hard to suppose the counter factual of what would have happened um in the case that you know dodd-frank wasn't written the way it was or the var charge wasn't codified in this way um but i think what's clear from my standpoint and i believe uh i'm sure chad agrees with me is if you look to the future and ask yourself you know what's the ideal situation for the financial system we're in you look at the settlement cycle you know it was t plus five so it took five days to settle a trade after the trade was actually matched um back in the 90s to the 2000s took about 20 years to get down to t plus three recently it went to t plus two um and so you kind of look at what the platonic ideal of settlement is and uh you have to assume it's going to be instantaneous that's just the the the only way technology and progress is going to lead us um and there's a lot of things that will happen as a result of that one of them is it would make deposit requirements obsolete to a certain extent because you know if if things are actually settling in real time and you have these these transactions happen instantaneously then there's actually no need to control uh some of these systemic fail to deliver or uh settlement risks because those risks would basically uh cease to exist so that that's why i became interested in the topic of settlement chad probably became interested in it uh for for slightly different reasons probably having to do with just general progress and innovation but uh i think we're very aligned with with that long-term kind of platonic ideal yeah and so chad do you want to elaborate on that and i was curious if you um you know had the same view on what the core issues were or if you wanted to talk a little bit more about what you saw as kind of the the root of the problem here so i touched on a lot of good points what i thought was really interesting about uh the gamestop issue is that it did not happen during a financial crisis didn't happen during a pandemic it didn't happen during any type of real exogenous event so you know when we had uh the last really big system of crisis leaner brothers failed so everyone said oh well you know lemon brother spell of course there's problems in the settlement uh system uh but here nobody failed uh there wasn't even you know a fear of a failure uh like with the pandemic this was just um you know a lot of training that happened and it really exposed the plumbing of the system for what it is a very antiquated and outdated system and by the way it was a really good system when it first started i think it solved a lot of problems it moved us off of paper um and it moved us to a way of creating liquidity but it did it in a way that didn't create true chain of title true understanding of who owns what when and so that means that you have intermediaries that are stepping in and guaranteeing trades because uh moving from paper to electronic uh couldn't happen in as elegant a way as we could do now with modern technology and we've i think reached the end of this old way of operating and that's what gamestop showed us we've now reached uh the logical endpoint here and it's time to upgrade the system just like we need to upgrade our roads and our bridges and our airports you know we have old infrastructure all over the place one key place we have old infrastructure is in the financial markets and that really shouldn't exist anymore and and frankly we know how to fix this just like we know how to fix the problems with our bridges and tunnels you just have to do it and um what got me interested was uh going back to the financial crisis and seeing how the plumbing exacerbated the problems in the system and um that's why when i came across blockchain i said wow here is a way to solve these problems and upgrade and re-platform the financial system and what i just never expected is that it would be so obvious that it needs to be done that you could have a systemic problem caused by the plumbing and uh there would be nothing else that was going on and that's what gamestop showed and i think uh vlad is right in the limit we're going to get to instantaneous settlement um but you don't have to necessarily get the instantaneous settlement to have huge leaps forward and you don't have to stop at t1 you could be a t0 settling at the end of the day or batches intraday because you know it's hard for people to upgrade their treasury systems to manage real time that's going to not be something easy to get to but i think vlad is right like inevitably you'll get to that point technology will enable it the systems will be upgraded enough participants will be able to do it that will get there but there's so many wins to have and i'd love to hear like what vlad thinks um you know if you could settle t0 today with a market maker how how much would that impact your business how how helpful would that be for you guys because i think that is um a key place that we can get to and if that's not far-fetched at all even though it might feel like it because we're at t2 we've done some t-zero trades our system can handle it uh frankly it can handle even faster than just doing a t-zero trade at the end of the day but um you know you wanna have a product journey that we're all going on but that journey can't take you know half a decade uh to happen or a whole decade to happen and each time you wanna you know shift things by a day it needs to happen a lot faster than that and i think that there's ways to do it and still be backward compatible that's really what we're trying to do well yeah so we're gonna um just dive right into all this t-zero discussion um but first i want to get a bead on the audience's knowledge of equity's settlement infrastructure so here we have the second poll again the audience members should choose which best applies to you the first option is when i read t plus 0 i assume someone misspelled the word to second one i've heard of t 0 and t plus 3 in reference to stock trades but don't know what they mean and the third option is i am familiar with how stock trades are settled and why t plus three is relevant so if you can select which applies to you then we can you know kind of better speak to the level of the audience okay so there's some familiarity um in fact quite a bit 82 percent um are familiar and only about 18 would say that they're not really familiar um okay so you know we'll be sure to kind of carry along the people who are less familiar but it means we can definitely dive into the details on this discussion so um in the senate hearings vlad you were quite clear about needing t0 settlement times whereas citadel is viewing t plus one is a more feasible goal and that's also the goal that the dtcc is aiming to reach by 2023 um and i just wondered what your take was on that goal um as opposed to t plus zero is that just something we we don't even need to stop there at that at that level or um and you know do you think we're ready to just jump right into t0 settlement times i think it's going to be challenging you know with with any change like this you have uh different market participants market makers banks that are used to an old way of operating and there's obviously going to be a preference of incremental progress and um the things are gonna have to change whether it's internal processes um you know procedures uh technology has to be upgraded and then there's also the unknown what happens if we are in this world of t0 is there going to be lots of revenue loss uh would would we lose revenue as a financial participant as a result of that transition so i think anytime there's changes like this there's hesitancy and so you'll see um much more of a willingness for for incremental change and you know i don't necessarily think that that's a bad thing obviously there's been um something akin to widespread agreement that t plus one is going to be an improvement over the current status quo which is two day settlement and i agree with that i think it will be a big improvement and um i think it's important for an effort that's so fundamental uh like this to to make sure that all market participants are heard and we bring everyone along and uh avoid creating new problems through the transition but i i am very happy that dtcc um and sifma uh recently produced a plan to get to t plus one from t plus two um i don't think uh obviously we should stop there um but i do think it's it's good progress yeah i did wanna add in actually that the dtcc did estimate that the t plus one settlement time would reduce margin collateral needed for companies like robin hood by 41 which obviously is significant um but chad can you also now talk about the solution that you are working on which i know is kind of in a limited version at the moment but why don't you describe how that works what that is what your roadmap is to get that out you know to um a wider number of companies and and equities yeah so uh the way our product works is right now we're operating under a no action letter and so that limits the amount of volume and the number of stocks that we can settle but we're settling live trades and have been for over a year now and uh we have uh three participants and we've had a fourth go live i'll be talking about that at some point soon here and we have others that are coming online so it's exciting for us to be able to uh be showing how this technology works and the fact that our technology isn't limited to a particular settlement cycle doesn't have to be t2 it could be t1 it could be t0 and ultimately this is a bit of a choose your own adventure our technology is very flexible it's up to the participants to find the agreement on what they want to be settling in but i do think that it's possible to move faster than t1 it's possible to get to something like t0 and to do it at the end of the day and that's very um understandable path forward that we've been laying out with participants but just as importantly the point of technology is not just a change settlement there's a lot of different areas that can be improved with this technology one of them is changing settlement time frames which releases capital and is more cost efficient but also having investor protections one of the problems of the gamestop issue was knowing how many shares were short and this wasn't necessarily a feature of players acting nefariously it may or may not have been i don't know the sec is looking into it but what happens is it's possible because everything is held in omnibus accounts with unclear chain of title for there to be excess share short uh for there to be more share short than the float but if you're using a blockchain system where you know where every single share is at all times and who the beneficial owner is at all times you have real investor protections that don't exist today because everything's just held in one giant omnibus account at the dtc and this is a problem and there's ways to upgrade this and create investor protections while creating highly liquid markets while actually being more capital and cost efficient what's a little crazy and sometimes people don't know this is that a lot of brokers are really just not uh having their clients trade a margin they're having them cash trade so they're settling with cash but they have it in the account they can't sell the trade for two days because that's the settlement cycle so the broker has to put the money up for the trade so these are cash funded trades and the broker is on the hook and the capital call can fluctuate wildly with depending on how much stocks are moving but yet they have the cash sitting there and so you have a very pro cyclical problem going on where you're getting giant capital calls it flex from 15 billion at the nfcc to 30 billion huge crazy call i mean who could have prepared for that you know no one just leaves 15 billion lying around so you have huge capital calls that are getting pulled um in some cases not in a very transparent way our system you can see all day long in real time what your margin will look like with all of your participants so you know in real time real time risk management not a crazy thing to have but it doesn't exist right now uh real-time risk management you could see that the capital calls are going up but why should you suddenly have to have 15 billion dollars that you have to post if you're having the cash from your customer in your account and to bridge that two days um and so the whole system really i mean should be shifted in a different way and uh and that's what we're um doing with our uh paxo settlement system and right now again this is a no action ladder we're shifting from a no action letter we're going to apply for a clearing agency um and when we have that we'll be able to operate um a regular way um in terms of ramping to being all qsips all stocks and accepting all market participants and so that's going to take some time of course but that is where we're going to be and you know we're optimistically uh hoping that will be this year i think that's the plan for us um and i think that will be a big um a shift for the markets because now they'll be competition for the first time in settlement all this that you said is so interesting i actually have three different things i want to say about that so first is um for people who don't listen to my show i did a great interview with caitlyn long of morgan stanley who talked about this issue about how if you had blockchain-based stocks then things like shorting by more than 100 wouldn't happen or that you could you could make it so that it couldn't happen um so people who you know are interested in um hearing about that you should check out that episode um and so chad i just also wanted to clarify so for your solution every all all of the stocks that you're trading and and that you say could be traded this way they would have to then become blockchain based stocks they would there would be like a tokenized version of this stock is that how that would work well we created backward compatibility so um you know today we have a full participant account the dtc that's what allows us to do this uh when we have a clearing agency you know we'll be automatically connected to the dtc and they to us but what is enabled by this is a backward compatibility so that if a share is tokenized and someone isn't settling on our system and they're settling a regular way we can de-tokenize it and it goes back and so that's an important point we know that it's very hard for people to be able to shift processes and certainly trying to do all or nothing is not effective so we've deliberately made it compatible so that participants can do some of their trading in this in this fashion or i should say settlement in this fashion um and they can continue to use their old methodologies when they need to and then when you were talking about how it's a little bit like a choose your own adventure type what is the fastest that your system can handle in terms of settlement well we haven't tried to do something that looked like real-time girl settlement because uh really all participants think that's impractical for the moment but certainly intraday batches you know you could be done every couple hours you could do three or four batches during the day of t0 end of day t 0 is what we've put out some press releases and we've done with certain participants already so again it could be faster than that even than several batches per day i think getting a real-time growth settlement's hard because you're talking about hundreds of millions of settlements and so that requires participants to pre-fund cash and pre-fund shares uh so that they're in a position and so you couldn't do that now but imagine a world in the future where you know say there's a central bank digital currency so all cash is on a blockchain and imagine a world in which uh all shares are on a blockchain well now things suddenly look a lot different in terms of even what an exchange could look like but also that could very well facilitate the type of treasury management that would allow real-time growth settlement but i do think that that's you know clearly a ways off that is part of the journey i was talking about the participants need to go on you can't get there overnight but you can get there i think faster than the pace that we're on right now kyber's dynamic market maker dmm is a game

gamestop scenario would have looked like under these different types of conditions so um you know we can talk about t0 which is kind of the ultimate goal but even something like you know chad what you described where you could do these intraday intraday trades or settlement so and either of you can answer this but i was just curious you know in in the case of something like this where you just have these stocks that are going up and up and up you know um you know vlad i'm curious to know what would have been necessary for robin hood to put up in terms of collateral um like in a teaser environment is it true that you wouldn't need to put up any and that what was in customers accounts would be sufficient or um you know yeah i'm just kind of curious to hear how you think uh improvements in this technology would have changed the outcome from the events this last winter yeah i think i think it depends on the implementation um so you know end of day t0 would limit the collateral to basically what can accumulate during an entire trading day um so uh doesn't completely make the problem go away but reduces it by a significant margin if you can settle in batches intraday and those batches are dependent on uh factors like uh the size of the outstanding net by position so they're kind of event based rather than time based uh then i do believe that that would that would solve the problem um effectively and i think that there's asset classes that effectively function like this uh cryptocurrency markets where you're converting from fiat uh to crypto operate basically in in that way where there's kind of ad hoc intraday settlement uh which you can describe as as t0 um and i think uh the the d5 kind of crypto to crypto trading is a good um a good example of what chad was saying earlier what a future could look like where um you know you have these stable coins that are on blockchains you have different assets on different blockchains and you could do these like cross-chain atomic swaps that effectively approximate what real-time settlement would look like and chad what about you how do you think that this world would look different well i i think it would be dramatically different the way it works today you know if you did end of day t0 it depend again as vlad said how is it constructed uh that would probably reduce margin almost all the way uh because right now you know your margin isn't even getting uh posted until either at the end of the day or the next day so you imagine if you're settling by 5 pm on t0 you know that's going to probably be most of what needs to be done so you could imagine dropping from 15 billion dollars of capital that's needed to do guarantees because you have a centralized intermediary that's guaranteeing every single trade to all the participants suddenly amongst themselves at 5 pm and you just needing to hold a little bit in case someone uh doesn't fund um that's a huge improvement i mean you're probably talking 90 plus percent uh capital savings i'm gonna guess 95 if you did intraday batching i think you know you're basically getting all the way there and um you know um you'd still probably want to collect some margin anyways just to be extra safe but that's not even how the system works right now there wasn't even a trade guarantee uh until very recently until the night of t1 so when we were at t3 settlement that guarant trade guarantee kicked in on the knight of t1 so you know getting to t0 uh is far better than what the clearinghouse was ever doing and you have to remember the clearinghouse has never been tapped before you had the 87 crash you had you know the asian financial crisis you had the dot com bust you had night uh capital you know giant uh kind of blow up uh any of these things never once tapped the obviously the financial crisis 2008 never once tapped the clearing fund so this is a huge amount of money that is being tracked and it's you know that's a it's a nice um thing to have but if it's not ever used and you know i i guess at some point it could be used i don't know when it's but it never has been used even through what is you know the biggest crises of all you know when will it be used might as well move to a different point where we can release this capital and it won't be pro cyclical where people are getting a 15 billion dollar capital call and it flexes from 15 billion to 30 billion um instead you could sit here and be using say t0 or batches free that capital up to be used to grow businesses to create new products uh to create more trading to create more liquidity uh to do all kinds of different things invest in their businesses uh you know that would be a real win for frankly all of society and so that's why this is such a big issue because that's a lot and by the way that that's just the capital in the guarantee fund that's not the capital on settlement day settlement day is very long and slow it's 30 billion to 60 billion dollars liquidity is trapped all day long with a lien on it so that means across wall street you have somewhere like 45 billion to 90 billion to 100 billion dollars of capital liquidity tied up in settlement processes that could be really you know released where could that go i mean well you could think of a lot of places a 100 billion dollars could be better utilized if you were getting to much more efficient guaranteeing and settlement processes it's just you're right it's huge inefficiencies and so i was curious because obviously you know chad you did say that you're hoping that you're able to open this solution out to a wider group within the year and obviously vlad is very interested in shorter settlement times so what would a market look like if um there were just certain platforms that were settling this quickly and others that were settling more slowly like is that would that even happen or is that possible for that to happen or yeah i was just wondering um you know how that would look what i'm trying to say is if the dtcc is on this track to do t plus one and you're saying that you could potentially release this out to a larger group within the year then you know what happens do we just have two different systems for oil or what yeah i mean you basically have a bridging mechanism so there there's a lending market that exists today uh the lending market um either on dollars or shares could help bridge participants so if some participants were settling in t zero um and they were trading to settle on t zero and you know you could settle on t t0 you could shadow on t1 you can kind of you put a tag in today in your trades and when you want settlement to happen and you can make different settlement time frames possible just with the normal process either through um otc trades over the counter trades uh alternative trading system trades or exchange trades uh exchange trades right now have to be a t2 so that would be the sec changing them but other purchases other trades can be other time frames and there are other time frames participants can settle in those other time frames and they just have to reallocate the inventory to deal with the rest of the process of settling out at whatever the sec rules allow again sec for exchanges is t2 if that moved to t1 or maybe they create flexibility at t0 then all participants could have the possibility of deciding when they wanted to settle okay yeah so it does sound like if platforms manage to get there more quickly then that's just a huge competitive advantage um you know it would cut a lot of costs it sounds like um so we could talk about this so much more um but we do also have another topic to discuss which is another big thing that's been taking off all this year which is crypto uh so why don't we do the third poll um because we kind of again want to see where the audience members are at in terms of their level of experience with this um so for this question it is have you ever purchased crypto if so from where and the options are i have never purchased crypto and don't have plans to i have no pro never purchased crypto but i'd like to i have purchased crypto via the robin hood app i have purchased crypto via paypal or squares cash app and then the last one is i have purchased crypto via coinbase gemini or another crypto specific company so go ahead and make your selection and we will see okay so more than half have purchased via coinbase gemini or another crypto specific company the second is um i've never purchased crypto but i'd like to no sorry the second is i purchased crypto via robin hood the third is i've never purchased crypto but i'd like to and then lastly uh paypal and then never purchased okay so clearly um yeah what we've been seeing in the news without a lot of people are getting into crypto is is um bearing out also here 17 market share that's pretty good so vlad you were one of the first fintech apps to add crypto why did you move make that move um back then before this big um you know interest took off in the mainstream yeah we we added crypto in early 2018 um which at the time felt felt somewhat late but uh i guess now uh look at what's happened in in the last three years um uh the reasons that we decided to add it was i mean mainly customer demand uh we look at different analytics for what customers want to invest in on our platform uh for example we were seeing um unfulfilled searches so people searching for different things on the platform and you know right around that time period we started to getting we started getting a lot of unfulfilled searches for cryptocurrencies and so we started looking at it um and then uh also it became clear that particularly in that phase of the cryptocurrency market people were predominantly interested in it as an asset uh less so as kind of a medium of exchange to power transactions um and the use case of cryptocurrency as an asset to diversify your holdings um is is very much in line and was in line with with what robinhood's core competency was so we thought we could do something uh really really special for customers make it work very well and at the same time sort of fulfill the customer demand you know we've been very proud of of the product that we've built and so how does robin hood's crypto operation work on the back end when someone buys bitcoin or another crypto asset in robin hood where are those coins coming from and then when they sell them where are they sold and also what is your revenue model for the crypto trading like do you just make a little bit of money on the bid ask spread or how does that work yeah it's structured similarly to our equities and and options business i mean different market makers but it is analogous so we uh route customer orders um through market makers and then those market makers uh go and source liquidity through uh a number of different exchanges and market centers and uh and you know we we obtain uh the coins and sell the coins via them and the revenue model is is also similar we collect rebates from our market makers on crypto transactions kind of similarly to to how it would work in an equities or options transaction okay so it's the payment forward or flow model as well yeah okay yeah and i mean you guys just published a blog post saying that you saw six million new crypto users on your platform in just the first few months of 2021 compared to 401 000 in a single month in 2020 um however i'm sure you're well aware you know on twitter i see it a lot of people are wondering you know why is it that when they buy crypto and robin hood can they not withdraw the crypto to their own wallets when uh do you think that you'll be able to enable crypto uh purchasers to move their assets off the platform uh yes the the wallets question no i've uh i've been hearing that one a lot lately um so i guess to the rationale why why we didn't launch with wallets to begin with back in 2018 and it was a consideration uh certainly we were kind of debating internally whether we should hold the launch and give people the ability to transact or or put it out there um without kind of withdrawal and deposit capability we decided that there actually is a very significant use case especially for people that aren't um particularly technology savvy and they they don't understand how you know public private keys work um because you know it's kind of like using a password manager um i don't know if if you guys use password managers maybe you do but if you've tried to explain to someone who is you know not a computer scientist or a technical person that they should have their passwords and this thing and have a master pass phrase and everything should be sort of uh buttoned up in that way it's the right thing to do and it's obviously great for security but you've just dropped the number of people that are gonna that are gonna kind of um go through with this by a significant portion so we're optimizing for making it as easy as possible to do what the majority of people wanted to do which is to get exposure to these assets uh with the lowest possible cost um and that's really kind of the pillars of robinhood's product experience we want to give people the lowest possible cost we can give them and we also want to have the best customer experience that's just like it just works and so i think we've accomplished that and now um with the scale and load that we're dealing with we've uh we've been staffing the crypto team pretty tremendously and we've committed to doing this we want to deliver uh wallets to people and we want to do it as safely and as expeditiously as possible while balancing just sort of the the demands of a surging business that needs um high quality customer support service availability and reliability um so it's uh well we'll get there but it's it's not as trivial as sort of like flipping a config file and all of these millions of customers can suddenly move their their coins around yeah yeah and from my understanding of this business i think also making things fraud proof is um you know really really important in this kind of scenario so i'm sure uh that may play a role absolutely yeah i've said um repeatedly robin hood takes safety extremely seriously it's our top value you know we're a safety first company and that means not just protecting customers but making sure that we protect the broader financial system and we work with our regulators and and other counterparties to um to protect the system that their transactions rely upon yeah so we're kind of running out of time but since we started a bit late i'm gonna take uh two last questions quickly both of you have businesses that are pure crypto and that they involve the selling of the assets themselves uh but you also have uh these businesses on the securities trading side which could be potentially disrupted by blockchain technology so it's curious just if you were to project out you know maybe five years or pick your number um in the future which business do you think will be a bigger business for each of you which business meaning crypto or uh stock trading will be a bigger business for us yeah yeah uh well as bullish as i am on crypto it's hard for me to imagine that crypto could have the same market cap as us stocks which i know i think it's like 45 trillion dollars at the moment and that's just u.s stocks that's not bonds or you know whatever other types of securities um i think that'll always probably be a bigger asset class um than crypto but on the other hand um the crypto has the possibility to really increase very significantly and um it's captured a lot of enthusiasm and right now the spreads are quite wide on it so people are making a lot of money on it i think the whole point of paxos is we're not trying to pick winners we're trying to be the infrastructure and so ultimately if i'm wrong and crypto is the biggest great and if you know if i'm right and stocks are the biggest great because we're working on both of those and so our goal is we're infrastructure so we don't have to know exactly which asset's going to be the right one and what i want to make sure is that whoever wants to build a business to serve those end customers has an easy way to do it and so if we do that successfully then um uh whatever asset class uh perhaps emerges even that we don't even know we can also service too i i generally agree with that from a sort of direct to consumer uh business standpoint uh you know we we want to make sure we're there offering the the types of investments that customers want to invest in i think from a technology standpoint we are likely to see greater convergence so you know whether you have some of these traditional financial assets um being tokenized or through uh through synthetics there's a lot of really interesting work happening in the synthetic space blockchain technology is is likely going to penetrate the traditional sphere a little bit more and you'll you'll see some convergence between these two things so the if you can't beat them join them answer all right and lastly what's next for each of your companies bloomberg did report that robin hood has filed to go public although i'm expecting vlad is likely not able to discuss this and chad paypal did um it was reported that paypal may be launching a stablecoin which is clearly in texas's wheelhouse and you also recently told the block when discussing your 300 million raise that you thought you could add one customer the size of paypal this year but now you think you can add three to five so what can each of you tell us what is next tell us about what is next for your companies well um i'll just say uh i i can't talk too much obviously about um any any public offering um but i i can say that we've got a lot of work ahead of us um we want to make sure we continue listening to customers uh both crypto and uh and securities equities and options and uh we've been growing the team uh to try to meet all the demand and make sure we continue to innovate i think innovation in the space is uh accelerating and it's going to be increasingly important to kind of meet the demands of of the people yeah and what i'd say is um uh what's driving that growth for us that you were just talking about laura that you mentioned uh where you know maybe we could add one person the size of paypal and i think we could add three to five is this move from um early adopter to mainstream we've been talking about a lot and it's happening far faster than i could have imagined and that's part of the reason why we raise the the capital is because um we wanted to use this as a chance uh to take advantage of the chance here that is this window of opportunity to really invest in our business take advantage of what's happening um with uh many large firms coming into the space i'm really surprised that how um it's really shifted i think partly because of paypal um and you know obviously you know vlad and robin hood really early in offering uh crypto but uh paypal really created i think a shift where people were afraid before paypal and they were afraid after paypal uh just for different reasons uh afraid to be first and now um afraid that they're going to be left behind and um there were obviously early adopters that blazed the trail that got uh paypal comfortable and i think robin hood is clearly one of those and um now that's creating a knock-on effect and um that knock-on effect is something that we're seeing because of our position as infrastructure and we're seeing that where firms want to come in and have a turnkey solution to be able to buy and sell crypto but also um you know be able to send and receive as vlad was talking about you know that's a complex thing we do that for uh customers and then they also see this as a way to be able to add all kinds of different assets and ultimately you have a crypto native asset is really a blockchain native asset and then you have non-native blockchain assets that we're helping to put into a blockchain world because re-platforming the whole system into a blockchain-based world is going to be hugely transformative i just imagine if every single asset in the world today was sitting on a blockchain what would the financial system look like i mean it's almost hard to like fully do that that thought experiment um it changes not just issues in the plumbing which is what we're doing but issues around exchange issues around getting loans issues around how people can have access to the financial system that they otherwise wouldn't um so there's so much that's going to happen here and it's exciting to see mainstream companies decide that they want to be part of this ecosystem because that's what attracted me to it 10 years ago and you know i think you know we're just still in the first out of the first inning there's only been 80 billion dollars of assets that have been tokenized um that's basically dollars for crypto trading you know we're barely even started here imagine what this would look like when you get to you know real real mass adoption yeah i love it that you said that because actually that was going to be a question which i had to leave on the cutting room floor because of time but i was curious to get you guys to kind of expound on what that world would look like because i am fascinated by that question um but anyway thank you both so much again for giving us your great insights thank you to everyone who joined our discussion i think we're gonna have to wrap up this really um scintillating panel thanks so much for joining us today to learn more
