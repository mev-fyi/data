I believe what tripped them up was the yield Seekers weren't paying attention to Rising yields through two three four percent they thought that money was stable wasn't going to go anywhere at five the floodgates opened and everybody started leaving and like wait a minute wait a minute over here the yield Seekers are leaving now and my tech guys are leaving and my crypto guys are leaving and they all want their money today at noon I couldn't I couldn't meet those obligations and that's why I think that they were forced what I'm describing is why all this led to say Silicon Valley Bank a week ago Wednesday had to sell 40 billion dollars worth of Securities and realize a 1.8 billion dollar loss and then their stock fell 60 percent and then there was a panic and then everybody started to run for the exits
