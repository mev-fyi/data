not a dividend It's A Tale of Two fun now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um my name's trading firms who are very involved I like to have the ultimate D5 Protocols are the antidote to this problem hello everybody Welcome to The Chopping Block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry Insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day so quick intros first we've got Tom the defy Maven and master of memes next up we've got tarun the Giga brain and Grand Puba at Gauntlet uh joining us today we have Laura the CEO of the show and finally myself I'm Steve the head height man at dragonfly so we are early stage investors in crypto but I want to copy that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice okay so for those of you who somehow have not followed the story we left off last week I think Tuesday we recorded this emergency episode um on last Tuesday we were we were sort of on this Cliffhanger when CZ had announced that he was going to acquire uh FTX although he just submitted an Loi meaning that it was a non-binding uh letter of intent to decide whether or not they after they do due diligence whether they were going to acquire FTX and on the last show we were basically anticipating there was a high likelihood that CeCe was going to walk away from the deal so that was Tuesday Wednesday CZ announces that CZ is walking away binance cannot take over the liabilities the the balance sheet is too much of a mess Sam then announces that he is going to still seek emergency financing he kind of softly blames CZ claiming that CZ was never going to buy anything um he announced that the FTX U.S is fine the problem is on FTX International but ftfus is totally okay and he says that the balance sheets are totally separated on the same day the SEC announces that for the first time they are going to be investigating FDX into misappropriation of customer funds there was already an outstanding investigation into some of their earned products but now it's it's starting to look like it's potentially a criminal probe so that's Wednesday everybody is kind of standing on pins and needles the Assumption at that point is that probably FTX is not going to be able to raise funding but nobody knows that the complete details quite yet Thursday last week withdrawals on FDX are completely Frozen but it's announced that Bahamian citizens are allowed to withdraw from FTX FTX claims that this was under the order of the Bahamian SEC the bombing SEC by the way later as of this weekend denied that this was ever an instruction given to FTX but the only withdrawals that are now coming out of FTX Global are two Bahamian citizens there ends up being an absolute circus where multiple things happen in the same day one Justin Sun announces a credit facility that he's going to allow Tron and Tron ecosystem tokens to be withdrawable from FTX and then only Bahamian citizens and Tron tokens can be withdrawn uh and and nfts and so what happened what happens is that on Twitter there are all sorts of crazy Black Market transactions where people are faking behind me in kyc or engaging into OTC deals with Bahamian users to basically use Bahamian kyc to withdraw out of FTX which is obviously very illegal and all this is happening out in the open on Twitter uh Sam was reportedly still in the Bahamas when all this happened but basically the whole team quit around this time and so FDX just kind of becomes an absolute circus Friday finally FTX files for bankruptcy and when FTX files for bankruptcy it's not just FTX International which is where the damage was originally done but every single subsidiary of FTX including FTX us including blockfolio and Ledger X all file for bankruptcy simultaneously Sam resigns as CEO and he brings in John Ray who was the Liquidator for Enron to be the Liquidator for the FTX bankruptcy people thought at this point okay it's over it finally FTX has come to rest the whole thing is going to be Unwound and we're going to learn what really happened and then Friday night a massacre it turns out that FTX starts moving funds again and people like wow what is the Liquidator doing at FTX at you know 10 p.m on a Friday night well what ended up happening was that the the cold wallets for FTX were hacked and hundreds of millions of dollars of FTX assets particularly in lots and lots of all coins started getting sold through defy we should we should be careful about calling it a hack or not it could have just been an Insider and we don't actually fully know we just know the funds move the funds moved somehow we know that they were unoptimized yes there's some some type of unauthorized access we don't know yet who this was or how they were connected to FTX um and at the same time soon after this started taking place people noticed that the hacker or the attacker quote unquote um started uh moving funds to two different addresses and over time it becomes clear that actually these two different addresses are somebody who has two people have control over the same address fighting for control and siphoning assets away from control of the attacker and so about 200 there was about 600 million uh worth of assets that were under contest and about 300 million of it was successfully siphoned Away by the attacker uh the other 300 million was either protected by the FTX team or Frozen a huge number of assets including the the I think the Pax G and the tether was frozen in anticipation of the attackers selling them for for unfeasible assets so absolute Mayhem taking place on Friday night uh finally the situation gets under control by by Friday by Saturday the balance sheet of FTX is finally leaked and we now know what the uh assets and liabilities of FTX look like basically FTX had one billion in liquid assets to 9 billion in liabilities meaning that if looking at the current state of the balance sheet almost certainly there are going to be Pennies on the dollar for anybody who is who's looking at uh the the FTX liquidation so it's clear now that the scale of fraud at FTX was massive it's clear that there was huge amounts of um of capital that was pulled out of FTX that should have been there for customer deposits it's clear that it infected every element of the FTX Empire it even affected FTX us which was originally perceived and we thought on the show that it was going to be totally cordoned off and that was the indication that Sam was giving as of Wednesday but the whole thing has now completely collapsed and we're now learning more and more salacious details and drama of what was going on underneath the hood so I'm gonna stop there we're gonna we're gonna go into a lot of detail about a lot of these things but I just want to first start with giving everybody up to speed on what has happened between then and now it took it took all of those facts before Matt Levine agreed it was fraud because I feel like if you actually have been reading like the fight Financial coverage and normal news it's all been like oh like they've had some problems they had asset liability mismatched maybe they could have borrowed funds whatever right and like today he was finally like and he was like yeah I like Sammy because he probably wasn't lying and that was like Friday uh and then you know today finally like oh actually this balance sheet is dog [ __ ] and it's mainly them saying tokens that they control they marked up to their like Peak value um and took no liquidity constraints or anything like that into account so I feel like at this point it's pretty clear that Not only was that true but like the block find Voyager Acquisitions were really just another way to keep kind of the Ponzi scheme going because like it really the interesting thing from a like theoretical lens about this is you're taking three separate businesses or entities that have three functions that on their own could be sustainable like an exchange that earns trading fees a market making operation that happens to have a very good fee tier that's sort of the altruistic way of describing Almeda and and the last thing is uh the ability to borrow against your own equity but those three things their their utilities when added together under one entity looks like a Ponzi but if they're a separate and adversarial they're they're fine and sustainable and that's like the interesting that to me that's the funniest thing about this is like somehow we just turned into a very standard Ponzi scheme it's just that you took the new depositors money and you used it to underwrite yourself ftt loans which you then had to use to prop up ftt which is basically buying up the you know paying the old depositors and you needed new new flow depositors keep that going and well so here's the thing true is I I completely agree with you and it does put all of the Acquisitions that Sam was doing over the summer into a very different light um and so just just to sketch out because I think a lot of the audience might not totally understand so you might remember in the summer after the three arrows blow up a bunch of lenders went underwater and needed to be bailed out and Sam kind of stepped in and announced that he was going to backstop a lot of the lenders and um at the time a lot of people believed that Sam was just consolidating he was being this JP Morgan like capitalist um it now see this is the theory okay again nobody really knows the exact details but the theory is that um Alameda was already underwater and was having their loans recalled by a lot of the other lenders and the only way that they could one uh prevent themselves from deleveraging which would have caused elevators completely blow out or two basically also obfuscate the extent of of their of their um their loan agreements with other parties was that basically they had to bail out the banks that were loading of money and if they didn't do that that Alameda was just you know ftt was just going to be vomited up everywhere and Alameda itself would no longer be be viable um and so the the idea is that actually they had to bail out block fi and and Voyager because they were two of their own largest lenders that's the idea now again we don't know if that's exactly true you know when when this happened on on when we were doing the show last week my assumption was that this started recently my assumption was that the the the the uh the capital that was lent out from FTX customer deposits to elementa was probably a momentary lapse that happened in the summer after three AC blew up right it was basically Sam was on the brink he had to go to elevator's rescue and if he didn't that everything was going to fall apart elevator was going to go to bankruptcy uh you know all of the Sam Empire tokens were going to unwind in a really dramatic way and he thought look if I can just if I can just tied over some liquidity now I can save Alameda pay back the loans blah blah blah all this can be made whole as long as crypto doesn't turn against me right the market doesn't turn against me that was my mental model of probably what happened as more of this information is coming out about just how consistently this pattern of misappropriation and fraud seems to have been at FTX it now seems increasingly likely that actually this was happening from the beginning now again we don't know this is speculation there's so much fog of War right now about what the actual picture was at FTX but the pictures that we're getting so far seems to be that this was the intention from the beginning was to use FTX as a piggy bank for Alameda and that and that's really scary that this so so one of the one of the big stories that came out from the Wall Street Journal this weekend was that um apparently there was essentially this back door that was uh some kind of some kind of program that Sam had access to that allowed him to basically keep two sets of books for FTX such that the Auditors would get one set of books about what uh where the assets were but he could you know with a click of a button move funds from FTX customer deposits into Alameda in a way that was opaque to their Auditors and actually opaque to people internally at FTX which is crazy and and uh demonstrates a a Clarity around fraud that I was not expecting to get at the heart of the story it's funny that uh right now is blowing up with people being like Sam lied to Laura straight to jail in response for this type of stuff yeah that's hilarious it's criminal oh it's fun it's funny because um I remember during defy summer um there was something I think Sam said to ask for someone else at FDX said to us on a call basically saying hey all these early D5 teams they [ __ ] up they did these doing these public token sales um because then you're supposed to be selling the security of why do you want to sell you know basically pseudo equity in your project actually actually actually this story um no so I so I relate the story to you it was not actually Sam who told me this it was actually Kyle from three arrows who told me this so so let me let me tell you the story 2021. I know I know this is 2021 last year uh I I come to Singapore and um it was actually it was like my second time meeting uh the three arrows guys and so I got I got uh lunch with Kyle Kyle Davies in Singapore and this was back when Sam was Top of the World Kyle was Top of the World um you know these guys were just printing money they were they were the kind of the titans of the industry and um he was telling me you know so they had a close relationship Sam and Kyle was telling me he's like you know I think I finally understood what Sam was doing and I was like what do you mean what do you mean you want to show what Sam was doing he was telling me you know the the what Sam realized is that the people from the last generation of crypto the way that they monetized their position in the market was that they would they would they would get really well known they would build all this press get all this awareness and then they would launch a token and they would sell that token to retail and that was that was the game in 2017. and Sam realized that that game is stupid because if you play that game one you you make money once you just sell the token once and that's it and then you get all these regulatory troubles right oh the SEC comes after you the people lose money they get really mad and like you just have to deal with this thing forever and what Sam realized is that uh what you should do instead is you should launch tokens and you should be a net buyer of those tokens because if you are a net buyer of those tokens then now that token is going to become really valuable because you're booing it in addition to everybody else you're not perceived as a seller you have no problems with Regulators because regulars aren't mad that you're dumping the stuff on retail and if you're Sam you can use this as as collateral and you can borrow the real money of crypto which is dollars and especially if you have a market making firm that can monetize using those dollars then that's where you make the real money you don't make the real money doing an Ico right that's where you can make okay you can make a few hundred million doing an Ico but if you want to make billions you need dollars to go make those billions and that was uh you know according to according to Kyle that was the strategy that that Sam was employing from the very beginning he did it with uh he did it with serum he did it with [ __ ] he did it with all these Sam tokens and now I guess Sushi potentially as well there's no speculation that that Sam was actually Chef Nomi all along who was the original creator of sushi swap yeah I remember when after I had this conversation with Kyle I was like huh that's really interesting yeah I guess that's true but I I I Associated that with Alameda I thought Ah that's what elementa is doing it's not what FTX is doing FTX is an exchange right like that's maybe Sam's personal strategy but I I didn't connect the dots that this is um that FTX itself would be the hold into this strategy um and that's what I think what what it was crazy to everybody but you know in in 2021 like so we never invest into FTX we never invest into serum we never invested into any of the Sam ecosystem tokens we found them just to be so ridiculous like so the way that the serum fundraise happened so I don't know if uh uh it was a terminal you were there you were there early in the in the serum sale um so when the serum sale happened everyone heard that you know Sam was launching a DEX and the way they conducted the sale was not like any VC round I have ever seen in my life so literally they had an Excel spreadsheet and they had lots of I think a million dollars a pop and uh you had to put your name down in the Excel sheet and it was it was basically like the price for every lot would get higher programmatically and so if you put your name in the Excel sheet as okay I'm in for you know 400 million FTV and then the next person has to do 420 fdv and the next person has to do 440 FTV and so the the game was that you need to get in as fast as possible put your name in as fast as possible and get to a decision quickly no time for due diligence no time to even think it through and Sam loved this mechanism right he did this kind of thing multiple times because he just believed that VCS are idiots and I mean doing that maybe he was right he just had a the interesting thing though is for all the Sam Queens they actually were his noose at the end um if you if you actually start to think about it because the thing that happened to them is that they all had these like seven year emission schedules like they wouldn't fully haven't fully diluted until seven years and they started with an extremely small amount of uh liquid tokens in the beginning and then they had this like hyper inflationary schedule so the people who bought into the serum sale within one year they could recoup their principal because the staking rewards were worth more than the principal and so and the staking rewards were liquid like that was the that was the sort of like magic to getting all these people to buy it early was that hey you get your money back in a year now the the problem with that is seven year emission schedule means that whatever valuation you're quoting right this like fully diluted valuation which is like total number of future tokens versus the actual number that exists it's kind of a sham you can't really say that the token is worth that market cap at all right because if someone had a loan that they have to liquidate let's say if you borrow it against it it would never be able to liquidate it and somehow all the centralized lenders are absolute dog [ __ ] at risk management I mean I I I you know if you're centralized it's much easier than what I have to do what we do for for D5 like you don't have to make proposals get people to vote you literally can just be like LTV is this I'm gonna liquidate you [ __ ] you right you're a bad lender and all of these people are dog [ __ ] in fact I am I DM so after I wrote some tweets about this have been filled with people who worked at Celsius and Voyager being like yeah we couldn't we weren't allowed to liquidate our top customers because they had three customers who are borrowing everything which was like Alameda three arrows a few other firms and they were like yeah all right the thing is we could never liquidate our customers because then we'd have no revenue and we all needed to show these like huge amounts of income streams um during the Bull Run and so these these centralized lenders had absolutely no incentive to a adjust the loan to value B figure out when to liquidate a loan that's underwater which is exactly what we the point in fact they went bankrupt because they didn't liquidate Alameda or three arrows right that's that's why Voyager needed to get bailed out and the more crazy thing about this is that Sam convinced them to let him borrow as if the the tokens were worth the fully deadly evaluation and one thing I think that's very clear from um the missteps of Caroline Ellison who is follow me the CEO uh is that after the uh coindesk leaked the balance sheet one of the most important things that you should read from that sort of text that was there was that their liabilities were all in locked ftt so they had they had some liquid assets of liquid ftt but they had they were Nets short at that price four billion dollars that's locked locked ftt that means someone probably Voyager or or block value or a combination of all of them lent money probably a loan to value of like 50 which is ridiculous because like this thing is never you could never liquidate this loan like that's how stupid these centralized decentralized lenders deserve to die because they were all [ __ ] [ __ ] like I don't know how to describe how stupid some of the stories people who work there have DM me like I it is it is actually they deserve to die they are like the subprime lenders of 2008. and of course the difference is a subprime lender is usually lent to people who are not explicitly adversarial with them that are just kind of bad borrowers here they're explicitly adversarial borrowers who gave you collateral that they control the valuation of and they control the size of and they sort of like hey look here's this piece of paper that's worth five billion dollars so lend us a billion of your customer funds and so that that's how the block size and voyagers and stuff got to say oh look we're making 100 million dollars a year we're charging 10 on this billion dollar loan and so of course FTX can make the interest payments for that so the thing that is kind of crazy is and this is really where I think the news of The Seven Year thing hung Alameda and FTX is eventually you know while the price is going up you don't have to actually borrow you're borrowing against something such that your net liabilities are actually decreasing because like your assets are going up as things go down as the price crashes you have to start borrowing more because you have to go prop up the price of this thing because like if it reaches certain levels your everything is liquidated all at once you have this huge Cascade and so what are they doing their Market making strategy for ftt and serum was effectively the following and you can see some evidence of this uh in order because there's really no bids like no one is buying this uh organically everyone is just collecting their staking rewards and selling and they basically had to borrow dollars against ftt and serum buy any ftt Instagram that's being sold which means they're now net long they're even longer this asset and over time they like had the spiral and Caroline basically pulled the Noose for them when she wrote that tweet about the 22 dollar thing because she basically admitted that if they couldn't get it around like if ftt fell before that amount they were like completely doomed and everyone knew how much Elite at the very least how much they're doomed for from that leaked coin desk and you know I I'm not even sure CZ was necessarily he thought I'll just kill Alameda he didn't he probably didn't necessarily realize it was as entangled but he said he's gonna sell like stuff teaching yeah I I think their strategy was very you know it actually I I was thinking a lot of what Nick Carter said in the last show about how you know every cycle there is you know the highest flying stars are almost always overfitted to the market cycle and very clearly Alameda you know they really came of age although they started you know people talk about the the um the early you know the the Bitcoin Japan are blah blah blah that that elevator did which like was kind of a as we're learning now is was more of a [ __ ] show than they initially LED on the reality is that like where Alameda really came of age was in 2020 and 2021 in the midst of this kind of defy Solana Mania when the primary thing that they needed was dollars and if you have dollars you can yield Farm you can leverage up you can bet on your own tokens you can know when things are going to get listed there was just a story in the Wall Street Journal about an hour ago which uh was talking about how if you look at on-chain data you can see very clearly that Alameda was buying up tokens before they were listed on FTX no I don't know I don't know that's brilliant sleuthing I mean everyone pretty much knew this that Alameda was basically the Venture arm of FTX before FTX Ventures was spun up the strategy worked like a charm in 2020 uh in 2021 they made a crapload of money doing it and they thought it would still work and that's what ftt and FTX was all designed around was they were adapted to this bull market environment and when that bull market went away and the reliability of knowing which tokens were gonna go up when and that having Capital meant that you could yield farm and dump tokens and be told totally Cavalier about this stuff you know it was so weird as an observer because we weren't very close to to FTX or to Alameda we never invested into anything they did it was so weird to see how like the right arm of FTX was supposed to be this like great stalwart exchange it was supposed to be this wonderful thing and the left arm of Alameda was this like mercenary Cutthroat you know basically like just farm and dump fund and people were people loved Alameda they wanted to take their money so badly like we would we would sometimes lose deals to element and we're like why are you taking alameda's money like they're they're they're barely even a market maker from they're just like a they're like a you know farm and dump firm why why would you want their their Capital but they were winning deals because of their relationship with FTX and this idea that if you want to get listen FTX and you want the same pump you want to be integrated into the Sam Empire you have to take their money and that became the engine the growth engine that I think um got them greedy I mean it is it is actually though like the real question to me is like how much how large the loans were at Voyager block five Etc because that's the key way to measure like how how much leverage they really took that they didn't count or like clearly they obviously didn't hedge anything I mean the linear wealth thing already tells you that the other thing that I think is is was a very childish mistake on their part is that Capital Management at like large scales in active Capital Management is very different than small scales like when they were like a 50 to 100 million dollar firm versus a billion plus in AUM you have to actually start being a lot more diligent about your net how much leverage you really are holding versus like how much you think you're holding and I think I mean as you can tell from their very shoddy bookkeeping it's clear they were not doing a very good job of even keeping track of that and you can get away with that I think at smaller sizes in the sense that like it'll be more apparent to you but when you have a large book of a very large set of assets and like you're not really thinking about how correlated some of the assets are they may might you might go from being like 1.5 x lover to 10x leverage because five of your assets are all moving in the same direction which is against the side you're short it's very much easier a larger scale to like completely misestimate your leverage ratio although nothing is more dog [ __ ] than saying oh uh actually we thought we had zero X leverage and we actually had 1.7 x 1.7 divided by 0 is still infinite my friend like yeah I mean one thing that was very clear I mean I'm sure that you spoke to ex-alimated people over the last year we we would we we interviewed a few people who came out of Alameda and everybody who was there said that it was just it was a circus like there were so few controls uh it was not well run it was not well managed I heard everything was like literally managed in management there was like no like this like accounting system for keeping track of all the wallets it was like you just wrote in a Google sheet yeah and at that time you know for young people I mean I don't I don't blame them like they thought Alameda was so prestigious it was so well known everybody thought Sam was like the the you know the he was the the Visionary of crypto and so a lot of young Traders wanted to work at Alameda and they churned really fast because Alameda didn't pay well it was a horrible place to work and so we we'd constantly talk to a stream of people who left Alameda and wanted to get a better job but I mean the one thing that that you're pointing to tarun which is also part of the center of the story is the corporate governance at FTX and a lot of that has come out um in the in the in the last week so you know we we never were that close to FTX we're invested in some of their competitor exchanges like vibed and so we never really kicked the tires that closely on their fundraisers it turns out uh that FTX did not have a CFO they didn't even have a board they took in 1.7 billion dollars of venture funding and they had almost no controls and we're learning more and more that in the Bahamas there was a a house that basically Sam and his core lieutenants as well as some of their friends lived in that was basically kind of like a polyamorous commune type place um where just everybody who was part of the Sam ecosystem uh lived together apparently they I mean it's absolute craziness so apparently there were a lot of relationships amongst each other that kind of were pretty fluid of people sleeping together who are part of the core team at FTX they were they were quite secretive about it they were also uh part of the orientations when people would join FTX is that Sam would walk through different stimulants and he would encourage people to try out some of these different stimulants in their onboarding I don't know if this is verified but I I saw this in one of the accounts of people I mean I will say the best uh primary source because like all of this is hearsay except for Caroline Ellison's blog Tumblr yes yes which is truly truly I feel I feel like reading that was like really understanding like the mindset of an incompetent super villain like they had all the traits of like sociopathy but like none of the like self-awareness to understand that you have to like execute that in a certain way but yeah it's her her tumbler has a lot of uh a lot of details about the follicles so I would I would highly recommend you go I I spent two hours Doom scrolling sort of the other picture that's emerging here is like there's this Inner Circle there's this top Circle at FTX which is like these you know four officers and there's everybody else um and so you know I knew people who rotated through FTX and I don't get the sense they were in on this massive scheme there was massive deception and massive just fraud but it was not as if like the entire system was was built this way it was like a small group of people who were going out and were actually yeah although yeah uh the more that I talk to people um I mean has seen kind of mentioned it I mean it appears that the operation was very shambolic and just you know I kind of made this point last week when we had the discussion with Nick but you know the more I think about it I think yeah I think like pretty much um last week I think some of my early messages out to people were to try to understand what the security setup was at the exchange because the idea that somebody could just move the funds without like it's setting off alarm bells and exchange that I I was just like I know how a crypto exchange Works in terms of security and like it should be some kind of multi-sig at minimum there's you know you know obviously there can be like rituals even around you know when you move funds from the from the cold storage like how you do that and so it was kind of like like how did that even work like on a functional level like how did they actually move this money without you know somebody at least like quitting and just being like I'm I'm not you know gonna participate in this I'm leaving this company like there was something very odd about that but the more that I've learned like yeah there were just certain kind of key elements that were missing and then on top of that what you mentioned about kind of applying this time pressure to a lot of the investors uh I think that was definitely a big part of it and frankly you know there were certain I think let's just say I think they were kind of strategic about which investors they went after in order to kind of give um themselves a certain machine of like having passed a certain bar maybe in due diligence because they maybe pressured those those groups a certain way um and the actual like uh reputations um that those groups had they didn't actually get to get to do what Their normal process let's put it that way the whole thing you know I just like last week when I was saying that I feel that SPF was sort of like you know it like he was like Hermione and it was like you suddenly found out he was Voldemort now I'm just like wow like I realized this was just baked in from the beginning the more that I'm like learning about kind of how things operated over a time period and how they were set up because like I said any normal crypto exchange is very well aware that like you know some 90 or whatever of all crypto exchanges have been hacked and so typically most of them they're just like the main thing we have to do is keep the coin secure and so you know you will see like kind of a priority around that and so the fact that that was able to happen without tripping some alarm Bells amongst certain employees that's why I was just like how did this even happen and yeah you know my conclusion at least so far is like yeah they did not even have sort of kind of the basic setup in place well FTX also very famously had very few employees and they were very proud of that fact I remember I think there was one point in like either 2020 or 2021 they had like 40 employees or something like that um which is obviously insane like 10 times fewer than you know coinbase would have for sort of a comparable Traction in size and so I also can't help but speculate and maybe look back and retrospect and think like maybe that is also part of the design is having few people means having fewer eyeballs um and making it easier to sort of bypass compliance last week we were chatting with a bunch of the um heads of exchanges in Asia and when all this was going down a lot of them were basically telling us that like they thought FTX was going to go down and at that time we didn't believe it I mean we just did we just couldn't I mean like I don't know it seemed like rumors were circulating and it's like okay why are you guys buying into these rumors it doesn't seem plausible wait wait and but just to understand they thought that just because of events last week or did they actually think that even before uh before this whole thing about the balance sheet when the math withdrawals were taking place they thought that FTX was was going to go under and we we just didn't believe it like to be honest up until basically Monday I didn't believe that anything was really wrong I I knew that Alameda was going to be in trouble like obviously uh if all that ftt was gonna get sold Alameda was gonna get screwed but I did not believe for a second that there were secret loans taking place between FTX and Alameda of customer funds that just seemed so implausible with everything that we'd seen about all these institutional investors about Sam and the controls that must have been in place given that they were talking about going public if you're talking about going public like of course there's no way that that could be the case little did we know exactly how bad the governance was at FTX but you know we had we had no insight into that and so they were they were telling us not only one that they thought FTX was going to blow but two what they were telling us is that like they thought that a lot of the FTX numbers were faked now I don't know if that's true or not it's quite possible it's quite possible that it's just that like wait volume filters are what kind of volume numbers and FTX were faked because what they were telling us is that like look we don't see FTX in these markets right when we're going out and battling for market share in these different markets globally we never see FTX but they're always you know top three top four for volume now it's possible that that's because FTX had so much U.S institutional volume that uh that's where all the volume was coming from was basically these big institutional players and most these other big exchanges are retail oriented right so like binance okay buy bit you know these guys they focus on retail they don't focus on institutions FTX seem to be focusing on institutions that might be part of the story but I would not be surprised for a second of what we also find as we go through the rubble is that FTX was was juicing their volume numbers now again it's going to be a while right now it's all in the fog of War we don't know what we don't know and all these people are kind of coming out of the woodwork now saying I knew it all along Sam was an evil guy he once stiffed me for blah blah anyway a big part of what is striking about all of this is now okay we take a step back right clearly this is one of the biggest catastrophes not just in crypto that we knew already on Tuesday but now we know it's actually one of the biggest catastrophes in Venture history right this is basically an Enron scale fraud that was enabled by some of the biggest VC firms and just the the culture of venture capital in in this industry and in general and it it's got me reflecting a lot on uh why did this happen whose fault is it Beyond obviously Sam obviously Sam has won his principal fault it is um but in terms of who enabled him what are the lessons that we take away as an industry when I say is an industry I don't just mean crypto but I also mean the tech industry uh because I think what happened here I mean obviously it was a bunch of yeah crypto investors invested into FTX but a bunch of just Tech investors invested into FTX as well um Pension funds as well yes yeah that's right Ontario did uh Tomasek did uh which is the Sovereign wealth fund of Singapore you've also got BlackRock you've also got you know you've got Sequoia you've got light speed you've got Paradigm you've got multi-coin you've got all these players who invested into the same company none of them required a board seat none of them required a CFO clearly none of them required audited financials from a reputable firm like there's some Mickey Mouse firm that did their audits apparently I heard that uh the somebody somebody had asked them oh what was it it was um chamoth said on all in podcast that he asked them for audit financials from a big four accounting firm and uh and asked them to like create a board uh with with external uh board members and Sam told him to [ __ ] off and then I heard um that Sam apparently was on a call with Steve Schwartzman the CEO of Blackstone and um Steve and Steve Schwartzman like you know he didn't really uh he was skeptical of the FTF story and Sam told them on a call that he was an old man and he didn't get it because he's too old and hung up on him and so this um this arrogance and this uh this kind of it it sort of became this legend that fed on itself and that not only and I think it's not only VCS but it's also the media because the media really created Sam right like I remember Sam back when he was first getting to the space in in 2019 2020 um he wasn't a big deal back then right he was starting to fund yeah I feel like the first time I'd ever even realized he was in crypto was I met him at your office yeah that was before I joined dragonfly right that was that was when those those before I came on board um it's a weird story because um so Alex and Beau who originally had dragonfly before I joined they sat down with Sam back when he was running Alameda he was trying to raise debt uh because he didn't want to he didn't want to actually have external investors in the fund he just wanted to uh sell debt at like a 15 note it's been it's been now circulated widely on Twitter and so uh they were interested so he was then pitching the idea of FTX and they were trying to invest into element itself that he wouldn't take external money and so he was like Hey I want to start a fund or sorry I want to start a exchange with Alameda and so uh they tried to uh they tried to invest they thought Sam seemed like an impressive guy they brought him to Asia they introduced him to a bunch of heads of exchanges and uh they end up having a falling out uh between Beau like my now partner and and Sam because Sam just kept flipping the script on them he kept saying like oh okay we're gonna do this thing at this price and the next day he would change it and he would kind of just go back and forth and he was just so aggressive and so difficult to work with that they just decided like look we just can't work with this guy and so they ended up walking away from the deal and Sam ended up uh his seed round uh was was done by other people I guess you know race capital and some other folks who end up doing the FTX seed round and uh after that actually for a while Sam really didn't like dragonfly he uh he refused to do deals with us for a while until uh until some you know eventually enough water had passed out of the bridge but at that time Sam was just seen as like kind of a quirky Market maker guy who got into space he wasn't nobody was scared of Sam nobody was amazed by Sam he was just like a guy who traded and uh was going to start an exchange but this Legend started to congeal around him and I really think the media it's very Elizabeth Holmes in retrospect right about how all the stuff that a normal person would look at and be like wow that's really weird he's like kind of a weird guy he's got his personality traits I think they're difficult to work with he's like on he's playing League of Legends while he's on a call with you he seems like kind of a dick he's sort of disrespectful all these things kind of became lionized and sort of became part of his his character and the media you know just ate it up and fed into it and he became the celebrity because of the fact like you know okay he has the uh you know he has the crazy hair he doesn't you know he doesn't care when he's on the call with you he wears the crappy t-shirts uh he has the Toyota Corolla he sleeps on a bean bag right this this mythology developed around him and um it enabled this whole thing I think a lot of people pattern matched him to like Mark Zuckerberg or to Elon Musk and said oh he's got this he's got this unique idiosyncratic Brilliance or maybe even in crypto like vitalik or Hayden right they're they're also Founders who kind of have that idiosyncratic character he fed into that Romanticism about the counter-cultural founder the the the the idiosyncratic founder the the slightly spectrumy founder and or I mean note that they deleted was truly one of the funniest you can find it what's in there that some of the stuff in that note is ridiculous like the first thing is they were lionizing him for playing League of Legends while pitching them um the second thing is they were just like it sounded like they didn't their form of diligence was more like what can we do to get in rather than like hey asking any questions and I think they definitely enjoyed the like uh brand name stuff like really harping on that for both Sam and Gary who's the CTO who no one knows where he is I guess but uh the thing is it doesn't read like an investment thesis letter as much as it reads like a a profile paid for you know like a I don't know yeah Laura I mean how would you describe it so this is why I just wanted to like separate out some of the things that haseeb was talking about that profile I believe was written for some kind of Sequoia publication and um a number of the VC firms have been launching their own Publications because they and even I think maybe some of the tech companies are doing this um because they believe the media is evil and I'll take out them and blah blah blah you know this whole thing like a16z and even like you'll hear some of the coinbase people kind of have this attitude and so they have been launching their own Publications which you know I mean I of course I interact with these people and they're lovely and whatever um you know I've never had anybody be like outrightly hostile toward me but you know I'm just gonna call it like it is like they're essentially propaganda outlets for you know their portfolio companies and whatever um and so that's it's called marketing propaganda is a very good listen listen being because that profile it came out of you know one of these outlets right and yeah okay maybe the traditional media wrote you know glowing profiles of Sam however like went so for a traditional journalist when you are doing that kind of thing like you know as far as we understand like we're not VCS but you know you will see like certain investors and to you that means like oh they passed whatever due diligence so I understand like yes they definitely should have dug deeper and they missed certain things however clearly from how shocked everybody was uh this past week I you know don't think that um there was anything like like let us let's put it this way I I definitely feel that whatever it was that Sam and and um his team did to kind of pull the wool over people's eyes like it was effective enough that when you have this sense that okay these you know like a pension fund and whatever investing like that just says something to you about kind of the Hoops that this has gone through right and now we're learning okay like maybe some of that didn't happen but you know I do feel that actually in the end you know journalism gets Vindicated here because none of this would have happened if coindesk and I'm going to call out Ian Allison specifically who is the reporter who leaked the Alameda financials which you know that is what triggered this whole thing and you know kudos to them like I have been in multiple chats where people are saying like Ian deserves a Pulitzer and all this stuff and you know I I do like I'm sure people are well aware that you know when I approach my work like I'm trying to find out you know the facts and to verify things and and you know that takes it takes work it's like it's not easy like just one other Lesson by the way that you know I've taken and green and I'm constantly learning this but it was especially honestly this past week is like crypto Twitter just moves at a pace that is like so fast like for a journalist you know it's just like yeah there are just certain things that um and people are willing to run with like whatever they're hearing and um so sometimes when you want to be a little bit more careful it's just like okay well wait a second you know I need to do a little bit more to make sure whatever so um anyway all this is to say that um I definitely actually feel that one of the takeaways would be that hey you guys journalism is valuable and um we shouldn't shy away from you know when people have critical coverage there's nothing wrong with that and you know there is a danger when you have um places like these Tech firms or whatever that are like we only want to put out positive stuff about it so therefore we're going to like control the message and we're going to have our own companies media outlets and our own Publications like I think there's a danger in that and that was on display with the Sequoia no no okay so first of all nobody reads Sequoia to get their coverage of sandbagment freed right they were reading the cover of Forbes they were reading the covered Fortune that's not true that's definitely not true I I I I can definitely tell you that there's a lot of people who are LPS in Sequoia for instance will probably read that and say hey oh sure and then then they'll try to enter the route to Ontario Ontario pension fund entered that way they they entered because they LPD in a bunch of funds who had invested in B1 and they entered to see because they so so I I would definitely push back on that not being read it is definitely it definitely influences people it's just not doesn't influence people like you or me I don't know what to do I see this money treadmill and I'm sitting on this Kepler to allocate where do I go where do I go where do I go oh Sequoia said this I'm going to go right that there's there's some truth to that okay look here's what I'll say okay so first of all it is not the responsibility of the media and I don't want to be misconstrued as saying that the media should have figured out the same was a fraud right of course not nobody knew that Sam was a fraud even the people who diligence him did not know that he was a fraud because he was hiding it that's what makes it even the people who worked like you know at a high level in FTX and Alameda yeah exactly and so that that is not the responsibility of the media or even of the people who are dding him if their DD was sufficient if their GD was not sufficient then it's on them we don't know we don't know what they were shown if they were shown fraudulent documents or if they're if they're like if there were forgeries involved we still don't have that information yet okay um I'm not saying that the media is responsible for playing somebody up into the narrative that they were clearly feeding them right and Sam was was leaning into this thing he was on the cover of billboards he was getting into TV commercials initially it wasn't that way right initially it was just FTX and Sam realized His Image was so powerful and it was working so well that he just leaned into it and started doing everything media wise right I also don't I mean I don't blame Sequoia for marketing their deals like that's their job their VC they're supposed to Market their entrepreneurs the the problem is that now that we know that Sam is a fraud that the media is now totally reversing the story right with with Elizabeth Holmes it was different Elizabeth Holmes uh the VCS were actually against Elizabeth Holmes the VCS didn't buy in the theranos it was all these like random investors who didn't really know what the hell they were doing that were investing the theranos and believe the story right that is a place where I think the media was more liable because the media built up this narrative that allowed all these much less sophisticated investors uh coming into The Fray in in Sam's case it was way at all in Sam's case it was very sophisticated actors who got bamboos one thing I just want to you know I at one point I just want to make is that we're saying the media but it was also the media that exposed Elizabeth Holmes you know John Kerry Rose journals and even before then Ken Aletta and the New Yorkers so you know like there's I mean just any reporter will tell you like when you approach a story sometimes it's like oh hey I gotta write a thousand words and whatever and like then you're only going to spend whatever you know a day or two or something and then other times it's like okay I have 8 000 words I'm gonna spend like you know six weeks two months whatever so like when we say the media um yeah it's just like I'm not gonna blame like somebody who literally spent two days writing about theranos or you know Sam or whatever um and again I'm not I'm not claiming that you know individual people and media responsible for writing things about about Elizabeth Holmes but like the reality is that in the valley people were broadly skeptical of theranos for a long time as he was as she was you know that company was continued to get funded um that wasn't true for fds right there weren't people hanging around saying hey I think this thing is a fraud you're absolutely right that okay the coindesk leads to the the the balance sheet of Alameda but again that had that had nothing to do with fraud it was just that okay Alameda is over leveraged right that was that was what that that told people and then uh CZ announced that he was going to sell a bunch of ftt and again even CZ almost certainly did not think that Sam had lent out customer funds to elementa otherwise he probably would not have done that because he ended up you know knocking down the entire industry and setting us back by by So Long by revealing this massive fraud right he probably did not want to do that at and so I think what what really happened was that the thing just unraveled and obviously this this leak of element is balance she has something to do with it but it was just that the LIE got too big that's what caused this thing to unravel it was not any single person or any single Insight from anyone that caused this thing to unravel it was just this kind of perfect storm that that that caused the whole thing to come crumbling down if if Sam had successfully raised 4 billion in that you know midnight on on Monday then maybe we wouldn't be talking about this maybe we would still be walking around assuming that FTX was still perfectly fine I I think I would disagree with that for a couple of reasons one is there was sort of like clear sort of accounting fraud like uh attributes to most of the revealed balance sheet I think if if we really Mark to Market liquidity adjusted almost all the assets like they're down much more than what is stated and the way that like I think it was being represented to people that were trying to fundraise from was that oh I we owned you know everything was marked to the fdv value and I think there's a lot of elements but even for FTX like because they're think about this the serum portion of the balance sheet I mean that was they were marking that to 2.1 billion dollars there was no way that was worth 2.1 billion dollars but the coindust article was not super deep right because they also mentioned that hey we're discounting stuff that is illiquid um you know they alluded that fact they didn't talk about what liabilities consisted of the liabilities I'm saying like let's look at the balance sheet that it is that we've seen now yeah the balance sheet now I totally agree with you if you go backwards in hindsight that four billion dollars he would have raised would have just gone to propping up that balance sheet to try to even get it back to the level just be clear I'm not saying that it wouldn't eventually have Unwound right if you are nine if you're eight billion dollars in the hole you're gonna you're it's gonna fall through at some point right uh it may be later but there's no way you're going to make back four billion dollars of cash to pay back your customers eventually right it's just not I mean they made 400 million last year in net profit which was one of the most legendary years for crypto trading ever so I completely agree with you it would eventually Unwound but we wouldn't have heard about it now we would we would still be walking around thinking that FTX was fine I don't think I don't think that would have been totally true because we it even if the bailout succeeded there was already this notion that there was some trouble on the balance sheet that you already had to have this thing happen and and eventually that would basically force people to to want much more tight accounting and and I think at that point you would have you would have found that it was effectively accounting fraud like very similar to Enron I actually all the people are comparing this to Lehman I don't think that's like apt comparison I think Enron had a lot of like weird Securities that they also marked in in Bizarro ways like and that their auditor was kind of stupid to understand and like I'll meet FTX basically and Almeda treated all these centralized lenders as The Idiot auditor which you know arguably was true but I I think there's a sense in which there was like clearly a lot of accounting fraud and like the thing you're saying that Kyle told you in summer is is effectively admitting to that right it's effectively admitting to like we're just doing accounting fraud on these on these tokens in in a way because like there is not a gap measurement for them um and you know governments are going to be extremely slow to seeing this but yeah it's very easy to get into a bad leverage cycle so my point is I I even at the four billion if it got bailed out I think there would have been some some sort of Day of Reckoning very soon not not very long because like that type of hole is incredibly unsustainable I mean you can just see it in the serum and ftt Order books like it was just there was clearly just someone buying anything and taking every price and I I wonder if like perhaps Alameda in the run-up last year their Market making strategies got less and less sophisticated because they didn't really have to be because everything was going up so even though they're buying you know even though they're quoting they're quoting the cell Direction and everything's going up the cell Direction wasn't that much they're making more in fees and technically and like FTX was because it was sort of like if you look at them as a single unit was like making more money by taking their loss that subsidy suddenly becomes extremely bad when you have to cover everyone trying to get out of Luna simultaneously and you haven't changed your Market making strategy and you're sort of obligated to the parent company now does that make make all the losses make sense I don't know like if you add up the total UST volume on FTX and assume that say you know 10 to 25 was filled by Almeda on the other side as a loss you still don't get to the numbers we see which is why I think they had to have some leverage crisis with the centralized lenders like there's something very very fishy about the sunrise lenders and understanding what collateral they still hold uh is really going to be crucial to this yeah we're going to learn all that stuff I think very slowly over the next over the next year or two as many years I mean if you go by enron's timeline it took forever so that's true that's true and you can see from the corporate structure of FTX which was like this gigantic spider web of entities across many different countries that this is going to take a very long time to unwind trading firms are often structured like that I think the biggest um possible malfeasance on the part of the Venture investors was the Venture investors didn't ask for the following they or maybe they did and just got told to [ __ ] off as you were saying earlier which is you normally when you invest in sort of a group of companies like that you you from a governance standpoint you ask for a a holding company you know like Berkshire Hathaway holding company of many sub companies like that you ask for a holding company and you invest in the holding company with some rights associate teacher these entities and from what I can tell I don't actually know if any Venture investor actually knew the entire set of of entities that existed part one part two uh I think like the idea of investing in any one of them and like making its valuation really large suddenly means the other ones can sort of like borrow against the valuation of that in in sort of some weird ways implicitly or explicitly via transfers that are made and Loans between entities and I suspect that actually kept things propped up quite a bit longer than you might have realized versus like if it had a holding company and like everything had to fall at once it's like and that to me was always the weirdest part about that about that fundraising round was like people were like would be like yeah we invest in FTX and then they forced us to invest in FTX us and I was like wait so there's no holding company invested in you invested in these things separately and they're like yeah they're probably some other entities but like they don't matter and like people were very blase about the the work the the spider web chart in a way that like I was like okay I don't know what you invested in because it doesn't sound like you know what you invested yeah so I guess that's the other question so so first thing I want to say is that I don't I don't believe in the concept of collective guilt and so I don't believe there's such a thing as the media is responsible or that the VCS are responsible but it's pretty clear that some individual VCS in this process enabled this and that other VCS like ourselves who maybe you know didn't speak out about things that we didn't agree with may also bear some of the responsibility for what happened instead of what Sam became in the industry um this is something I've been thinking a lot about over the weekend we didn't invest in Sam obviously we haven't had we had Sam on the show we were we were friendly-ish with him you know we were on we would chat about things occasionally and occasionally we find ourselves in rounds together because you would invest into a lot of stuff I I never suspected Sam of anything like this and um I I found him to be an impressive person like when I chatted with him he seemed very smart he seemed very shrewd he seemed very capable I didn't agree with the way that he ran FTX I didn't agree with the relationship between FTX and Alameda you know we work in an industry where there's all sorts of [ __ ] that's going on that you're not going to agree with and if you if you nope your way out of everything that you you find untoward or that you're uncomfortable with you're just not going to be able to do anything in this industry besides just hold Bitcoin so I um I don't know I'm curious what you guys think about Let's ignore individual VCS because I mean we could do that all day and it's kind of a stupid thing to do because they're doing that enough themselves is what do you think about VCS on the whole and um the extent to which VCS or VC culture enabled this to happen I I think just a byproduct of of the market to an extent right like this is so if you think about like ftx's rise it was 2020 and 2021 when everything Tech was just getting money thrown at it at crazy valuations and that's naturally what's going to happen in that kind of environment when you have you know too too much Capital chasing too few opportunities um and so naturally one way you can discriminate on capital is due diligence and through branding um and the capital letters and ask questions as we saw with the small thing is going to get more access than not that sort of baked into the price I think the thing that I mean it's maybe obvious to say about FTX is so sad is Not only was this Enterprise Value destroyed which you know that is the risk that you bear investing in in Venture investing in making any sort of investment but it's the customer deposits and the user deposits that that also evaporated right like uh what was it the uh it was the electric car company that just got charged with fraud um Nicola um I'm Nicola Nicola Nicola Nicola yeah Nicola okay a lot of people lost their money but they knew kind of explicitly what they were doing right they're they're speculating on this electric car company stock or you know hey you bought bird scooters and bird scooters and now what like 20 million dollars something like that okay but you kind of know what you're doing here it's it's basically the commingling of these different types of you know investors or customers and and the loss there that I think is just like staggering it and sets it aside from I think a lot of these other you know Venture failures in the past two years yeah so so I think I guess this gets back to my point in the the beginning of the show I was like there are three entities here three sort of operations that on their own individually assuming that there's like rational actors trading on them or arbitraging things are totally valid businesses one you know one being the exchange making fees one being a market maker and one being a lender lending against Equity or tokens the problem is if you combine them in the right way such that there's no one arbing the spreads between them you get you get this like Ponzi scheme and it's like very it's it's not this is why the idea of like investing in like pieces of this big thing actually it can be deleterious because you actually basically fund this like Ponzi like the incentives to make make this like Ponzi like thing I mean it really was a Ponzi scheme at the end of the day because it's like very hard to see any other way of describing the idea of taking new customer funds and lending it to yourself to then prop up this token that is you know implicitly paying off the new customer fund uh and the value transfer to early ftt and serum holders I think the idea that that was not transparent to the depositors is probably the biggest frustration especially relative to something like D5 we're like that you can you can see when that happens like there's there's no way to hide that and like all this proof of Reserve stuff is right at the moment kind of a charade because it's actually quite hard to guarantee the liability side of this especially if there's leverage involved because you actually don't know all the counterparts you don't unless all the counterparts are D5 protocols which then reduces to like okay the D5 Protocols are the only ones that guarantee you public revelation of of liabilities and assets right like every everything else is relying on some notion of tagged addresses and you know there's a little still a little trust me bro aspect to that even the even even all these things that try to do liability matching um you know they're all these like awesome ZK protocols for doing it but none of them can deal with like a derivatives exchange they all assume that they're they're giving you proofs of assets and liabilities on the spot instrument none of them can handle the derivative instrument and so I I think that that's something that D5 is like the only thing that's ever existed to guarantee that yeah well until everything is in D5 which is Gonna Knock it up anytime soon we still need to trust people we need to trust operators we need to trust the people who are building these companies to be who they say they are and Sam was not that and I guess like to me it comes back to the question is like should we have not should people in the industry have known should the VCS have known again we don't we don't actually know enough yet we're still kind of in the fog of War all this stuff is coming out now everybody who's ever had a gripe with Sam is now going on Twitter and telling their story and it now kind of seems like the story is that you should have known and I think this is probably not exactly right um I think like as far as I know Sam was not a he was not somebody who people were going around saying I think he's a scammer I think he's stealing money I think he's you know embezzling funds from FDX customer deposits you know people had different gripes with him that he was Cavalier that he was mercenary that he was a dick um but I don't know anybody who seriously claimed that he was stealing money I mean there's this thing that's happening now that I think you know uh one of the big Twitter accounts is covering this was talking about that you know anybody who now has a relationship with Sam or had a relationship with Sam it's kind of like uh it's kind of like uh being in a picture with like just Lane Maxwell you know was like at the time like they were they were just a normal person who like kind of made the rounds and like everybody's interviewed him and stuff like we've had him on the show you know like you've had you've you've had him on Unchained multiple times he's been on every single podcast he's been on odd Lots he's been you know he's met with uh Bill Clinton and with uh Tony Blair and blah blah blah like everybody has been around this guy the question is like do do you think I mean pour one out for Tom Brady I feel like didn't he actually invest money like I thought this was like yeah he did yeah for like 50 million it was crazy I mean he's had a rough year he Tom Tom Brady's here I feel like but no I I especially like what do you guys think because I feel like this is so much of what Twitter is doing now is there obsessing over every single thing that anyone has ever said about Sam I mean imagine imagine if if uh the fact that like all the Enron uh execs were like really good friends with George Bush existed and you had Twitter around that time you'd have social media would have done the same thing I think this is basically like what does Enron plus social media look like hmm which is a new immersion effect yeah I actually want to address uh the earlier question before we talk about before I um you know add something on this but um going back to the VC issue like I kind of tweeted about this yesterday but another thing that I keep thinking about is Fred ursum is a co-founder of coinbase and Paradigm invested in FTX and so there's just something there where I'm like so I don't know you guys tell me when you're a VC what kind of relationship do you have with your portfolio company because I'm a little bit like either Fred knew nothing about what was going on at FTX in terms of the setup and the security and all these other things I mentioned or um he did and like couldn't you know influence Sam I like it just does not compute to me that those two people could have had a relationship around building this company and that FTX would just be so so so so so so so so so different from how coinbase operates it like there's just something I find so strange about that well the first thing is that so remember a Fred so okay I I don't know so I'm gonna I'm gonna just speculate basically so first let me let me copy it with that so the first thing is that you know Fred was building a domestic Exchange in the US which was U.S regulated Sam is building an overseas Exchange in the Bahamas that was servicing International clients which just means the standards are very different for the level of compliance and and you know the things you have to do second is that remember this FTX grew during covet and so people you couldn't just you know go fly to the Bahama he was in Hong Kong originally right with FTX started in Hong Kong moved to the Bahamas I think last year um I think like mid to late last year and so um you can go to these places without doing a long quarantine so VCS were not going doing on-site so nobody was going into the Bahama molecule and checking to see if they were like having proper controls from you know how the private keys were stored they were just getting on Zoom calls and asking them and they would take whatever they said as answers because like what else are you gonna do right you're not gonna go fly there and like you know go join the polycule and figure out what's really happening so the the reality is that like VC always operates on trust the first time people went was the SALT conference which is like that is also like a crazy thing right they look back at that yeah yes uh it's been a bizarre year the marriage of scaramucci and and Sam at that time seemed very counter-intuitive to me but now it actually does seems like it almost is like a a perfectly written sonnet I mean Sam was just so shrewd in buying access so you know he he bought access in terms of the you know the US in donating being the second biggest donor to uh Joe Biden's campaign uh being a massive donor to a bunch of um you know Democratic candidates across the U.S you have the Miami Heat stadium F1 sponsorships like all this stuff that just like brought him attention and notoriety that didn't necessarily result in in um uh you know customers right it's not clear that any of this stuff had a part of a positive Roi and they clearly you can see from the balance sheet they weren't making it back in trading fees so they didn't have the profits to show for it but they were spending hundreds of millions of dollars onto frivolous nonsense that just increased their name increase their ability to ultimately borrow money and leverage themselves and and that's what it buys you one of the craziest just like hearsay rumor stories I heard and like I have no way of validating this so but I think it'll be funny to share on this podcast is um how do you think you know someone like Sam Actually convinced Tom Brady or met Tom Brady to you know invest join whatever well he has an agent and his agent uh and this is the part I can't verify owned a tequila brand kilo company and supposedly the agent was like yo if you buy my tequila company I will introduce you to Tom Brady and like help make this thing happen and they bought this tequila company for 50 million dollars to do that and I again I have no way of verifying this but I've heard this from four separate people wow and I heard it way before this happened like I heard it like in January and February but like I think I think there was a lot of that when you're talking about pay to play it's like you're to buy the agent's external company for them to like introduce you wow well get ready depositors you're gonna be we're gonna see what that um tequila company is worth so we can try to make you whole oh my god well my agent ever did anything like that there's always there's always there's always money in the tequila bottle it's the new there's always money in the banana oh my God oh my God okay well in in um one of the things that uh people so back in I think one of our previous shows we were talking about how Sam was buying up uh all these distressed lenders and I came out and defended him and I said hey you know uh like everyone I said something like hey SPF is like buying stuff or he's backstopping the industry and you know you should give respect what respects do for doing that because you know nobody else is doing it and people started jumping on me yesterday saying like you know look you're you're saying Sam is so great like look at you you're in bed with this guy I was like okay so I just deleted the Tweet because I'm like okay I I feel stupid now for having tweeted that to begin with but I I feel like this this um I feel like Sam is just gonna become like a ghost now where everybody is kind of going through and scrubbing everything they've ever said about him it's almost like it's almost like a ritual I feel like that everybody is being forced to do is disassociate themselves with him as far as they can I don't want to delete the episode where we interviewed Sam because I think it's a it's an important Moment In Time although it was a terrible episode because he was in a hotel and you know his internet was terrible it was really bad but um speaking of deleting episodes Lex Friedman deleted his uh I saw that in the castle episode and I thought okay let's talk about okay so let's talk about this let's talk about this so um so one of the one of the the key things of course that that uh the media loved marketing about Sam was that he was an effective altruist so for those who don't know effective altruism is a movement of basically I mean I think actually 200 I would probably disagree on the definition of effective altruism uh but it's a movement that uh is is characterized by people like uh will mccaskill um Holden karnovsky who's the founder of givewell uh Peter Singer and then most most famously and most recently Sam Megan freed um who was probably one of the most famous names we should also allow for the fact that finger is a very famous philosopher for the last 50 years and he has done many other things he just happens to be mildly Associated I would say he runs the life he can save which is one of the largest EA Charities which sure I was I was on a panel for the last two years with Sam and Caroline with Peter Singer on a panel that they ran and I moderated it last night so like no no this Peter Singer is an effective altruist he is very much okay yeah by the way I'm not an effective altruist and now that I've learned a little bit more about it I'm like uh this this is not for me okay so but anyway so we we should talk about this so now um so in the in the eyes of the media at this point Sam became the most famous effect of altruist and of course the mythology around him was that he was this kind of saint-like figure he was going to donate 99 of his wealth he had absolutely you know he was basically living in this crappy t-shirt sleeping on bean bags blah blah you know we just got uh driving a car driving a Toyota Corolla you know Tick-Tock loved his story about this selfless billionaire guy and then it was in um he was he I think he was a board member of the Center for Effective altruism for like three four years the big donor to give a lot of EA Charities uh and he started uh what was called the FTX future fund that um they were one of the largest donors I think they committed over a billion dollars to donate to um effective altruists aligned Charities let's say um and then Alameda research itself I think they'd pledged like 50 of their earnings annually they were they were going to donate to charity and so it was from the very beginning what animated Sam and what kind of brought him on his mission to get into crypto actually to even become a Trader so the reason why he went to Jane Street and became a traitor after originally studying math at uh at MIT was that uh he was convinced that he wanted to earn to give the earning to give is this concept in in effective altruism which is basically this idea that you pursue a high earning career so that you can redirect those funds into high impact Charities and the idea is that you can potentially have more impact with your giving than you can with many kinds of direct work and this was this was an idea that was very popular back in 2013 2014 and the effect of autism movement um and and this was explicitly what Sam was doing and now of course the the most famous name associated with effective altruism has been very publicly disgraced is now going to go down as one of the legendary fraudsters of Our Generation and uh basically EA the effect of altruism as a movement is now being indicted and so you've got a lot of people writing op-eds a lot of people dissociating themselves with the movement you know a lot of people looking like they have egg on their faces and I should also say so I'm somebody I self-identify as an effective altruist I've been a part of the movement since 2013. I actually knew Sam I first met Sam at 25th in 2015 before he got into crypto before I got into crypto at an EA conference in San Francisco back when he was still at Jane Street because Sam was a big EA guy and you know everybody everybody in sort of EA World knew his name I didn't know him very well I met him once in a hallway and we chatted for a little bit and that was it but um but I I myself am somebody who have been earning to give I've been doing it for uh basically seven years since I got into the tech industry I don't donate 99 of my wealth they donate 33 but so this is something that's very you know to me tarun you've been very public in basically in your indictment of effective altruism as a movement and you basically think that um this stuff is all [ __ ] I want you to to kind of voice your concerns and I want to try to address them and also kind of respond as best I can I think I do have a a long track record of of writing anti-ea stuff for a long time but I I feel like I should have been more militant after seeing this uh the last few weeks but I think the main conceit I find with most of most EA stuff is and and sort of in general consequentialism uh as a philosophical movement is you always have to start with the Axiom that the ends just by the means to argue that you're optimizing utility in some ways and you're not even able to construct an explicit utility function you just are saying like hey I'm gonna like try to optimize this type of thing of like how I'm doing how I'm allocating my my wealth or how I'm donating or how I'm doing whatever and I think first of all there's no consensus telling utility function second the idea that you say it ends justifies the means means that okay well then like you might as well just like kill a ton of humans to lower costs right like there's actually this like level of inhumanity in in the entire philosophy of this thing that it would rather pay money now so there's at least the long-termest part of EA so long-termism is a dollar spent to improve the welfare of people a thousand years in the future is worth more than a dollar spent to improve the welfare of someone now and people who have that mindset would rather sacrifice tons of people right now the welfare of those people their livelihoods their ability to to live in a a meaningful manner because of this idea that oh I'm going to help infinitely many people in the future there's going to be more people in the future so like the net utility Improvement for each person in the future is higher and the conceit in that is that you a haven't found the discount rate like because you have to Discount some amount of success you assume you there exists no discount rate that's this linear utility type of mindset the second thing is that when you use this ends just for as a means thing you inevitably have this thing where it's like you you run into the trolley problem style thing of like oh do I just like am I willing to to kill one person to save five and you know oftentimes you know the utility Optimizer just says yes right but there is this notion and like EA people you can see in mccaskill is like really shitty apology on Twitter which is like five too little too late in my mind uh that basically yeah oh we've written we've written four blog posts in our history that that give you some way of saying that actually we have one way of getting around the ends just by the means when it comes to robbing you know kind of like unethical behavior and most of that comes from the following conceited assumption which is assume that all humans who are editing this utility optimization thing are running an untrustworthy Hardware so they make mistakes then you can't actually make a a utility judgment that affects them based on uh you know like normal utility optimization they always make this base of like oh if the AI did it they can do this but the human does it uh you should have some correction and to me that's just saying you chose the wrong [ __ ] utility function and that means you're you're just like oh uh after I guess like after we already [ __ ] up something I guess we're gonna like bolt on this correction and the idea that there's this idea that you you don't face any consequences for this post-hoc x-post kind of Correction to your behavior I I feel like that's not how most societies operate and that's not that's not how human interaction is meant to to exist if you're if you're actually trying to have some notion of of equality or humanity and it's very funny for a [ __ ] philosophy that starts with all pain is equal as its initial kind of Dogma you know that's a Peter Singer Dogma somehow leads to this like oh we're just gonna like not be that equal and then like bolt on all this this episode and I find that stuff to be the most deleterious part about it and it's like I don't mind robbing grannies now because I'm going to like help the children teacher and that that mindset is pervasive amongst a lot of people especially in the what I would call the Oxford Jane Street Dustin Moskowitz part of EA okay so let me let me let me let me let me try to try to respond to some of that so the first thing I'll say is that um so I I've been in EA or sort of self-identified EA since like 2013 2014. and um back then the movement was very small like it was this kind of weird set of ideas that I'd read on blogs on the internet and I agreed with them I thought they made sense um and I I thought it was a a it felt to me like the right way to orient my life and my relationship with work and with my responsibility as a human being to uh give back and not kind of take for granted this idea that as one of the most privileged people on Earth and being privileged not just in the sense of like okay well you know I have uh I don't know the way that people usually think of privilege is like oh male or whatever um but more that like I'm American I can work here I speak fluent English I'm pretty intelligent um that puts me in like the one percent of the world that has all these capabilities that allow me and I have access to like some of the most incredible wealth engines in world history which is Silicon Valley or just the general tech industry which most people even if they're smart enough they don't get to have access to the the jobs and the wealth that are created by it and um the the core idea of you know that Peter Singer really originally awakened me to is this unfairness of it and that is your job it is your moral responsibility even if Society doesn't tell you that it's your responsibility it is your responsibility to do something to correct that unfairness and now you know EA is a pretty loose concept and it's increasingly become more you can call it a movement and you can call it a philosophy I would say I subscribe more to the philosophy than the movement I'm not a part of the movement in the sense that I don't go you know last time I went to that conference was 2015. um which was seven years ago I stopped going because I'm like okay these are kind of weird and I'm not getting a lot out of this um because I'm just working I'm just doing stuff I'm not going around thinking about EA all the time it's just a it's a it's a life philosophy more than a culture now the culture of EA um I I haven't been very publicly outspoken about it but I've always found it um surprisingly incompetent so we've never I've never funded anyone from EA I kind of wanted to like in my mind I was kind of like okay I feel like maybe it's a good thing to fund somebody using EA but every a I've ever come across has just always struck me as either like extremely Machiavellian or very incompetent in ways that are very difficult to explain to them how they're so incompetent and it's just ranking there have been so few success cases of people who are EAS who managed to like really be very successful uh Sam was kind of the one example that seemed like a real outside success in EA and um now that being said like this whole idea that EAS are are married to this like um kind of Ruthless cold utilitarian calculus I think it's just it's just not true um that may be true if you're reading the EA forum and people are arguing about these philosophical debates but it's kind of like you know there's no EA there are no EAS in a foxhole right in reality you go out you take care of your family you like are nice people on the street you kind of do normal things and then when you are considering how you give and how you have kind of you know sort of career level impact or life level impact then I think to me the velocity of EA I don't think it it I don't think it commits you to utilitarian or is it more consequentialism to me what EA commits you to is this idea that people should be rigorous about the way in which they do good and that most people are not rigorous enough and that ironically we are very rigorous about business we're very rigorous about technology we're very rigorous about statistics and about macro and about all these other things but for somehow the the thing that's most important that we do with our lives which is improving the well-being of others people are incredibly unrigorous and they appeal entirely to their emotions and how good something sounds and they don't they don't even attempt to give the same level of kind of mathematical seriousness and inquiry to those questions now that doesn't again I don't think it commits you to saying okay we have to spend all our money on existential risk I don't do that and I don't think it convinced you to saying okay we have to send all our money to bed nets I would say the the fact that anthropic has 500 million dollars from FTX is like an indictment of this this thing right it's like I robbed the grannies to like do AI safety that's literally what they [ __ ] did they robbed the grannies the pension fund people the people whose LP Capital was in this [ __ ] place and they gave it to this thing that was like oh like we're gonna say give people from AI that tries to kill you 10 000 years in the future like to me that's the morally rep principle there are that that's just like it's just like [ __ ] stupid and that is like the dumbest [ __ ] thing I've ever seen and I I that's why I'm in general find this like morally bankrupt Theory just leads to creating Psychopaths like it leads to it leads to incentivizing people to not care wait Laura actually yeah sorry Laura go ahead yeah I I actually um so like my so yes I I barely knew uh anything about affection altruism but what I you know learned from covering Sam is that you know he I maybe he took it further than you who see like somehow when you were articulating and it seemed like basically reasonable but I do wonder if he took it to a sort of an extreme right like I've never heard you say you know I just want to make as much money as possible to give as much of it away to other people right but like Sam you know maybe not using those words I don't remember but like I somehow got that impression from him and so when I interviewed him recently I mean the way I phrased this was just around the political donations but it's something that I was wondering and you could express it in a slightly different way which I'll get to in a moment but I asked him when you are making your political donations is your motivation your EA philosophy or is it to Foster crypto the crypto industry in the US like to to help the crypto industry and he basically said it was like for EA purposes um and so you know when you have this person who is working in this field but their values are not necessarily aligned with that industry like like his guiding lights were not like around decentralization or whatever it was really around the aea thing it's like his attitude to this was more like I'm going to use the crypto industry to for this other goal and um I could see how you know when you're thinking more in that way it could lead you to do really crazy things like take your customer funds and use the loan that to Alameda basically I mean I pointed that you know I don't know what was in his head but it's just something that occurred to me because I feel like a true cryptic person you know after living through you know all these exchange hacks or whatever they would like they would protect that stuff they wouldn't you know just be Cavalier with it and you know I don't think that's even much of a theory I mean they had the big ads with Sam on the front saying I'm in crypto to do the most good for the most people which makes no [ __ ] sense like that has nothing to do like [ __ ] Coke from this like oh the Corolla guy like lives in the 75 million dollar Penthouse and like like that that [ __ ] [ __ ] like oh if you're really that effective at donating [ __ ] don't live in the 75 million political house like you know there's like a lot of stuff that they spent money on that just completely violates the dogma of all the [ __ ] they're saying like why will you buy that ad that money from the ad could have bought mosquito Nets [ __ ] like that's like the that's what I'm saying like oh you're not even listening to all the [ __ ] you're saying you're just high on your own Supply like the more I thought about it when I was like granted like I've met ever researched this I was literally only trying to understand it for this interview with him but I just was like oh weirdly and it goes back to what tarun was saying about the one killing the one person versus the five I was like oh like if you follow that philosophy you are going to end up in like making very weird choices that take you out of a very conventional morality and I like there was just something where I was like oh like if you're thinking that way it just like it like it's um it's hard to explain but it's like um when somebody gets so hyper rational and they're like only thinking like in this mathematical way it just kind of takes them out of the human sphere and that is kind of I feel like maybe what happened here it was actually a pretty good thread that someone dug up about with Sam basically talking about the killer Criterion which is this formula that helps you think about how to size your bets based on the expected value of like a bet and basically people are now digging it up and sort of it's sort of interesting glimpse into how he thinks and the journal sort of you know tell here is that he talks about is utility function being sort of log money which is you know generally it's going to be like the max you're supposed to be getting out of uh your utility function in the Kelly Criterion but also then therefore lets you justify basically you know wagering large amounts of money once you have large amounts of money for something that is not going to necessarily pay off if like there's some chance that you're gonna make a trillion dollars because it's basically the same amount of utility that you have right now and I think that is maybe kind of what you see in like the outcome from FDX is like you know wagering larger and larger amounts because you're assuming there's some you know massive payoff that's not going to be particularly different well here's where I take issue with this okay so so one I I agree with you that there's something clearly um there's something clearly messed up in the kind of the the warship of asceticism around Sam right I think there was something very unhealthy about it and it was there from the very beginning at Alameda because it was fake like a lot of it was not real I mean it was it was not it was not fake right like if you if you look at what they were doing from the Alameda days and what he was doing while he was at Jane Street he was doing this in EA from the very beginning I mean from the last year the last year the last year was Wednesday cleared in the last year he was worth 30 billion dollars if you're really an aesthetic with linear utility you should you should you should be scaling your asceticism by not changing not like making ads of yourself in every San Francisco like there's a lot of stuff that's crazy the Twitter uh stuff uh you know when like Elon musk's tweets uh came out and like mccaskill was in there trying to the Costco's just trying to be in the the capital formation game not the the actual redistribution game in the same way that Sam is and they both you know reputation laundered each other and in general I think like we're kind of trying to be like oh well you know what was true three years ago must still be applied as an invariant but what we saw in the last year was malfeasance and malevolence let me finish let me finish okay so I I have still not totally internalized like what did EA get wrong here and I totally agree with you that clearly um some of the folks who are at the center of the EA movement particularly will mccaskill tied their fate to Sam and they and they found him incredibly convenient at a time when there apparently uh so I was reading about this some today or last night in the uh EA forums that there were a lot of people internally at EA who had a lot of criticisms with Sam and felt that he was a Machiavellian person that he had a reputation for being very unfair and very manipulative to people um but they ignored it supposedly this is this is what now people are saying but again I I don't totally trust this just because this is the kind of thing that always happens when somebody gets kind of publicly shamed and bad things happen is that everybody comes out and says I knew it all along and I always had this you know whatever so these these claims get Amplified in times like this it'll be a while until we get a better accounting of who actually said what when and who thought what when so I I don't know I still need to prosper myself if I want to distance myself from effective altruism as a cultural as a culture as a cultural movement as opposed to as a philosophy right what any particular person does obviously does not indict a philosophy a philosophy is a philosophy you have to you have to argue on the philosophy not not some particular person who practices it but effective autism is not just a philosophy it's also a movement it's a social movement and it's a it's also an organization of people and uh that organization of people may have made some pretty massive mistakes I haven't paid a whole lot of attention to it because I'm like you know I'm in crypto all day and so this is all I do the other thing that I want to say though is that I I really do want to take issue with this idea that it was effective altruism that caused Sam to you know embezzle funds or whatever the hell he did okay we know why people embezzle money they do it every it doesn't matter whether effective authors or not people do it because they're scared or they're greedy that's the answer it has nothing to do with effective altars there's nothing to do with going to MIT nothing to do with being a Trader um this is the oldest story in human history we don't need to appeal to any complex philosophy or social organizations to understand why people do the [ __ ] they do when they're cornered the answer is that Sam felt the need to bail himself out because he was scared and that is what we need to impugn that is that is what we need to that is what we need to repudiate I think trying to mentalize and say he did it because he's an effect of altruist and he was going to save the granny blah blah blah blah if anthropic was not on their balance sheet I would agree with you the Antarctic is the ultimate thing that proves that like anthopic is literally like EA porn company right that's true I would agree with you if he made that investment to anthropic with customer funds but we don't know when any of this happened we have no idea of the timeline yeah well also you know almost two billion dollars is missing apparently so who knows where where the donation came from but one thing I will say is like you know when you talk about that moment where it's either gonna be greed or fear that motivates you I mean like he could have very well just said okay Alameda failed we're gonna announce this you know I have this other profitable business I don't need this other business and so I actually feel that EA did play a role in the sense that he's like oh well if I make this bet and I can like you know earn the greatest amount for whatever you know like like it's not because I feel like just like a normal entrepreneur would have kind of looked at it in a cold way and just been like okay this one you know we're just gonna have to close it up it just it's you know in in the red and then but the other one this can be a healthy business there are tons of exchanges that do very well but because his goal is to just make as much money as possible to give it away I feel like that is what made him you know like like I said before it's like going back to that notion that EA is what drove his principles rather than like a cryptic person because I feel like a crypto person Laura Laura this is the most fraudulent industry I have ever seen in my life are you really claiming that a normal crypto person here would not like literally exchanges are the Bastion of fraud of everywhere every possible business a more pure crypto entrepreneur maybe than is the phrasing you know he does like let's put like but you you admit though if he had just done that he could have definitely had a very successful business with FTX right of course of course yeah elementa would go under if he would lose a lot of face he would lose a lot of money but right TX would still fundamentally be fine right I again we don't know what happened or when it happened but here's what here's what I will also say okay the the reason why this happened like the real like you sort of you know do the five wise right like okay why did this happen why was that allowed to happen um the answer should be that there should have been a [ __ ] board and a [ __ ] CFO that would not have allowed any of this to happen even if Sam wanted to do it right at a normal company the CEO does not have the choice there is no okay in a moment of Crisis you look deep inside and decide okay how many utils do I want to save out of you know the far future or whatever that's not even a question that enters into most CEO's mind because they know they can't and that's part of the problem here with FTX and that's what I'm that's why I'm pointing to the VCS and the governance here is because the fact that this was possible is the problem right you should not allow a human in a moment of fear to be able to make a decision about billions of dollars of customers money that's the problem no I'm all I'm saying is that since those structures weren't in place and we all admit that the rational choice would be to say okay we're going to close up Alameda but FTX we're going to keep going with that that's working he didn't make that choice and it's weird like why why did he not do that and the only way I can think about it is like I said about this kind of other philosophy of his that he said was his guiding philosophy where he was like if I make this bet and I can't remember in the Sequoia article he has something about where he talks about like Risk in this way and you could see like following you know that what he says in there like oh yeah like you might try to make this big bet to try to make all this money like I don't know that that was my read on it because otherwise it doesn't make sense I mean it's possible Right but like the other thing is that he's a traitor and as a Trader especially as a very highly leveraged Trader clearly throughout most of his career this was what he's this is what he did apparently in the early days when Alameda blew up that's what happened is they took on a bunch of Leverage and it blew up and so like the he it's it's not as though the idea of okay you take on some leverage and you bail yourself out was a foreign concept to him he's a traitor but the concept of where you get the Leverage is the point of actually caring about your business right your utility function should [ __ ] keep your exchange alive not not just think of it as another form of a lender right like and the problem is he he viewed these lenders as such idiots so much that he thought his own company was a stupid lender and and you know like that's that's the morality look I mean one way or another clearly what Sam did was morally absolutely reprehensible but I think the goal of the industry is not to like psychologize and figure out okay what particular idiosyncrasy of his moral beliefs led him to do this great but wait but wait I have a question when you say clearly it was morally reprehensible like according to a common morality but I'm asking when when you're making that rational equation of like ofi you know the risk isn't is this amount but the number of people I could benefit is this amount blah blah that whatever okay so how many people do you think he benefited now as opposed to if he had just left FTX alive and still been a multi-billionaire right so the risk didn't pay off but I'm saying when he made the calculus maybe he thought it was going to pay off that's the only like because this whole thing is so crazy in my head that's like the only way I can imagine he justified it so here's what here's what troubles me about all this is I feel like there's this exoticism about you know because Sam was a utilitarian that every single thing that he did was like you know him laying out this utilitarian calculus in his mind I know plenty of people who utilitarians they don't do that they're normal people but they believe that that is the right moral framework when they're making you know kind of clear-hearted decisions about how to donate money or about how to make big kind of societal level uh decisions okay borrowing from from robbing Peter pay Paul is the same as uh making a donation decision from the perspective of just the the dollars accounting and sense no I don't think there's anybody I know who's a utilitarian who would agree with that when when you're making four billion dollars of loans against dog [ __ ] collateral that you minted I think that it's a very similar I mean yeah okay so it seems like true and you're committed to this idea that utilitarianism commits you to basically committing crimes if they have positive externalities yes okay I I I I don't think there's any utilitarianism my one of the main reasons I say this is all of the logic that I have seen from both mccaskill judkowski and the EA forums involve this post-hoc belief that oh actually we can bolt on the ends don't always justify the means to by by mutating when we say like oh if it involves humans maybe we treat it different than involving AI and it's like no [ __ ] should walk like that's the point of having agreed upon rules and morals and rights in the society so there's a concept of of rule utilitarians which gets around sort of naive utilitarianism I think naive utilitarianism you're right to ruin does commit you to this idea that um if if you're if you do something wrong or deontologically immoral meaning you're breaking some moral law but there's no obvious uh uh like you're not found out for doing it or you just you know the positive fictionalities outweigh the losses yes naive utilitarianism does commit you to that almost nobody who's a utilitarian is a naive utilitarian because it results in these weird trolley problems and all these kind of uh you know these horrific consequences so very few people believe that but but the other thing is I don't think I don't think EA commits you to being any kind of utilitarian right I I wouldn't say that I'm a utilitarian uh I I think I have some kind of weird mishmash of like virtue ethics sometimes I have utilitarian I think on large scales and on small scales I think I'm just like a normal ass person and I follow the rules and that I think is what most EAS actually look like which is why I don't again you know EA as a philosophy in EA as a movement are two very different things and it's very clear EA's movement has a lot of rehabilitating to do and it may be unsalvatable I don't know I haven't spent enough time in that uh Community as of late and I don't really hang out with people who are other EAS because I just do it I don't I don't make it like my Identity or my Social Circle but the the core ideas behind EA I don't think I don't believe they commit you to anything like what Sam did I think what Sam did is that whether he was an EA or not he was a [ __ ] up guy and he had a very loose sense of morals and I don't think it would have mattered if he'd never found EA when he was a young guy I think he probably still would have done some [ __ ] up thing in his life because he clearly just had a loose relationship with the truth and if you are that kind of person it doesn't matter what philosophy you believe right it's about character it's not about philosophy I I don't think there is any philosophy that's going to make you decide to go [ __ ] over all of your customers and lie to everybody you know and run a gigantic fraud like that that is a really messed up philosophy to get any human being to do that and I don't think there is any such thing out there yeah but yeah we don't have to keep arguing this but I think it goes back to the kind of like bet idea like when you have that choice like like when you look at the outcomes you kind of calculate a percentage chance of this or that like that's the only way that I can uh imagine that this happened but I remember at the point that I wanted to make me which is that you know and I tweeted something like this but I do think one of the big takeaways is that Traders should not run exchanges like yes the two mindsets are just not compatible um you know like yeah just now that we've learned all of this I'm like whoa you know and it's what I said I don't want to keep repeating myself but you know just like security should be the first and foremost thing and I heard I saw somebody tweet something about and I I could verify this um because I'm going to have Jesse on the show later but Jesse palette Kraken might have told somebody that one of the red flags that he saw with Sam was that uh or with FTX was that they had a very small security team apparently which that's a red flag for an exchange which makes a lot of sense so Brian Armstrong you know for all the criticism he's got he has a completely different personality from Sam uh I don't think he's a traitor he's definitely more like a builder encoder um and you know just other people with that kind of mindset around security and whatnot like that's the those are the people who should be running centralized exchanges yeah I think um we talked about this a little bit last show but like the the Jesse's and Brian's of the world who started these companies well before anyone thought this industry would turn into anything and really believed in the ethos believe in the promise of the technology um you know I don't think they would have done something like this because obviously it's just so harmful to the industry overall um whereas you have opportunities to come in see it as a great way to make money and I think that does sort of cloud your judgment maybe not explicitly maybe there's not a literal thought around you know the ends justifying the means I think certainly like you know it speaks to your overall incentives well so I I want to wrap this show with just a reflection of like okay we're here now this is one of the most catastrophic failures of the last five years in crypto is the um the downfall of FTX and it seems like the more we learn the worse it becomes it's clear this is going to set the industry back so the question that I want to leave with is just what do you think happens from here what is the next uh six months what does the next year look like as we recover from this you know I actually want to equivalent with your statement I don't know if I would say that it will definitely set the industry back at least um on a long enough time scale because I actually think it's so good for the industry just like based on all the principles that you know I hear from crypto people about what they're trying to build and how they want to use this technology to change society I actually think it's so good to get those kinds of people and um you know those kinds of practices or whatever you want to call them um out and have people recognize like this is not how we do things um sooner rather than later and so you know I understand that maybe not regulators and lawmakers will understand that right in the beginning but I imagine that the community members will kind of double down on more decentralized things on self-custody on just like all the sort of really core principles and so in that regard I actually feel like this could kind of hasten the more pure version of crypto than kind of the way the industry was going the last two years yeah I mean I want to be optimistic here and I agree maybe in the long run yeah maybe this is a step forward but I feel like we always say this after every exchange hack and people have been trying to push not your coins not your keys not your coins forever and and humans just kind of keep doing the same thing they've always been doing so I would like to believe that you're right but I'm also somewhat uh maybe a little bit pessimistic but I think it's just going to be very chilly for a while like this asset class just looks so toxic to a lot of people who aren't already working in it and I think people who pushed these Investments at their more traditional you know crossover funds or VC funds uh look extremely silly now and I don't I think on a long enough time frame things will heal the Technologies new technologies will be built and you know hopefully things will look better but in the short term it's just hard to see how people get excited about underwriting investments in crypto if they're not already in it and even if they aren't in it rethinking the strategy I don't know what would you say I mean what I said on Twitter the other day the first place that liquidated the Alameda paid back we were D5 protocols and defect protocols due to active participants who care about not being [ __ ] stupid like centralized lenders who deserve to die you know we spent a lot of time actually trying to understand like what risks these things these Protocols are taking and how much leverage they're actually giving people and the fact that an actor has to go pay back the smart contract first instead of relying on you know sweetheart deals with their own Exchange is the ultimate sign that crypto's technology is the right technology in the future and between ZK then really the sickness related projects in snark land and defy I still am I actually think the death of this type of stuff is actually very good for increasing the the level of development in those Technologies because people see them as necessary not just sufficient or nice to have them so to me that's the taken that'll take away yeah I'll I'll definitely plus one to that to ruin it's clear there's going to be a big regulatory backlash as a result of FTX because there were so many of the Rich and Famous who were caught up in this thing this was not just some run-of-the-mill kind of off you know overseas random exchange that ended up stealing people's money um this was something much bigger and it makes a lot of people look stupid and it makes a lot of people think okay if I couldn't trust FTX who can I trust that violation of trust is gonna be very hard to overcome I think we will eventually overcome it but it's going to take time it's going to take a lot of work on behalf of not just centralized players but everybody in the industry of showing that we are up to the task of creating products and creating a a um an industry that people feel comfortable with and you know the reality is that you know we talk obviously about defy a lot in the show and we're big Believers in D5 um but for most people D5 is still too complex it's still too difficult it's still Beyond The Pale of what they can realistically use and stay secure uh interacting with and so there's a lot of work to do and so what I see is that the next year is likely going to be quiet um you know we're still uh going to be funding great entrepreneurs who are working on new ideas and building new things and I think Capital will be there for folks who who have genuine ideas about how to move the space forward but I think consumers are going to be pretty gun shy for a while eventually we'll we'll get we'll get past this hump because crypto you know crypto is resilient it's been through many many terrible crises before and it'll get through this one just as it's gotten through all of them before um I think institutions are going to take a step back I I think they are going to be a little bit um traumatized by what they saw with FTX because they assumed that the work had been done that had not actually been done they assumed that the um they could trust that this institution was run like a real grown-up operation when in fact it was it is not just that the money got lost uh but the way in which it was lost and the level of Fraud and deception particularly coming from the very top coming from Sam himself is just so unconscionably bad that I do I do think we're going to take one on the chin as an industry for this but you know at the end of the day tarun I would absolutely underscore that is that the thing about technology is that technology only ever gets better it never gets worse people keep finding new ways to optimize these things and make them faster and make them smoother make them more usable and you know two three years from now this this technology is only going to improve regardless of whether or not um you know people remember FTX or they don't there will come a time there will be a cycle after this that there will be people who I've only ever read about FTX which is kind of difficult to imagine now but there were people like man you know I heard about that what was that like at the time it must have been so crazy when like how did you guys not know that this big exchange and this guy was such a big deal they say he slept on a bean bag like what does this meme I keep reading about there will come a time when all this will be like this ridiculous story that only oldies like us are going to remember and uh yeah I look forward to that but in the meantime um I think what I would say is that it's back to work so it's back to building it's back to focusing on the the important things that we need to do which is to make this technology better so that it actually can be ready so people don't have to use they don't have to trust individual people or individual companies the way that people were forced to trust Sam the whole point of this technology is that we don't have to trust people anymore we don't trust institutions anymore and it's not ready yet if we were ready we wouldn't have gotten here um and so I think it the ball falls back to the builders um to be able to open the door to the next stage of this industry yeah one thing that um I just want to add when you were saying that people in the future won't even know this whole debacle it just reminds me of how um I can't remember it was at some point probably this summer or something I saw people you know they must be new and like they didn't really know what the Dow was you know and like that was that was like just this big it's like Mount Cox the Dow and now FTX are pro Tara Luna probably is all also in there but um I think if you surveyed members of constitution Dao I would guess less than 50 of them right it's funny I'm teaching a course at Berkeley on web3 entrepreneurship which is very timely because we've the courses run through a lot of crazy stuff doing ethics no they will add one next time yeah we'll add one next time it's a good call it's it's it's it's it's just so um it's refreshing in many ways to be interacting with students who don't know any of this stuff they don't know what the Dao is they barely know what you know kind of what happened before 2020 basically is just like ancient history to them so um it's uh it's in many ways refreshing because it just reminds you that there will be another generation after them too that's not going to know anything that happened since 2023 and they're gonna be building the stuff that goes into the next cycle most likely so um anyway yeah this stuff uh this stuff continues on it doesn't stop for anyone so at that I think we've uh We've hit just about two hours is I think the longest show we've ever done yeah I want to check if uh there's any additional words in the letters in the Wheel of Fortune hahaha and Partners yeah he talked to New York Times and like has some very unself-aware quotes in it that make it seem like he's like oh well I made a mistake whatever whoa whoa can you share those before we round yeah yeah the uh the last line the last few paragraphs of this New York Times article are like yeah I feel like pretty can you just read aloud people can say all the mean things they want about me online he said in the end what's going to matter is to me is what I've done and what I can do and you know like I feel like there was no like I'm sorry all right like here's what happened I'm really like I I made an ethical lapse it's like no that's fine whatever wow did he did he confirm that it's a hack or no uh he did no absolutely not no he's he's posting them he's he's he's improvising he's figuring out as it goes wow wow okay wow that's crazy yeah I I again I feel like the lack of like moral self-awareness is is something I associate with extreme utilitarians and this is clearly a demonstration all right well tarun maybe maybe you're more right than I originally assumed um all right well with that uh I think we're gonna sign off thanks everybody [Music]
