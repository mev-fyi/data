[Music] i think the most likely case is that there will be at least three forks with the difficulty bomb without the difficulty bomb and proof of stake i think that the proof of work chain the main one without the difficulty bomb does not go to zero and i think maintains a decent amount of market count my current prediction you know don't hold me to this is completely finger to the wind is something like two to ten percent of ethereum two's market count there's never been more institutional capital sort of willing and able to buy east in size um pretty pretty highly convicted around that and there's just a lot more um you know there's a lot less uncertainty around it and it's just gotten a lot bigger and you had you know defy and then you had nfts and gaming you've got multiple use cases that are happening on layer one smart contract platforms and you juxtapose that against btc's narrative which is as challenged as i've seen it in the five years that i've been paying attention to this i think people in my opinion don't understand what the theory actually is ethereum is not money because money has no use ethereum has use you use it to use to power the applications on this network bitcoin has no use it's just money it's like the dollar has no use it's just money and that's why it's a good form of money because its value cannot be conflated with actual utility of other stuff i don't really understand i guess they do understand like some of the motives but in general like i i just don't really see a future for it again you know i'm a core developer where i really understand like the code the logic and the things that go with it i'm not a trader investor or anything of that sort so i can appreciate this when people might find some value in a chain like that but i really don't you know see a long term long term being a thing but you know people said that about youth classics so i don't know you know what what's what's what's gonna happen
