an ETF format was what we always conceived of and that's always what we intended to do even before we launched the product back in 2013. so we have been on a journey for the last nine years not only growing this product and bringing Bitcoin accessibility to investors in a regulated and accessible way but we've always been in pursuit of an ETF so when we think about the journey that we've been on yes it was very unfortunate and very disappointing that the SEC um denied our application to convert gbtc to an ETF in June of 2022. investors have been patient we think investors deserve this and it really is a signal that in the near term investors have really seen that their regulator is you know pretty much shutting the door on the opportunity to take the world's largest Bitcoin fund and bring it closer into the regulatory perimeter
