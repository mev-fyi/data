description today's guest is Thomas Brazil founder of 507 Capital welcome Thomas hey Laura thanks for having me there's been so much news regarding FTX this week let's start with a bombshell of a lawsuit by FTX against Daniel Friedberg who served as the chief compliance officer at FTX us as well as the general counsel of what the lawsuit said was quote bankman Freed's so-called crypto hedge fund Alameda what did the lawsuit reveal and why was it so shocking uh let's see where do I start okay thanks for having me on again let's see so the lawsuit was pretty damning because it sort of shows a real pattern of historical activity and also as you would have assumed it takes more than one person to let's not say perpetrator but have such a such a big apparatus of activity that's that's less than all about board and so you you see that in in this this what's called an adversary proceeding uh or AP as it's called in bankruptcy court basically a lawsuit uh to recover funds um against uh Daniel freeberg and you know it's interesting I mean the biggest bombshell is probably the the you know the the length of which this gentleman went to probably cover the tracks through the Whistleblower payoffs um there were some whistleblowers that were paid off as well as like help basically obfuscating who was the ultimate you know sort of owner of bank accounts to be able to hide the fact that there was money flushing around between Alameda and FTX so those are pretty pretty you know some of the stuff in there is pretty damning I mean they're basically saying that he backdated agreements by what sign what like what signatures um on on documents versus e-sign which is pretty bad what's interesting is the way if you read the adversary proceeding it's written in a very clever way which doesn't call it uh prod it calls it breaches of fiduciary duty um I think that's very purposely done basically to be able to have a lower bar to meet to be able to actually litigate this person and potentially other people that were involved there were some unnamed parties like Law Firm one Law Firm two I assume the former Law Firm you worked at as well as who knows maybe Sullivan Conroe maybe another firm but there's definitely some other parties that are probably going to see some activity and this is like the first rung of uh lawsuits um regarding this activity that that's that's named in that abstract student okay yeah and his former Law Firm was Fenwick and West and I just wanted to note um this actually also solved a little bit of the mystery around North Dimension which was that washington-based bank and from the lawsuit it's pretty clear oh this was spun up to obfuscate the fact that um Alameda you know was receiving all these customer deposits and was using them and they even like made up all these fictitious a fictitious story about what uh the purpose of North Dimension was with a fake website Etc right yeah because they didn't want to have to disclose that customer funds and non-customer funds were being co-mingled right and I would say the other thing it shows if you if you look at that uh AP if you read some of the paragraphs you'll see a very there's very interesting statement uh I can't remember the exact paragraph I could go look up if you want but there's a paragraph where basically say he was paid in serum tokens as part of some sort of compensation structure that was they think fraudulent and they want to claw that back and that's interesting because I think there were a lot of let's call it connected or potential insiders that were compensated in that way and I think they should be worried because clearly this is one of the first lawsuits we're seeing out of the estate where John is calling those kind of payment for services on transactions out and wants to claw back that money and I wanted to also note that um the you know backdated signature um that was used to you know show that this certain agreement had been in place around the setup between Alameda and FTX and and their accounts and um what they did was then they gave that to the Auditors and then those audited financials were what were used for the series C 400 million dollar rounds so all of this you know it was um just sort of this house of cards that was being luckily those are 510b Clans so it'll be behind creditors I should say the because I assume that then someone that's a that participated in that round would say well that was fraudulent inducement because you you had an audit opinion that was basically bogus because you gave them fake information and so I want to sue you when those claims usually go under creditor claims they're called what are called 510b claims or um basically lawsuits on account of like Securities transactions or Securities fraud just to boil it down which is coming up in other cases too um because you know crypto is the security is it not you know when we first started talking it was like oh only these things are securities now it's like well now everything's a security uh except for maybe Bitcoin and ethereum but I digress um and then last thing you sort of hinted at this so does it do you think that this will eventually implicate Fenwick and Weston if so how honeypo sent no uh very likely that some sort of action would be brought against them uh we don't know what the teeth of it would be I mean you know these are very as my bankruptcy lawyer loves to say when I get you know jump to conclusions on something this is a fact intensive question and so it will matter what the facts are um if if Fenwick did protect themselves uh and really uh this guy was very Rogue I find it hard to believe because he was there I guess from 17 to 20 and then transitioned from 20 uh to FTX GC uh so clearly he was doing transactions while he was a partner uh for Fenwick and impressed Sam or Sam's father it would sound like from reading the the be and if that's the case then if he was a partner at the firm and doing stuff that was an amount of fraud then you know law firms are you know I should say Partnerships are liable for the actions of their partners and so it's a very hard lawsuit for someone like a Fenwick to to defend okay but it would be dependent on whether or not he had committed those actions while he was yeah okay okay yeah it would depend on like what actually occurred while he was a partner you know and he would have to be as his activities as a partner um at Fenwick and then you could post when he went to FTX what did the partners that he was liaison liaising with uh at Fenwick what were they you know what did they actually sign off on what did they help out with how involved were they it's hard for me to believe that there wouldn't be some some teeth to some some lawsuit there but you never know all right so now let's also talk about uh another lawsuit that FTX uh made against K5 Global who is that and why is FTX suing them yeah you're gonna know better than I don't know you know these are I guess connectors uh best most connected people of all time I guess Sam said my understanding is a guy was like a former you know talent agent was quite connected in in Hollywood and and you know with celebrities and things like that and I guess Sam thought they could be useful for FTX so you know originally when I had a someone call and talk to me about this transaction way before this uh abstract shooting was filed um it was it was described as hey they invested in the lp of K5 you know as like an investor in their fund and they bought part of their general partnership that's the way the transaction was described but that is not the way the adversary reads I mean the adversary proceeding reads like they basically were paid 300 million dollars out of the gate for doing nothing and then they invested in certain portions of LPS but really did not get much of an equity interest with very little due diligence and I guess in total of something like 700 million dollars on fairy-like due diligence with very very little asses to show for it and in in I think that's also part of um John Ray the the Liquidators sort of um storyboard in his mind here is his the debtor was always insolvent way before I was dipping into customer absence way before these transactions were done and therefore these are textbook fraudulent transfers or conveyance and we want to basically unwind these transactions and we want our money back yeah and a similar one would be the embed Financial clawback which you know that happened I think last month but um again it's a case where FTX apparently paid 240 million dollars and it's worth maybe not quite even a million and um yeah so yeah but I mean these are typical I mean you'll see this kind of stuff in Bank in bankruptcies where you'll see these fraudulent transfers prosecuted I think the issue is it's good to see John and the team basically just going through the file and Prosecuting things as as they get enough uh information together to in their mind bring a legitimate action for creditors so it's great to see all this stuff I mean look I don't you know if you're on the other side of it it's not great uh but some of these things you know they're real defrauded creditors here that deserve answers at least um if not money back uh for some of these alleged Investments you know so in a moment

app at railway.xyz to find out more back to my conversation with Thomas this week there was another major development which was that FTX is looking to restart the exchange if that were to happen or I guess now they're sort of exploring it um how do you think that whole process will go well um if you look at some first of all a few reporters have given me a little Intel on what they hear and then in addition to that I've been looking at John's um uh fee applications and I would say it does look like they're exploring it clearly in Earnest um I think what you're going to have is the estate right now in perella which or I think it's perella and maybe Jeffries but the investment bankers for the debtor are taking in basically offers like you know tell us what you really want to do we'll consider it um I don't think there's like a formal process like because there's nothing there's no motion before the court so the debtors basically just take at this point taking in offers um unsolicited and kind of saying like look tell us what you want to do you think you can provide a Services let's talk about what we could do um uh I don't know if you want me to go into this now but when I spoke with John in person at a debt wire event in New York uh he was pretty candid that hey we're going to look into all this stuff but at the end of the day like I don't really you know I don't really care if we restart or not I just want to get 100 repay for creditors and I'm going to do try whatever means I can to get that and and so I think of course they're entertaining it if someone's going to make a few hundred million dollars cash in the balance sheet and we'll run everything and you know there's cop there's high confidence around that I think he's going to be very open to that so the process right now is a little ad hoc it's not very like streamlined um if you get an what will happen Laura is if you get one bid very similar to Celsius that kind of sets the tone for the structure that people want to see or what the estate's willing to accept then you'll see people reading that offer and saying like oh that's really good we can do better than that and so you'll see topping offers on that and I think the reason that when I say offers there's no what's called auction going on like to reboot the reboot would be through a bankruptcy plan so when I spoke to John and you know this is a conversation in confidence but I think it's good to share it and I think he wouldn't mind me sharing it which is he want he said that he wants to get a file on record a bankruptcy plan on file by July 31st that's 30 days from now so they're clearly taking in all the bids they can get and if they can get a credible offer um that'll be part of a plan and then there'll be opportunity for people to jockey and offer better offers and things like that but he had basically said he wants to plan on by July 31st and he wants a confirm plan by 2024 July 21st July 31st 2024. so and just to be clear about what you're talking about the plan for um restarting the exchange or liquidation yeah oh so it's it's kind of like he's gonna they're gonna decide they're gonna kind of well they're not gonna decide because you need a confirmed plan but they're looking at this now and they anticipate either getting a plan on file with a restart you know it'll take months to get all the stuff confirmed but like in the Bare Bones outline of what a restart would look like by July 31st or a plan of liquidation now one kind of liquidation is even approved Laura it'll take years to go through all those like all those lawsuits that have been filed they're going to go on for years those people have money they have competent counsel they'll defend themselves in court there'll be lots of Discovery and depositions and whatnot um but that's what that's the outline he gave me and you know frankly meeting him in person was great I was kind of Blown Away at his candidness and kind of Blown Away at how aggressive I think he's going to be for creditors which you know I love to see so yeah anything else to say about his personality um he seems uh smart but he knows what he knows he's a bankruptcy trustee his background was he was an attorney before he did this he got involved I can't remember the first case he got involved in but he walked me through I mean I wasn't around for Enron because I'm just too young Enron was a great great case they had high recoveries he did what's called OSG which was a large um um uh large shipping company that was 100 repay case and he really is intent on trying to make FTX 100 repeat case that's what he said to me I believe him and he seems pretty hard-nosed on it he's also quite candid and irreverent which I actually like because it means he doesn't take himself too seriously and he gets on with the work um you know in a lot of foreign jurisdictions because we're not just involved in things like FTX we're involved in all the cases um you know you meet you'll meet Liquidators and administrators of the states that are incredibly slow uh incredibly passive and you kind of think like well why aren't you at least exploring this and now to be fair he has the benefit of he has a lot of dollars to work with um because it's a huge estate um but it's refreshing to see somebody being as aggressive as he is in terms of Prosecuting the the items you know before here and if he gets a plan on uh even a Bare Bones rough outline of a plan by July 31st I think that is an amazing achievement given the given where it started one thing that I wanted to understand you know because you're saying that he wants to do 100 recovery so obviously this week also it was reported that FTX has concluded it owes customers 8.7 billion dollars and I wondered how is that being calculated or denominated is that like a conversion because obviously a lot of this must be an actual crypto asset so is that just based on current prices or like do you know how that number is being come up with we do not I would say we don't a lot of the uh in speaking for people that are distressed people in the market the whole Market doesn't really know where they're coming up or how they're coming up with those numbers Hey there one quick note after we wrapped Thomas realized what I was asking here and he explained that the 8.7 billion dollar number is based on crypto prices the day of the bankruptcy filing which was November 11 2022. we think there's a lot of do I say I don't say the word coin I guess I just did but a lot of alternative alternative all projects uh that are that are considered in there I guess chiefly among them is all of the basically locked uh Solana and it'll be a big question mark I mean John even asked me like Tom what should I do with all the lock Solana and I was like oh my God John wave up my pay grade so I think even the estate is one of those things where they're not really sure what to do right now they can't just sell it because I guess there is a huge lock schedule on it and so I think that seven billion there's a lot of locked up stuff I mean one of the things John said to me that I thought was quite interesting and again I think this is newsworthy that's what I'm sharing it is you know he said not only does he anticipate getting to 100 recovery by trying to increase the numerator but really it's by decreasing the denominator and and so I think he really means it and one of the things he highlighted was kycaml on the denominator meaning all the claimants like who hasn't been kyc to ml like who's got Funny Money floating around on our exchange and I think that's a big I think it's going to be a big issue with claimants and one of the other things he highlighted was people treasuries with with really all all projects that have treasuries that are with FDX and now have claims instead of dollarizing those claims like you would traditionally do I think he was basically saying to me like I'm just going to get that person back their crappy coins and so I think if you're in serum or in you know some of the alternative projects or something yeah maps and oxy I think those are things that you want to be very careful about as a claimant now that's good for creditors as a whole so those are some of the things he he had said but and wait just to understand the kyc aspect are you saying that if you were a customer of FTX and you had not done kyc at the time it was functioning then you're kind of out of luck there or are you saying no no no I think he he's going to do his own he's gonna say they didn't do a good enough job got it okay because not only does he want to do kycaml but also like sources like source of funds like where did you get the 30 million from to begin with oh yeah okay I just think that'll be an issue for some claimants for sure for sure um so I was also wondering what do you think are the odds that they will try to relaunch FTX you know I the thing is we buy claims I never want someone to think I'm like chilling for my for for for like oh it's all going to be death and destruction and so you should sell me the claim for nothing so so it's hard for me to say without someone so take it with a grain of salt I think the odds are pretty low um but look if somebody comes up with an unreasonable bid like hey I'll pay 250 250 million let's relaunch everybody that's a creditor is gonna get 60 cents on the dollar and they're going to get 80 of the new Co equity and we're going to get 20 for our 200 million dollars that we pump in like sure let's do it I just don't think looking back at like Voyager and looking back at Celsius with some of the offers were I just don't think we're gonna get there why would someone not pay a lot for some of those customers and then pay a lot for FTX I mean I guess some people say oh ofdx is a lot more more profitable because it just had a I don't know like better customers and all the offshore derivatives were profitable maybe maybe maybe but also like I've met a lot of us claimants to have international claims and guess what they should not have been able to open accounts that is not what you're supposed to do like if I'm in the states I'm not supposed to be able to open up account with a broker that's not registered in the states like that's not you know so I met a lot of those companies and they got some explaining to do all right so are you also then saying that you feel that recoveries for customers will go better if they don't relaunch or what do you think will be the better scenario for recoveries so yeah that's a good question you know we we there's just like when you when you start talking about restructuring and bankruptcy it's like the recovery is always the liquidation value is like the lowest and then of course like restructuring where you have a going concern is always a higher valuation but the question is is do you add risk to your recovery if you do a re uh a reorganization and that's the only thing I worry about I'm I'm we we would be all for and I think a lot of distressed investors have no problem with a planned sponsor that puts in real money and wants to take it over um and wants to give a lot of the new co-equity to the creditors and so people could even have the opportunity to make not only 100 repay but a few times their money over time if they listed on the NASDAQ and it ends up being basically the I mean it'd be weird to be a NASDAQ listed company that can't operate in States but whatever it's clearly a higher value the question is again more risk is the same thing coming up in Celsius which is there's a plan sponsor but it adds risk to be giving them the reins and some of the capital that would just be liquidated out to you to capitalize the nuco all right well the other thing that happened was that the price of FDT jumped on the restart potential so do you think that ftt would have any role if FTX were to restart no and I think it's a mistake that people are trading in it yeah no no I mean is Celsius is an issue right Celsius just came up like they're kind of restarting it but what's happened in Celsius nothing now we can talk about dollarization and like what value you should place on your ftt token should you get the petition a value was that price manipulated because the lock schedule blah blah blah but in terms of like the the the actual the actual economics you would get in a restart why would FDT be cut in at all you know stranger things have happened but I think it's a very low probability and a bad trade other than you're a market maker and you're making so much money off the ups and the Downs that you just don't care yeah yeah well also because of its role in the collapse of FTX I think you're right that it probably would not have a role um but there's an upcoming important date called the customer bar date what is that and why is it important yeah I'm glad you mentioned it uh it was approved recently and let me tell you the exact date so we have it here for the record uh so the customer bar date is yeah 9.29 so that would be September uh 29 2000 uh excuse me 2023 so by September 29th you have to file your proof of claim and is there some issue with the what the what the debtor is reportedly says your claim amount is or you have some additional lawsuit you think you you your your own money you need to get that on file by that date it's super super important that people uh do that um once you have a late filed claim you come behind all the other creditors and so yeah it's just very very important that if you have not filed a proof of claim or for whatever reason um when you got an email from Kroll and the numbers were wrong or you didn't agree with them or um you didn't like characterization or something you need to follow your proof of claim with crawl with the court by that date so it's super important for people to know about it and it also what it does is it puts a Line in the Sand because then we know exactly what all the liabilities are because after that date you basically cannot really file claims you can file late claims I mean it's just pointless to do so really um but all right and then the last thing I wanted to ask you about was that last week Bloomberg Dow Jones The New York Times and the financial times filed an appeal against the order to redact the identities of ftx's customers and in a message uh where you flag this to me you just wrote super interesting um why why do you say that so it's interesting because I feel bad for the judge here because he granted something that should have not been granted so if you look at the standard for allowing redaction under the bankruptcy code you are not allowed to redact like chartered information just because you want to like they're basically two standards you have to meet it has to be either what's called imminent harm or like I don't know what the exact phrase is but basically like commercially sensitive information so you have to argue one of those two points and the judge has to agree with you for you to to Grant you the relief I mean that's the way so so one of the things I wanted to add at the very beginning this is you know bankruptcy courts are course of equity so the judge has a lot of power to do what he wants but there's also the bankruptcy code that he still has to follow and to me the standard of redaction you have to to do those two things either imminent harm or commercially sensitive information the debtor hasn't done that at all and I feel bad for claimants because maybe the bankruptcy code is old and stale and needs to be refreshed and needs to be updated by Congress but we have the laws the law says what it says this judge is probably going to get overruled on appeal because now you've got it was Bloomberg and DOW Jones and someone but the actual uh party bringing it was like the association for free press or something I mean if you're familiar with them but it's some sort of like uh like Free Press like non-profit or legal non-profit it's bringing it and you know they're not wrong I mean it's hard for me to Fathom how they meet either one of those standards and they're likely gonna win at the Appellate level and you know I don't want all the creditors to be docs it's not not my not what I like to see but then they should have made a better record of like meeting the standard uh because they didn't the judge just was like oh Kirkland you want to do this rubber stamp what else you got for me and it's it's a symptom of what goes on in bankruptcy court unfortunately I think it's interesting I think that they're likely going to win you know maybe the creditors end up hating like these news organizations for bringing this but it's a real Bedrock principle of the bankruptcy court and code which is transparency that's why I like I love how transparent the process is I I've kind of turned a bit on this issue where now I do think that the customer's information should probably be redacted but it doesn't matter what I think the law does not support it in this instance so interesting to see that someone's actually appealing it and who's repeated appealing is interesting Yeah so basically you're saying like to keep it consistent with how all bankruptcies are done like that's why you support it okay yeah I mean it's just the code doesn't support the redaction even though I do feel bad for creditors because they feel like hey I never thought my information would be public I'm into crypto so I'm kind of probably into privacy there's like a you know there's like a there's like a big Venn diagram of overlap between privacy people and people are into crypto but it's unfortunate it's what the bankruptcy code says to get the relief of the automatic stay there do you have to follow the rules and one of the rules is providing transparent information one of them is credit information as well so all right well this has been hugely informative thanks so much for coming on Unchained thanks everyone don't forget next up is the Weekly News recap stick around

Mike belshi said that despite pulling out of the deal with prime trust it is planning further Acquisitions predicting more industry consolidation in the coming months Sam Pinkman Freed's legal motions to dismiss charges denied FTX founder Sam bingman Freed's legal defenses faltered this week U.S District Judge Lewis Kaplan refused his motion to subpoena documents from former FTX Law Firm Fenwick and West Kaplan clarified that neither the law firm nor the FTX debtors are part of the quote prosecution team hence the government is under no obligation to present documents not within its jurisdiction the judge rebuffed the motion as a quote fishing Expedition that lacks specificity and relevance furthermore judge Kaplan denied a binkman Freed's request to dismiss most charges against him labeling them quote moot or without Merit binkmann freed facing what would likely be a long prison sentence if convicted had attempted to dismiss frond charges arguing that FTX customers suffered quote no economic loss from the alleged fraud Kaplan dismissed this argument as incorrect both factually and legally citing the multi-billion dollar deficit Alameda had on its balance sheet This legal predicament arrives as bankman freed prepares to defend his actions based on Fenwick and West's advice thereby proving his lack of criminal contempt however kaplan's rulings seem to thwart these
