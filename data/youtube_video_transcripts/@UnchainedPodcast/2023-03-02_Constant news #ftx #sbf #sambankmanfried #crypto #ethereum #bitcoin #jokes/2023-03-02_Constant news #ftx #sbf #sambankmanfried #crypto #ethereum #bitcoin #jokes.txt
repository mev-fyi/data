charges against FTX are literally like Netflix there is so much content I cannot keep up this week nishad Singh an FTX founder and former director of engineering pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors investigating SBI honestly so inspiring to me when men agree to cooperate like I once had a boyfriend who once did dishes one time staying pleaded guilty to Securities fraud Commodities fraud wire fraud okay honestly maybe it would be faster if I listed the types of fraud he didn't commit he's also charged with participating in an effort to artificially inflate ftx's Revenue artificial inflation you guys got the wrong AI but you're very close Singh's lawyers have said that nashad is deeply sorry for his role in this and has accepted responsibility for his actions okay I had no idea that all it took for men to apologize was to hire a very expensive lawyer Singh wants people to know that he wasn't always a bad guy he was once a Facebook engineer who was very involved in the effective altruist movement but I guess maybe before that he wasn't a bad guy
