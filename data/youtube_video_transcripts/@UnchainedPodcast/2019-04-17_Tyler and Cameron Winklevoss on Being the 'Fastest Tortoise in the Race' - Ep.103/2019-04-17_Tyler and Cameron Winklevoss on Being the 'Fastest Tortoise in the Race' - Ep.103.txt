hi everyone I've got a quick update that I'm appending to this episode after its publication during the recording of the show Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss said that no other staple coins have named their banking partners in the moment I mentioned that tether had revealed at least some of its banking partners but I wanted to note that circles USD coin has several banking partners including silver gate Bank and US Bancorp management and true USD has named its trust companies and their correspondent banks I've also put links to that information in the show notes there may be others among the dozens of staple coins as well now let's turn to the original episode hi everyone laura here before we dive into today's episode I have a quick message in case you missed the news last week we relaunched the unchained and unconfirmed websites both podcasts have new logos and a more unified look plus we've got a beautiful podcast player on every episode page as well as transcripts and exclusive content go check it out at Unchained podcast.com also I launched a weekly newsletter which is a curated set of the week's top crypto news and links along with a little summary to make sense of this fast-paced world go sign up for it now to receive the next edition this Friday don't forget the URL is Unchained podcast calm where you can see the new logos read transcripts of Unchained and most importantly sign up for my weekly newsletter and now onto this week's episode hi everyone welcome to Unchained your no-hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host flourishing if you've been enjoying unchanged popping an iTunes to give us a top rating or review that helps other listeners find the show considering using digital securities as a way to grow in 2019 tokens offs trusted platform provides the security and compliance tools to leverage blockchain technology and enter new markets with confidence visit us at token soft dot IO or on Twitter at token soft do you have an idea for a blockchain app but are worried about the time and cost it will take to develop the folks at asier have you covered the new Azure blockchain dev kit is a free download that gives you the tools needed to get your first app running in less than 30 minutes learn more at akms unchained or by following them on Twitter at MSFT blockchain within months cryptocurrency anti money laundering regulations go global are you ready avoid stiff penalties are blacklisting by deploying effective anti money laundering tools for exchanges and crypto businesses the same tools used by regulators cipher trace is securing the crypto economy my guests today are Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss the CEO and president respectively of Gemini welcome Cameron and Tyler hey Laura thanks for having us hey you doing thanks Laura the last time I had you guys on the show was in 2016 and a lot has happened since then Gemini has undergone major changes and will actually start with talking about one of them your new ad campaign what is the message of the campaign and where are the ads running sure so we just launched a new ad campaign it's targeted in New York City it's in the subways on taxi cabs we've got a few billboards as well as well as a crypto bus and the message is basically the revolution needs rules and it also coincides with our mobile app launched in December and why are you targeting only New York City so this our first campaign and we're on your base company so it made sense to sort of test this city and it's also happens to be one of the financial capitals of the world and also has one of the preeminent Bitcoin or rather virtual currency regulators York DFS so it felt like a great starting point to start a campaign yeah New York City or the state of New York is really ground zero for building a framework for cryptocurrency companies to become license compliant businesses and so that was there definitely a pioneer as a state it's very much the reason why we built Gemini in New York and why we have almost 200 employees here and growing and so it sort of made sense to start it in our backyard where this all happened and Cameron myself we testified at the Bitcoin hearings I think they were in 2014 and helped you know educate the regulators and shape the regulation to be thoughtful for crypto companies so this is definitely the right place for us to start this campaign and we'll see how it goes and then we'll consider rolling it out to other cities and jurisdictions so it's just from the way you're answering it does seem like you're almost saying that the targeted audience for the ads is the regulators is that the case no it's definitely definitely customers you know prospective customers we actually had a a meet in the street event yesterday at Zuccotti Park which I believe is where the first u.s. Stock Exchange got its early beginnings almost 200 years ago and you know it's really interesting the the so far the feedback we're getting is the campaign has really struck a chord especially with a group of folks who actually believe in crypto they've been reading about it for years and they don't really need to be sold on the dream of crypto or its promise what they're unsure about is how to engage in crypto in a safe and compliant manner and so we're really trying to just start the conversation and let people know that there are ready related exchanges in custodians like Gemini where you can easily buy sell and story or crypto and it's not some Wild West we have to continue to change the narrative I'm sure you remember the Silk Road days where you couldn't really read a single article without some mention usually it was a headline or you know in the first party article about Silk Road and how Bitcoin is anonymous and only used for illicit activity and we know how how wrong that narrative is and really has proven to be but that didn't take weeks or months to shake it took years and even to this day there are a lot of people who still believe bitcoin is truly anonymous it's simply not not the case so it's really important for the community for us to really start continuing the dialogue and educating people that this is a very valid technology and there are safe ways to engage with it because what we really don't want is a lot of sophisticated people who believe in the technology who miss out on that next wave of getting involved yeah the conversation today is so much different than it was even two years ago people believe that this space is the future they believe in the dream of crypto they just don't know how to get involved with the dream without getting burned and so that's really where the dialogue is right now and this isn't about building rules for crypto itself we think the rules of math and cryptography are quite quite good this is about building rules for the crypto companies that people rely on and Trust with their money this is about Mao Goths type scenarios this is an a crypto problem per se and just out of curiosity who came to see kotti like when you were saying that those people were receptive and we're saying that they were responding well to the ads like who were those people they were people who a lot of them worked in the financial district so they were going for a couple fee or lunge or commuting to work or leaving work a lot of people the professionals in the area and then some people who came specifically to the area because they saw the tweet and we also had a crypto bus which was super hard to miss it had some advertising slogans on it and we had we had free coffee from Brooklyn Roasters so that that you know that alone could have excited people to show up and so it sounds like it was kind of the traditional financial services community you know there's there's people who were already in crypto there was people who aren't in crypto but said hey you know I'm gonna think about this again I'm gonna go talk and there's one I think one gentleman said you know I'm gonna talk to my son my son's been talking to me about this for years and as soon as I get home I'm going to restart that conversation because he wasn't really sure about a safe way to engage so there was a real big mix because the thing is that you know at least on crypto Twitter it didn't seem like the community has responded to super well to the ads I'm sure you've seen the tweets because they keep tagging you so for instance or they keep tapping attacking gem and I like Eric for he's the CEO of shape-shift tweeted and this was in response to one of the ads that says crypto nice rules he said hey gem and I crypto has lots of rules already crypto is rules these rules are stronger than any political inscriptions they are objective open and knowable to all parties they transcend borders and they are enforced by mathematics crypto is a system of laws not men I saw Dan McArdle the co-founder of Vasari said that ads prompted him to close his Gemini account so what's your response to these negative reactions well we certainly know that we're not going to please everybody and I will say that I actually agree with Eric Eric's a very thoughtful thinker and an excellent writer and I agree crypto doesn't need rules because it has the rules of math and cryptography the rules that we're talking about are the regulation and oversight on how people use the technology and how people build the technology and how companies like Gemini for example custody assets and what kind of oversight we have a regulator who checks to make sure that we're doing what we're set what we say we're going to do but the great thing about crypto is it's it's really a it's a continuum it's a gradient you can participate it in a centralized fashion you can sign up to gemini download our mobile app on board in about two minutes and you can sort your crypto with us but whenever you decide that you don't want to be in the centralised sort of off chain part of that crypto experience you can opt out a Gemini at any point and withdraw your assets into the decentralized blockchain and store it yourself so so effectively you know Gemini's oversight we believe the majority of people are going to want that type of experience but there's nothing preventing people from living in more of a p2p decentralized version for the same reason you know there's some people who don't want to store their cash in a bank their alternative is is for most parts storing it in a mattress most people don't do that some people do most people if they want to buy gold or exposure to gold they buy a gold ETF there are certain individuals who do not like the idea of their gold bars stored it with a qualified custodian and they want to store it themselves so they go to the effort in the trouble of building a safe and securing it but one of the interesting things about crypto is that if you want to live in the decentralized version of the world it's actually a lot more viable and practical you can actually move substantial amounts of the value through the blockchain in it's much more practical than actually storing a lot of cash or or you know moving gold bars when the zombies come running it's really hard outrun them if you're carrying a bunch of gold bars but if you're carrying you know a treasure wallet with crypto that's actually a viable strategy and and so you know there are be folks that that don't ever want to engage with with Gemini and we think that's sorta ly fine right yeah that could be your next ad campaign to outrun the zombies with your car yeah totally and just a further further hit the point you know there's there's a lot of people who drive sport utility vehicles SUVs and I would venture a bet that 99 percent of those folks never go off-roading and never will go off-roading they're staying on the highways they're commuting around suburbia but having that optionality it's nice to know that they have it and the same thing with Gemini if you want to stay on Gemini that's great if you want to go off-roading and crypto and take your crypto with you wherever you go you can do that too that's great right and in but when you talk about a Bitcoin exchange there are humans involved there are people it's not this lab experiment that's all software and protocols there are entrepreneurs who are making decisions about how to store your value and there are serious ramifications if they get that wrong so I think that's what we're talking about it's a sort of simplistic reading of the ad campaign to say oh we think you know the Bitcoin protocol should be regulated that's not really what we're talking about we're talking about places that act like banks or exchanges that interact with the protocols that need regulatory oversight in a thoughtful way if mount Cox had been under regulatory oversight it would have been a lot harder for that to have happened what happened it would be a lot less likely and that's really the point that we're making and that's really the point that people interact with they recognize if they want to go and get involved in crypto and buy some they're gonna have to do it most likely interface with a company and what does that company doing who's behind it who's watching who's guarding the guards themselves so to speak for us it's the state of New York in the New York Department of financial services for other financial institutions it's other regulators but we think that that's a really important piece of the larger puzzle in the ecosystem and that's been important in the financial industry for a long long time we're a New York Trust Company under New York banking law and you know history over the last hundred years or so has taught us that thoughtful regulation builds the healthiest most vibrant markets like the US for instance and that's what we really want to bring to crypto we want to get rid of the chaos and the Wild West and sort of the the mystery is like I said before a lot of people who believe in the dream they just don't they're scared and they don't understand how to become part of it yeah but I think so I still think that there is a certain tension there the way that you've been talking in your answer it's kind of like you have been positioning it almost as sort of different choices you like in terms of convenience right like are you going to keep the gold bars yourself or are you gonna have someone else monitor them and safeguard them for you that kind of thing but you know I just I also know there's this other analogy you guys have used a lot which is you have often said that finance should work like email and that it should be available 24/7 and you shouldn't have to wait three and a three or five days to send somebody money but then you know as you've been discussing you also say that you believe that cryptocurrency investors need the same protections that investors get in more traditional markets and so the traditional financial system has a lot of surveillance built into it so if anyone does anything shady with their money banks will have to let regulators know if he has a via a suspicious activity report and that doesn't happen with email right a Gmail does not screen all the messages and you know keep track of who all the senders and recipients are of all the messages and then cut off people from their email if they're caught engaging illicit activity but you know that does happen with the financial system so in that regard like you know those are really different visions so how do you those two kind of visions for what crypto could be so I think with with respect to email I think it's important to note that email providers are subpoenaed around the clock for information related to any kind of illegal activity from state federal international law enforcement and governmental authorities so they don't think it's quite so black and white you're not operating an email in this space where where your your activity isn't being monitored if you're up to bad activity but I think that look we're talking about value and and people value enables bad actors to commit atrocious acts terrorist financing is a real thing being a New Yorker and live in New York you know September 11th is a real thing and and that's really that's the overarching goal of bsa/aml it is not to create a Big Brother state or a surveillance state it is to prevent these horrible crimes from happening and it's pretty darn effective and I think for the vast vast majority of people they're okay living with that reality that you know their transactions may be monitored and and that's fine and and taking it over to the sort of the market surveillance piece of it every capital market in the equities in derivatives world has robust market surveillance every time you buy a share of Apple or Tesla that is routed presumably almost always to an exchange where there's monitoring going on and it and that is to protect you the key thing here is consumer protection it's not you know consumer violation of privacy it's consumer protection and quite frankly a lot of the email providers and a lot of the social networks I'm not so sure they they aren't reading everything you send I LA every time I look at a product on the Internet in fact I was I was listening to a podcast over the break and the same you know an Apple podcast the same podcast was being shown up in my YouTube feed so that's a Google company and I was listening to an Apple and on an Apple device and an Apple service so I'm kind of wondering you know these guys aren't just like looking for themselves they also seem to be talking to each other so I think that there's a lot of that actually going on we're afraid not that I think about it I was googling something on my Apple iPhone in Safari and then later my YouTube kept giving me an ad for anyway okay you're right clearly everything going on on the internet is shady so but I wanted to ask you about because you brought up the market surveillance you have this new technology the Nasdaq smarts market surveillance technology to monitor the Gemini marketplace so what exactly is that doing so basically the idea is you're monitoring for manipulative and deceptive practices so people are trading in a way that's abusive and unfair and what we're doing here is we're not reinventing the wheel for bringing something that's so different the table that you don't already experience in so when you when you trade a share of Apple through your etrade account these these market surveillance products are working on the exchanges where you purchase that share and it affords you a safe kondeh a rules-based marketplace and we just want to bring the same standard to the crypto space and the regulator's want us to do that too and they've made that pretty abundantly clear in terms of the SEC CFTC they want to see exchanges surveilling the marketplace for bad at bad practices and they won't also want to see them coordinating and talking with each other to make sure you know manipulation doesn't always happen in a vacuum on one place it's usually someone trading on multiple venues so there has to be just similar to the equities world or the derivatives and futures world these exchanges talk to each other and identify these practices that are unfair and we want to provide the same level of fairness and experience to our marketplace in the crypto industry that's what this boils down to that's where it's coming from and it's also been requested pretty openly in many shapes and forms from the regulators and it's it's basically a homework assignment that that we and everyone else in the industry have to do in order to push the ball forward if we want to see things like crypto ETFs and more crypto futures products and more great financial instruments using crypto we've got to answer this call with these types of solutions and that's just not me saying that that's the regulator's of the most sophisticated financial market in the world saying that all right so we're gonna talk more about regulators and the Bitcoin ETF in a little bit but actually first I want to talk with you about your stable coin the gemini dollar so why did you decide to launch a stable coin and how is it differentiated from the others particularly something like the pact so standard which market as far as I can tell pretty pretty much is roughly the same structure you know the the sable coin is a really interesting project and we felt pretty passionate about it I think it's our view is that the first use case scenario for crypto was bringing commodities on to a blockchain we consider Bitcoin a commodity the CFTC does and most US regulators put in that jurisdiction and that was the first use case of crypto as we know it ever and then there was the hole then people figure out how to put securities on the blockchain and what most people read about and saw was the ICO craze which I sort of refer to as non-compliant securities the new rebranding these days is SEO security token offerings and I call them the pet's calm of security token ops yes yes yeah the way that it's really the first way that people didn't realize they had to follow Security's rules although however I must know that you guys did invest in tasers which had an ICO so yeah and definitely so it's a really umbrella term and Cameron's more referring to the way things that were securities didn't follow securities laws and so it's sort of a misfire the new school of ICS rebranded as stos recognized that hey if we're a security we've got it follow securities laws which have been in place and well tested and understood for for the last 80 years so it's been really interesting to see this evolution from you've got commodities on the blockchain Bitcoin and ether and maybe ether arguably started off as a security but now it's jumped over the chasm into commodity land because it's sufficiently decentralized and no longer trips up the the Howey test but there hasn't really been a currency on the blockchain a good medium of exchange and even though bitcoin was called a digital currency from many years from you know almost from inception and often times that's the umbrella term for for the industry Bitcoin has really been a virtual commodity and it was the only one when Gemini started it was really a Bitcoin exchange because there's nothing else and then people figured out virtual securities they were called I SEOs now today everyone's a called of SDS but there really wasn't a digital asset to act like a currency and a good medium of exchange and unit of account commodities like Bitcoin we believe are stores of value it's really hard to you don't really want to spend a good sort of value if you invest in a share of well you don't want to use it to buy your cup of coffee because you're hoping that goes up so no one wants to be the person who buys the Bitcoin pizza again this the 60 million the pizza that costs twenty dollars which was ten thousand Bitcoin something like I don't know eight years ago but today it's it's something like a 50 million dollar depending on the price pizza that's a Papa John's Pizza it might even be really good but it probably wasn't that good and certainly not and we actually did this to we bought a couple of things with Bitcoin we bought tickets to space on Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and in hindsight turns out we probably overpaid tedx we actually invested in certain ideas and tasers with Bitcoin and depending on how much de sousa ppreciate s-- versus bitcoin we may have really overpaid we had preferred to make that investment in just cash because we kind of know it doesn't have the volatility it's more stable and it's not cash is not a great sort of value over the last I don't know 40 years the purchasing power of the dollar has lost you know 87% of its purchasing power whereas something like gold on the other hand has gone up 23 times so you got gold on the blockchain you got secures in the blockchain we need to get dollars in blockchain and forgive me if this is a long way of saying that's exactly what the gemini dollar is it's it's putting dollars on the blockchain that will empower the and fuel the decentralized app movement and all these other cool used case scenarios but prior to the launch of that you had tether the circle eur/usd C which was by circle people can listen to my episode with the cofounders of circle to hear more about that you had through USD I mean there were kind of a lot that obviously makers I is a you know popular stable coin so there were a lot of other options and so why did you guys decide to launch a new one and how is it different from some of these others in particular the Texas one so I think we should it's important to note that we launched in September I think that you know we weren't aware of the other projects obviously paxos launched the same day in circle I think followed a month thereafter so we you know I think our view obviously tethers tether I don't think we need to spend a whole lot of time on why that's problematic as a is a stable claim but I think one of the the biggest difference perhaps between the Gemini dollar and the other stable coins is we have exhaustively and publicly stated where the dollars are held what bank and that bank is State Street it's one of the largest custodians in the world it took us a very long time to to build that relationship go through the diligence process but the great thing about State Street is it has a tremendous balance sheet it has uh effectively unlimited capacity and it's been around for 225 years or so so again oldest company in America in America and we're really proud of that and so when you effectively hold a Gemini dollar out in the ether you know that the dollar backing that that token is held in a institution that has safety and soundness and and and I think that no other stable coin issuer discloses their banking partner and I think there's two reasons for that one they're not proud of their partner it could be somewhat of a fleabag Bank and doesn't have you know much of a reputation or credibility or the second at reason which is quite frankly a lot worse is it the bank doesn't know what they're banking and so there's some kind of layer between the stable coin bank account and so they have this omnibus account which is holding these dollars and they just assume well it's another business with dollars and we saw this a lot in the early days of Bitcoin where companies were opening up bank accounts and then eventually compliance Department does an account with you they look at the bank account and they say oh my god what what is this we're banking the Bitcoin or a crypto company this is not what we understood this is not what we signed up for and they effectively give you 30 days to you know closed the account and remove the funds and so nobody knows where true USD is banking I have no idea where circle stores their dollars I have no idea where paxos or smite got their dollar so it's impossible to assess the counterparty risk of holding that stable coin is the bank solvent is it sound is it safe is it in the US is it in the US so is it afforded FDIC insurance is Treasury going to wake up one day and say we're gonna freeze that and take a look in there and unwind it and if that is the case which has happened before look back to mount docs and the Diwali wallets I think the the feds sees somewhat something like 10 million dollars of value and those take a long time to unwind and figure out and so then you're stuck with a stable coin that doesn't actually have dollars backing it and that's a problem and it's sort of like a game of musical chairs right for the for the people holding those coins and and that that's sort of goes back to the heart of our marketing campaign is that for these type of situations consumers should understand where their dollars are and that's the kind of rules and transparency that the market desperately needs yeah and I just want to clarify I do think tether has revealed it's been relationships but you're right they don't have the same stature as State Street but I also did then want to ask you know that obviously it is the choice to kind of make the trust in that system or make the source of the trust in that system a bank like State Street whereas when you have something like maker Dow where it's controlled by smart contracts and it's over collateralized and you can sort of see everything that's happening on the blockchain why did you sort of choose against something in that vein so I think part of it is just simplicity people understand the US dollar and so simply putting it on the blockchain it sort of removes the whole educational barrier most people around this world are perfectly fine holding dollars in fact they would love to hold dollars instead of their local currency like the Bulevar in in Venezuela or you know if you're in Zimbabwe they've got the trillion-dollar trillion dollar bill hyperinflation you know I think something like 66% of $100 bills US dollar bills are outside the country they're in Russia they're in Cuba they're in places where they're desperate for you know a US dollar which is not arguing again not necessarily the best store value but substantially better than what they other alternative that they have so the simple elegant nature of it and the other thing is most people still well they I'd say almost everybody still denominates things in dollars we buy our groceries in dollars we think about value we think I think about Bitcoin in dollars so that was probably the big the big thing there with the maker die there there's an issue with obviously as you mentioned the over collateralization and then one other point though I think is that there is also a tremendous amount of misinformation around which of these products are licensed the Gemini dollar we worked with New York DFS for over a year to get approval the issue effectively virtual currency in the form of the Gemini dollar a bleep axe received the same approval circle is not a license issuer they do not have approval from a regulatory authority to issue true UST does not have regulatory authority it is a and neither is tether I know that's probably obvious but it's worth worth we're saying it again because because people on Twitter they say wait tethers registered as an MSB with Vince n therefore they're licensed no that is not a license that is simply saying hey I've got you know reporting obligations and we're going to try and one piece of the puzzle and that's the easiest piece it's actually if you do the legal analysis you need its money transmission on a state-by-state basis and I've yet to see the licensing for tree or see in many of these projects that's sufficient and really covers the 49 state licensing but back backing up a little bit this is really a trust product and we're pretty good at trust we're a trust company we been doing this for a while people tend to trust us there's no way to get around the Trust's and the humans behind it because it's centrally issued and that's why the regulatory oversight is so important we have oversight state street has oversight our auditor is a licensed CPA they have oversight with a security pen test team pen test the contract so we built this network and web of trust and we think we've done that better than anybody all right we're gonna keep discussing a

offered on the to over-the-counter trading desks which incentivized the some traders to buy large volumes of Gemini dollars with the discount and then exchange those Gemini dollars for the pack so standard redeemed those four dollars and then pocket the difference which is basically like a very easy 2% profit so I guess these traders were trying to withdraw the their packs through the mobi exchange and Hawaii has this $10,000 withdrawal limit and so these users were creating sometimes like up to 30 different accounts under different names so what was the intended effect of offering the discount and did you get the effect that you wanted I think every almost every stable coin that we're aware of offers some sort of incentive and and that's typical of any marketplace whether it's a stable coin or trying to incentivize price discovery and liquidity in tight spreads we're to be honest we're a little bit mystified by by that sort of article in the sense that it seems to us like the answer is pretty simple people just don't want to hold packs yeah I mean have you ever heard of sour grapes it just feels like someone who created a product and the markets spoken and they don't really want to hold the product they're redeeming that product because they don't like it and they prefer other products like Gemini dollar and that's what's happening and someone went out to journalists and sold that story and the journalists you know bought it hook line and sinker I think Chad's not sure why yeah he just read a blog post about it that's what it felt like yeah and and and pack some packs offers incentives too so you've got two products that are offering incentives and the market has spoken and they decided that they don't want to hold packs and it will sue then but one other thing that happened as a result of this is that Hobie ended up having more than three-quarters of all gee USD is that a problem for you does that matter in any way I mean how much of tethered as by Nance have ok see you base it just it's just like immaterial is that what you're saying I think when people but I think like that so like I my guess is that Finance has thirty forty percent of the tether and circulation that just means what it means you know we don't we don't determine where Gemini dollars go or use you know our user agreement prohibits them from black markets and other nefarious illicit areas but if you or if you create a DAP tomorrow and people want to bring millions of Gemini dollars to your incredible DAP because they love it they want to play it use it we don't govern that we don't you don't take a position on that we're totally agnostic and if people want to take Gemini dollars Soho be and trade it there that's none of our business and if people like don't like Paxos standards and they prefer gym.i dollars that's great but that's not like again that's between that's their decision not ours and I think the the the idea that a lot of people signed up accounts of Toby I mean we're has anybody verified that claim I mean how would how would would you know how would shad know that I don't I don't remember what he's said in a blog post I'm pretty sure Hobie out of respect and confidentiality for their clients would not be disclosing that type of stuff if it if it even happened so note nobody's verified it it's just made up yeah I mean well Chad in his blog post he said something about how he verified it with the actual perpetrators or maybe approach is the wrong word but anyway actually I want to move on to the Bitcoin ETF because like that kind of you guys have alluded to that through the conversation and I think it's a really important topic so one of the main reasons your ETF application was rejected had to do with the unregulated nature of the crypto cash markets and obviously Gemini itself has rules in oversight but more than 95% of all crypto trading volume has still have offshore on unregulated unregulated exchanges and you said in your in your AMA on reddit recently that you're still committed to making the ETF a reality so how do you plan to overcome this hurdle to get the SEC comfortable that the underlying markets are not prone to manipulation so the the the quick answer is is answering their call and requests for more market surveillance on the crypto marketplace and we've started to do that with the virtual commodity Association SRO and bringing Nasdaq smarts technology to our marketplace and those are the step in the right direction to getting regulators comfortable with eventually approving an ETF like product and so also now to argue sort of against my last question I want to also ask about SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce's descent from the rejection of your ETF she said that the SE C's decision basically rested on an incorrect interpretation of the regulations she was saying that the regulation instructs the Commission to determine whether the rules of the exchange are among other things quote designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to promote just and equitable principles of trade and are not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers issuers brokers or dealers end quote she asserts that your application met that standard and that if that yardstick were actually applied across the board then there are other commodity based exchange traded products that would simply not have made the cut and she also continues on explaining like the Commission's mission is to just ensure that investors have the information they need to make intelligent investment decisions and that the rules of the exchange should be designed to provide transparency and prevent manipulation and she said your application satisfied those requirements so do you agree that the SEC held you to a standard that was beyond what the regulation outlined so I think that certainly a lot of people agree with with her dissent but at the same time look we understand that it coin is a totally new asset class and we've got to get it right and so if the Commission is taking a very conservative viewpoint in this regard because it's really going to be the first of many and open the floodgates you know we can live with that I'm okay with that and we understand it and we're gonna work hard towards meeting that I think that investors deserve the same protections that they get if they buy a sheriff Tesla or Apple and I don't think it's unreasonable for regulators to to strive for that and especially since this Cameron mentioned this would be the first of many it's it's much more than just one product it's a really big it opens a big frontier and it's got to be open correctly so one other thing I wanted to ask about from her dissent she said that their decision not to approve the ETF inhibits institutionalization and that it also dampens innovation what do you think of those points it's an interesting point and there's a lot of truth to it I don't know how you have it both ways I see both sides of it but it's definitely a chicken-and-egg problem it does make it harder to get more institutions without a regulatory blessing although I understand how they feel that it's certain commissioners feel that it's not necessarily ready for primetime and this is a classic chicken and egg the best we can do is continue to build in mature this market with things like market surveillance and best practices so we brought up the virtual commodity Association which is your self-regulatory organization that you're trying to establish I guess right now you just have a working group for it so do you intend for the VCA to be a true self-regulatory organization that has the backing of a regulator that can levy enforcement's upon violators or will it be more like a trade association so like just for listeners who don't know like for instance FINRA is the SRO of the securities world but it's backed by the SEC and so if you guys do become a true sr who who will the VCA be backed by so the the goal long term is definitely to try and seek SRO status and that's achieved I believe by a amendment of the commodities and Exchange Act that would give it a-- thority similar to what happened with the National Futures Association it I should point out that it took the NFA seven years to get that Authority whereby any you know anybody who traded derivatives and the like had you become a member of NFA and sort of prescribed or subscribe to the the best practices now whether we get there you know that that remains to be seen and and how long it takes you know it seems like there's a lot of appetite in the CFTC especially with Commissioner contends to build a SRO that is self policing and the reason for this and I'll just quickly lay this out is that securities have the SEC and FINRA have direct supervision over securities markets and the trading there of the CFTC only has direct supervision over the derivatives and the NFA is the SRO of the derivatives world it's like the FINRA equivalent but they don't have direct supervision on cash spot commodity markets like Gemini and such they do in the in the event of fraud or manipulative behavior they then can exercise direct supervision but generally speaking these markets are not they don't have that layer of exchange coverage and that's why an SRO is super important here and it's further compounded by the fact that there's a lot of retail consumers in this market it's a very retail driven market so unlike other commodity cash markets where like agriculture energy where it's a lot of sophisticated players and it's big boy big girl rules we have a lot of mom and pops and people who are getting into this this the world of crypto which is phenomenal and fantastic and it's probably the first time that Wall Street's going to be the last people into the deep end and it's a great sort of inversion and opportunity for people to get access to this amazing asset class but we need to have some some cupboards and protections so that is definitely the goal whether it gets there is another question but that's the goal so obviously regulation is a huge theme of this podcast and I just feel like this is kind of this demarcating line that I'm seeing in the crypto space in general but there are a lot of companies that have opted out of the kind of strict regulatory regime that you guys choose to operate in and the bit license I guess is you know one really big example of that but a lot of those companies that have opted out they have much higher trading volume than in exchange like Gemini and I guess I would say you know by Nantz is probably the prime example of this so how do you guys plan to compete with the likes of of an exchange like finance so I think it's a great point and a very true observation and we we view this very much as a marathon event were in the first or second mile if that some people are gonna sprint out the gate I mean you know I could probably lead the New York Marathon for a step even though I'm not a marathoner and so I think this is a long game that is very true and core to our values as a company we we often talk about you know we're not building a unicorn we're building a Centurion we're trying to build a company that lasts for 100 more years if you look at some of the most established and trusted institutions out there State Street being one of them it's it's a double Centurion whatever if there's another term for the head but it's over 200 years old and and that's that's what we're playing for and so look if we could cut and go offshore and didn't have to follow the rules we would probably have a lot more volume - but that's not the game we're playing for and we think that as more and more institutions and people come into the space they're going to they really will not interact with an unregulated offshore venue they simply won't and they simply can't and so we think you know that's the long term will be very competitive there are our mottos we're just trying to be the fastest tortoise in the race okay that's a great motto so I also wanted to ask because you wrote in a recent blog posts that your goal is to bring cryptocurrencies to the people and places that need it the most but I couldn't help but notice that your areas of operation are the u.s. the United Kingdom Hong Kong South Korea these are all very developed countries with high functioning financial services so how do you square that mission with what you've done so far great question so that's kind of one of the unfortunate I don't know if it's a tragedy of technology but the places that need it the least get it the first if you look at sort of the telecom and how that developed we got cell phones in the developed world really quickly used them but we had a lot of great other alternatives landlines and all that stuff the developing world you know they got it later but then they also had the benefit or they have the benefit of not having to lay all those copper lines and whatnot they can sort of leapfrog into that next that next level of technology so that's kind of that that is one of that's sort of where we are right now in many ways people didn't wake up you know in the US and say man like credit cards are so horrible why wish or is a better payment system than mo and PayPal are just not cutting it sure like we have we don't you know there's there's issues with them and we can do better but we're not ring from hyperinflation or the the real problems of the economies in in other parts of the world but we'll get there and and and the Gemini dollar can get there right now and all you need is an internet connection so it's it's definitely a long-term goal of our company we believe that there will be you know there is a value revolution going on right now it's going to reaaargh attack the Internet we've all sort of thought about the decentralized web web 3 what that looks like and and and getting you know banking the unbanked is a huge piece of that future and we're going to get there but it probably you know it's not going to happen right away but that's that's a goal and I also wanted to ask about your listing process you guys have been even more conservative than coinbase in terms of adding new assets and I didn't know if part of that had to do with the regulation so it's just curious you know you know what is the process for deciding which new coins to list and how does that affect you know how quickly you can roll things out because like I couldn't help but notice that you launched Bitcoin cash trading in December but that was a month after the coin cash hard fork which I'm sure did not lend any more credibility or confidence in that cryptocurrencies so I sort of assumed that maybe you had started the process to add Bitcoin cash prior to the hard fork but that may be getting approval from the New York State of the Department of Financial Services may have held that up so can you describe the whole process for me yeah so we actually had approval for Bitcoin cash prior to the fork and we decided as a team that we were going to wait this work out rather than lists and then deal with the fork aftermath and a lot of that is just geared towards protecting our customers because if there isn't replay protection or there's some kind of funniness that you can't model out or protect against or anticipate as is the case with a lot of these Forks there's unfortunately not a ton of information and some exchanges are like an afterthought people in the different communities are so focused on the philosophical differences of their their different coins and the protocols and not about the realities of operating exchange and trying to support it so we said you know what we're going to wait this out and let the dust settle it probably costs us two months or maybe three months in terms of listing the coin there's no doubt lost revenue but it just didn't feel right putting it live with that risk hanging out there so we're really conservative and I think you know as we've we've said before we're just trying to be the fastest tortoise in the race who or not we're not trying to be any any faster than that but yeah so I don't like I don't know what standards coins have to meet in order to be listed but I just want so first of all what is that and then second did the hard fork kind of like you know I guess changed your perception of whether or not bitcoin cash met that standard so we we are developing an internal rules we haven't publicly sourced them or published them yet because they're still in process for each coin up to this point it's been a sort of a case-by-case situation we look at the the team the use case the proposition of the coin is it doing something unique or is it just another me too and is it truly you know solving an authentic problem that those are the general common-sense things that we look at and will it will it pass muster with with regulators obviously we listed Z cash we didn't attempt to list Manero and we felt that Z cash was the privacy coin that we could get our regulators comfortable with we are definitely looking at and thinking out of framework but what we don't want to do is publish a framework that we don't follow or that we have to unpublish or mend so we're being again super conservative I think you'll see something from us over the coming year but we're not quite ready to go live and I should also point out we never listed if you're in classic and we just haven't gotten comfortable with it and there is a 51% attack very recent yes yes super that was maybe one of the more insane things I've seen on my coverage so one other thing I wanted to ask you was you guys did an MA AMA on reddit and I couldn't help but notice there was this one question that I think was asked more than once that you guys didn't answer so I was gonna ask it here why should users use gem and I when coin based pearl has cheaper fees it's a good question so I think we are probably going to be updating our fee schedule in this quarter I think will be super competitive but we are more competitive than coin base in a lot of regards in terms of fees our mobile app fees are more competitive we don't charge four percent to redeem or stable coin they charge I think four percent on the USD C so it's it's not a it's not a correct assertion on the commenter all right and then the last thing I'm gonna aspect wasn't you guys secured insurance coverage for the digital assets and your online hot wallet so what does that mean exactly and what instances is does the insurance a plan for how much so we have coverage of the entire hot wallet we I don't think we've disclosed the amount but it's significant and I think that it is the most of any crypto custodian in exchange on the market and effectively there is not an infinite amount of appetite among insurers there's they're sort of an amount of coverage that that is out there and I think we did a good job of impressing them with the the underwriters that is with our cold storage system and our procedures and policies and protocols so I think we achieved the highest level that the highest aggregate amount and that applies if you guys are hacked or if there is like employee theft or something but it doesn't apply if I've lost my password my if my account was calm is that correct it it does not so if you were to have your credentials compromised it does not cover sort of your behavior but we have we forced two factor authentication so you'd kind of have to jump through some hoops on your end and make a lot of big mistakes to lose your credentials to a Fisher and I don't a phishing attack or a spear phishing attack I'm not sure if it was clear before but the insurance coverage covers the entirety of the assets that we hold on customers behalf in our hot wallet and so if our hot wallet has an incident or is hacked then it would be covered okay actually I do want to add one last question which is you guys have been largely if not completely self-funded do you envision ever accepting outside capital for your business and and also just out of curiosity how do Gemini employees feel about the lack of external capital raises and valuation milestones so we've always thought about raising capital and will continue to always think about it it's not something we're we're not into capital raise now we're not thinking about one anytime soon but we always explore options and every options sort of on the table but just because we haven't raised from you know Sandhill Road VC doesn't mean that our employees don't have equity value that is significant and we're not really we don't play this like oh we're chasing a valuation game we're just building sustainable value in a great company and like Cameron mentioned a company that lasts for over 100 years the Centurion our opinion everything else will fall into place equity value people doing getting rewarded handsomely for all their efforts that will come you don't have to raise money from like a third-party investor on Sand Hill Road and keep chasing valuation games for to get the same result so that's kind of our percents on a lot of a lot of companies raised money and that's like this thing that they prayed around and it becomes a lot of times it's like the last good thing they do and they've run out of money yeah and I think that um almost all of our core founding team the tenor first 10 to 15 people are still with the company 4 plus years Coast and and a lot of these people have moved well past the the four year vesting date and so we have a ton of institutional knowledge and cultural carriers in the company who have seen it grow from you know a ten person outfit to the two under person outfit today and and you know the human body I think every seven years we have like a completely regenerated cells and yet somehow you know every cell in your body down to your bones is is new and yet we retain our memory somehow I don't know how that works but Gemma and I we have our corporate memory and history and we have a tremendous amount of senior leaders and early people at a lot of the companies that have raised there is tremendous turnover and and there's not a lot of faces that have been there early on I think that counts for something it allows us to be really tight we're great at kind of communicating internally and understanding each other and being aligned and on the mission at hand alright well we'll check back in with you in a few years again I guess with the same roughly the same interval maybe not as long yeah maybe sooner we'll see we'll see well it's been so great having you where can people learn more about you and Gemini Gemini calms
