I almost quit doing this a few months ago actually I had done a lot of stuff with Celsius I'd actually found some original things that were cited in other other papers in coindesk and things and you know I kind of thought like well I've made my contribution to this I can just quit I just have too much fun doing this I've met so many interesting people and learned so many interesting things about real real Finance in addition to crypto and literally I know everybody I know people all around the world now because of this right so like I can't really stop now unfortunately maybe but in terms of time I mean I find I find time nights weekends whatever when this is your hobby when you have a hobby that you really like and care about like I don't really watch a lot of Netflix you know like I don't uh I'm way behind on reading books I'm really behind on like other things I like to do because this is basically what I do for fun
