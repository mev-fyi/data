hi all i just wanted to share with you a blurb that rao pal co-founder and ceo of real vision wrote about my book the cryptopians which comes out february 22nd he said laura shin brilliantly lays out the untold story of the rise of ethereum amidst the crazy times of the crypto boom of 2015-2017 a story of high drama played out in the big stakes world of cryptocurrencies and cutting-edge technologies with a cast of characters worthy of a thriller novel the only difference is that this incredible tale is all true and the hero of the story ethereum has gone on to even greater things this impeccably researched book is a must read for those wanting to understand the complexities and realities of creating one of the world's great technologies if you have not yet pre-ordered a copy

got crypto choose beefy alchemy pay is the pioneer of the world's first truly hybrid crypto and fiat payment network that makes real-world crypto payments easy secure and instant for both merchants and users alchemy pay bridging fiat and crypto economies today's guests are gwendolyn regina investment director of bsc growth fund and sami karim ecosystem coordinator at binance smart chain welcome gwen and sami thank you laura hey laura how's it going so i am curious about both of your backgrounds why don't you each tell the audience what it was that you were doing before working on binance smart chain and then how it was that you came to work there and what your current role is and why don't we start with you gwen sure so hi everyone really glad to be here so myself i would summarize my my background as having spent the last 16 17 years in the worlds of technology startup and media i've won several hats i've founded and and exited a tech media publisher i was super lucky to have founded also an early stage investment fund then global market expansion always a range of things but always in technology and again with media so just before bsc i was actually at a big tech company so facebook now mata where i was building a new kind of accelerator program for the asia pacific region and yeah so i joined bse a few months ago and it's been an absolutely great fight and sammy what about you what's your background and how did you come to bsc sure great to be here so my background was really in the enterprise software space so i was working on large-scale digital transformation projects mainly in the education space but also worked in other industries financial services healthcare oil and gas after that i went to consensus i was a consensus for two and a half years and then after that i joined the bsc core team uh supporting ecosystem growth so in 2021 binance smart chains started the year with roughly 350 000 daily transactions and 50 000 daily active users and there were about 200 decentralized apps by the end of the year you wrote in a blog post that binance smart chain was then at seven million transactions a day and 1.3 million daily active users with more than 1100 daps on the network so how did that growth happen yeah that's a good question so maybe i'll tell you a little bit about the backstory of how bse came to be uh so bse was a community project it was one of the ideas that the one of the developers in the finance chain team thought about would be an interesting experiment to do so at the time obviously all of the decentralized apps and d5 everything was really happening on ethereum midnight but we also saw that the infrastructure at that time wasn't able to support very large user growth and then obviously recurring issues with network congestion and resulting in high transaction fees so we thought about providing an alternative infrastructure so initially our targets we thought like reaching 30 percent of the transaction volume on ethereum maintenance would be success uh but given the growth of bsc kind of indicates the level of underserved demand that there really was so for us we were really focused on and thinking a lot about how do we develop and scale infrastructure that can support massive user growth so how do we bring in tens of millions and hundreds of millions of new users into crypto so we were really focused on on that and we wanted to do it in a way that would be chain agnostic language agnostic client agnostic but we did realize that the largest developer community and the most mature developer tooling and infrastructure was in the ethereum and evm ecosystem so we decided to launch bsc as the evm chain to allow developers to take advantage of all the developer tooling that exists but we just used a different consensus mechanism so it's using delegated proof of stake so that allowed for much higher scalability and of course much lower transaction fees so that's kind of the back story of how bse really happened there wasn't really a grand plan around you know reaching that level of users it just it just kind of happened organically based on the market demand and so for listeners who you know may have heard of binance chain can you just spell out the difference between finance chain and finance smart chain sure so binance chain supports or the binance chain team supports two independent but parallel blockchains so binance chain was launched in 2019 it's a tendermint tendermint based chain which was designed to run binance decks it's it's basically a single purpose chain so it doesn't have the ability to run smart contracts it's just purpose built for to run binance decks just highs high throughput high speed chains producing blocks every half a second and binance decks for the listeners who don't know it's a order book based text so because it doesn't have the ability for developers to build other applications there and that was actually we received a lot of feedback from the binance chain community after the launch of binance chain to be able to provide an infrastructure that developers could build applications on like a general purpose chain so those are and binance smart chain is an evm chain so supports developers to build a wide range of different types of applications on top and so as you mentioned bsc is built off a fork of ethereum's geth client and some of the other differences are that it has block times so about three seconds versus 13 seconds for ethereum and so i'm actually not sure what the maximum throughput is but based off the record number of transactions you've processed in 24 hours i thought maybe it was up to almost 200 transactions per second or something as opposed to about 15 for ethereum however there are only 21 validators as opposed to thousands for ethereum and those validators are chosen by 11 validators on finance chain at least as far as i understand so one of the main characterizations of bsc is that it has sacrificed decentralization for throughput and when i asked twitter for suggestions of what questions i should ask you to one of them asked oh you know if it's defy on bsc is that even d5 you know is it even decentralized so can you talk a little bit about why it is that bsc decided to make this trade-off and how you think about you know whether or not things are actually decentralized on finance smart chain sure so of course this topic comes up a lot in in the communities so when we're talking about decentralization i think it's also important that we talk about it in a way that's not binary on a spectrum right so of course bsc is not a maximally decentralized network when you compare it to ethereum mainnet so it does sacrifice some aspects of network decentralization to optimize for scalability but we have had a plan around progressively decentralizing various aspects around the network so validate your candidate diversity is one of them so in the initial period when we first launched and were trying to bootstrap the network the validator candidate diversity wasn't a high priority at the time but as the network grew the interest from validator operators and the community also increased very significantly so today there's quite high level of validator candidate diversity including for example bison trails which is owned by coinbase running a public validator on bse and and many others uh from the community running validators as well i think that's just the number of validators is just one aspect around the various important aspect aspects of decentralization but i think also it's important that there's choice for developers and users so for developers that require an infrastructure and their use case requires a maximally decentralized network that's available today with the ethereum mainnet but in order to really grow the number of users that can participate in defy it it became evident that there had to be alternatives and that that's the case today so you have uh for example take pancake swap which is the largest tax on bsc it's the largest number of users among any d5 protocol today so that was really only possible because of infrastructures like psc so i think it's important that there is more choice for for developers and users so i've seen that bsc people have talked about you know that you believe when it comes to the crypto space generally that there will be a multi-chain future can you talk a little bit more about what that will look like and how bsc will fit in yeah that's another topic we spend a lot of time thinking about as well so we do believe that the web 3 will be powered by an internet of blockchain and a network of networks and we're just seeing that start to emerge today so if you look at the number of evm chains it's growing rapidly there's a number of different ecosystems also continuing to grow and bring in net new users into crypto i think for us that's the most important thing so we're super happy seeing more infrastructures coming alive and bringing being able to support massive user growth we're also starting to see a lot more technologies around interoperability happening a number of different ecosystems i think that will also support the development of really cross-chain applications that aren't really possible today or that are not very scalable or effective from a cost perspective so i think supporting that type of innovation for us also is super exciting and important maybe i can also chip in here laura right to to kind of bringing that topic of multi-chain world from the investment point of view if i may so from an investment investment point of view for the bsc fund investment program when we look at projects and depths you know we also support a multi-chain well people ask us like hey are you only investing in projects to build on bsc and we're like no right we support a multi-chain well please build as many chains as possible right as many as you want that you think is relevant but yes we we do have a preference for hey please build on bsc of course we can offer you all the support you know for you to be engaged with the bse ecosystem but really we support a multi-chain world just to add another point here as well so the bsc chain ecosystem will also become increasingly multi-chain so if we think about how do we reach a billion users like what does a pathway to a billion users really look like the current chains and current architectures i don't believe will really be able to support bringing in a billion users into crypto um so we will and we are today already seeing that the current bsc chain is kind of reaching the the capacity or limits of the number of users that it can really support and for other types of applications if we look at gaming for example which probably has a pretty clear pathway towards hundreds of millions and eventually a billion users it requires different types of chain architectures it could be private charted chains or i don't think there's any kind of consensus yet on what are the type of architectures can really support that level of user scaling but we want to experiment with different types of chain architectures and provide the infrastructure that will allow developers to build those applications that will bring in hundreds of millions of users and eventually a billion users and so gwen when you were saying that you you know also invest in projects on other chains are you saying that they would be ones that build on multiple chains including bsc yeah so we have invested in some projects that are live mainnet on other chains and have a plan to build on bsc so that is good enough for us for now right because for us you know we are again fairly chain agnostic but really that um again we support the multi-chain world but the plan to bsc uh we prefer that to be in a picture because again we want to you know feed this that this team into the larger ecosystem because we can do so much more to help them be more engaged you know partnerships and stuff like that um of which um sami is leading those efforts as well and so in this multi-chain world how does bsc see itself like in terms of do you imagine that the chain will take on a particular niche like for instance it will be kind of more focused on either d5 or nfts or gaming or something like that or does bsc see itself as the dominant smart contract platform maybe we can start off and then sammy can join in right so you know i think ultimately we're all in this space because we like the paradigm shifting you know potential of the technology so for myself you know when i look at it i just really like innovation across the space right so when i look at depths and i look at what's going on it's really about hey let's grow the pie together again right so again the rising tide lifts off boats and so when it goes back to kind of what we're looking at in terms of like chain usage you know i think though the jury is still out so on our side we are focused on certain investment categories you know we also focus on how can we again on board the next billion users right the first billion users to crypto in general right and then of course we grow from that so when we look at those uh with that in mind we we are focused on finding more d5 projects advanced d5 you know nft gaming we announced um metaphy for example as a as a coherent thesis that we are looking at uh we are investing in that includes nft social phi dao enablers as one kind of project gaming for example right so we see several themes across um the domain and we believe that you know these will bring in much more the mass market so really bridging web 2 and web 3 as well so that we can get to the next billion users so um for us you know in terms of focus on a particular chain i mean we are from a technical aspect doing way more to support the different potential usages um but as for now i think the jury is still out sammy would have anything to add on that yeah i largely agree with that so i think the the current bsc chain i think will largely be occupied by d5 protocols and the deep majority of defy activity will stay on the current bsc chain and then other infrastructures and other chains that we launch and support will be used for other types of use cases primarily so gaming to congregate on gaming projects to congregate on certain chain infrastructures uh other types of applications on on other infrastructures so the game gaming chains for example will be more suitable for gaming applications they might have significantly lower transaction fees so today the transaction fees on the current bsc chain is around 30 cents so probably not that suitable for the majority of gaming applications but the future chain infrastructure is likely to be fractions of a cent so much more suitable for those types of use cases uh but ultimately it will be up for up to developers and users to decide and i think um i'll add on to that as well right so to bring in that the whole idea also of you know sami mentioned transaction costs and speed right so we talk about security and stuff like that as well like i'm not sure whether the different use cases again require the same level of choice in some sort of variables of trade-off again so i i also align with with sami so i think what that just to make the point that i think for us you know um we look at the future and there's still a lot to be written i think you know there are certain directions you know we are going and the world and the ecosystem across the chains is going and yeah it's exciting to see how that will evolve and at the moment what kinds of developers would you say are choosing to build on bsc as opposed to other smart contract platforms and kind of on the flip side of that among the full universe of crypto users who would you say is the typical bsc user i think it's pretty varied so starting on the first question i think today we're seeing the bulk of development activity and projects uh still a lot of stuff happening in the d5 space we're seeing very significant growth happening in the gaming space we're seeing some projects in the social phi category and then others like in the longer tale that are looking at use cases around institutional digital assets um and other types of use cases uh user profile it's it's difficult to to categorize i think it's super broad right now because we've seen user growth really globally across almost every country and also the types of users as well are also quite broad but i think it has bsc the current bsc chain has the ability to support a much wider range of user profiles including users which much smaller net on chain net asset values and so i actually you know earlier when i asked you kind of what the focus would be i actually thought you guys were going to say gaming because i did notice that gaming makes up over 50 of transactions on bsc and i also saw that the growth fund announced a program in early december with animoka brands to invest 200 million dollars into gaming projects on bsc so why you know have you kind of put that focus there especially since you were saying that you felt the current chain can't really support that kind of activity i think it's been really driven by what's happening in the market generally so i think if you look at this year the axi infinity stories really captured the imagination of a lot of people and that's also driven a lot of the activity from the developer community as well it hasn't been like something that's intentional intentional or that we've been trying to drive it's just happened organically so i think we've seen a lot of inbound demand from game developers and and different a range of different types of game studios more traditional game development firms that are looking at developing blockchain games and they're coming to bse because they do see the largest number of users there among other factors to add on as well like gaming is in the real you know web 2 world it's such a big use case and it's something that's really captured the masses really for like a better word right and so when we see that again the taking off of the axis xc and then axis of the wannabes right and other games you know really um having a way more users we really see this trend as like hey this is a really great use case how can we capitalize on it to again offer users more choice more options for games but for chains for example as well and much more youth a better user experience right so gaming is one focus because of that because it all leads back to our goal of onboarding the next billion users but that doesn't mean that we don't focus on other things because when we talk about crypto it's about financialization of of many industries right so we are looking across the space you know we talked and sammy mentioned a few categories we look at right so we've talked about the innovation and the kind of developers building on it we see just many different kinds of of teams you know we've seen uh people building ai as well for example we invested recently in in a project that enables nfts to be ai infts intelligent nfts right they're super interesting elephant so we we see a really a range of developers building on bsc and so you know as we mentioned earlier at the moment probably with the throughput that's available on bsc gaming probably may not be able to take off um to the same extent it could in in the future so at this moment what is bsc's scaling solution or or plans for scaling yeah so we are looking at what the future looks like from infrastructure perspective we know that we or we want to experiment with different types of chain architectures i think in the short term the community can expect to see private chartered chains that will be primarily occupied by gaming projects and then later other types of l2 solutions and other types of chain architectures could be chains that are not evm as well so basically we want to serve the developer demand whatever that might be so we'll run a number of different types of experiments and focus on how we can really support the scaling from an infrastructure perspective i also wanted to ask so gwen you know you've been talking a little bit about how you've been deploying the one billion dollar growth fund can you just talk a little bit more so we talked about gaming like what what other kind of are your top priorities and how are you looking at different projects that you are you know eyeing for investment yeah so i would take a step back first and kind of give a rough overview of the one billion uh growth fund so we have four pillars that we segmented the one billion into so this is to target different uh people involved in the ecosystem so the first 100 million goes to talent development this basically means we want to really educate um more people about the ecosystem about crypto and blockchain so this means working with with higher level like institutions you know to educate again our into r d projects as an example we have 300 billion focused on incubating and working with the top depths and builders so that's primarily through our most valuable builder program so it's an accelerator and recently we just announced mvb season four where this time it's going to be investment focused as well so that's how we're deploying the funds where we want to bring in a top depth and this time also newer depths right who are much more innovative and we want to hey you know put uh more funding behind you investment money behind you but also incubate you and another bit another part of the pie is uh 100 million for liquidity incentives so this is really to kind of incentivize our depths to help them you know we want to see long-term vision um in terms of how they will grow how they can uh we can help them provide sustainable liquidity we kick them off but we really want to see them you know have a concrete plan to make sure that their debt is sustainable and is growing as well and the last bucket is 500 million with dedicated to investments this is where is is where i kind of talked about earlier as well in terms of mattifying stuff like that where where we do direct investments so over um the last year or so since the bsc started deploying on distributing capital we've made a 40 over investments into again various projects everything from infrastructure web 3 infrastructure to web and dev tooling to the different depths like again d5 game 5 um and you know more innovative this one so we're looking as again more social phy as well and so here we've been talking all about binance smart chain which of course has the name binance in it can you talk a little bit about how binance was involved you know from the beginning and then what its current relationship is to bsc yeah so bse was you know sammy briefly kind of mentioned it earlier right so bse was kind of an initiative essentially from the binance chain team and it got huge huge support from from binance but now we know really it's it's run you know autonomously you know we are looking at the bsc on our own like this is the bse core team and for the one billion dollar growth fund um where did that money come from sponsored by binance yeah i can just add in here so because uh bse of course like transaction fees and uh the validator notes taking is is all denominated in bnb so obviously binance are huge supporters for us and ncz as well as a massive supporter and advocate for for for bsc but i think we've reached the stage where we're also progressively decentralizing that part as well where we become more community driven and and run more independently and may have other organizations and groups supporting bse in the same way that that finance does in the future so you talked about bnb and that used to be burned every quarter based on the profit of binance however the i guess algorithm you could say or the or the calculation by which the bnb would be burned recently changed can you tell us how that's now determined yeah sure so uh we it implemented recently a real-time burn mechanism so it's similar to the mechanism on eth main net in which eath is burned um so using the same mechanism on on bsc so it's basically based on the transaction volume uh that's happening on on bsc mainnet which is burning bnb in real time all right so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about some of the features and potential issues or problems with bsc but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible alchemy pay is the pioneer of the world's first truly hybrid crypto and fiat payment network that makes real-world crypto

to my conversation with gwen and sami so as we have mentioned earlier binance smart chain was forked from ethereum however also some of the main dapps on bsc were forks of uh applications on ethereum such as pancake swap being a fork of unisua venus being copied from compound and maker dao et cetera i mean there's another one uh that's popular called autoform which is a copy of urine and so what do you have to say to people who criticize bsc and the applications on it for just being copies of ethereum and its popular smart contracts i would say that when we look at it when we look at the space you know um ethereum was was the the first you know computer programmable blockchain right so the smart contracts uh chain a platform and it's done immensely well right so it's amazing the amount of innovation that's happened there but at the same time when we look at the growth of the entire ecosystem and the growth of what's happening on bsc there's also been a lot of innovation you know we've got like dairy protocol for example doing everlasting options you know with i mentioned earlier for example lethal you know doing intelligent nfgs so we've got a lot of developers building you know new stuff and kind of thinking like from the ground up what they can do with with web3 essentially so i would say that you know for us what we're looking at again is always like it's not just bsc we're looking at innovation in the space and we want innovation to thrive across the all the chains yeah i'll just add on that so bse is a public permission list chain so anybody can deploy contracts on there of course we're trying to provide some guidance to the developer community but a lot of those projects that you mentioned are community projects so they're just i think at the time when if we go back to d5 summer 2020 uh when really compound the launching comp kicked off like the whole yield farming and massive growth of tvl in in d5 there wasn't really alternatives like everything was happening on ether net and like a lot of users were being priced out like fifty dollars hundred dollar transaction piece of time um so when the bsc infrastructure was launched developers and users started to see that there's an alternative here and then that started to grow very rapidly as well um so i think the defy ecosystem for sure on bse for sure was leveraging a lot of the innovation that was happening on on on ethereum but today there is a lot of innovation happening on bse as well in the infrastructure space in the d5 space and others as well in early 2021 many transactions on bsc were failing and people were tweeting screenshots of contracts that for instance had 680 000 failed transactions within 17 hours and even recently uh last week when i asked people on twitter for questions that i should ask you somebody named the defy avenger replied is bsc broken i bridged for two projects recently and got more failed transactions than all my other defy experiences combined on eth pali and avalanche transactions that did go through on bsc were very slow not going back there again so why are there so many failed transactions on bsc yeah i think that's a fair question so i think over the last one year or throughout 2021 when we went through different growth patterns we had some periods where there was all-time high network transactions was around i think 13 million but we did have a lot of challenges in supporting the scaling of the infrastructure so i think inherently evm architecture was not really designed for that lev that transaction volume and a lot of the infrastructure as well like data indexing and a lot of others it's not only about the block consensus but all the other infrastructure and tooling to support that transaction volume was never really designed for that purpose so there was a lot like a very steep learning curve for the whole developer community for a lot of the infrastructure providers but i think the the current situation is that the tooling and infrastructure has reached a level where we can support the the current and transaction volume even if it goes to 13 million transactions daily transactions or even beyond but it was kind of a difficult and painful learning process but i think today all the other evm chains can also leverage a lot of the improvements that have happened across that infrastructure and tooling stack uh to be able to support that that level of user growth uh so definitely it's been it's been a kind of steep learning curve uh but has allowed us to kind of reach a point where we're able to support the scaling of infrastructure uh to where it is and much beyond there have also been a lot of hacks on various bsc protocols in march meerkat on bsc was drained of 31 million dollars possibly by the team itself in april uranium finance lost 50 million dollars in may an attacker stole 45 million dollars from pancake bunny and the bunny token then basically collapsed in may there was possible price manipulation on venus which cost 200 million dollars worth of liquidations there was the squid game token named after the popular tv series and that appears to have won been one big giant rug pull coindesk eventually reported that some bsc users had just left the platform completely due to concerns about the safety of their funds and i did also see that after may bsc or rather that inmate bsc had accounted for 20 of all d5 total value locked but now it's only six percent so is bse doing anything to address these issues or can it very good question so i think definitely there has been lots of exploits but it's not unique to bsc i think it became a very attractive target for the black hats and the malicious actors in this space due to the large number of new users their large tvl in a lot of the d5 protocols but there hasn't been there isn't really any way to kind of prevent that it's really about user education so it's about educating users around how to evaluate risk educating the developer community around how to think about security and security best practices on the technology side we are starting to see some innovative solutions on how to kind of prevent so like early detection systems there's some really interesting innovations happening in memphis technologies that allow transaction simulations to detect large asset balance changes and do these kind of technology types of solutions but ultimately i think the main the most important one is around education for both users and developers and on that point for the education bit uh laura so this is where as well under you know our efforts you know we're sponsoring hackathons we under the talent program development program we want to educate both a retail user as well as incoming developers and talents to the space more as to how security again is so important right as you said funds and many people have been exploited so we really want to make sure that the next depths that are being built as well have great usability because usability is one way in which you help the users you know be more secure right so the users can you know we can educate the users but if the depths can also do their part right by making their systems just less likely to make mistakes i think that would be they'll be cool so i think when we're looking at you know different efforts again across uh the space as to how can we increase the level of education um and security sami when you were talking about the technological solution so let's say that there is some kind of attack happening at that moment say with a flash loan are you saying that somehow the technology could stop that in in mid transaction or like how would that work because also there probably would be some legitimate uses that might get caught in that so yeah i just would like to hear a little bit more about that yeah so a number of these solutions are still in different stages of r d but there there was two exploits recently that happened outside of the bsc ecosystem but basically the way that those works is it's basically like an early detection system so there's bots that are monitoring tornado and any any addresses that are funded through tornado any contracts being deployed by those addresses they'll analyze the events there and then provide like early detection or warnings to the project teams of those particular d5 protocols so that's one of the types of technologies that are being developed and there's others as well but i think the those types of technologies will help to grow the whole defy ecosystem in a more anti-fragile way so i think a lot of the exploits that happened over the last year were also indicative of the kind of nascent stage of where d5 is at the moment and kind of a lot of the challenges that need to be addressed we also leverage a lot of partners lara so you know we we work closely with certic pack shield we have a bug bounty program for example we also work closely at rock dog you know so security is important so not just on the technical side of things but also through partnerships so there was a recent github post that called out that the chain isn't being run very well and it was saying basically the developers working on the protocol are not doing a good job it began this is a blockchain with supposedly billions of value yet it is governed and developed like the project of a stoned teenager and then they wrote several bullet points there is no code review patches are simply committed in most cases even without a proper description of what they do or what problem they try to solve there doesn't appear to be any reasonable testing process in place every update appears to make things worse there is zero responding to bug reports hundreds of people report non-sinking nodes or nodes falling out of sync response from the developers zero there is no beta testing stuff is thrown over the fence and it goes on there's a more but i won't uh you know read the whole thing but they concluded the root cause of the problem is that you mindlessly increased the block size and reduced the block time without doing the actual work required what do you have to say to these criticisms yeah i think some of those criticisms are valid so i think the uh for sure it's acknowledged the developer community uh the bse developer community faced lots of challenges on some on running their own nodes and a lot of infrastructure related challenges i think it's also really due to the current architecture right so geth was not really like we really pushed the the limits of how much death could be used and so there's a number of issues around that but we are seeing today as well a number of awesome community driven initiatives for example the work that's happening uh with the aragon client team on developing a bsc compatible aragon client that will be able to support the operation of much easier operation of full and archive nodes uh by developers but i think for sure as well like we're constantly trying to improve and we're being supported by awesome developers in the community to drive a number of these initiatives and actually i would say also like we welcome these candid posts right this is how we we improve you know how our team gets feedback as well we we you know we think feedback is a gift right and you know i think this also helps the entire ecosystem so candid feedback is welcomed yeah i would also encourage so in that same post for listeners that can find it one of the bsc core developer teams also wrote a quite detailed post which provides some really good insights around some of the stories and backstories around launching and then scaling scaling bsc so would highly encourage listeners to also check it out and so it sounds like you feel like it's more of a technological issue with kind of like pushing the boundaries of geth because you know the way that this post was written it really seemed like they were saying it's more of an organizational process type issue it's not really that it's more around the infrastructure challenges and i do i do understand the frustrations for a lot of the developer community would have faced over the last year but there's a lot of initiatives happening on how do we really um support the scaling of infrastructure with this level of user growth and and transaction volume and the current usage and where we really want to go as well so i think for sure there's been tons of issues on the infrastructure side but i think there's a lot of initiatives and how do we really support the sub address these in the short and medium long term and i think in the long term as well you know lara we again we mentioned that we're trying to get a 1 billion right our all-time high for bsc was 2.27 million there's a long way to go so we have a lot more things to do right even on the technical side we are aware of that and we are the team is is looking into that another user wrote on github uh their name was null cubit and they talked about a bsc transaction in which it appeared that a validator prioritized a transaction that had a gas price of zero and that the validator then received a transfer of bnb which null qubit speculated was quote possibly as payment for the special treatment and in in the post they noted that there were many similar transactions with the same behavior and that the transactions weren't publicly visible from the transaction pool which raised the possibility that these were transactions that were submitted directly to the validators and then they wrote clearly there is an agreement between the originator of the transactions and the validators and the goal is to perform front running without risk and then null qubit noted that since the gas price was zero there was no burn and then they said it's possible that this is another thing these validators are starting to explore to bypass the burn feature and maximize their profits what is your response to this post so this is happening on a number of other ecosystems so there is like a growing market today for transaction ordering that started really on ethereum as well but it's happening on a lot of the other evm chains so there is growing market demand from professional traders and others and these types of use cases i think this type of activity will grow like there's growing market demand around it there's not really much we can do to stop it like the it's really being driven by growing market demand okay so at this moment we probably i'm sure we're all aware there's very much a a heated competition at the layer one level and initially you know i would say that bsc was among the chains called an ethereum killer i don't even know if people are still really using that term anymore but one of the younger ecosystems than bsc which is terra recently overtook bsc as the d5 protocol with the second highest total value locked and so currently there's 17 billion dollars held in terra across 17 protocols versus 15 billion dollars for bsc across 277 protocols why do you think that this has happened i think it's largely driven by the what's also happening in the market given the appreciation of of luna so if you look at the defy ecosystem on ontario it's quite concentrated on a few on a few daps but i think it's great generally like the growth of d5 across other ecosystems gonna support bringing many new users into into crypto generally so i think more chains more infrastructure more new users are all all really awesome uh for the space generally like i wouldn't really don't really like to get into like the comparison type of thing and i think like tvl and d5 is like one metric you should look at like a number of different types of metrics too including users unique active addresses unique active address growth community size growth and a number of others to get a really more representative view of what the user growth for any type of infrastructure really looks like and so some critics perceive that bsc has taken off because of the high fees on ethereum and obviously also because of the throughput issues there but if ethereum scales and also brings down transaction fees then what place would you see in the market for bsc it's great for all of us i think like you know ethereum going to 2.0 you know really just would make the entire ecosystem you know much more friendly and i think the space for all because again we're only at like 200 300 million crypto users in the world right there's just so many more billion to go so so for myself like super excited to see the progress because for ourselves also we have and it's sammy said earlier about some of our technical plans we have so much more to achieve and with so much to do as well so it's exciting actually and sammy did you want to add anything on that yeah i think the emerging layer 2 ecosystem as well is also going to help to support bringing many new users into crypto providing more choice for developers as well i think eventually we'll love to be able to leverage the expertise and experience that we've gained in supporting the growth of the bse infrastructure to also the power the growth and scaling of of other ecosystems and other chains okay but yeah i mean i just wonder if in that world obviously ethereum will be perceived as being more decentralized and then bsc will not have those advantages of the higher throughput and and cheaper fees but you know i mean even even now i would say that if bsc is kind of like competing on those factors that then solana even at the current moment kind of maybe is a more appealing choice for developers because it also offers higher throughput it also offers lower fees but it is still more decentralized than bsc so what would you say you know is the appeal to developers who are still looking for that kind of environment so i think if we look at the the landscape and the situation today just based on the number of users on bsc which is larger than all of the other evm chains combined is what's really attracting the developers to come and build projects on the current bsc infrastructure so i think as other chains and user growth continues to accelerate as well developers will ultimately have more choice but also users will i think eventually congregate and do the majority of their activities on chains based on different preferences so it could be access points it could be a number of other factors it could be where their favorite nft marketplace is so uh ultimately i think the important thing for users is also the freedom of choice but also freedom for the assets to be able to move from like if nfts are issued natively on x-chain be able to move those nfts to chain y where their favorite nft marketplaces and ultimately having more freedom for and choice for the users so as i mentioned on twitter i solicited questions for both of you and one of them a startrade7 asked since binance just has 21 validators what happens if the authorities decide to shut down binance smart chain i think that would be pretty difficult because the validator candidate diversity today is like there's a number of validators that are being run by groups that we don't know the identities of those operators so i think it will be pretty difficult i'm not sure really how the execution or enforcement could really happen okay yeah so i guess we would have to see so last spring cypher trace which disclosure is a past sponsor of my shows signed on to apply its transaction tracking and wallet attribution software to bsc what exactly does that mean would d5 and bsc be more similar to using a centralized service which has a typical kind of know your customer process no i think that's more related to being able to analyze certain addresses analyze certain transactions especially ones that are blacklisted or known to be connected to certain types of malicious applications or it's more related to that side it's like the driven more by compliance requirements for certain exchanges to be able to integrate with that type of infrastructure another question that i received on twitter was funk e 0tx asked what happened to binance bridge will it be replaced or put on ice for good so and when you answer can you explain what binance bridge is and then answer the question sure so binance bridge is a one of the many types of bridges supported by bse currently so binance bridge allows users to bridge assets from a number of supported chains to bse and it was leveraging some binance infrastructure basically we saw that the majority of usage was happening on other bridges decentralized bridges and it was one of the key focus areas in the initial period of trying to bootstrap the network wanted to support a lot of choice in how users can bridge their assets to and from bse so we decommissioned binance bridge mainly because there was uh the majority of bridging of assets was happening on other bridges that are currently still operation and we're seeing more bridges come into production and being able to support bridging assets between a number of different ecosystems so finance bridges decommissioned it's no longer in existence it won't come back either one bridge we supported as well for example from the bsc fund is any swap right so we we support um yeah a lot of other projects out there infrastructure so after bsc's huge year of growth in 2021 what are the plans for the chain in 2022 yeah so we have a couple of initiatives that we're planning we want to launch a number of new infrastructures that will support user scaling for different domains so the first ones the communities can expect to see are for gaming specific chains so chains that are much lower transaction fees potentially the same block speed but will be much more suitable for gaming applications so later we'll also look at launching other types of and other chain architectures so we want to try and run a number of experiments and then the ones that we do see developer and user attraction for will support the scaling of the infrastructure for those but i think we want to try and really support and experiment with different types of chain architectures with the view of being able to support applications to reach hundreds of millions and eventually a billion users on the investment side of things uh we constantly are still looking for super interesting projects steps again across kind of the funnel right so everything from infrastructure to kind of next level up of tooling in general you know be blockchain tooling or just web tooling and really thinking about how to bridge web to web3 so we've made some new investments as well under the mattify thesis and category we haven't announced them but you'll see much more many more announcements soon at that space and we're looking for way more so i think one big theme in which we really are backing on for this year for 2022 it's really doubts right we've seen doubts uh take off in several different ways we think there's just so much more to be done with dolls right this is a new way of collaboration and yet it's not super easy actually to really start a doubt you know um so we want to again invest in more dell enablers you know and and just again in the space you know we always think about where will the mass use cases be right and so we do that through direct investments to something like our core investment partnership with animoka brands we're talking a few more big potential partners as well industry leaders to maybe do similar you know investment programs you know and could be a much more strategic partnership where we talk about investments incubation you know you know collaborating with different ecosystems for example so there's a lot more um plan for 2022 and it's super exciting yeah i agree with you i think dallas are going to be big this year i'm pretty excited about that all right look forward to our new investments laura we'll keep you posted please do all right well where can people learn more about each of you and your work so i'm on i'm
