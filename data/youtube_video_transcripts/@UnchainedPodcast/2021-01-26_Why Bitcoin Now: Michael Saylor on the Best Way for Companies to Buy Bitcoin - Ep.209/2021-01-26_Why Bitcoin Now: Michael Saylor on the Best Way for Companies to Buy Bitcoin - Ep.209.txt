michael saylor founder and ceo of microstrategy welcome michael thanks for having me since events and bitcoin move so quickly i want to let the audience know that we're recording on the afternoon of friday january 22nd this morning microstrategy announced it announced it had purchased another 10 million worth of bitcoin quote in accordance with its treasury reserve policy micros microstrategy already has 1.1 or had already purchased 1.1 billion dollars worth of bitcoin in 2020 that is now worth about 2.3 billion dollars is the treasury reserve policy simply to allocate any excess cash to bitcoin yes um we keep a certain amount of working capital in u.s dollars or in the local countries in yen and juan and euros where we need it and generally we target about 50 million dollars and then anything we generate from the business uh in excess of that we work to sweep into our treasury and then as soon as practicable we convert it into bitcoin and why did you decide to do that that's you know obviously quite a different switch from how pretty much any other company out there works so why did we adopt bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset you know i think that if uh if the u.s dollar was debasing at the rate of five percent or less a year at two percent my perception laura by the way was the us dollar was pr was debasing at two percent a year you know the inflation rate is two percent people preach we will not allow inflation to be more than two percent so if you just listen that you think well i guess cash is maybe losing two percent of its value or one percent of its value or you know jerome powell says we can't get inflation we don't have any inflation yet so the average person would maybe think that the u.s dollar didn't lose two percent of its value this year and that was my perception for a decade and i think um the jarring k-shape recovery that started in march caused me to question all of my premises and all of my beliefs about macroeconomics i mean i mean let's be honest right you run a software company you're not really a macro economist right you're not really thinking about macroeconomics asset classes currency trading currency devaluation monetary inflation i didn't know what i couldn't have told you the difference between m1 and m2 money supplies or the rate of monetary expansion in february of this year it just i could have preached to you all day long about apple watch i could have told you what i thought about the the transformation of mobile devices and wearables and phones and how it's going to change politics and sociology i care about tech i didn't really pay attention to money so i think that march was a jarring wake-up call and what i well you know somewhere along the line i started reading macroeconomics and i discovered safety's book the bitcoin standard and then i started looking at the rate of monetary expansion then i realized it was about five and a half percent for the last decade and then i realized the asset inflation rate was five and a half percent the cost of capital was five and a half percent and everything clicked and then i realized that the cost of capital jumped to 25 this year and everything double clicked and then i realized the cost of capital was going to stay at 15 or more and then i realized that if we didn't do something we were screwed yeah so uh you know then despair sets in or despondency and and um you know if if everybody had confidence in the currency and they have confidence in their asset strategy there's no need to do anything different when you have a crisis of confidence you have a crisis of confidence in a country you leave the country right i mean if you had all your money in argentine pesos at some point you lose confidence if you lost confidence in venezuelan boulevards at some point you realize you got to leave i think this was a crisis of confidence when we saw the k-shape recovery and at that point i realized i either needed to invest the money wisely or i needed to give it back to the shareholders and uh the giving it back to the shareholders is like it's a it's a nice flippant thing to do but you know then you decapitalize the company and then you have no assets and if you run into if you run into a business crisis you become insolvent and you're bankrupt and then things get really bad so we decided we had to come up with a treasury strategy we were forced to by monetary circumstances and bitcoin uh looked to me and to the company to be the most rational highest quality technically most perfected asset if your goal is to hedge yourself against monetary inflation and is this money then that you don't imagine that you'll need to tap at any time soon because so i know um bitcoin can be volatile in both directions but let's say it was a bear market then it's like that kind of like long-term investment money that you just don't feel like you're gonna need to touch yeah the decision was made easier for us because we're about a 500 million dollar company and we were generating 25 to 30 million in free cash flow in feb per year in february but when we went through the lockdowns and and the transformation to what i'll call the virtual wave all of our all of our marketing sales and services dematerialized virtually and we started doing things via zoom online our microstrategy world cost three and a half million dollars last year and this year i couldn't spend the money even if i wanted to spend the money that's your annual conference yeah yeah it costs three and a half million dollars to collect 2500 people in a room now think about how much you spend to collect 2500 people in a room well um here's a good factoid for you are our business travel and entertainment expenses year over year it decreased by what percentage do you think 99 98 98 okay it's a lot of money so so to make a long story short the uh the company's cost structure compressed our cash flows expanded and all of a sudden we realized we're going to generate not 25 million a year probably more like 75 million a year and so we we're cash positive what's the second observation you can't use you can't throw people at the problem anymore hiring 10 000 people to knock on doors doesn't work if there's nobody behind the door they're not going to answer the door right you can't throw money at the problem the you know you don't throw money at the problem you throw intellect and acumen the world wants to see the most entertaining musician the most intelligent analyst the most charismatic articulate communicator they you know and that's what moves so um we realized that we weren't going to spend that much money we couldn't spend that much money if the company's going to be successful it's because the software works and people want to buy it and you better do everything you can to make it less friction free right more friction free so brute force strategies that involve money and manual labor stop working we have a lot of money we have 500 million dollars in cash we have the at the expectation of generating another 500 million dollars in cash so there's a billion dollars in cash and cash flow and you know i guess the you know good news bad news is i give you a billion dollars and the bad news is it's not going to be worth anything in five years or ten years it won't buy anything houses went up twelve percent year over year so you have to make 12 more to buy the same thing you could have bought last year so why do we adopt this strategy well well we have cash we're gonna have cash you can't use cash to grow the company anymore what can you do with the cash you can either buy the stock back you can dividend it back to the shareholders or you can invest it what are you going to invest it in well how about uh an asset inflation hedge that you you can't make any more of pure monetary energy now did we actually consider buying the stock sure we did we actually uh tendered to buy back 250 million dollars worth of stock uh at the same time as we bought the bitcoin uh it was the 250 million dollar acquisition of bitcoin in a 250 million dollar tender offer and the idea was give every shareholder that disagreed with the strategy of investing in bitcoin the opportunity to exit their equity position at a profit was a dutch auction with the premium so uh some people did most didn't we took the excess cash we invested in bitcoin you know and if bitcoin was trading at 10 000 right now we would have 500 million dollars of bitcoin and be waiting to see how the strategy works out but bitcoin traded up and it's more than that and so now we've we're i mean our treasury now is uh up 1 billion 300 million dollars the stock is up we have we now have a balance sheet which is in excess of like 2.3 billion dollars a bitcoin and now the question is what happens with bitcoin right i mean a business is two pieces uh your right hand your left hand the right hand is your p l your left hand is your balance sheet okay so you can grow the business by growing the p l twenty percent a year or thirty or fifty or a hundred percent a year if you're genius that's that's hard but i mean you can do it that way you can also accumulate shareholder value by growing the balance sheet by 10 20 30 a year if you told me bitcoin was going to grow by 20 a year i would think well if you're going to grow by 20 a year and you have 2 billion on your balance sheet then you're going to generate 400 million dollars in in investment income or or uh or shareholder wealth in the 12 months that's a lot easier than doubling well if we doubled the revenue of the company we still couldn't do that right right like we would have to increase the revenue company by a factor of five yeah okay so you know there you can compete that way or compete the other way i mean some people you know some people kind of get irked like it's like you're cheating by making money an easy way well everybody on wall street's making money that way and every financial company on earth is like making money by by holding or trading assets or using their balance sheet every bank does right so we simply adopted a strategy that would allow us to create shareholder value which is good for the employees good for the shareholders good for the brand good for the product nobody wants to buy software from a company where the stock is going to zero nobody wants to work for that company either right well one thing that's so curious to me is so you heard about bitcoin quite a long time ago and famously tweeted back in 2013 quote bitcoin's days are numbered it seems just like a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling so i'm so curious because you know i just feel like a lot of people have this story where they start out as critical and then suddenly they kind of have a light bulb moment and i was wondering what was it that someone said to you or what was it and how they explain it to you that finally made you a convert was it literally just the pandemic or was there something else i don't think we'd be here if it wasn't for the pandemic it's the events of march of 2020 i think there was a catalytic month the k-shape recovery the lockdown of main street and the rapid recovery of wall street forced everyone to review their assumptions about the way economy works and the way you create shareholder value and uh so that was uh that was critical i think the the economic response of um of the bankers was kind of critical right i mean if the cost of capital goes from 5 to 15 that's a catalytic event i it's very difficult to generate shareholder value when the hurdle rate is 5 the risk premium is 4 percent you have to get an eight percent yield or an eight percent increase in cash flow every year in order to create shareholder value and if you can't get eight percent or more cash flow growth what can you do you can leverage up you can borrow a billion dollars buy back half your stock and you can take a four percent cash flow growth company and make it look like eight percent and so you can almost make that work from 2010 to 2020 right and so you look at every publicly traded company or every company you you can imagine how you know how do you make stocks hold value you leverage up how do you make real estate whole value you refinance which is leveraging up how do you make bonds hold value you refinance them how you do that you keep lowering interest rates if you can lobby in order to get the bankers to lower the interest rate from five percent to four and a half to four to three and a half to three to two and a half you're leveraging up the bonds as you're leveraging up the real estate and then you're leveraging up the companies and you can use that to take a five percent grower and make it look like a 10 or 15 percent grower arguably apple did that in the last few years if you look at apple's apple's revenues are flat for three years its stock has doubled right its uh cash flows were fairly flat but it was buying back its shares so that's one way to be successful the other way to be successful is to be google or facebook or amazon what they did is they grew 20 top line and 20 bottom line so if you're growing 20 percent top line and bottom line in an environment where the cost capital is 5 that works right you hold that stock you made money that was a good trade now what happens to every stock where you can't leverage up and you can't grow more than the cost capital they don't hold value okay so it's interesting until 2020 but in march of 2020 it became um untenable right because whatever you think you might have done at five percent cost of capital when it goes to 15 or 20 percent cost to capital and you're fully leveraged up and the interest rate is at near zero at that point how many companies are there in the world how many companies in the s p 500 can grow their cash flows and their revenues 25 like it from from now from this point right right i mean it's it just is impossible right one percent five percent last year maybe it was like zoom nine ninety percent can't so coming back to my observation right when do people discover new ideas when you're faced when you're forced into a corner when your back is in a corner when do people make paradigm shifts in a war when they die or when there's a war right when the old generation dies and that you know peter schiff's son likes gold right bill miller's son likes bitcoin right when when the new millennials the pair a new generation comes along they might get it otherwise you need a war and uh you know what was the war the currency war when i actually crank up the inflation rate of money by a factor of three or four then you can't ignore it so what do i think in 2013 look i didn't have a problem i was you know my i had a solution the solution was buy amazon buy apple buy facebook by google that was the investment solution and in business i had a business i was going to sell enterprise software and i had to i had a conservative treasury and we invested our money in in t bills and cash and you know laura i remember when you could get five percent interest on it on overnight money five and a half percent on uh on repos no duration risk no credit risk investment grade okay so that i mean there was a time when it would be rational and responsible for a public company's ceo to invest their cash in uh in in those treasury assets and then if you have excess cash you gradually buy the stock back and we did we bought back 300 million dollars with the stock like large sums and then you do your best to compete with microsoft oracle sap ibm and that's what you do well uh i think what happened is a the inflation rate went from five to fifteen percent b we saw a k-shape recovery uh extreme screaming success all the financial companies are doing great this year all of the you know service companies and main street companies you know are struggling if you happen to have a stock on wall street maybe you're getting a pass but if you're a private cash flow business and you're not financiable you can't get cheap money you're not right they're struggling so so you have that on one hand and on the other hand bitcoin matured i mean bitcoin was one two three years old you have to check the box will the irs give it property treatment uh will the sec deem it property that's a pretty big deal being property and not a security right you saw what happens with ripple when you're a security right it's illegal for cynthia alumnus to promote a security in congress whereas promoting property ownership in congress is the american way and so so that decision is it property or is it a security is pretty critical i think if you look forward you say bitcoin's been de-risked will it be forced well it was and we know what happened will it be hacked it wasn't will it be banned it hasn't been banned is there any rhetoric to suggest they'll ban it no except in china but you know you know what else china banned they ban google twitter facebook okay how how those trades do in the last decade so china is totally consistent they banned the information network they ban the mobile network they they banned the speech network and they're going to ban the monetary network and bitcoin's the monetary network and that just means in the western world in europe and the us bitcoin is going to be the predominant digital monetary network and then it'll be it'll have rails on it be right regulated in the same way that stocks and bonds are and when it is all the crypto anarchists will be freaked out that there's some regulation and all the people at black rock and pemco and fidelity that have more money than god will say okay well it's safe now we might as well buy a hundred billion right you know what i say to the crypto anarchist is why don't you just get along with the institutions and the corporations for now hold your nose and when you've made billions of dollars or tens of billions take all your money buy an island start your own country and do it your way just take but take the money first right like because there'll be time to do it your you could have an island with no taxes and and no and all privacy you do it exactly how you want it but wouldn't you be better i mean to get the hundred billion dollars first and then start the country then to have your privacy and then have no regulation and then and your bitcoin is worth like 42 dollars right it's like it's it's not that i don't believe i look i believe the ethos i'm a libertarian i'm all in favor of all of these all of these uh you know individual sovereignty and and the like i just i think there's a certain order to go about these things and the first order is make the monetary network successful yeah and then after that figure out what you're going to do and don't hate on square and paypal because they put some rails on on some part of the network it's like it's still going to benefit you as the hodler yeah right i mean grayscale is benefiting every hodler even though you know that's anathema you know it's not your keys it's not your coin but arguably grayscale is doing more for the bitcoin ecosystem than anybody because they're channeling huge amounts of institutional money into it right to the benefit of everybody um earlier you were talking about these kind of like pivotal moments where the paradigm uh changes and um so when i heard the news that microstrategy had first bought bitcoin the name was familiar to me and then i remembered how i knew it and you may um know what i'm going to ask you about but you know i knew microstrategy as the high-flying stock back in the dot-com era was a total tech darling and then it had this epic downfall that i was watching you know every day in the news seeing the stock price plummet you know after these accounting or regulatory irregularities were revealed actually by forbes which is um my former employer but at the time i was following this i was working the wall street journal and so i'll just recap for the audience it appears microstrategy and you can feel free to correct you know anything was booking revenue from deals that had just been inked uh but booking that revenue on its quarterly earnings to show a profit or sometimes at least the sec said even leaving contracts unsigned until after the quarter ended and then choosing which ones to sign to meet revenue targets and so after this was revealed and microstrategy redid the accounting it showed that the company had actually been losing money for the previous three years and so this was just in the news and i mean you were also quite the character like there was a profile of you in the new yorker and you know i remember uh yeah just uh you know you seemed like this larger than life figure and um at the end of that year microstrategy and the sec reached a settlement after the sec accused you of fraud and so frankly when i realized this was the same company and person that i'd followed all the way back then i was i was really amazed that also that you had stayed ceo so i wondered what was your takeaway from that experience well you know what they say about experience it's what you get when you didn't get what you wanted look that the restatement was a low point uh in the history of the company uh i'm not proud of it i learned a lot from it and uh i'm still here you know and uh i i think that uh it's probably not that much more i care to say about it it was 20 odd years ago was there anything about that experience that you think or do you think there's any link between what happened then and then your decision now to go all in on bitcoin uh no i don't think so um i i think that at all points in time for the last 30 years the company has grown by harnessing technology trends and we wouldn't have uh we wouldn't have become a public company if we hadn't actually harnessed uh open systems and relational databases and that was a new trend and we wouldn't have grown if we hadn't tapped into the power of the internet and that was a trend uh i launched a bunch of companies along the way like alarm.com and that was like a home automation trend alarm.com is a multi-billion dollar publicly traded company today uh like it was it was uh yeah it was like all the home automation things that google and amazon are doing but it was 20 years early we launched a company called angel which is like surrey and alexa it was another thing at every single point right if you don't embrace a new technology when the mobile wave came along we launched a bunch of new mobile software and that was how we grew and uh and so today there's a monetary network and if you want to grow you have to tap into the monetary network they're all just different waves of technology and paradigm shifts if anything uh you know what i what i learned from my experiences back in 2000 was be very careful right be very careful but you know it was difficult times right um 99 of the companies that we competed with are gone 99 of the ceos that i competed with are gone it's a 99 mortality rate and uh you know i learned a lot i did some i did a financing at one point didn't work out well the stock gyrated i learned to be careful about that i learned to be careful about many things but but you can't quit uh thinking about the world and you and you can't um you can't allow your past to keep you from charting the right future and uh i'm i'm quite sure this is the right thing to do i think the rest of the world will in time agree with me but laura at the end of the day uh public companies are required to take risks to grow the business right so so there are thousands and thousands of public companies there are some companies that don't wish to be software companies they think that's too risky there are some companies that won't be real estate companies i think it's too risky right the responsibility of a company is to chart a strategy communicate it transparently and then let people decide whether or not they want to buy from the company or they want to invest in the company and i think that we're very transparent about what we're doing and it may not be for everybody some people may not like the idea of bitcoin they may not believe it's a digital monetary network they may think that maybe gold's a better investment or maybe the us dollar is a better investment right they all are entitled to their opinion and they'll invest in companies and assets that uh are suitable for their outlook on the world all right so in a moment we're going to talk about kind of what happened after you made the decision that you wanted to allocate your capital to bitcoin but first a

cutting response time back to my conversation with michael saylor so you uh have your light bulb moment with bitcoin and you decide that this is what you want to do or where you want to put the company's excess cash when you proposed it to the board members and the company officers what was the reaction they were open-minded they wanted to get educated so first we started with an education process and it takes a while to to understand it and after the education process there was a consensus building process a lot of meetings a lot of discussions and then we developed a set of projects and we assigned some work for everybody to do and the cfo had his work and the general counsel had a different set of tasks and we considered all of the legal regulatory and operational and technical implications then we came back and met again then we formed a consensus that we were going to pursue in essence a dual strategy right the first part of the strategy was invest in bitcoin and the other part of the strategy was do a tender offer and then we executed that and so we didn't know how that would that would evolve right i mean when you have if you have publicly traded company it's not like you could just meet with the three shareholders you can't even meet with the 10 you can't meet with shareholders because they're changing every minute of the day from 9 30 to 4. so what we did was was we we announced the strategy telegraphed it allowed the market to digest it then we started to execute the strategy we had a 20-day tender period that was 20 days for the market to digest it again you're in a dance with the shareholders right because they could have tender 250 million dollars or they could have tendered none or they could have tendered some at different prices we don't know what will happen so after the tender offer was complete then we had better information and uh we knew we had 175 million dollars of extra cash we also had rotated the shareholder base we had a different shareholder base everyone that thought this was an awful strategy had either sold during the tender period or sold into the tender and those that stayed in the stock and presumably actually a lot of companies bought into the public float based upon the strategy right so you have a different shareholder base and you have a different capital balance sheet situation so at that point we announced uh that we were we were going to expand our scope and we are going to make bitcoin the primary treasury reserve asset without a cap right and that's that's a another important development then we move forward to acquire additional bitcoin with a new uh with a new shareholder base and from that point forward things evolved right we don't know how that the stock price evolves the bitcoin market evolves new things new developments present themselves and then we act accordingly and rationally yeah i mean in hindsight we can say your timing was extraordinarily good um but one thing that i was wondering is so that moment where you decided to not cap the amount you know like kind of a traditional way of looking at a portfolio is oh you would invest some percent like you know one percent two percent five percent ten percent in to uh uh what they would call a speculative asset like bitcoin and so what was that moment where you said okay it's not going to be like a percentage it's just like everything that we don't really need right at this moment um at the and i mean i know you kind of already answered it but is it literally just what you were saying about how cash is depreciating or was there any talk about trying to diversify or at the end of the tender offer i mean when we finished the tender offer and we knew the result of that we had a board meeting we made that decision and uh i i guess i would um i would take issue with your characterization that bitcoin is a speculative asset that's yeah i mean right that that's a value judgment or that's that's a that's a particular characterization it's a speculative asset if you think it is but if you think that you're going to lose 75 percent of your purchasing power by holding the dollar and bitcoin is the soundest money in the world and is going up 200 a year every year on average for a decade a rational person could conclude that in fact it's the least speculative thing you could do right so it just comes down to your point of view as for and and this this is a fundamental uh issue too for example if you were in argentina and you had all of your treasury and argentine pesos and i was on your board and you walked in and said mike the argentine peso is 10 pesos to the dollar but i think it's going to slide to 20 pesos to the dollar right and i think perhaps we should uh take our pesos and convert them into dollars before that happens or convert them into something else is that speculation i mean is that are you risking the company's balance sheet and then if you came if i said no just do half and you said but we're gonna lose the rest right i mean is it is it prudent and risk adverse to only do half what if i told you the peso was going to go from one peso to the dollar to 140 pesos to the dollar which is what happened okay that's what happened are you gonna sit and debate with how would you feel if i'm on your board and i say to you well laura you know i really don't think it's safe for you to convert half of your or 75 of your balance sheet to dollars i really think that's unsafe and you say but you know we're going to lose 99 of our wealth of our shareholder value i don't know it's a speculative well and now you're going to say well the dollar's not speculative well it kind of is speculative because i've had a company in argentina and let me tell you what happened when i did exactly that i converted the pesos to dollars and the government passed the law converting the dollars back into pesos devalued them ten to one i lost all my money right okay so it was speculative to convert pesos to dollars right so any decision you make with the treasury has some risk in hindsight the least risky thing i could have done was convert the money to bitcoin if i had actually converted the pesos to bitcoin and not converted the pesos to dollars right then i actually would have kept the value and we could go on to other assets right maybe i should have bought gold with it or bought forest land with it or something but but um this idea that it's a speculation is is based upon i don't know some it's some premise that people have in their head they think that it's it's therefore risky but if something's going up 200 a year on average for 12 years in a row at what point do you conclude that it's no longer riskier to hold it than to not hold it yeah i feel like you're like um one of the first people in the hyper bitcoinization wave where you know you think in bitcoin it's like andreas or like other you know i've had olof carlson we the founder and ceo of pollington capital he used to just do all his money in bitcoin as well um so one thing i was curious about so when you went to buy the bitcoin what were the most difficult points in the buying process you know what parts of the bitcoin industry do you think could need to kind of advance further to serve corporate investors well the two challenges that uh any institution or a company has when they're buying bitcoin or who do i trade with and then where do i store and that's somewhat related to the other decision you have to make which is am i going to buy the underlying asset and take custody of it or hold custody of bitcoin itself or am i going to buy into a fund i guess do i buy the bitcoin on exchange or do i buy grayscale or or an equivalent as a fund where i have the economic interest but in fact the fund manager has responsibility for trading and custody so um i there are different pros and cons with regard to those decisions and different companies will make different decisions based upon their own circumstances i think you just have to find the institutional grade funds or custodians and exchanges we're actually hosting a bitcoin for corporations conference and we're going to have 10 of those institutional grade vendors there and i'll be speaking you know either with the ceos or with their heads of institutional sales and the simple question is what do you offer for institutions what's the customer journey what kind of companies do business with you right what what advice would you have for them i think you know the growth of regulated entities is clearly a big plus right when fidelity came on board i mean all of the companies getting uh licensed by new york state et cetera that's been the financial authority that's been a good thing and uh as as uh more and more publicly traded companies and large multi-billion dollar institutions get involved they'll be interested in um in doing business with custodians or funds that that pass their accounting criteria where you're going to want to have your sock your sarbanes-oxley opinions and your and your sarbanes-oxley controls sock ii findings uh and they have to incorporate the fund or the custodians um annual report uh accounting control filings into their own 10ks or or their own annual report so so that development of a regulated audited normalized set of institutional vendors i think is pretty critical to the industry and it's been very helpful i don't think it wasn't there in 2013 obviously it wasn't in 2015. it's not even clear if it was there in 2018 i think really in 2019 and 2020 most of these things started coming online yeah so a microstrategy average purchase price was a little less than 16 000 and um right now you know the price is about 33 000 so you've more than doubled your investment and most likely by the end of the year we're probably going to be in some kind of bubble i imagine so the return will be even higher and you've said that you didn't buy the bitcoin to sell it um but would microstrategy ever take some off the table when you sense the market is at a top and then just buy in later when there's another correction or do you just plan to huddle through all the cycles you know and whether those you know whatever 80 down turns when the crypto markets are in a bear market yeah again i i just disagree with your characterization i don't expect an 80 downturn i don't think it's a speculative asset and i don't think you can you can quote unquote take money off the table you know you're speaking like a crypto trader right now right yeah i mean maybe you'd be maybe you're doing it just to represent their interest but um i don't see the world that way i think that bitcoin is sound money it's the technically superior asset class compared to the dollar the euro the peso the bolivar compared to a stock index compared to gold compared to silver compared to everything you can conceivably buy it is technically thermodynamically superior as an asset so when you say things like that to me and maybe you just do it just to just to see what i'll say back i just imagine you preaching to me in argentina while you're asking me if i'm going to sell the dollars and buy pesos back again as the pesos leads from 20 to the dollar to 40 to the dollar to 80 to the dollar or if we're in you know venezuela i mean you think a venezuelan company is going to like quote unquote take some money off the table by selling their their u.s stocks and their u.s dollars to buy back into local currencies so then you know in zimbabwe you think they would take money off the table right like the point is if if you have the superior asset it's going up forever laura forever right i mean right but i mean we can all look bitcoin sort of as numerous investors have talked about it kind of like breathes you know after having the next like year and a half after it tends to go up and then aft you know after it reaches some kind of bubble it kind of size a little bit and then then after the next having we see it go up but you know so it's it's this kind of like up and down cycle but the overall trajectory is up so and it's not you know i these aren't like on twitter people were asking me to ask you this as well i think it's a perfectly you know natural question to ask i think um i don't think bitcoin is volatile if you're an investor if you're a hodler if you're if your time horizon is one year or if it's one year you're a short-term investor you can find like two or three times in the last decade when it wasn't great but it wasn't awful if your time horizon is four years you can't find a time when it wasn't working so i i think i mean just a normal ordinary responsible investor with a four year time horizon looking to say this is very boring right it's exciting if you're a trader or a journalist and if you're on twitter and if you want the news to change every day like people and i feel like on twitter we've got a hyperinflammatory hyper like a high speed short time preference like i have to have an opinion every day or every week or every month and that means everybody's always generating news and there are like if i if i take anybody on the world and if i take a micro uh with a microscope and i zoom in and i'm a magnifying glass and i i i zoom in by a factor of a thousand i'll eventually find a blemish like if you if you look at bitcoin trading every week you'll find a blemish if you look at it every day you'll find more if you look at it every hour you'll find more if you look at it every minute you'll find plenty but if you zoom out to a decade or five years then you'll have a different view i i really take issue with every everybody that attempts to apply some statistical model i i'm not a trader i i i by the way to be clear trading is is speculation and traders see the world in short-term moves and they're alway and and maybe traders love volatility and traders love controversy and you know traders love this debate because it creates that volatility but this is an engineering issue for me this is the year is 1910 people are wiring their houses with electricity and you're asking me at what point i'm going to turn my electricity off or or you're telling me how eventually people are getting tired of electricity and then you're telling me that wouldn't i really want to convert back to horse and buggy and manual labor to take some off the table because electricity is a scary speculative thing and i'm like no it's running water it's electricity it's automobiles it's not a fad it's the future it's it's not a bubble it's it's capital flow when all the money is leaving the peso going to the dollar that's not a bubble in the dollar that's capital flight from a collapsing asset or collapsing currency that people have lost confidence in just like the stampede to the internet like would you ask a company when are you gonna stop using the internet this you know are you gonna stop using it in a quarter because you've used too much electricity and internet can i say right and you're like well you know i noticed that your facebook or your your twitter hits were going down or they weren't as high so you just have to turn off your thing my and my view is is this is all just short term uh technicality and by the way i don't think there's a single trader with all the data in the world that can predict the future like for example you're going to go and pull every line of data of every second if you know every trade of bitcoin since 2010 to today how would that be a better indicator of the future if the future is based upon things that are changing it's like this is the thing i said to keith mccullough keith wanted to like talk about quad models and correlating bitcoin performance to the cpi and inflation and deflation and these crunching numbers and just like the fibonacci retracement is not going to determine the future of bitcoin any more than the fibonacci retracement is not determining the future of electricity right okay and inflation is not going to determine the future of running water and if it's stock if the economy stops inflating or if the cpi goes up by three or goes down by two it is not going to stop a tidal wave from blowing into your beach if you're standing on the beach and there's a tidal wave coming the first order issue is that's a tidal wave and you're going to tell me well you know in the last decade all of our statistical models didn't predict the tidal wave and there's or something it's like it's irrelevant because it's an engineering phenomenon so a traitor that wants to preach to me about what they think should happen based upon 2017 in my opinion is irrelevant right for and let's come back to the key point if ten billionaires choose to buy five billion dollars or a billion or two billion dollars worth of bitcoin each all of your models are irrelevant all of your history is irrelevant it's like everything you like you think you know how things are going to work out and like how about all the statistics of new york city for the past decade how relevant are they to predict what happens in new york city right this month right not relevant at all so so traders i can't predict the future the only way trading is not a way to make money by the way in my opinion the people that make all the money are people that predict the future henry ford right john d rockefeller right andrew mellon what did they do they invented aluminum they invented oil they brought us cars you know they brought us electricity andrew carnegie brought us steel mark zuckerberg not studying some statistical model how did he get rich he kept facebook stock he didn't sell it jeff bezos he kept his stock so at the end of the day none of this statistics matters none of the trading matters none of the volatility matters these you know people that are living in their little world studying their fibonacci retracements and and preaching with like incredible conviction about the the upcoming expected 60 retracement or 80 retracement they're overlooking this fundamental issue which is if bitcoin is a digital monetary network and if enough people with money and power decide to adopt it it's going to go up and increase by a factor of 100 or a thousand and there's nothing you can do to stop it and its past is completely irrelevant to its future right so looking back makes no sense the only question you got to ask yourself laura is and here's the question you got to ask how much bitcoin is square cash going to sell in 2021 on the mobile app that's the question right how much is paypal because paypal and square are going to obliterate everybody else's opinion about what they think should happen right yeah and so like i i think that too many people in this industry have been around too long and they're captured by their past and they and everybody wants to draw on their past because they own it well no it is true though that um even when you look at certain of the analytics right now it's uh you know we're in uncharted territory um one thing i wanted to ask you about was uh this was just something i didn't understand so according to the gap accounting rules um your company needs to use the lowest value of bitcoin in any quarter as the price and if it fall falls below the price at which you acquired it you have to impair the asset and write that value on your balance sheet so i didn't understand like does that help you or hurt you in terms of your bottom line or like the taxes are i didn't really understand the implications of that the implications of of accounting are if it's if it's accounted for as an intangible asset you can't write it up on a gap balance sheet you must impair it uh to the lowest price that it traded at in the period in question so what that means is that your gaap asset balance sheet is not going to be as high as if you were carrying it as an investment asset that's why uh that's why in some cases it'll be more interesting for some companies to invest in it as a fund instead of buying the underlying asset right because you and even then i can't really speak for how every company will account for it because every company has its own accounting treatments and they all have their own facts and circumstances and the facts and circumstances get pretty complicated okay so actually so that element um it sounds like that it can at times be negative for for microstrategy i wouldn't characterize one way or the other okay it probably just sort of depends what happens in that quarter like i don't know what you're getting at that like it it isn't always 100 negative or 100 positive define negative i guess if you didn't like if you could just use the actual the price at the time of you know of at the quarter ends do you know what i'm saying like it like if we were to just use that price as opposed to having to use the lowest price you know i'd rather not engage in a discussion of accounting with you like i can't i can't see what the upside is of that yeah i was just trying to figure it out but you're right okay let's talk about something maybe more fun which is um i was just curious how has your life changed after it became public that microstrategy about bitcoin i engage in a bit more communication now so i i communicate on twitter and i communicate on youtube and i communicate on television more often because i think it's important to uh to be uh an advocate for the industry and to explain what's going on i think a lot of people don't understand uh what bitcoin really is and they don't understand the bitcoin network and the emergence of a monetary network and i think it's important to communicate and educate the world on that so i'm more engaged in outbound communication and education uh than i was before and i wondered so when city downgraded the microstrategy stock stock to sell it also indicated that senior management had been selling microstrategy stock and they wrote quote we are also concerned that the company could be losing focus on execution with ceo sailors disproportionate focus on bitcoin versus running the business and signs of deterior deteriorating employee sentiment what do you have to say to that well i don't agree i think uh i think employee morale is good i think the company is executing fine and uh i i think the shareholders would disagree with the opinion as well but everyone's entitled to their opinion there are some people that don't choose to own bitcoin and there are certain banks and there are certain entities that are more positive on it than others so i think everybody's entitled to their opinion and what did you think when it was revealed that renaissance technologies was the third largest buyer of microstrategy stocks since the summer we have uh various institutions that take positions in the company from time to time and that's changing almost every quarter so uh we're flattered by uh by the support from any any uh reputable investor and they're all pretty reputable so i don't i don't play favorites i mean we've got a lot of really good investors that have that have invested in the company and and uh we appreciate them all so your stock price has gone from 123 the day before the announcement to roughly 575 today what do you think will happen to your stock in a crypto bear market or bitcoin bear market i don't know i can't speculate i mean i think what happens to the stocks is is up to the marketplace the market decides again i think that that uh you have this model that you think that bitcoin is a cyclical thing like a sine wave and and and that's it's an implicit assumption and the question what happens in a crypto bear market but if i had a model that we're going to wire the world for electricity at what point between the year 1900 and the year 1950 did the world unwire its electricity or roll back its running water or roll back its automobiles i i view bitcoin as a monetary network that is spreading right it's a bear market in automobiles and what year was that bear market you know from the point that ford and general motors started right so it's like if you don't believe it's an industrial network right was when was the bear market in google and you know since the company was founded right right it's more like if stocks are reported on a quarterly schedule i mean i understand what you're saying because of course from a long uh from you know a long time if we're looking at a long enough time scale then of course what you're saying is is true it's just obviously you know the rhythm of stocks and quarterly reporting and all that is is really different well again speculators and traders manage to manage to speculate about volatility and and focus upon it but investors and industrialists are more focused upon upon building something for the long term and the fundamental critical issue to understand is bitcoin is the most the technically superior asset in the world right now and it's running on the dominant digital monetary network and that digital monitoring network is growing and is spreading and there's no reason i think it's not going to continue to spread was there a bear market in the internet like like at what point did it make sense for the company to worry about a bear market in the internet like if you were given a interview to jeff bezos in the year 2000 he said are you worried about the bear market the internet and his answer would be i'm building a great online retailer and we believe in the future so i believe in the future of bitcoin i believe the future of a digital monetary network and i think it's just as important to humanity as electricity and running water in the automobile and steel and communications and the internet and it's going to grow over time and maybe there'll be good days and bad days but you know we don't do things based upon whether or not we'll be up or down by the hour by the day or by the week we do things because they're the right thing to do so if you believe that the world will benefit from a thermodynamically sound monetary network then you're going to invest in bitcoin you're going to build bitcoin into your balance sheet you're going to build it into your p l you're going to evangelize it educate the world and you're going to you're going to look forward to the journey and if you don't then you won't i i think it's a mistake by the way for all the for any crypto traders or speculators to to fixate upon speculating and trading this thing it's going to be like trading apple stock in the year 2010 it's like you might like buy it for a dollar fifteen and sell it for a dollar twenty seven and brag to your friends or or shorted at a dollar forty two and cover your short at a dollar thirteen but ultimately you're going to look silly if ten years later it's trading at a hundred and twenty dollars a share and someone's gotta say so you were doing what you were making nickels when you could have actually made a hundred x or a thousand x that much money by actually investing in it you right you know you think the people that are all the wasted time and energy yeah i mean people shorting and trading and speculating in the in the short term direction of general electric or general motors or you know or standard oil they're not the ones that you remember you're reading about the people that are actually you know henry flagler andrew mellon you know the industrialist j you know andrew carnegie you're reading about the people that actually invested in the future believed in the future fought through the difficult time periods and and held out for the long run so you could call it hodling but i don't how about just commitment commitment conviction and conviction over the long term right and not being caught up in the near term i mean that's the strategy and i i can't imagine that anybody no employee wants to work for a ceo without conviction no customer wants to buy from a company that's not committed right no no vendors or counterparties or nobody wants to do business with anybody that that changes their opinions and blows with the wind day by day or week by week so i think you know there are some people that can make money speculating this way and that and and trading against bear markets that's not the business of a technology company a technology company needs to identify new technologies and find a way to invest in new paradigm shifting technologies and if you do it well you'll grow and the world to be a better place and if you guess wrong then you suffer the consequences and that's the free market and i also wanted to ask about the convertible debt offering which ended up by the end being 650 million dollars i i wondered how that works for the purchasers um so they receive 2.5 shares of microstrategy stock per 1 000 principle in in notes so does that mean that if the price of bitcoin goes up more than two and a half times then microstrategy gets a higher return from these notes than the purchasers do or i i wasn't you know i i don't really fully understand this world so it wasn't true a convertible bond is structured as partly bond partly warrants so if you were to loan me 650 million dollars and as a part of a convertible bond the first question is what interest rate am i going to pay you in this case say it's 75 basis points three quarters of a percent interest second question is what's the term in this case it's five years at the end of five years i either have to i have to pay you back the 650 million dollars or in cash or i need to issue 650 million dollars worth of equity at the then current value of the equity assuming that the equity is lower than the strike price of the warrants so the first component of the bond is it's a bond and you have downside protection the second component is warrants so in this case the bond converted at 398 dollars a share so that means that if the stock price is above 398 dollars a share above that strike then you have uh the right to convert your bond into the share equivalent of 650 million divided by 398. so that's like 1.6 million shares so you in essence have 1.6 million warrants if uh the price of the stock goes above the strike and if the price of the stock stays below the strike you have a bond which pays you back not that much interest less than one percent interest but you get your principal back so it's a principle protected way to invest in an equity it's not as it's not as much upside as buying the stock right you'd you'd be better to take 600 if you've taken 650 million dollars on the day that bond was struck you could have bought two and a half million shares you could have bought more than the 1.6 million shares of stock because the because it struck at a premium right 37 was the premium so if you if you wanted all the downside and more upside you could buy the stock but if you don't want any downside and you want to accept less upside then you would buy the bond and so the bond gives people participation if bitcoin were to go up by a factor of 10 then they've got participation in that not as much as the shareholders have but right it presents an interesting proposition if i was an institutional investor i could buy 650 million worth of bitcoin or i could buy 650 million worth of microstrategy stock or i could buy 650 million worth of a bond they by the way and that's assuming that you had a charter that was flexible and and by investors have limited partners they're like public companies i have to consider what my shareholders think they have to consider what their limited partners think so if you had a if you were high net worth multi-billionaire family office and you could do anything you know by calling the phone you have those three choices to make but but as a practical matter what's more likely is you either have a fund that invests in bitcoin and you raise money to invest in bitcoin and that's what you can do or you have a fund that invests in equity public company equity and uh you can invest in anything with the ticker on the nasdaq you know amazon microstrategy facebook but you can't buy bitcoin and you can't buy bonds or you have a convertible bond company and sometimes you have convertible arbitrage funds where their specific strategy is they would say well laura give us your money and we're going to buy the bond but we're going to immediately short the equity and the comment the common equity in the market so we'll never have that much equity risk we're just going to arbitrage this and we're going to get like 10 yield okay that's a strategy and if you break that strategy maybe your limit partners will be irritated at you right maybe you can't but you could also have another fund which is a convertible bond fund with the option to go long or to or to hedge it and and if i bought your bond and i went long that means i'm not gonna i'm not gonna immediately hedge it i'm gonna actually keep the bond and keep all the upside down that's that's all of the different uh situations everybody's got a pool of capital they can play with subject to a charter a strategy and a set of limited partners and then what happens is people choose to make an investment based upon you know their circumstances does that okay answer your question yeah that makes sense you kicked off a trend with so far only three companies now buying uh bitcoin for uh you know allocating their capital bitcoin which are you and square and now mass mutual but i'm sure we can expect many more and um i you know i couldn't help but notice of course that you have had tweeted with elon musk suggesting that he convert the tesla balance sheet from usd to bitcoin did the conversation go any further than that you know i couldn't tell you one way or the other it would be inappropriate what i can tell you is um i think a lot of companies will do this in the coming 12 months and you'll start to see more announcements because it's an idea whose time has come there's uh i i've seen a lot of interest and there's a a lot of private company ceos reach out to me and they're they've already done it they're just not making announcements but but this is actually more common at least a hundred oh wow at least a hundred that i know of uh and what size typically like small private companies or sometimes billion dollar plus companies i mean billion multi-billion 500 million 100 million so there's a lot of companies in that sweet spot and they you know generally they they all everybody talks to everybody right and and us companies generally or well i'm more familiar with the us ones because i just have more connections here but and what types of industries it's limited just to the us i think that in europe and the far east and in the middle east i think we're we're actually seeing people come in what types of industries do they tend to be in everybody's got money well it's just money right like it's like the the the amazing thing about bitcoin is it's just pure monetary energy so everybody on earth that has any wealth to speak of or any any assets to speak of has the same problem at the same time and this is the solution to everybody's problem it doesn't really matter what business you're in nobody's got a monopoly on that i think that information is traveling a little bit more in the u.s right now because just because of the social networks et cetera but but it's not limited to that that i can see um i've had conversations with people in the far east hong kong singapore london europe dubai abu dhabi south america everywhere in the u.s so there's a non-stop continual set of inquiries and i've seen a lot of them have acted i think that um we'll see more public companies they're they're the the higher hurdle because they have more due diligence more compliance more more issues to work with uh or work through than private companies have but um i definitely feel uh i feel that's happening that's going to happen in 2021 we've got we'll have a couple thousand people coming to our bitcoin for corporation summit in the first week of february and uh this massive enthusiastic uh response to that everybody wants they just want to they want to understand how to do it like what it would take you six weeks to 12 weeks to work through the legal the accounting the compliance the due diligence and the other issues if you're a major company with a board with auditors with lawyers etc so what we're really doing is we're bringing together all those experts and we're going to open source all of our all of our documents into the public domain in order to accelerate everybody's journey by about six weeks and save them half a million or a million dollars each and then we'll just put we'll put those top uh those ten companies on this you know onto the uh the agenda so that so that a company can come they can figure out the methodology they can see what their options are work through the due diligence issues understand how a gc or a cfo thinks understand our auditors think outside counsel think decide who they want to do business with and how and and we will discuss the accounting issues so if you want to go deep into accounting you should come to that event because we'll have our auditors and our cfo going in detail on accounting and trade-offs and issues and we'll have our our general counsel with our outside counsel talking about all the legal due diligence compliance and regulatory filing issues and i think we want to make it as transparent and as accessible as we can to the world and was it all those conversations that you were having with different court companies you know officers that led you to wholeness yeah we got i mean i had a lot of conversations i know everybody from the point you decide you want to do it if you're an individual when i said i want to do it it took me like eight weeks to get through all the aml kyc you know education process as a company it's about 12 weeks if you wanted to go as hard as you possibly could and i have a brilliant team of finance and legal people and it was a small group so what we want to do is just take that 12-week process and we want to we want to make it simpler and more accessible and more transparent and cookie-cutter because there's 10 000 companies with exactly the same issue and they all just need to learn and so if we can educate the 10 000 companies then uh we'll we will speed up the maturation of the market and we will de-risk it right and and sometimes it's like do i want to spend a million dollars on accounting and legal opinions before i take this to my board or what if i could just take it to the board and spend ten thousand dollars and spend three days maybe it would i'm more likely to do it right so we're lowering the barrier to entry there by just uh by making the stuff transparent and so if you were to put a number on how many fortune 500 companies you thought would hold bitcoin by the end of 21 what number would that be i can't give you a forecast i i don't know okay more more will right and so i'm enthusiastic about what'll happen but uh you know i i can't give you an exact forecast the future i don't know so this already seems like a new line of revenue for microstrategy and you've also announced that you're looking into developing commercial bitcoin data products what kinds of products are you thinking there first of all you know we're not doing this for revenue this is a it's a free uh summit and uh we're open sourcing all of our methodology and giving it away to the world for free because it's the right thing to do um we will benefit and our shareholders will benefit because you know as yeah when apple buys 25 billion dollars worth of bitcoin it will be good for everyone that owns bitcoin right so institutional adoption is good for the entire network and that's why we're doing it with regard to our other thoughts on on uh bitcoin i think it's really important when you're considering how to plug into the network that you take your strategic assets that you're committed to where that you're really good at and then you plug them in efficiently as opposed to chase after new lines of business that happen to be related to bitcoin where you're not the the world leader so for example we are we're a world leader in business intelligence and we have thousands of engineering years invested in in software to extract insight from large sets of data so um if we can find a way to to plug that software into the crypto world or the bitcoin world and the blockchain in some way that's constructive then we'll do that something like hyperintelligence might be if we come up with hyper intelligence and we can apply it uh in such a way that it improves the quality of of the exchanges or improves the quality of bitcoin or is a convenient uh a convenience or intel intelligence boosting thing for people using this data then we will we're evaluating all that right now we don't have any particular product to announce i think that um our first order benefit that we get from the entire bitcoin strategy is the notoriety of the company as a brand has been increased by a factor of a hundred and that makes it easier for our enterprise sales people to get meetings with senior executives like now we get call backs from the cio from the cto from the c the cfo the treasurer the cio the cto the head of now they're more likely to know about us and half the challenge is just the brand you know and then and then if they view your company as being um on a solid footing and and uh and of sound finance and if your stock is working and if and everybody's talking about you then they go oh yeah microsoft i remember them and uh that makes it easier for you to sell your existing products and services it makes it easier to recruit big recruiting benefit to become more famous it makes it easier to retain employees people like you know if you're a company like tesla people like to work for a company changing the world if you're changing the world then that's useful so it's useful for recruiting it's useful for marketing it's useful for for relationship building um ultimately our software is business intelligence and hyper intelligence to people that want to extract any insight 99 of the world's data is still not on the blockchain as the blockchain grows then probably a lot of these things will will have an inside leg but you know i i'm expecting the great majority of our revenues will be in the business intelligence world and uh that's fine i don't think there's any any problem with that all right so at a certain uh at a few different points in the conversation you know obviously we've brought up uh what's been happening with the us dollar and um interest rates and so i just wondered what do you think will happen to the global reserve currency status of the us dollar i think that um we have um lost price discovery in stocks and bonds and commercial real estate and um that's because of the of the you know excessive monetary inflation we're seeing in the past 12 months i think that bitcoin is going to grow to be digital gold and it's going to grow larger than gold and at some point that will bring back price discovery to currencies to bonds to stocks to uh monetary indexes so that you can imagine there's 500 trillion dollars worth of assets in the traditional system in bitcoin is irrelevant and gold is not playing the role of enforcer of monetary discovery it just it's not working we're not on a gold standard gold is not going to be 20 30 percent of the monetary energy is not replacing safe haven it's not replacing cash it's not replacing bonds as a safe haven asset people are using tesla as a safe haven asset or it's a store of value right now so gold doesn't work the world needs um needs a safe haven store of value that's sound money as bitcoin grows it's not going to replace the currencies it's going to be the the central core it's like granite bedrock you're going to build new york city on granite you're going to see bitcoin become a 10 trillion or 20 or 30 or 50 trillion dollar thing people that were buying stock indexes as a store of value will say i think bitcoin is a better store of value instead of taking 15 of the s p why not take 200 in bitcoin or 100 bitcoin was 280 percent right and smp is 15 in the last 12 months okay so so why in the world would i ever buy an s p a spider index or vanguard 500 index as a store of value and the answer is people are afraid fear uncertainty doubt not you know ignorant or fearful or something so as we regularize or normalize uh bitcoin as an asset class i think that it's going to demonetize those indexes and it's going to rob capital from bank accounts i mean who's gonna who's gonna put money in a savings account that yields zero percent interest right it's already you know square and paypal are already siphoning off money from a savings account right so what you're gonna see there is is um bitcoin becomes people have talked about it they're like it's what is it it keeps everybody else honest it's like it's like the sovereign enforcer of integrity in the world right what if there was one country that anybody could move to that was fair and equitable you know then if another country were to abuse your rights you would presumably you know blink and move to the fair and equitable country well we can't quite do that but we've created um uh cryptocurrency and cyberspace which is fair and equitable and if you live in venezuela or nigeria or south africa or lebanon or turkey or argentina you have the option to move your money and it's pretty obvious like it would be irresponsible to not it's not a bubble right you wouldn't describe bitcoin's appreciation against the venezuelan boulevard as a bubble you would describe it as rational capital flight as a currency collapses into another currency that's not collapsing so i think what will happen is you see that flight governments have to respond to that as that starts to happen with the dollar and the euro i think that people will realize that when price discovery returns then interest rates will begin to matter again let's go back five years right what what used to be the reason that a country wouldn't drop their interest rates to zero because if i drop my interest rates to zero everybody attacks my currency and all the capital flows from the pound to the dollar or it flows out of the euro it flows out of the turkish lira or flows out of the whatever and so your currency collapses and so so the check on irrational behavior is capital flow and i think that what we're going to see here is we're going to see more and the check on irrational asset pricing is capital flow why are stocks overvalued because people have no alternative why are bonds overvalued because people have no alternative if there is an alternative the capital is going to rationally flow to the technically superior asset and it seems pretty clear right if i have something which is the reliable that's going to appreciate it 200 a year that you can't inflate away it seems technically superior to something which is yielding one percent interest that is being inflated yeah so we'll have to see what happens to the us dollar um so on twitter people told me to ask you and i think this is a great question what would it take for you to sell any of the bitcoin i would have to find something superior to buy like bitcoin is the technical it's the apex asset it's the best asset in the apex monetary asset the technically superior monitor asset if you define money thermodynamically or mathematically or based on any engineering principle it's you got a bath you got a swimming pool and it's got a leak in it and 15 of the water drains out of it every year and the other swimming pool has no leak in it one of the two swimming pools is technically superior as a swimming pool this is a technically superior asset so i bought it because i was selling inferior assets i'm selling the dollar to buy the bitcoin i'm selling a stock i'm selling gold you know not not buying and selling right so the issue really is like why would i sell the superior thing to buy the inferior thing when you invent something which is better and you show it to me and by by the way it can't be just better technically right i mean otherwise some random bitcoin fork with a small engineering commodity better it has to when you show me a better monetary network that has more money in it that's more thermodynamically sound if you could basically take bitcoin and if it ran ten times faster and it had five trillion dollars on it and people with more money than the bitcoiners were using that thing then i would probably throw in the towel sell bitcoin and buy that thing i would sell bitcoin cash to buy bitcoin it's pretty obvious why when a hundred people with more money than me pick something which works better than my thing and they anoint that as money then i will buy that thing and so that that's why you would sell it i mean i'm sure i wouldn't sell it to buy um a fiat currency that's being debased right so it i wouldn't i wouldn't buy a 20th century thing right it's like let me turn it around to you if you have a house with electricity and running water what would convince you to turn off your electricity in your running water nothing yeah you see it it comes down to do you see it as a as a thermodynamically sound monetary network that's the future of life on earth and the base layer for 500 trillion dollars of assets you know do you see it as a railroad what would cause you to stop using the railroad what would cause you to stop using airplanes what would cause you to give up on on antibiotics when will you give up your mobile phone when will you stop using google what would cause you to stop using youtube and the answer by the way is when something better comes along right yes yes i see that if it's i think it all comes down to a very simple fundamental question do you view it as technology is it a technical network is it a digital network like google is it a railroads a network a power network is it a communications network is it a technical engineered network is it air transit network if you believe it is your you expect it to grow for the next 10 20 30 40 years because it's it's technically superior to the thing it replaced it's pretty obvious that if i can move a billion dollars of gold around at the speed of light a million times a second everywhere on earth that's better than holding a bunch of gold right it's like if if i if i you know like when will the guys in star trek give up the transporter beam that transports you at the speed of light anywhere you want it's like they're not giving it up until you come up with something better so if it's technology it will only be replaced by better technology and money is technology right if you if you're a trader and unfortunately there's a lot of people in the crypto business that they've been around it forever but they still don't know what they have they still think they're they're trading little coins and tokens and speculating and they're trying to guess which token will be up tomorrow the next day they miss the big picture it's like we've invented a monetary network the first in human history it's probably a million times more efficient way to move money around money is half of everything right half of everything on earth is an asset you need like your car like your house like your clothes like your art that's half and the other half is just pure financial energy it's optionality to buy the stuff that you don't know you need yet but you know maybe you want to give the money to your granddaughter your grandson or save it for a rainy day so the half of the monetary energy in the in the human race is currently moving around on in 20th century asset containers called stocks and bonds and try wiring 100 million dollars of apple stock on a saturday afternoon turkey it's like you can't do it right you can't do it right i mean this is why i don't get worked up over crypto regulation it's like i can't wire a hundred million dollars of apple stock to a private wallet in sub-saharan africa so why would i be so worried if the treasury wants to know if i wire a hundred million dollars worth of bitcoin to sub-saharan private wallet it's like yeah they might do it yeah you might hate it but uh google and apple still hold value they're still valuable even though you can't send them to sub-saharan africa with privacy you don't need to actually have that flexibility so bitcoin it solves a problem and the problem is 2 you know 200 trillion dollar problem we need one monetary network that everybody agrees on right and what what what is going to make it successful i mean basic technology protocol an open protocol that is that supports a deflationary currency that's one thing thermodynamically sound mathematically pure we need it to not be you know corrupted code then we need you know a physical network of hodlers to protect it we need miners to operate it needs to be reasonably decentralized once you've got past that it all comes down to can you get institutions corporations you know and individuals to embrace it and if they choose to embrace it then it becomes the network and if they choose not to embrace it it isn't so this is the thing it's a technology network it's it's probably in my opinion it's the single biggest technology advance of our lifetime you could you could compare it to the internet i mean andreas wood the internet was an information network what happens if i digitize information and put it on a network this is digitizing money i saw an interesting quote somebody said uh the two greatest um inventions of the human race are language and money well the internet is really all about language right if information is language so the internet gave us digital language moving at the speed of light a million times more efficiently than you know i'm sitting in a library with books okay like books right that's the that's the 19th century quasi-20th century approach to language very inefficient you might as well be sitting in a vault of gold and i so i think that everything you saw on the internet that was that was a digital language and yeah it was important but digital money digital money seems to be more important least is important we can debate back and forth one thing is for sure it's at least 10 to 100 times more important than google and uh yeah the world needs it you know when google came out you know you could either buy google hold the stock and believe in it or you could be perennially asking people about the google bear market when they're going to actually take money off the table and how they're going to trade it and i was like it's it's it's just that's just so hard and exhausting laura to try to figure out when you when you're going to do that we're a company we're trying to make the world a better place i have some capital i have some bandwidth you got to decide what you're going to do with it so what i tried different things we invented alarm.com we spun it off it's a nice company you know we invented business intelligence we run it we do good we have a chance to help commercialize the bitcoin monetary network the world needs it it's probably going to happen with or without us by the way i think i wouldn't have done it if i didn't think it was going to happen with or without me right it's going to happen and probably if we're wrong then we're wrong there's 3 499 other publicly traded companies that'll do something different and then the human race will go forward on their shoulders and not ours if we're right maybe we help it along a little bit and the world will be a better place either be a better place for the people that need a currency that have no other alternative or maybe it'll be more rational place because price discovery will return to stocks and bonds and real estate or maybe better place because politicians will treat people better or maybe a better place because big tech companies will find a way to move digital gold around a billion times faster than the current goal moves around and when they move it that fast we're going to create something magical that will go on i think um i think if you have electric uh electric power network with a short circuit right people forget there'd be no new york city there's no human there's no civilization if i can't get electricity to flow over power lines without a leak right right like people dismiss this stuff but new york city wouldn't be here you can't make a skyscraper work right there's some fundamental things about our society right there's no antibiotics without refrigeration or no hospitals right so if you want to build a civilization you're going to have to create networks that are thermodynamically sound and the railroads the power networks the oil networks you know and steel and and metallurgy and other types of engineering and automotive networks they're all critical and i feel just as strongly about the monetary network it's it's it you want you know you want an example go look at what's going on in venezuela or argentina right now right you could spend a million hours trying to run a company but if you're running a company and you're a genius and the currency is collapsing that you're actually doing business and it's hopeless yeah it's hope it's it doesn't really matter what you do if the currency collapses the currency is the blood supply and the oxygen carrier of the body politic and the body economic so it's uh you know you could say well you know leave that to the politicians but again name me one successful company in venezuela right now like there won't be any right there won't be any so so when i talk about it as a monetary network i think it's important because it means that companies and individuals need to plug into this monetary network the same way they need to plug into oxygen when the air and the oxygen gets sucked out of the atmosphere you need an oxygen mask otherwise you're gonna die and uh you could you can say well i'm dying slowly and so may you know it's like you could you could say i don't think it'll get any worse but the point is at 15 a year there's a point at which you're not going to be able to make it so i think it's a it's it's critical for humanity and it's a critical engineering breakthrough and if if you understood that when you understand that you're not selling right you're not gonna sell the only way you know if you have electricity in your hometown and someone says let's turn it all off you're gonna say whoa before we turn it off we better have nuclear fusion in the form of a sugar cube that we can give to everybody so they can light up their house because otherwise a lot of people are going to die so i think when you've got something better then we talk about it but until we've got something better the the best thing we can all do is find a way to spread this monetary network to the four corners of the earth all right well this has been um a really amazing conversation um where can people learn more about you and microstrategy and the upcoming bitcoin for corporations event they can go to hope.com bitcoin is hope h-o-p-e and we have tons of information about bitcoin on hope they can follow me on twitter uh michael underscore sailor
