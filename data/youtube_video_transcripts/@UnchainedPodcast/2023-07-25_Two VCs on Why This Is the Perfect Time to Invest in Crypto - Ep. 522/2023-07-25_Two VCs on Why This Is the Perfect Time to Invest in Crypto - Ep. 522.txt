as far as as we're concerned this is one of the best times to be an investor and to be investing and this takes us back to 2018 and 2019 which were our favorite times to be investing as as Venture capitalists but also in in the public markets hi everyone welcome to Unchained your no hype resource for all things crypto I'm your host Laura Shin author of The cryptopians I started covering crypto

discuss are Chris brodeski and Joel manegro Partners at placeholdervc welcome Chris and Joel hey Laura you are so as I'm sure you guys know very well I think I've known both of you since 2015. crypto typically breathes in Bear and or I'm doing the opposite hand motion bear and bull markets and in the past the Cycles have lasted about four years um though I would say you know each cycle has been unique in its own way so it's curious for your thoughts on what this current cycle is about and it's to our question the second part is where are we in that current cycle and why don't we start with Chris sure well you know the four-year pattern um has been playing out and it looks like it potentially will play out again here um we recorded about a year ago with Kobe and I would say a lot of what happened or what was discussed in that podcast has roughly come to be true um and there are different reasons for this four-year Cadence I would say the earliest explanation was around the Bitcoin halving cycle right so Bitcoin has its annual rate of Supply inflation every four years um and it just so happens that the year before really big price movements tends to be a Bitcoin having year um you could think of that as um if all costs in the Bitcoin mining Network are held equal when you cut the annual rate of Supply inflation you double um the marginal cost to produce each unit of Bitcoin and you know that can influence the order books and the price at which miners will sell their Bitcoin I think that was a better explanation earlier on in cryptos history because Bitcoin was more dominant and the amount of Bitcoin getting produced um as a percent of the overall supply of Bitcoin was much greater right so as more Bitcoin has been issued and as the annual rate of Supply inflation drops it becomes less of a of a driving force um a so so that's like a very base level uh base level explanation I think a higher level explanation if you went to like the highest level you would look at say Global macro markets and the flows of liquidity interest rates things that often determine the pricing of risk assets and I would give Raul Paul actually a lot of credit here where he's been really on top of these debt refinancing Cycles um that tend to actually coincide with crypto bull markets but basically just when liquidity is sloshing into Global markets when interest rates are pretty low if you think about an interest rate that is uh feeds into the discount rate at which you price forward looking assets and so the higher that rate is the more discounted the asset will be the lower that rate is the less discounted a risk asset will be less discounted means higher price right and so right now we have very high interest rates around the world but if those rates start to come down which you know I'd say a lot of people are expecting that to happen next year into 2025 that could cause an upward repricing in Risk assets and crypto is the riskiest asset class right so arguably it's the greatest beneficiary so that's a very high level and very low level explanation I also think in between you can you know think of product cycles and human psychology and you know the bloom bust nature of crypto as a market that trades 24 7 365 that people get really excited about but also pretty depressed about and you know because of the fast-moving nature it allows for you know these very hyperbolic moves um to the upside or downside that then it takes people time to recover from and Builders to actually mature the infrastructure and also uh create applications that are more user friendly that will pull in more and more people and we've all been doing everyone on this this Zoom has been uh encrypted for a long time now and so I think we've seen every expansion how much better the products get right and we're at the four we're at the very beginning of seeing new products come to Market that weren't previously possible that are the setup for this product cycle that will also Drive expansion Beyond just like the fiscal and manage Terry components I love that I totally agree with a lot of that and we can dive into more details later Joel what about you yeah we definitely agree on that and um the there's a famous quote from Warren Buffett that comes to mind which is that the value of a business is 100 dependent on government interest rates cryptos also um part of that sphere of influence uh for a number of reasons uh we could have a philosophical conversation about how that may change in the future um but the only thing that I would add is there's there's sort of two components to this there's there's the financial cycle and then there's the technology side and they they play together in interesting ways and uh the financial cycle is uh pretty much as the way that plays out the way that Chris described it and it has a lot of variables that influence it and crypto is a a natively financial technology and that it it revolves around uh assets digital Assets in this case but it is a new technology uh to a large degree or a Technology Innovation and so it's also subject to the patterns of technology to technological Evolution that we've seen with previous technological uh inventions and so something that we relied on uh to or a framework that we've relied on since the beginning is um a lot of progressive spring work for technological revolutions and financial Capital which is looks at a much broader time scale it looks at several decades of technological Evolution and she would argue correctly that crypto is not a revolution uh in and of itself but instead part of the information technology Revolution ocean that started in in the middle of the last century but we still think that there are echoes of how the technology Cycles play out in the sub-revolutions or the sub-cycles and the basic framework that Carlotta proposed is that for the new technologies you have broadly speaking and installation phase then you have a recomposition phase in the middle that is sort of a transition period between the uh infrastructure development and the widespread application development and then you have after that recomposition period you have what you called the deployment phase and the deployment phase is when all of the Investments that went into the infrastructure in the infrastructure phase then materializing to products that become part of of mainstream usage and crypto definitely does seem to be following that same pattern and one of the things that's really Stark is um as part of the installation phase she describes that there's two two periods uh first is the eruption which is about a decade plus of when the technology has been invented but we don't quite know what to do with it um it's just kind of there it's a little bit of a toy you have some nerds and some kind of Die Hard technologists really playing with it and that feels like the first 10 years of crypto where we had this blockchain thing and no one was really quite sure why it would be useful and Bitcoin was essentially the only game in town and everything else was a derivative of Bitcoin and then the second part of the installation phase is what she called the frenzy which is a time when suddenly it clicks and we sort of understand okay now we sort of know what to do with this new technology and that catalyzes a bloom in investment in interest but all of the infrastructure still hasn't been developed yet and so what you have is a lot of capital being invested into a of issue more than a reality and that tends to create Financial bubbles because you have an excess of financial Capital that exceeds the current technological reality and ultimately that comes to a crash because the the reality of also at a certain Pace Financial Capital kind of sloshes back and forth quickly by by the variables that Chris described and what's interesting about the crash and recomposition is that it's it's a very important time in the evolution of of whatever technology is going through that cycle some of the elements that Carlotta described are are kind of eerily similar to what we're living out today um where she describes that often it's the time when we get the most regulatory reactions and and Regulatory energy coming to the space as a consequence of the over investment and the excitement and it's also a time when there's a lot of Chaos in the market it tends to coincide with Global Financial crashes or Global Financial events which is also pretty interesting but it's it's key because it is the regulatory outcomes of that phase which you know we might say it lasts about five years or so or the the the lengths don't matter as much the regulatory outcomes are what create a a solid foundation for that Synergy phase for that deployment phase because that means that you can now have uh sustainable growth on a solid basis with a more ordered Market uh better standards uh things like consumer protection but beyond that because of all of the over investment in the installation phase what happens is that then the infrastructure final gets cheaper and one of the ways in which that shows up in our industry is for example we all remember in 2021 how despite all of the excitement it was kind of ridiculous that a transaction fee on ethereum could cost hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars however during that time the lock Capital was invested into scaling ethereum but also alternative networks with innovations that allowed for faster and cheaper transactions and so for example solanus one of the an avalanche and many others and now we're entering this world of Roll-Ups that that also play into that and so coming out of of this crash we're actually entering a phase where the infrastructure is really cheap and when the infrastructure is really cheap that allows for the development of the applications that for example Chris mentioned now we're seeing applications that weren't possible before and that were impossible only not only technically but also economically because for example if we take nfts as as a case study uh you you can't possibly imagine deploying nfts to billions of people if it's going to cost tens of dollars or hundreds of dollars to transact in them but the moment that it costs fractions of ascent to engage in transactions then it's now possible to really scale applications to relate our Gene survey yeah oh my God there's so much in what you said there um but one thing that I was laughing a little bit about was when you said that the eruption creates a frenzy that brings in more Capital than the technology can support and I was just like that was definitely the Ico bubble um which yeah it was 2021 bubble both Yeah well yeah yeah although that one you know obviously there was a lot more the stuff that actually were but we'd say you know we'd say that that that frenzy stage started in 2017 and ended in 2021 and so actually going back to the early days of placeholder we had this chart that took the uh and this is on our website on our original uh thesis uh that looked at the it had an image of Carlotta cycle adapted to crypto as we saw it in 2017 we marked it as the beginning of the frenzy and you know that tends to be a period of about similar duration and so in some ways it's kind of fascinating that this is booked from you know this is almost a 40 year old book and it still has predictive power in in deter or describing how technological yeah I've read that back in the day I'm gonna have to reread it because yeah I want to see how everything maps on yeah people should definitely read it by the way if you haven't we I yeah I think we might even have a link to it on my website somewhere the Unchained crypto website but and we'll put it in the show notes for you so one thing also that I wanted to ask about because in my opinion the year of 2022 was a very singular year for crypto I've taken to calling it The Year of crypto Carnage um you know it's just historic for the sheer number of collapses like Terra Luna Celsius 3C FTX and I'm not even naming all of them there's more so I was curious how you guys feel that the crypto industry has been building differently if you know it's been different building differently at all um and then generally if you kind of feel that there are like certain lessons that either entrepreneurs or investors have absorbed like what would those be certainly well I I do think that Humanity will continue to repeat certain mistakes again and again and again and one of them is using too much leverage so so that's one side of it of like humans will make certain mistakes again now if we build the infrastructure better we can protect people from making those mistakes so I think coming out from the Carnage of 2022 one thing we've seen is return to to focus on the non-custodial truly decentralized mechanisms because those are the ones that didn't fail us right and Luna was not decentralized we would argue and it was a failed mechanism and I would say that anyone who studied it closely and helped um you know how to say intellectual honesty without getting skewed by by the returns could see that it was a failed mechanism but so there's been a return to non-custodial and like specifically within Solana I think that's a great case study um because a lot of teams did use FTX right and got burned by FTX and that has caused them to shift over to using squads and using a multi-sig and getting more crypto native with even just how they run their operations because those mechanisms and those protocols Can't Fail them right and so learning that lesson was was really important and I remember Joel saying something like uh this was in the midst of sbbs you know collapse and you know the crypto specific stuff of like what a great way for entrepreneurs to get you know lessons on the importance of counterparty risk right and so that's important and that will influence how people build in in the years to come so I would start there the other thing I would say and this relates to what Joel was saying about regulatory activity in the recomposition phase we've we've been articulating this as a progression from defiant defy to the internet Financial system and that while we do think D5 will continue to persist as a permissionless you know potentially non-kyc AML system and there will be that that world and it's Unstoppable and I think that there are Arguments for why it has a right to to persist as a form of speech or code written as a form of speech we also think that there's going to be a growing part of these systems specific to finance that is regulated um that is kycaml that does say work to meet the needs of some of the biggest capital allocators in the world um and that would be what we think of more as the internet Financial system and um again it it benefits from the efficiency and speed of blockchain-based systems things you know we've talked about for many years now in the crypto space it also benefits from you know the transparency and in some in some cases the autonomy of a non-custodial system I think that we will see that you can be non-custodial and compliant right and there are ways to to go about building things that way but the non-custodial is really about limiting your counterparty risk whereas the compliance is really on the application layer of who you are able to do business with and the types of capital that you can touch so those would be two things that I would say that we would expect out of the 2022 Carnage I think that no one is upset about uh law enforcement and Regulators going after Bad actors but everyone's upset about them going after good actors and unfortunately we uh had a situation where the lack of action or preemptive action with uh against Bad actors has created in the United States at least it seems a situation where there's an overreaction uh to the events and and that that is dragging down the good actors like coinbase but despite that we think that companies like coinbase and the good actors will prevail but it's really important that the Bad actors don't get away with it and that the cycle of impunity stops because up until 2022 we had largely a regime of impunity where there were some isolated cases where enforcement did go after Bad actors but they were kind of scarce but going after those large-scale Bad actors and you know there's people that been put in prison there's people that have criminal cases against them is really important as far as setting precedent and discouraging future Bad actors from uh from trying to do the same things or executing the same schemes so that's that's really important that's part part of the reason why it's such a significant year um and so coupled with uh the changes in how entrepreneurs are building products that Chris alluded to that create safer products overall uh I think fewer people are or people are going to be more sensitive to building resilient systems that don't fail that have uh sound crypto economic mechanisms but it also means that perhaps some people will think twice before acting in a way that's a proper acting in a way that that goes against uh users or a question for both of you actually would you because this was a debate I think on The Chopping Block like do you think that criminal cases against doe Quan are fair there I know that placeholder you know did not believe in Terra Luna you felt that it wasn't going to succeed but you know I know some people said hey being an entrepreneur and failing is not a crime other people said he you know should be put away for that so I was curious for your thoughts yeah you know I I don't know and I don't think my opinion matters on that you know speaking for myself um and it it's sort of up to the justice system to decide that and and judges to decide that I do I do understand the sentiment it's hard to judge you know intentionality which is really what what um a lot of cases are about that you intentionally act in a way that was helpful or that you unintentionally do it and something that uh we've talked about internally a lot is when you get these big events that are uh negative events often we need scapegoats to kind of release a lot of the trauma uh and and the industry trauma and sometimes the scapegoats that are chosen by the market or by Society are chosen unfairly and and that is something that happens and so you know there's good actors there's Bad actors and there's people who make mistakes who you know are neither good actors nor Bad actors I think that there's a lot of people who didn't like uh folks like dokwon because of their attitude and demeanor um throughout the you know the whole Saga and that doesn't help him um and so you know things like that matter and even how you behave and um uh your your personality and your character is hugely influential in establishing credibility and so I think he put himself in a position where uh there's not that many allies in part because of the character that that he exhibited and I'll keep it very brief the only thing I would say is um how someone reacts to Earnest critical feedback always reveals so much at least to me about their intent and I think that if you look at you know vitalik and how he deals with Earnest critical feedback um or you know totally from Solana or um any legitimate ecosystem building for the very long term they tend to incorporate and you know cogitate over feedback and the people that I'm really skeptical of are the ones that punch down at that feedback and are reactive to it and inflammatory around it and then I have to ask well what's the intention like if the feedback is meant to make your system stronger you know why are you being so reactive it feels insecure right and are you actually protecting against a known insecurity for your own monetary gain and if that's the case then that's intentional right and I'll leave it to the courts to decide that I have my own opinion and I would just say the pattern of you know being reactive to Earnest quality feedback is a major your red flag yeah either the intent or the dilution or level of delusion yeah that kind of took us on a tangent but um I also wanted to ask about some of the stuff that you guys had mentioned earlier on because this definitely has been you know setting the the tone for I think for crypto Market activity for the last few years and that is um you know what's going on in the macro environment which you both alluded to uh there's actually a Federal Reserve meeting next week the day after this podcast comes out what are your projections on what will happen um in the macro environment kind of like over the next year or so and how that will affect crypto during that time I can I can start and then Joel I'm sure you'll have thoughts too um I would start by saying we're not fed Watchers uh we're not qualified economists and uh but we are Market participants and have been for a long time you know rough you is that um we're in recession in the U.S whether the FED sees that or not because of the data that they look at is you know Up For Debate but um we are we are in recession we are very near Peak rates um and and then you know the other thing I would say related to much of this is when you approach markets you don't have to nail it perfectly based on the month or or even you know you can be as as rough as the quarter or half year in your correctness where you get the changeover and um and and so I would encourage people to not agonize over the exact pinpointing of when is the last rate hike and rather just see that we are close to to the end of of rate hikes and Joel might have a slightly different opinion here or not and I'll let him voice that the other thing I would say is trueflation is an interesting um service that just shows inflation according to like a private service rather than a government aggregated service through CPI or PPI and trueflation would say that you know inflation is behind us at least for now true inflation I think they're they're saying it's about two percent I haven't seen the latest Mark and trueflation was early to say that inflation was coming up um before people were really talking about it and so I think it has some Merit there um as a tool to at least counterbalance governance government marks um now there is a world where inflation rears its ugly head again this decade and you know that's a different scenario and that's something that we talk about at play solver and that could make the coming expansion a little bit less consistently up and to the right for a sustained period and a little bumpier but at least over you know the next 12 to 18 months my expectation would would be that we we do see Peak rates in the second half of this year of 2023 and that um next year is a easing of rates and an injection of further liquidity into the markets as we ease our way out of recession yeah we're probably 90 shared view I'm a little bit less uh willing to say that we're we are in a recession exactly because depending on what you look at the the US has been surprisingly resilient to rate hikes but again it depends on what what you watch that said there's plenty of evidence that things are are on the verge of breaking or starting to break and the different people who uh watch different uh elements like for example treasury receipts uh we had the whole banking episode uh that is a direct byproduct of of rate hikes that those those types of things take a while to manifest in the economy especially when uh you have an industry that moves quarter by quarter um there's a uh a fellow that I I follow that likes to say that it takes it takes a long time for the page to pass through the python um is is his way of describing that it really can take a long time for these effects to be to to show and while I agree that we're we're probably near the end or near the peak um that doesn't mean that there aren't some uh negative catalysts ahead of us and and that those could coincide and so uh I would say that we're expecting a volatile period uh or the volatility that we've seen to continue potentially in both directions volatility doesn't care about the direction it's just um rapid changes in price um and so we invest slowly and we try to make sure that we get enough time diversity and like Chris said no we're not trying to kind of tie ourselves to a particular month or a particular order but more pay attention to how the Cyclones are playing out um that said whether this is good or bad it it really depends on which side of of the market you're on as far as as we're concerned this is one of the best times to be an investor and to be investing and this takes us back to 2018 and 2019 which were our favorite times to be investing as as Venture capitalists but also in in the public markets and we're caused to the remarking in our internal conversations how similar this is to 20 2018-19 which we look back with great songness now 2019 in 2018 and 19 were horrible um but you know you look back at them in in uh after the fact years after the fact then you you you realize how how great uh times they were and so we're really quite enjoying the the period that we have right now because we're sort of set up to to be able to invest through through periods of volatility but it does mean that it always feels the worst towards the end and so sentiment is always the worst at the bottom and so and then with every rate hike we're closer to the end as well because they can't go forever and so you know some people would argue that we should have done bigger rate hikes sooner because we'd be closer to the end uh than than we would be now and you know that's that's a credible argument um but overall uh I think it's it's it's more useful to think of these as times of opportunity rather than times of distress because if you have that mind set then you're better able to see that this is really a great time to be active in the market as opposed to being to waiting for the type to turn to to a large degree waiting for things to turn you've already lost the bulk of the opportunity so for example some people in kind of trading circles don't consider there to be a bull market until we've surpassed the all-time highs we're a long way from that but if you're waiting until we surpass the all-time highs to declare that it's a bull market and then to to become active you have lost two-thirds of of the opportunity already and what I would what I would layer in in here too is um the context that Joel and I are extremely long-term investors right and so I think we're sharing the perspective of a very long-term investor an accumulator during these periods and accumulator I guess according to uh crypto Twitter um and you know so so for us that's that's why it is um a time of opportunity and I think we do our best work in these environments and also like Venture money is back at 2018 19 lows right and so we're working with entrepreneurs in the way that we want to be the conversations have slowed down we can go deeper there's less Mania in the air all all good things for for building meaningful products but if you're a Trader you know you might be waiting for that you know final turn and the like rates will likely Peak when we get crisis right and so those two come together and so that could cause you know this this this another major moment of volatility that Joel's alluding to and so in that moment though it likely forces the fed's hand to be like okay everyone calm down like you know next uh meeting or at the meeting that they do lower rates or you know come down 25 basis points or whatever everyone can breed the sigh of relief now to get to that point they might have to break something right and so that's that and the trader might want to wait until that break has happened and then they'll jump in and it also depends on the scale of capital that you're moving um but long-term investor definitely what Joel's saying is is corrective this is a time of amazing opportunity and it's also in the public markets it's not just the private markets yeah I would also say that I imagine that the whole FTX Fiasco has really given VCS the upper hand so you guys are probably finding that it's reminiscent of 2018-19 because of what happened last year um so in a moment we're going to talk about regulation because that really is this drive right now but first a

Laura Link in the description back to my conversation with Chris and Joel so as we were just discussing the biggest story in crypto ever since the collapse at ftxg wonder why that is um is the story of Regulation and recently we saw a big judgment handed down by judge anna-lysa Torres in the southern district of New York on xrp and I'm just going to State this kind of slowly and carefully because I recently released two episodes about this but I continue to see a lot of commentary and confusion I get a lot of people dm'ing me saying that my guests were wrong that I was wrong blah blah you guys this you know this is what I've gotten from continued Research into this so basically what she ruled and and also note the language that I'm using here she wrote that those transactions in which the buyer had a legal relationship with ripple the company which you know that is what the institutional buyers had they had that legal relationship with ripple the company those constituted Securities transactions so I see some people saying she said xrp was a security sometimes and sometimes not it's really more about she was willing about these transactions and then what she was ruling is that sales occurring on exchanges where the buyer did not have a legal relationship with the company Ripple those did not constitute Securities transactions anyway just want to make that clear now my question is so this was seen as a victory for the industry also repudiation of the SEC and I was curious for your thoughts on kind of you know what effect this will have on the industry which has been in sort of limbo at least in the US for a while there's there's a lot to unpack there um but uh we agree that it's it's overall a really good precedent the battle is not over or the war is not over um that's that's a a battle that has been one to a degree um and uh based on my own personal analysis and opinion I agree with with the way that you described it um and it's the way that we have always thought about and and operated as investors and the meme on Twitter which I think is the correct meme is referencing how we test is that an investment contract for orange is doesn't mean that oranges are a security and so this this judgment is essentially in line with with that uh understanding and to to make it a little bit more practical what happens when companies or teams or entities or organizations raise money from investors buy even if it's by buying tokens there's often a contract associated with that that's something like a token purchase agreement they uh a Saft or or some other legal contract that then uh describes the exchange of money and capital for it for the asset and it makes total sense for that to be a secure transaction that should not be controversial and that should be regulated as a Securities transaction and all of the things that go along with it things like the accredited investor rules and and so on and so forth I think there's been a little bit of an overreaction to interpreting that as then going to make it really difficult to raise money for crypto teams I don't think it does that at all it does add some legal work around it but it it also shouldn't be as easy as you know just doing an Ico and selling tokens to a bunch of people and and um and getting a bunch of money to develop something and so I think this is a very fair middle ground that uh that aligns well with it should align well with the principles of the space the way we like to see teams come together develop a technology and release it is to raise Capital privately from investors in regulated transactions ideally equally and then create and and distribute an asset to to a community in a way that does not constitute a security transaction and so I think the ability to do that is preserved I think some kinds of investors that are more on the uh at least someone else's word for it kind of the token slipper types that uh is something that happened a lot of 2021 where they would buy tokens from a team three months before launch you know launch the token hype token then dump the token it should be harder for those investors influence to the business and hopefully this precedent makes it so but the the really important uh aspect of that ruling I think is there's the security judgment but there's there's also the part that covers the um the transactions on exchanges and that's really important for the koi based case because the coinbase case is predicated on the assets being Securities and so um if uh coinbase can't be an unregistered Securities Exchange if the assets that are being traded on that exchange are not Securities um so we're really hoping that that this will work out in coinbase's favor because they deserve it and that should bring a lot of clarity to one of the major concerns for many of the investors that we've talked to which is what is the impact of a token being security on user adoption and utility because Securities have become I think overly feared as a as a concept as if Securities where illegal Securities are not illegal there's I think 40 50 60 million Americans that own Securities and trade Securities that's not a problem something being a security is not a problem where it is a problem is well with a lot of these networks the asset is has a utility component and that a user ought to be able to uh you to spend the asset in order to consume a service and that's where an asset being deemed to security can be problematic because it means that I if I send it to you as a form of payment or I just use it in a game or something if that's a Securities transaction that comes with a lot of hair around it and so that's not sustainable so this ruling is really important to protect that aspect of the space the fact that the average user not the investor transactions with investors should be regulated um should be subject to disclosures and should be subject to investor protections and and other such things but we must really protect the ability for the end users to be able to receive transact and use the assets as they're intended to in the platform set that they've been attended to without those being Securities transactions which is what I think this court case sets us press and also one quick question which I guess uh Chris if you want to answer this um because they saw Adam Cochran tweeted uh oh if xrp so basically you know as we mentioned like certain transactions involving xrp can be Securities transactions but essentially she was saying xrp in and of itself is not security and so um Adam Cochran tweeted something like oh well if xrp isn't inherently a security then pretty much nothing in crypto would be because you know you probably remember um like even when coinbase did its assessment it gave it like the ranking closest to a security um so you guys have invested in like file coins Lana polygon and those were some of the tokens that were named as Securities those lawsuits um that the SEC brought you know against like coinbase and some of the other places and so I wondered and I obviously understand if you don't want to see any particular token but just being investors in tokens that have been named you know were you guys breathing a sigh of relief after the xrp thing or kind of how do you think about that ruling when it comes to your own adjustments I'm going to let Joel answer because I think he's he's more qualified um but I don't think we were worried but go ahead Joel I'm also curious about your opinion but I think we were less relief because we weren't worried but more like you know yes uh because it's it's what we believe and uh it's really great to see that uh the courts uh at least so far have been trending towards what they should be neutral and and assessing Things based on the matter merits and not the political implications and so the way we see it and and you know I'll allow myself to go little brother here as well one thing that's important to remember is the Howard test came out of a court case the courts are really important and uh going back to 2017 we were just getting started I used to joke that we're gonna get a court case in the Supreme Court someday and it's going to be an important case and we don't know what it's going to be about but it's going to be an important case because this technology is going to turn out to be so controversial that some of the implications of it are going to have to be decided by the courts and so in in some ways we were actually quite energized by by seeing um these cases uh come come to the fold because it there's a little bit of a deadlock in the U.S regulatory regime right now and Congress is doing some things but Congress is intentionally a slow body and so Congress is going to move at the speed of Congress um but unfortunately the setup that has been created in the US is such that I don't think that we're gonna get clarity directly from the regulator other than through Court precedence and that's okay looking at the history of financial regulation a lot of it is a consequence of of Court outcomes and court cases in Austin you get this interplay between congressional action and judicial action and then executive action that that comes on the on the back of it if you look at for example the different points in time at which even the creation of the cftc and the different breaking points in time when the cftc regulations were updated and the Futures regulation and commodities they often coincided would be periods of financial speculation and then the unraveling of Bubbles and then the lawsuits that would emerge from that and then the court precedence that would then uh kick Congress into action and so that same Dynamic seems to be playing out here more broadly however the the US really stands in stark contrast to what's happening elsewhere in the world elsewhere in the world we're seeing the complete opposite reaction and Direction and I'll just do a very quick overview but you know the UK just passed some really positive crypto laws and have made it uh have made web 3 a national priority the EU has passed them crypto loss starting with stable coins in the Middle East even the UAE created a an entirely separate different regulatory agency just for digital Assets in Asia we have South Korea and Japan that have also made this an important strategy and we've all probably seen uh what's been happening in Hong Kong and in Latin America and so the the global Trend and the global trend is really important because these are Global networks and Global assets the global trend is to work clear it stores clear rules and clear regulation and legislation and the USS is slow on that trade and we could debate all of the reasons why but ultimately what happens globally is more important than what happens in the US but even the U.S dire as it may seem from the surface is actually trending in a very positive direction so one thing I wanted to ask about was the lumus gillibrand bill proposes to set up a self-regulatory organization or SRO to basically yeah self-regulate the industry if such an organization were to be established what would be on your wish list of what it would implement um well first I think it's a great idea we have that in finance with finra which we're a part of and you know it acts as an intermediary between the the industry and and the regulator um as far as wish list I haven't thought about that but um I would hope that they make extensive use of smart contracts to to regulate uh or to self-regulate and for it to be an opportunity to establish a very modern and effective uh regime for real-time regulation in a way that's uniquely possible through this technology something like shindra which has existed for a long time relies on paper to operate digital papers and PDFs but it's still stuck in the 20th century of submitting filings and and filling out things by by hand Etc and I think with this technology we have an opportunity to really showcase the power of of smart contracts into digital assets to self not only self-regulate but self-regulated and automated intelligent way and I would just throw in the the probably the number one thing top of mind for me um at least as it relate relates to the assets and the distributions is something placeholders always been focused on and that is who gets what allocations Within These networks um and we wrote about this in 2021 as the you know the original sin of the creation of a lot of crypto networks and if we go in time and we just kind of break it up between Insider and Outsider and I know it's it might be funny to some people because placeholder is technically on the inside as we help you know a lot of entrepreneurs formulate the ideas and um you know actually launch the networks but because of that we get a look at um how things are constructed and I think we come from a very ideological place of one of the things that brought us to crypto is this idea of better Distributing access to Capital um and wealth creation for everyone in the world and uh if you look at Bitcoin is a Open Access Network everyone could have been mining it from the beginning now it was a very limited set of Cypher punks and like you can make lots of arguments about how you know that became unevenly distributed and I actually would say that because of the Matthew effect the law of the cumulative Advantage things do skew towards inequality and and we're not trying to create a perfectly equal world I think we're trying to increase everyone's access to a fair playing field and so you know Bitcoin had a pretty fair distribution I'd say ethereum also had a very fair distribution in that everyone could get access to the Ico right anyone could have put in BTC in 2014 and in some ways icos were better in 2017. like some people got ripped off but some people um from a you know small base of money and just you know a retail perspective not having a big institution like what placeholder is we're able to get access to projects at a very early stage that changed their lives and you know it is unfortunate I would say that in trying to protect the consumer in some ways the SEC cut out the consumer from some of those early gains and actually pushed a lot of that activity to VCS but then in pushing a lot of that activity to VCS I would say placeholder on the spectrum of like ideological sits pretty far to to the side of ideological or or you know driven by some ideals um that we want to see proliferate in the world and so we do think about these things a lot there are other firms who are more financially driven and you know it just depends on what you're prioritizing and um I would say that the more financially driven firms can create distributions that benefit insiders more than is likely healthy for for the overall power of this movement and so a way to neutralize it is just standardized reporting around who gets what why do they get it um and and you know this even just feeds into how Dows are capitalized and then how the service providers to das are paid and Ryan sulcus at massari has been on this for a while you know um and so if we could get a standardized framework around the original allocations and the asset flow of these major crypto assets I think that would help people a lot because right now it's kind of murky through coin market cap and I mean it's it's getting better um and like uh defy llama I think has some good Open Access tools where you can see Supply over time and you can get an idea of if you are going to get really diluted as as a retail purchaser in the market but just increasing the ease of access to that information and standardizing it would go a long way all right so my last question for you that's kind of business slash Regulatory and then we will get to the investment stuff which is probably in some ways more fun um I just wanted to ask you because I still feel like there is kind of two big dark clouds that are potentially looming over the industry one involves digital currency Group which is a huge company has invested in a ton of companies and also has a number of subsidiaries it's subsidiary Genesis has already filed for bankruptcy and dcg is facing a lawsuit by Jam and I um the other is binance I'm just going to combine these for efficiency's sake binus is in a tough situation that's been sued by both the cftc the SEC uh they recently laid off a thousand staff they're cutting benefits their market share is decreasing the liquidity and finance U.S is almost non-existent I just wonder you know how you guys were thinking about these two uh potential you know events um and you know I don't even know what you think will happen there but why don't you maybe yeah give some thoughts on those two things to how that might affect the overall industry I would address them as a package and you know it's it's all part of broadly speaking and then you know we can go into ridiculous but broadly speaking it's all part of pleading out the the industry and uh going back to kind of the quip earlier about there's there's good actors there's Bad actors and there's people who make mistakes um if if you're a good actor and you made a mistake you know sometimes mistakes you gotta have to be punishable too or punished too even if um if they were made innocently or or without evil intent um and you know that's that's how a fair World Works um and so if you if you acted in a way that cost harm then you should face the consequences of that um and I think it's part of the same kind of event where it discourages people or at least makes them think twice about acting in ways that could be potentially harmful such as using too much leverage or putting customer assets at risk and so on and so forth or having shoddy internal processes Etc because the the pain of even though you know the era of easy money makes it all exhilarating and you might feel like you can get away with anything and you're the king of the world and uh nothing bad that will ever happen to you and everything's fine uh when the tide turns is really painful and then you have to turn around and and really uh pay for all of that and um and so I think that's all part of the same umbrella uh ultimately you know when the FTX event was going on I I likened it to a surgery to remove a tumor the surgery sucks it's painful it's you know you you have to go through so much trauma to do it but you have to get the the tumor out otherwise you're just not going to be healthy and so I actually uh felt relieved when FTX collapsed weirdly enough and and you know that catalyzed a bunch of these other things because I I would much rather have the situation that we have now than a situation where imagine if if it hadn't collapsed and it was still going on today and you know dcg would still be operating the way that it is there wouldn't be as many as much scrutiny Finance how much more horrible would it be when they'd all inevitably collapse as it as it was going to collapse anyway and so as far as I'm concerned it's it's sort of yeah take the Band-Aid off get all the all the bad stuff out of the system and the sooner we can get through this period uh the the sooner we can really get back on on the right track and I would say we don't have at least I don't have any Edge on the specifics of the dcg situation or the binance situation um Joel and I have you know known Barry silbert for a long time and actually going back to 2014 when I was at ARC you know Barry was like one of the people that approached Arc and grayscale at the time which was very nascent about the Bitcoin Investment Trust and so I guess I have some loyalties there you know and so and I've also seen Barry um Judo uh Judo flip a lot of situations into his favor and so I guess I'm not willing to you know hold judgment on Barry or dcg until the whole you know picture is revealed and I over the years have learned to not um bet against him like I even just remember as an example when ethereum forked in 2016 because of the Dao I was at ARC and I had like a few people calling my desk bidding for the forked eth and I was like why are people buying the fork to eat like this thing's useless like everything no everyone knows this thing's going to zero and it turns out that like I think Genesis was like accumulating a lot of Etc and it was like at like fractions I mean it was it was Pennies on the dollar right and it's actually a brilliant thing to do it drew the ire of ethereum people and like I understand all of that but I also have to acknowledge that he will do things um that you know no one else would think to do I guess and and sometimes that can get you into hot water and again I don't understand enough of the specifics to hold judgment on that situation and and um you know with Finance with Finance I don't know CZ personally like I've corresponded with him through Twitter DMs I have less of like a read on his character we we have some anecdotes from people that we know he's definitely a risk taker you know there's no doubt about that so both of these people are Risk Takers and I think they're calculated Risk Takers and I would expect them to find some way to survive but you know it's going to be with some battle wounds and some restraints and things like that but they're still they're still both Titans of the industry so I think it's easy to kick someone like that when they're down and you know and and that's not at all what Joel was doing I think Joel is just speaking broadly about the industry and say the catharsis of this process and so that would be where I land with dcg in finance yeah that day when um Etc started trading or the real it's really the days afterward um that is a very entertaining scene in my book and I had some Choice tweets of Barry that I included because he was riding a high and gloating about on Twitter so I mean it was crazy that was such a crazy process I remember poloniex was the first to list Etc and then like people started paying attention to it and then like a bunch of hash rates swung from E to Etc is that like 20 of eth's hash rate and it was like and then it all became a thing you know and I I don't know at least in that period I think Etc traded to like 30 bucks from like a few cents right and so like that was a ridiculous amount of wealth creation very quickly just by say questioning what was like widely the consensus thinking at the time yeah if I'm memory yeah my memory is something like it was three dollars and fifty cents and it was at eight but anyway I'll have to look it up in my book but all right so this is probably the part that we've been that the audience has been waiting for especially the dijons um so you know given everything that's been going on obviously as we discussed VCS are in Prime position to make some really good Investments it you know it just feels like uh you guys have the upper hand right now so what is your current investment thesis and people wanted me to ask you Joel since you're famous for the fat protocols thesis which by the way it just blows my mind that that was published seven years ago um but people were curious to hear you know whether you still think that that holds up um well I'm asked that a lot um and there's there's a couple of related uh pieces that I've written both before fat protocols and after fat protocols that add a lot of context and there's also a lot of um um I think different interpretations than the one that I originally intended uh when when it was written but the short answer is I haven't seen any evidence that it hasn't held up and that doesn't mean that it will always hold up however I do make a a big distinction between you know value capture and investment returns they're not the same thing and that's something that I Illustrated in the follow-up called thin applications which describe that you you can have most of the value captured at the protocol layer and still have periods of time when most of the investment returns are at the application layer and those are two very different things and so um I think a lot of people took it to mean that that you could only have value at the vertical layer and that you would never have value at the at the application layer or at the layers at the top and I just don't think that's true our investment activity it reflects that we don't only invest it in in the fat protocol so you can have you know something that has that exhibits a great return financially built on top of ethereum that never surpasses the value of ethereum and then the other Nuance is that the the language that I use talk about layers of protocols and layers of applications it was really looking at a macro view of you know take all the protocols together take all the applications together what's going to be the relative value split uh so that's another Nuance but more broadly speaking in terms of where we are now and how has that developed and thinking less about the financial aspect and thinking more about uh the the progression of the technology um I'm actually taking back to an even older post that was called the blockchain application stack and I think a copy of it is still up on coindesk and the blockchain application stack is I think I wrote it in 2014 and this was before ethereum launched this so it was all it was very Bitcoin heavy but it outlined this view that uh in 10 years new web applications would be built essentially on a stack of of a shared data layer which at the time I sort of identified the Bitcoin blockchain as being a shared data layer now I think it's you know several blockchains than a shared protocol layer which at the time I called them overlay networks that would anchor onto the shared data layer and then these overlay networks would provide specific Services as as protocols uh that would also be open source and then there would be an API layer and then an application layer on top and the API layer would be how the applications would interact with the overlay networks or the protocols and then the underlying blockchains and over the past couple of years but we've seen a trend that has now accelerated of layer 2 networks and now the the emerging technology of Roll-Ups that is is pretty close to to that Vision where there's now a growing Trend even though some of these technologies have been other development for several years now that they're coming to Market and it sticks us back to the conversations about cycles and the time that it takes for the infrastructure to mature we're quickly entering a world where it's much cheaper and faster for teams to lease protocols that work as l2s or Roll-Ups on top of major networks like ethereum or Bitcoin or Avalanche and and other networks like that than it is to launch your own blockchain uh or or smart contract Network or L1 from scratch um and and that's really interesting because it's it's very similar to that early sketch even though there was a bunch of things wrong with it but I actually think it it in some ways reinforces the fat protocol thesis because it what we're seeing is the beginnings of the consolidation of the infrastructure and so going back to the installation facing the Carlotta model what you have during the installation phase is an expansion in in the infrastructure where a lot of capital funds a lot of different attempts and a lot of different competing Alternatives and so we get a lot of choice in the market as we're experimenting and figuring out what's the right way to build things but what happens when you're transitioning towards the deployment phase is that that those choices begin to consolidate into the the more uh formidable pieces of infrastructure and it's it's only when the infrastructure begins to solidify that you get the explosion of the applications on top and I think we're starting to enter that cycle which has us extremely excited it's very similar to what the web went through in in the early 2000s actually with the with the app end of the cloud for example which was a way of consolidating all of the internet technology into an easy to consume cheap package for companies to build on top and then before the cloud before Cloud systems which was really just packaging all of the internet infrastructure that existed before it was extraordinarily expensive to start a new web company because you had to set up your own servers and and um you know get good bandwidth and and do a lot of things but as those things became Consolidated and packaged then you could move to a model where it was really cheap to launch new companies and what we're seeing now with with the these emerging Technologies is is becoming extremely cheap and extremely easy to launch new networks that don't have to have their own token necessarily but don't have to have their own miners or their own validator set but still are able to to provide the same level of of security or maybe even higher security and scalability and so what we're seeing the market teams leveraging that technology and Chris I'm sure will add a lot to this we're seeing two things either new teams that will be starting from scratch uh leveraging these Technologies and will require a lot less Capital to get to Market and we'll get to Market much quicker and so that is is creating a really Dynamic and really uh engaging uh new generation of companies and also existing companies that are thinking of transitioning their infrastructure over to the large step I guess I'll I'll pick up where Joel left off there and I I guess I I will start with infrastructure and um which also alluding to with the mic immigration is really the long tail of layer one smart contract networks that have a very costly validator ecosystem you can think of them as a little bit like um what was the pets company or webvan there's the famous pets company both of those yeah that's pets.com or webvan you know I I don't know if they had to do this but I suspect they had to set up their own data centers you know they had a bunch of costs everyone in the 90s had to do it yeah this alludes to what Joel was saying of like they had to set up this massive amount of infrastructure that was basically redundant with a bunch of other people having to set up their massive infrastructure and that's one of the many things that ultimately crushed them in the cost to provision the service to the end user and I'd say the long tail of smart contract networks that don't really have much in the way of differentiated daps or you know transaction fee demand they've for the most part pretty high annual rates of Supply inflation so the amount of the new units of the crypto asset that are minted each year or the percentage of the overall float that's minted each year to sustain the validator the the validator set and so that is that is only sustainable so long as you have growing transaction fee demand to ultimately lower the rate of Supply inflation and provide you know true yield to the validators through the transaction fee demand which is the progression we've seen ethereum make right where Now ethereum is really supplanted the annual Supply inflation with transaction fees and now you know eth is basically uh even or deflationary in the amount of new eth that's created and it's still producing yield because there's organic demand there most layer ones and and when I say most layer ones I mean I think I think at this point there's I mean there's certainly dozens and there's probably hundreds because I don't know them all um the ones that don't have enough demand they're probably going to become Roll-Ups right because they built duplicative data centers that they can't maintain that they're going to bleed out value from and then people are going to eventually give up and be like well why am I eating all this annual Supply inflation when there's no transaction fee Demand on the horizon and so well some some will die maybe they'll shut off their validator sets I I don't know we we've talked before about how protocols don't die the way companies do and that's kind of the murky thing that I'll that I'll leave there to the side but they'll certainly Fade Into relevance unless they kind of give themselves a second life by moving to a roll-up system where a roll-up system you're going from having a pretty costly validator set to a few sequencers or a shared sequencer and there's teams working on shared sequencers now and the the cost of your infrastructure for equal or Superior security collapses right and so then you don't need those those High rates of annual Supply inflation in and then you can you know you will see more clearly whether the yields coming from transaction fees and also maybe the teams will be able to build and this is still at the infrastructure layer but build more differentiated tooling for developers to make it easier for them to launch applications and so for us at the infrastructure layer I would say um we've been most focused on the the large public winners that are consolidating power and you know that's Bitcoin in in ether but we've also been very vocal about Solana um uh beginning second half of last year into this year we do think that's a robust Standalone ecosystem and that the Solana virtual machine can stand alongside the ethereum virtual machine there's very strong Network effects around the ethereum virtual machine but we think that um Solana is differentiated enough and appeals to a different enough set of more web to traditional Finance minded folks that that find that ecosystem more familiar that you know a ecosystem of roughly equivalent power will form around the svm it wouldn't surprise me to see more users actually on the svm in the next expansion than on the evm even if the number of developers and total asset value on the evm is is larger and we can piece that apart more but at least that the infrastructure stage we have been focused on the public markets which signifies opportunity to you know anyone listening uh to this call we have also worked with uh Celestia for for a long time well I guess going back to 2021 before Roll-Ups and data availability was the buzzword that it is now or modular was the buzzword that it's now and we are excited about what Celeste is building that will take more time um in in in terms of building out the layers to reach the end user but it is a provocative architecture that I would say can provision block space at the lowest cost possible with the best performance and customized customizability um attributes for for developers but it will take time to get there um so let me pause because I think you have questions I I do have two questions so maybe one of you can take uh one of or you know each of you guys can split these um one would be I've seen people wondering you know are we gonna have so many layer twos because I've seen some people say that it'll probably coalesce into a few um you know others are like no no there's going to be a ton of them so that would be one question and then the other is about Solana um because there are other blockchains that are similar to it you know they are just more centralized and so I wonder you know how you thought that affected their kind of I guess yeah long-term popularity or where that would place them in the crypto Market let's start with layer twos take it away Joel I think there will be Millions of networks and protocols I'll explain why it's we don't need a million smart contracts or a million uh smart contract platforms we don't we don't need that many however between the lines of everything that we're saying is a massive reduction in cost across the board and that's that's that's it that's an important thing to understand uh cost to the user cost of transaction cost of development uh cost of launching networks Etc and there's an economic relationship between Supply and cost in in sort of basic economics and so I find it helpful to think about uh what happens when the cost of launching a network is zero the cost of launching a website today is zero and so we it's not hard for me to imagine that we get to a place where where the cost of of launching a a an L2 or L3 or hyper chain or whatever people call it um you know there's there's the technical terms in the marketing terms but the just call them l2s or or overlay networks um the question is then what are those networks going to do and if you're only thinking in the dimension of these are all ethereum competitors or ethereum Alternatives that's that's never going to happen however I think we can think of four categories there's going to be the the contract Networks there's going to be the application specific networks and that's really a world where each major application or application of sufficient scale has its own role or its own uh Network likely roll-up based uh as as the back end and that's really a structural change in how we build online services there's also going to be sector-specific networks and geography specific networks and those may also converge in some ways so you may have a smart contract networks and this is also related to regulatory outcomes where some of what regulatory uh uh events are going to do is they're going to create some fragmentation in the industry where you might have Universal leaflight protocols like uniswap but you might have a version of uniswap running on a roll-up Network that serves only certain countries in Latin America that have an agreement amongst themselves to operate their Network in a certain way so you might have for example Regional D5 networks or hyper local D5 networks uh the moment that it's really cheap to launch these and so when when you think about all of those categories um then it really expands um uh really the what what a network is or what a protocol is in the case of for example gaming for instance we're seeing a lot of gaming focused networks that are meant to network together an ecosystem of games and they're not necessarily made to network with all of the games in the world but to create a shared environment for them to operate with each other and then some of those games may have their own their own uh separate Roll-Ups or networks and so um from that perspective things that become really important are the technologies that we've already talked about the things like Bridges and liquidity venues for assets and information to pass freely between these networks and we're we're seeing a lot of teams working on on providing solutions to both of those and so when you when you put all of that together it really it really makes it possible for there to be as many networks as there are websites now you might ask why is that necessary why would you want that and I think that um thinking of a blockchain as a backend to a website um really puts you in a position of think okay what are the the benefits of thinking about it this way and so so far blockchains have been backends to lots of different applications and lots of of uh different uh Services kind of like the mainframes in the era where one machine would run all the things and so now every website has its own dedicated sort of servers and they're often in the same data center but they're you know uh you could simplistically you could think of one website one server uh even though sometimes they run multiple servers but the advantages here is okay how what are the structural elements of this architecture that make it Superior to web 2 and I think it also comes back down to the to the to the cost of operation where uh one of the consequences of centralized infrastructure in book two is that a company has to take on all of the cost of operations which are massive and so you know Snapchat or Twitter to use a familiar example has massive infrastructure costs and when we look at what Twitter had to do with uh really shutting down public access to the network and limiting it to for example logged in accounts which people interpreted as you know Elon Musk being britty Reedy but it had a real a real economic reason which was Twitter could not handle a massive increase in traffic from AI agents scraping its website because it produced a massive increase in infrastructure costs without a corresponding increase in revenues or profits and that to me and I'm going to say the uh we've gotten through an hour and change without talking about AI so we'll talk about AI for a little bit it's interesting to think okay you know I won't say a bunch of things about AI but if if we can imagine a world where every human has several AI agents working on their behalf and all of these AI agents are visiting all these different websites and Gathering all this information and we really believe that web to infrastructure and web to business models are going to be able to cope with a thousand fold or million fold increase in web traffic when 99 of that increase comes from machines who don't click on ads don't subscribe to Services who who don't generate Revenue in the web 2-way and it from that perspective it seems really obvious to me that the only kinds of services that are going to be able to cope with that new reality are the ones that are built on a blockchain and smart contract basis because the back end is decentralized and it's distributed and because you can have business models that are AI compatible with digitally native microtransactions where you can you can charge the AI fractions of ascent to access a service or to access a function or to access some media and then we can really now uh experiment the business models that are compatible with the new reality it's very clear right now that webto business models are incompatible with with that emerging future and so I think those two elements converge here in a really elegant and beautiful way and that's one of the reasons why we're excited so there's so much there it could be a whole nother episode to unpack but I do want to just for for some listeners I do want to clarify that when Joel's saying millions of networks that doesn't mean millions of layer ones or data availability layers right it's a Consolidated set at the base providing data availability and then when we're talking about millions of Networks you're really getting into say the execution layers and that is kind of also to your question too Laura around l2s and I think people need to differentiate because if you look at optimism they've released the op stack where you look at CK sync they've released the ZK stack and then you will have optimism the layer two you'll have ZK sync the layer too there will be teams that build in those layer 2 environments right and they get improved composability say with other contracts that are in that layer 2 environment but there will also be teams like we've seen with Bass from coinbase that take that stack and build their own L2 right and so in that per through that view we are going to have dozens hundreds thousands hundreds of thousands potentially millions of these environments depending on the needs of the application right the infrastructure needs of the application and some applications might exist in the say Mothership l2s and I would say those are going to be the ones that um most need Atomic composability now this is assuming that we don't solve for Atomic composability cross Roll-Ups and that's like a whole nother layer of experimentation I would say and it would be more like uh people talk about a lot about like message or value interoperability but they need to also talk more probably about state reading and state interoperability between Roll-Ups and that's like an emerging part of of say the picture so what we're excited about is there's a bunch of open questions right and so no one has it figured out and where the network effects are going to reside um at these higher levels people are still trying to figure out even though it's becoming increasingly clear and this goes back to say part of placeholder strategy that some of the core existing uh public crypto assets are likely to be long-term winners that keep winning right and so your average investor doesn't necessarily have to figure all of this out when you know they have access to names like BTC Ethan Seoul in the public market I guess I mean you had asked about Solana Laura and you know we we observed Solana for a long time we saw the white paper when it came out I think in 2017 the white paper first came out from from tolly and we never got involved with salon at the private pre-launch stage we did have talks with the team in the prior bear market and for us we tend each bear Market we tend to really focus on a underdog ecosystem that we think has true Merit and accumulate a sizable stake in that underlying asset and then Venture invest on top to understand the network to support the entrepreneurs to help make our own luck to interconnect good entrepreneurs with each other within that ecosystem and so we did that with ethereum in 2018-19 and it worked out for us and we're doing the same thing I would say with Seoul in in this bear market and um socialization was a point of focus for us you know we've been in crypto for a long time we want the benefits of these systems to be maximally distributed and I think our view is last year was a what was a majorly redistributing event for Solana right and if you hated Solana because of FTX or because of Sam or because of you know some of the low float Shenanigans which I agree were deplorable around some of the tokens launched on top of Solana then you should be happy that those things got washed out or that those predatory tokens are basically now irrelevant or down 99.9 percent and so um similar to Joel's analogy around the tumor like there were a lot of tumors that were taken out of Solana um last year and so that say made it a proper timing for for us to get involved and then you know I think I totally just tweeted recently that there's something like 300 yeah 320 000 stickers um on on salon and I I'm not going to get into the semantics of uh duplicatives and what's an individual Staker because that can also become a bigger Rabbit Hole I would encourage people to look at I think it's Naka flow yeah nakaflow.io and Laura I can send you that it's a measure of decentralization and the number of nodes you would need to take offline um or the number of nodes that control one third of the stake of a proof of stake Network which is a critical threshold and you know there I'd say Solana ranks well um near near the high end of its peers and it ranks higher than ethereum in in that value now this is a whole sticky debate in and of itself what I would say though is Solana is sufficiently decentralized to be resilient and to provide distributed value to the world and then um one of the reasons we we talked about infrastructure investing at Lane but on the Venture side we've been spending more and more time at the application layer and we want to work with entrepreneurs who want to to bring the applications to 10 or hundreds of millions of users and one of the areas where we've been most focus is the salon application layer and the reason for that is as the infrastructure is still say coming into its final form around ethereum or you know Celestia as as an up-and-coming Contender here Solana has a road map that I would say uh requires application developers to think a little bit less about the infrastructure um and in having to think about it a little bit less they can think more about user onboarding um user experience some of the Dynamics of what makes a product really good and sticky for users and so um we would expect that uh some of krypto's biggest applications in the Nexus fashion will be on top of Solana a good example would be drip.house which we work with it's drip.haus and there it's just it's playing with the idea of inverting nfts from a very expensive scarce thing that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to hey get onto a list a drip list and they have many drip lists now for for it can be an artist it can be a music protocol like Vault it could be a restaurant in the future but you get on this drip list and you get dropped weekly nfts for for free and so it starts to invert this model of okay I gotta pay a hundred thousand dollars to gain access this club to hey I just got to spend the time to get onto this list and then I'm going to get goodies free goodies on a weekly basis that I own and I can choose what to do with and then you're like well how could they possibly afford to do that and you look at say State compression on Solana and drip as an example could drop 100 million nfts for 200 bucks and so sorry 100 million nfts for a thousand bucks 10 million nfts for 200 bucks right and this is on salama's website's State compression but you're starting to get to economics of scale that allow for experimentation at scale right and even if an nft costs a dollar to deliver to a user that's too much right and so I think the rough math that we ran is um with Solana as compared to what's failed on ethereum at least right now this will change over time but you can experiment with a thousand users on Solana for every one user you can experiment with on ethereum specific to nfts and so it's just those types of things that will allow more iteration and this is not to say like we are not here we a lot of our careers thanks to ethereum you know Joel and I I'd say grew up we cut our teeth on bitcoin and crypto and we grew up with ethereum and um I would say that ethereum still has a very core place in our beings but we also want to help support other ecosystems of Merit that have differentiated approaches that we see as appealing to differentiated developers that will build products that bring in different types of users and so to us Solana has Merit in that regard yeah so Joel started to discuss this but I definitely want to explore it further because obviously in the last I don't know like half year roughly there's there's been so much talk about Ai and already people are looking at using Ai and crypto together so what investment opportunities are you guys excited about um in that Nexus there's a couple of different layers to that um and I'll I'll start with media because we were just talking about nfts and one of the interesting things about the emergence of generative AI at the same time of massive unpopularity of nfts broadly speaking kind of on a mainstream level how they both come together where in in 2021 which is crazy to think as the world free AI uh or pre-large language models or generated models um it was pretty impossible for even the average artist to understand why they why would you need digital scarcity for digital art um those Concepts seem very foreign and so a lot of artists had a really negative reaction and there's a bunch of of other Associated is reasons there but the average person outside of crypto really couldn't understand the value of nfts not just on the consumer side but on the Creator side as well and what's what's interesting now is that uh anyone who engages in Creative work has had a realization that they now have to compete with machines and or use machines in an interesting way to to to leverage their art and and there's there's there's going to be or we're seeing this expansion of creative potential and creative output as as a result of of uh of machine creativity uh posing the written form the visual form uh the the audio the audio form Etc and so um I think nfts are going to play a really important role in establishing the provenance of content and that's an old idea that's actually a 10 year old idea uh back when I was at Union Square Ventures um we the the way that I got to know uh Jesse Walden and Dennis Nasser up Jesse who's now the founder of variant and Dennis who's the founder of mirror was through a company they had started that we invested in called Amai and we spent two years uh trying to figure out on-chain content attribution and it was way too early because no one cared about it and my whole idea or maybe it was the two well it was called okay yeah it was the same uh it was called mine and then the the protocol was called media chain and the idea was well we had Bitcoin in the early beginnings of ethereum and the idea was well let's inscribe the metadata of uh you know piece of music or a piece of art onto the blockchain so that you could always know who created it this is is this is before the word token was popular this is before nfts this is before ethereum launched and so it was really ahead of its time but no one cared now all of a sudden people kind of care about where the content came from or or where the media came from and we're really gonna care uh about who produced it and to be able to trace it not not because machine generated content is bad just we just want to know whether it was created by a machine or a human or attribution right just just to inject a little idea of like it's going to piecemeal pay a whole bunch of people that it stitched the idea from then you'll need a programmatic system so that's that's something that a blockchain is uniquely capable of of providing and so that's that's I think going to be an important uh layer of infrastructure for media altogether going forward and the way we see it played out for example the early experiments and on-chain social media networks on a platform like mirror um if it's which is a writing platform everything that you write gets Minted as an nft and you can trade it it has value there's there's sort of ways to to generate economics from it but I think over the long term there's there's more of a cumulative effect than an acute effect to every piece of media being tokenized and um it's really it's which is a kind of network effect where it's really valuable when all the media is tokenized because then you can create all of these relationships in the different forms of media and you start to get Innovations in How We Do recommendation algorithms and and how we track preferences for people because for example if I have an nft of something that you wrote in my wallet than any application that is able to look at my my wallet's contents can tell something about who I am as a user by the nfts that I hold whatever they are so making nfts cheap is really key to that and we start to see how that changes the relationship between users and services uh in that right now for example Facebook or Instagram or Tick Tock are a black box of recommendations that you really can't control and they profile us or they profile the users and they know the things that you like and that you're going to like but it's all a proprietary algorithm that they control and it's not access and it's less about the control it's more like it's not accessible to other applications uh who might compete with them so it creates these anti-competitive environments however when all that information is on chain then you could have a much more Dynamic much broader selection of applications that can tailor content or recommendations or shopping to you without relying on that black box and this is where you know being able to deliver nfts for fractions and fractions of ascent uh it is necessary for that to play out some other areas and I'll take less time with them are uh and these are some of my play things in my mind that that I'm interested about and so thank you for indulging me wallets for machines is I think that's something something that's very interesting and that's a very narrow uh idea and if someone's working on that please reach out um because I'm I'm very interested in that I'm I'm very interested in AI agents that have their own wallets and that provide services get paid to provide those services and then also spend to provide to consume services from other machines this goes back to that idea that we might have a uh you know 10 order of magnitude increasing web traffic but 99 of that growth may come from machines and so I'm really interested in machines paying each other for services and in thinking about about that world wait and quick question um there I think there was uh something on ethereum that enabled that recently and so you're basically saying like the application that utilize Etc okay got it yeah and there's all other things like that are happening on ethereum as well like I forget the specific ERC uh proposals but there's one that gives nfts their own wallet and so something that we're starting to see some people experimenting I just had that on my show I might be 6551 it's so embarrassing I just did a whole show on it I'm like which number is that you're probably right um but that's really interesting because for example people are tokenizing as nfts all kinds of things and so one of our one of the companies in our portfolio great uh thank you for reminding me I will never forget about that one of the companies that we work with is tokenai saying uh automations which are primitive forms of AI as nfts that can be traded and the the AI doesn't live in the nft but the nft represents essentially like a property right to that agent or to that AI that can be traded and that's something that's you know this this is some stuff that is really far out there but it's really exploring a world where there isn't like one chat GPT and five competitors but rather we all have several of these smaller agents that do different things or trained for specific purposes and that worked for us and it's very obvious to me that that's only going to work um if web services are built on a blockchain substrate because those machines are going to have to pay each other those machines are going to have to build reputation for each other to be able to judge uh which ones to use which ones have an operating history um so all of those things combined think uh are they're really important intersections of of Krypton AI we might even say that AI might be crypto's killer app that's so cool Chris there's a lot of foundational thinking that that goes into the things that Joel said and um I want to just Channel our partner Brad for a second because um Brad Burnham is a venture partner with placeholder and Union Square Ventures and help get uh well he founded Junior's grow Ventures with with Fred Wilson in the early internet application era so he's gone through that in web 2 um and you know he's now um working alongside both firms in web 3 and his obsession until correct me if I'm wrong but his obsession I would say is an Insight application that goes and gathers information for you and that's likely these AI agents and then brings you the end outcome or the end information and that inside application likely only works when you're custodying the full view of your own data so right now our data exists in all these web 2 Thief dumps and so Facebook has a a partial look at us and Amazon has a partial look at us and apple has a partial look at us and they produce pretty good AI services for us right now but they don't have the full picture and most of us wouldn't be comfortable giving them the full picture we'd be like no that's invasive but um just as we all have homes that hold most of our information in the physical world right and maybe we scatter it in a few places and we have keys that unlock that information to the people that need access we need the same architecture in the digital world and so we're migrating over time and it takes a very long time towards a world where we can authenticate our data the full picture of our information to these agents right that then will do work for us process the digital world and so it's shortcuts say a lot of the work that we have to currently do and the bra the example that Brad often gives is if he goes and buys skis you know for for ski season then skis chase him around the internet for the next many weeks because everyone has a piecemeal view of his data versus if someone had a holistic view they would say okay he bought the skis don't bother him about the skis anymore and it's like all right agent ABC you know go bug him about you know mitts for his wife or something because she hasn't bought myths yet and we'd know like last year she bought mitts or you know whatever it is um and so but again that architecture relies upon blockchains to authenticate full views of who we are to these systems so that our privacy and our rights are um you know honored but then also that the services the digital services that we use improve with time all right so this is a very slight pivot but I just have to ask this question it'll be our last as we record the SEC just acknowledged five Bitcoin ETF application BlackRock Fidelity wisdom treat vanic and Invesco what do you project will happen there do you think we'll see if Bitcoin uh a spot Bitcoin EDF approved and if so which one or which ones well uh Chris has a background in ETFs and so I'm I'm curious what his thoughts are but I hope we do this would be this would be an important event and these people have been uh pursuing that for for a long time and but you know I let Chris talk about the specifics of ETF but I'll maybe talk a little bit about the significance of why you know because some people ask why would you want it in an ETF if you can just go get it there's the financial argument which is yeah there's a lot of investors and allocators who just cannot or won't allocate uh to these assets unless they're in an ETF and and that's one point but more broadly I think it's an important event for the integration of the internet Financial system and the traditional Financial system and so we need these borders that uh really integrate uh the the Two Worlds and so if an ETF allows for larger Capital flows into for example an asset like Bitcoin that trickles down to the to the rest of of the industry even if there's no direct relationship so thinking about it as the harmonic convergence of um of the Two Worlds is something that needs to happen whether it happens now or later um tpd but I hope it does I have a very hard time saying whether it's going to happen or not because um I think it just really comes down to Gary Gensler and I don't know him personally and I have um of course views on his motivations and but at the same time I think that there's a growing amount of political pressure to treat crypto a bit more fairly and um approving an ETF could be a release valve a Bitcoin ETF could be a release valve to do that when I worked at ARC we did a bunch of work on on a Bitcoin ETF and Arc is also in the running here um it's weird that they weren't in that announcement I'll have to go go look but um I remember we did a bunch of work at that time and I I submitted some comment letters to the SEC in that you know 2014 to 17 time frame that I was at ARC because the Bitcoin markets were probably too small and the infrastructure wasn't quite there to support an ETF and I could understand some of the sec's arguments then but now if you look at when gold ETFs were approved Bitcoin ETS are getting held to a much higher standard relative to say what gold ETFs were held to when they were approved and so and and there's a bunch of ways that you can uh say approach the process and say hey this is starting to appear unfair um and people will raise the Futures ETFs right and why are we approving Futures ETFs that also in Long Run rely upon spot pricing which has been one of the sticking points for the SEC you know how it feels like a double standard right how could you approve the Futures ETF which actually causes more slippage is less good for the consumer relies upon spot pricing and the not approve the spot ETF and So eventually it's untenable I think to hold this position a Bitcoin ETF is inevitable and it's just going to be a matter of um which uh chairman actually you know gets over the line and does this and there might be enough pressure to actually get chair Gensler to do it but I don't know him personally so I can't say even if I did know it personally you probably wouldn't tell me yeah for sure um you guys this has been an epic show obviously this is quite possibly the longest show I've done at least in recent memory um but it's been amazing where can people learn more about each of you and your work we're both on Twitter though uh Joel never tweets so maybe we can apply some social pressure on him to to tweet more well you you tweet enough for the both of us um but uh it's our website placeholder.vce where we occasionally write our long form content but yeah um you know we're around and we're really interested in just as a closing thought uh just reflecting on the whole conversation uh I we often remark or we have remarked over the last couple of months that we haven't been as excited as we are now since 2019 or so um you know all markets are kind of uh they're exciting but they're not very productive and um even though it seems very dire out there from what we're seeing eating sitting working with entrepreneurs seeing the energy of the new teams that that are that are not just coming to Market but starting new companies it's really contagious and uh this is really a great time and I know that there's a lot of people who are struggling if they uh entered this world financially in a year like 2021 and it's I think it's important to remember if you don't have this experience or you haven't gone through this before that uh this is this is part of the process and eventually uh we're all going to look back on this period and and remember it as fondly as we remember 18 and 19. we're all more Innovative in Bear markets because we face more problems and problems force you to innovate we're into the bull market like everything's great why do I need to innovate um there and you know on Twitter we're placeholder VC uh Jay manegro C bernisky Perfect all right well it has been a pleasure having you both on Unchained thanks Laura thank you thanks so much for joining us today to learn more about Chris and Joel and the state with the crypto
