not a dividend it's a tale of two funds now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyways um unnamed trading firms who are very involved i like that as the ultimate pump d5 protocols are the antidote to this problem all right hello everybody welcome to the chopping block every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspectives on the topics of the day so um i first i want you to apologize we're starting a little bit late uh because tyrone is very late he was very late um he wanted to say something to everybody for being late to roon please take the floor all i have to say is uh i i do apologize for the late start but you know sometimes thinking about time too much can make you go crazy oh my gosh the most to ruin apology ever okay very thanks arun um all right let's quick intros uh first we've got tom the d5 maven and master of memes uh next up we have taroun the giga brain and grand pub gauntlet who was perpetually late uh next we have laura shin the uh self-proclaimed journalist and the ceo of the show uh and then we have myself i receive head hype man at dragonfly there was no alliteration there there was no well the last time we had this big drama about whether she was actually a journalist or not and she claimed that she was and we said i'm curious okay all right but moving on that's what i said i said that you said that you're a journalist and something journalist and author hello journalists and authors oh very very impressive um anyway the uh the three of us are early stage investors in crypto but i want to cover that nothing we say here is investment advice legal advice or even life advice okay so we're starting a little bit late so let's go ahead and jump into the meat of it the big story of the week has been the sanctions on tornado cache so quick backstory tornado cache it's a privacy protocol slash mixer on ethereum at the time it's been basically the largest privacy solution on ethereum it's also the thing that most hacked funds end up getting washed through tornado or mixed through tornado so um last week we saw a treasury and the office for foreign asset control also called ofac they issued the first ever sanctions against a smart contract so it was not tornado cash the company it was not the people who are involved in tornado cash but rather the sanctioned entities include tornado cash quote-unquote which is not a legal entity it's just the name of a project and then specifically the list of a certain number of contracts in tornado cache which were mostly on ethereum now trainer cache actually has other contracts on other chains so cache exists on bsc it exists on arbitrom they were apparently not sanctioned but the ethereum contracts itself were sanctioned so this is the first time we've ever seen this we have seen another mixer get sanctioned so there's another mixture called blender which got sanctioned a while back but it was a legal entity and the people who were involved with the legal entity this is the first time we've ever seen this this is not a person this is not a company this is a con a set of smart contracts and a general project that has been sanctioned by ofac and so in response to these sanctions we saw an enormous amount of responses from the crypto community huge pushback uh lots of people one declaring their solidarity with tornado cash um tornado cash immediately started getting blocked from a bunch of their vendors so alchemy shut off their api access same thing with um what was the other one that i think you know if you also shut them off um their their governance form was taken down uh the discord was deleted um so and the github was completely arranged the github's of the founders of the founders it's anyone who contributed anyone to terminator cache github get their account deleted so their accounts were completely erased from github even for non-trader cash contributions they are just wiped off the face of the earth and we've also seen one of the co-founders alexi perzev who is based in uh he's a russian citizen but he was in amsterdam at the time he was arrested in amsterdam we still don't know what the charges are and foid which is the um the enforcement authority in uh the netherlands has not said clearly what the charges are uh but he's still currently under arrest um we've had a bunch of commentary from coin center who's preparing to challenge the sanctions as well as the eff uh it's it's been it's been really crazy to see this stuff playing out in real time nobody really knows what's going on soon after that there was what's called a dusting attack where um some person i think there's some uh somebody on twitter when they were going to do this they sent 0.1 eve from tornado cash to a bunch of well-known docs addresses so including people like shaq uh and justin sun they all receive 0.1 eth and as a result a lot of compliance solutions that are supposed to pick up on people who are engaging in interactions with tornado cash which of course is now sanctioned and so very not okay um they were now suddenly getting blocked from a lot of things that use uh uh chain analysis or trm so for example ave is now blocking people who've interacted with tornado cache the front end the front end sorry the front end the front end of ave as well as the front end of some other protocols started blocking people who have uh addresses that have interacted with tornado cache and so we're starting to see this broad ripple effect of what happens when the biggest player which is or the biggest tool which is sanctions starts to hit and come up against the concepts of decentralization and and defy so what are your guys thoughts on what we've seen with the tornado cash well you guys should start because you invested in tornado cash so i feel like we should maybe start with you know their story more closely than probably laura or i do well we we we know the team fairly well and we and we do own some torn tokens the the team broadly i mean the the surprising thing and this is public at this point you know roman and alexa have shared this already is that um you know nobody nobody from ofac really interacted with the tornado team there was there was no prior notice from treasury that hey where you guys are under investigation and um if you if you remember actually tornado cache the one they have a compliance tool on the front end that allows you basically like the equivalent of a view key uh for monero where basically you can you can basically show somebody look here's my twitter cash address you can generate a report that basically shows you look here's the source of funds here's where i got it from but you can selectively disclose this to people you want to disclose it to rather than just close it to everybody um and then second they also i think it was like in april they started themselves enforcing on their front end because obviously the protocol is decentralized they have no control over the protocol which is one of the core points about tornado cache one they burned access to every function except deposit and withdrawal yes so like the owners of all functions were like gone so you can't you really can't change anything exactly and so this this may be an important point that i didn't uh touch on deeply enough so the big difference between tornado cache is something like blender the blender was run by a company like if the company gets deleted blender was gone there was no more blender tornado cache is an entirely decentralized system of smart contracts that are completely autonomous no more human intervention is needed for tornado cache to run so tornado cache really just is a bunch of code that lives on the blockchain uh when they when they so for for the the founders now they you know they did own the the domain and the website and the domain got seized as well um the um the website they were blocking on their website uh any sanctioned addresses from interacting with toronto cache so ironically they they kind of did what they could for uh trying to mitigate the degree to which bad actors could use tornado cache but ultimately once you create decentralized code that anybody can use well anyone can use it the blockchain doesn't have the ability unless it's voted in by governance to be able to discriminate which actors can and cannot use the blockchain and so in some way the question in my mind that this raises is does this mean that basically privacy is kind of doomed as a category because the reason why tornado cash got hit is that that was what the biggest and high profile hacks ended up using they end up using tornado cash and so north korea and the lazarus group when they're hacking you know the ronin bridge and some of these other players they went through tornado cache in order to try to draw the funds and now that premiere cache is no longer viable for that there will be the next thing which was some lightning service is that right yeah there's some like random lightning service that got the proceeds of a reap the curve finance act so the curve finance act took place after the tornado cash act and um i guess the attacker sent it to this like there's this like lightning service where you can send ethernet contract and then relay to bitcoin violating it's much more expensive than using like ren but ren theoretically was centralized like alameda owned most of the nodes running it i think they actually announced their decentralizing today probably mainly because alameda is a kind of easy target let's say for ofac given that a lot of people are u.s citizens who work there but uh i think there's sort of an interesting thing of like what the alternatives are uh showing up i'm not sure privacy is dead as a category in the sense that in fact it just motivates certain people more i think there's this weird problem where certainly the funding for privacy may privacy projects may initially go down but there might ironically be kind of like a second wind where people are like oh we feel more motivated now the real question is like are the developers who are actually good at writing privacy software which you know as we've learned from the zk world is really like five people and maybe four of them are civils you know i i think like there's really not that many people who are extremely extremely good at careful at writing some of this type of code because it's you know if you make any mistakes you have things like the zcash influence inflation bug and so like you know you you really have to be you know if normal crypto smart contracts are measure 100 times cut once uh you know writing like privacy code just measure a million times cut once and so like yeah i think it's actually it's hard to find those people who care about it or are good enough actually to implement this stuff but usually those people are motivated by non-financial incentive and this is actually kind of an increase in that so i would actually not be surprised if we see way more things happen from anons who are actually just people who maybe i think that the problem is that like privacy requires a lot of r d work right like for sure not sorry yeah yeah for sure it's it's not something that you can really easily spend together on nights and weekends you know like you really need a lot of dedicated energy and time and a strong team and for a lot of the people who can do it like they have they have really high opportunity costs so i think without consistent funding i think it is actually really hard now that being said like you know if you look at if you look at the privacy coins after the tornado catch sanctions they actually didn't go down monero and zcash were basically unperturbed even railgun which is like a kind of tornado nova copy thing like it dipped a little bit and then it came back and so i think the market seems to be seeing this as like okay this is just tornado cash yeah but i actually asked jerry brito about this on my show that was my last question like does he think privacy is going to be the next thing regulators go after in general he was like no yeah i think the the reality is the regulars are not thinking that deeply they're just like look trainer cash bad north korea bad so right yeah put the two together and i was just stuck by like how sloppy everything has been so far like i feel like the treasury really [ __ ] up here like um specifically listing the ethereum deployments of it in tornado cache not the other instances uh listing every single pool that was used not just the 100th pool that north korea used like you know is north korea going to use the 0.1 eth pool probably not and yet it was banned anyway um the fact that trader cash did have this compliance tool even though like well why do we care about privacy why is this a problem because somebody can get basically fresh eth and users can can use it to cash out well if i can go to an exchange and show them the compliance tool and say hey here's my original address here's a new address you can sort of stop that sort of cash out process and so everything about it just didn't really make any sense i don't think they really understood what they were doing jerry also brought the point that how is a smart contract supposed to defend itself other sanctioned entities can defend themselves they can they can you know start a lawsuit what is a smart contract supposed to do and so the whole thing just feels like they didn't really know what they're doing and i feel like there's going to be a big legal challenge and even you know we're still find out about what's happening with with alexi but you know there have been there have not been charges brought yet the dutch police claim that they're launching their own investigation unrelated to the us seems kind of sus like the entire thing just feels very kind of amateur hour and really disappointing yeah i don't know if i agree with that like i feel like watching this whole thing what i'm seeing is um the same issues that i see with security regulation in the us where i feel like the crypto community has its views about you know what decentralization mean what what open source code means like um and they kind of have these certain distinctions that they're making right but that's like the industry i mean when gary gensler came in as you know that cc chair people thought like oh he gets blockchain he's gonna kind of view things the way we do and yet he understands the technology and he has a totally different view right like to the point where the sec seemed to imply that ether was no longer a security and then he seems to be no longer a commodity or no longer now yeah yeah sorry before gary gensler yeah and then now he's kind of implying that it is a security so um i feel like what i see time and again is like oh like even when i read like for instance you know the new york times or like the wall street journal or whatever they'll see say things like oh there was this new crypto legislation introduced and it's very friendly to the industry meaning like the industry um you know had a lot of input and they shaped the bill and like you guys all because you're part of the industry you're like well that's how it is like you know these are commodities and and but like as we've seen as you see regulators will look at something that you guys consider to centralize and be like actually it's really you know identifiable people it's really centralized and so i feel like it's the same thing again i just want to add on about the the dutch authorities so you're right we don't know what the charges are and stuff but um i interviewed somebody who used to work at oface and vincenne and he was saying that essentially we just don't know all the facts about what happened right and so it could be that there really are things that are illegal in the netherlands or whatever jurisdiction this person falls under that you know our give the authorities a legitimate reason to to arrest him you know in the u.s where we have like stuff about free speech and and everything you know we have a bunch of like u.s lawyers opining on what this all means but really it like not when that really applies to this person as far as i understand so well yeah you look you're absolutely right about alexi we don't know what the charges are and once we learn the charges might be like oh [ __ ] those are serious charges right maybe are incidental to his relationship with tornado cash right and you're absolutely right dutch system i don't know i don't know anything about the dutch system um but we i think we are in very good position to be able to criticize ofac because yeah i mean i'm not i'm not necessarily disagreeing with you so much as just pointing out that um you know like tom had this very strong opinion oh they definitely looked up it may be that they very well understood what the implications would be but were you know confident that they could make the argument that this was the right step that's all i'm saying i'm just saying like you guys definitely view it all as being one way but they might have a completely different interpretation of everything this whole thing in my mind is also very bizarre because it just parallels so much like the crypto wars of the 90s um and the case law that was presented there and the establishment of code is free speech and so the whole open source privacy movement i feel like we're just replaying this again even though we've sort of already seen this happen you know 30 years in the past right i mean yeah maybe i mean these were the same arguments that were made of why encryption should be illegal why are you encrypting stuff but don't you have something to hide doesn't north korea encrypt stuff at least in the u.s as far as i understand you know regulations around financial things are like way stricter than around other things so that's like i know people encryption was financial regulation right like what were people what was the pro argument for encryption was credit cards that's the thing when you do encrypt sending over the internet right and it's like okay this bad stuff that people do about sending illegal secrets and you know whatever i don't know whatever nonsense they were uh obsessed with at that time that's the collateral damage that we're willing to accept in order to allow for good economic activity to go on unperturbed with encryption and it was also very serious because they were munitions and so it was an arms control export and so obviously you know smuggling you know munitions out of the country is also extremely illegal um and yet you know that was sort of changed yeah and it took it took people who were one obsessed with privacy for anything to change because most normal people don't care or don't even understand what's going on and second it took people who were willing to do so at personal risk because at that time the developers behind pgp took personal risk in creating technology that they knew was illegal in the us right and actually you know adam back for whatever misgivings that might have about him right he was he was he was a true cypherpunk and a rebel i think it was it wasn't him who like had rsa in his uh his t-shirt or something yeah i think it was everything his email signature was the rsa algorithm which was technically illegal it was it was illegal to as as a munition uh as you know something that's supposed to only the military supposed to have these mathematical formulas which is a ridiculous concept on its face and now the idea is that this set of code is illegal now look did they say that no they didn't say it they said some vague thing about tornado cache and these ethereum addresses which are not even all the addresses of tornado cache um which which is my point is that what they're infringing on is a really important very difficult conversation that as a like we need to grapple with these conversations not have answers handed from on high right yeah and i'm not saying that i uh don't agree with you guys like i'm somebody who does consider privacy super important um i find it weird when people don't but i'm just saying that i feel like you know very swiftly the community kind of had a very certain take on everything and i was like well we don't know their reasoning we didn't like they might come out with a lot of reasons why this was the right move that's a lot i'm just trying to say yeah you may think they definitely bungled it and they'd be like no this is exactly what we intended yeah knowing the you know average level of competence and intelligence of like you know most of these uh yo government officials i'm i would be very surprised that they had you know a really good argument as to like why was the move i think it's just like you have a hammer and this is where you're going to use instead of and you know from their perspective it's like what are they really losing um right like it's like a classic i think that's you know look at all these these protocols and these companies that have sort of abandoned tornado cache and it's like yeah is our microsoft lawyer is going to stand up for tornado no it's it's extremely high risk very low reward so he's going to get rid of it um and the tornado the treasury probably did a very similar calculation yeah then you saw who's the who's the legislator who was like finally we stamped out you know tornado cash which is owned by north korea oh it was the secretary of state lincoln yeah blanket blanket who explained that was created by north korea which is yeah just like this whole thing is just like this boogeyman you know even the title the title of the of the post is us treasury sanctions notorious virtual currency mixer tornado cache they're just like oh my god like it's it's just all designed to create this like fear was like what what is tornado cache you know it's a it's a privacy protocol that some bad people use when you sanction this thing they will find the next thing to use and are we going to sanction that thing next right like the next hack is going to go somewhere it might be some lightning thing it might be they wrap through monero and they go into the monero bridge and they use monero or they use zcash next or they use ren and there will always be something that bad people use and is the theory that we're going to operate with is that we'll whack them all one at a time until one that's not sympathetic shows up and actually fights us yeah but i have a question like what if the government comes out and is like okay here are the ways that tornado cash was actually centralized and it's like some kind of nuanced argument about i i don't know i'm going to you know extremely careful to avoid components of centralization um i mean they burned the admin keys they didn't run like a relayer it was really just you know you build the code they didn't even deploy it there was a deployment ceremony so i just i i'm open to the idea that maybe there's more to it but that's the thing they didn't sanction the people if you sanction the people then it's like okay there's some argument about it so people are responsible so they didn't sanction the people huh if they sanctioned the people then i agree well they didn't know clearly if the secretary of state thought it was north korea they didn't even know the right people were out there yeah yeah i know i'm just saying like uh you know i don't think they did that much they clearly did not not bubble up all their due diligence yeah i would say the one thing though that's important yeah so with regard to a ceremony ceremonies are when basically you have a group of people who each contribute part of the randomness to the initial creation of like the initial genesis block that is used to be the initial point of random number generation for for like a privacy protocol so you can think of it as like no one person contributed the initial genesis kind of like in the satoshi as a famous quote it's actually many people contributed part of it it got aggregated so they did that but there was also a deployment ceremony so they basically used crate two and said hey you can do this transaction and it's gonna deploy a component of tornado cash so they didn't even do that so 30 contracts that were deployed by random people right right there was no incentive to do it people just did it right so um yeah i mean this whole thing like i mean clearly this is going to be a fight and the thing that's frustrating about this is that and this is part of the imbalance of power between the government visuals is that you know when ofac takes a step even if that step is miscalculated it's you know a breach of their um of their abilities right or what they're constitutionally allowed to do um the amount of work it takes to undo that step right the amount of legal expenses the amount of time the amount of energy the amount of economic destruction that happens it's hugely asymmetric right it's going to take years before anything happens on any of this right obviously we'll eventually learn the charges we'll get more details about what happened and why and you know but but the the amount of work that it takes to to push the government back one step is enormous relative to what it took for them to take the step and that's part of the frustration of something like this and that's part of why regulation by enforcement sucks like that's why it's so much better to regulate through conversations so that people can actually make decisions as a collective about what is the right way to treat privacy how do we think about financial privacy is the idea that look you don't have the right to financial privacy if bad actors are also sharing in that product that financial privacy with you is that the idea is like what's the theory here i mean the the problem and maybe this is to laura's point is like you know most the time i think if the government sees a sanctioned country that you know we've had sort of male relationships with for decades anywhere near anything it just becomes a like stop everything type of decision now there's collateral damage in that of course but that is the cost they're willing to pay for enforcing kind of this type of thing and like i i agree that there's a nuanced argument against it but i do not think the government needs is has been kind of told to have a care about nuanced argument their their regulators effectively lay down the law of like anything north korea has to be kind of bludgeoned and that's it but this is clearly like a very different categorical difference right with like what they usually do they usually sanction a foreign person or a foreign company which makes sense right like okay all they're doing is taking that framework and just hoping that it works well it's like imagine that nor imagine that they sanctioned like literally a code base they didn't they didn't literally sanction the code base because they just said tornado cache which people assumed met the code base and so github deleted their code base imagine that they sanction this code north korea uses for their hacking efforts right and it's like some you know i don't know some disassembler or something like that they say north korea uses this and if we if we take this offline north korea is going to be screwed i mean we do do that by the way with hardware export restrictions and ips so i i would argue that you're you're you're not totally on code is free speech but hardware gates are not free speech which is like a funny distinction okay okay export restrictions on hardware is actually quite different even though it's the same code it can be the same code burned into an fpga and it will it will be illegal as hardware but not as code i think that's i think that is a reasonable distinction to make though but i but maybe i don't have a good argument why but i i see your point i'm just saying like they draw the line arbitrarily already to me so it's just like they just it's turtles all the way down once you cut a little yeah well i think uh you know people are talking like you know what is sort of the next shoe to drop right like um are validators supposed to process transactions from sanctioned entities um you know is ethereum supposed to exist and process transactions from sanctioned entities like you know it is you know turtles all the way down when you sort of look at the stack and wonder like where does it sort of stop yeah it gets interesting when you look at the questions of after the switch to proof of stake then like is coinbase gonna um you know process a blog that has uh interactions with tornado cash in it or i mean like it just gets really really weird quickly i don't know so this may be a segway to our next uh topic but i just feel like i keep on learning so many different things about um you know what things will be like post-merge that really calling it questions certain fundamental elements of ethereum and make me wonder like oh is this really going to be a good thing or is this going to end up in creating a lot of um you know potential uh threats to ethereum uh i don't know they're there's just what are you thinking of um so this obviously is like the most recent one just those questions around um validators and stuff but um you know this centralization vector around like uh liquidity uh sticking derivatives um and lido and stuff like i did a big show on this and i kind of was surprised that like there wasn't a little bit more alarm about it because just as a journalist listening i'm like whoa uh this seems potentially quite bad um and then now you know i'm learning a little bit more about mep i don't know a ton about it yet uh enough to really give an opinion but i can definitely say that given the range of things that i've heard there's like really good points being made against institutionalizing mev and like um just making it uh something that is an accepted part of ethereum and so i don't know there's just like a number of ways where i'm like whoa uh [ __ ] might go down maybe uh yeah so i think the the first thing is the theorem already accepts there's just no there's no there's no if stands or buts about they've in fact centralized it off-chain and there's you know despite the fact that that's been tried to be decentralized by multiple attacking auctions we've centralized to like 70 to 80 percent of hash power in one so the first thing is it's already there the question is whether it gets shared the revenue gets shared amongst all validators or not but actually but some other people would say that another question would be should we do more to minimize it rather than just accept it so there's a couple there's a couple of things i think the first thing is that every mitigation mechanism has a cost so anything that's doing something like say fair ordering either is more centralized so like the chain-link arbitrary version of the world has a centralized sequencer effectively um or like at least a centralized off chain relay um the or it adds a huge amount of latency or kind of like changes to the ux that would be unacceptable to most users or developers like you just have to wait a long time you have no clue what other transactions are being included like a batch auction the second thing is there's sort of what i would call my folk shannon theorem which is like any time you actually have any uncertainty in a transaction processing mechanism there's always some amount of minimum extractable uh value from people who are processing the transaction and when you force people to go from the environment of like hey i submit a transaction to someone who then afterwards is like very low latency with like all the other parties i have to interact with then it's like okay well there's that the fact that's very low latency means the net extractable amount is a lot lower but now that we're like hey we want to actually just send packets or i want to send transactions over the internet which has tons of reliability issues you can't guarantee that the latency is low you're obviously gonna the higher the uncertainty the higher the expectable value so there's no real way around that that's just like the laws of physics the i guess the second thing is that there are ways of mitigating and most ways of mitigating actually involve in making the auction better or making the economic process better not like these fair ordering things that change the security assumptions use new cryptography like that maybe is not ready for for prime time yet there's trusted hardware which gets break broken in every other month like i'm just waiting for like all these sgx things to break at some point well and protocols are also redesigning themselves over time to like reduce mv opportunities so yeah i i think there's going to end up being like we're we're just converging to whatever the information through theoretically minimum let me paint the intuition that you're trying to convey here because i think it might not be intuitive to most people um why mev is intrinsic to blockchains so mev is basically the idea is like imagine imagine you're running an exchange okay but you're you're the exchange operator and as you change operator you can ultimately decide what happens when as long as nobody is obviously cheated and when you're a totally centralized exchange obviously nobody can really tell who's getting cheated and so people are sending you stuff and you're like oh you know what this one goes here and this one's gonna go here and then boom i'm gonna go in between and i'm gonna make some money um now the tighter that the bounds are like let's say that everybody is you know uh coordinating everybody can actually see who's doing what trades when now it's harder for you to cheat but as long as it's not instant the moment two people send you a trade right if two people send you a trade and you can decide which one goes first and you can decide when your trade goes in there's always some mev mvp is just the ability to control how the order book plays out and uh tarrou's point is that it's impossible to get rid of you can make it better you can make it faster you can do whatever but as long as somebody runs the exchange they can always do something to make even a little bit of profit right now in theory you can make a ton of profit because there's seven second blocks or 12 second blocks basically which means that there's a lot of time for you to go in and reorder stuff and do a lot of nonsense i also think people give flashbacks for saying oh flashback is like causing mev or something like that i think the mental model for flashbacks or ever seen like the the hamster nav episode of the wire you know where it's like they sort of sanction a portion of the city to like basically sell drugs and i feel like flashbacks are sort of like that in my mind like this is going to happen anyway so we may as well have an orderly market for it as opposed to uh you know what people previously did which was like you know bribe meyers do co-location like crazy gas spikes stuff like that yeah and so so actually the history of this was that these probabilistic gas auctions led to people spam instead of saying like i want to be after this transaction because i'm front running or back running you instead would just spam the validator with million copies of the same transaction with the gas just a little bit below the transaction and be after and if there's many competitors everyone was spamming and you had this like huge spam war against the network and it just like basically was non-productive usage because most the block would be filled with these failed transactions that were people trying to spam by moving that separate from the production of a block via the flashback auction you actually at least made it much more orderly for the average user the non-strategic user the dumb user the user who just like opens metamask hits send not the user who's like sitting and actually like monitoring the mempool and interacting with these things directly so the the proposal and ethereum that is the controversial one that you're talking about is this notion of what's called proposer builder separation so the idea is that builders or block builders people who are taking sequences of transactions that they see ordering them executing them and giving a proof that like they executed those transactions correctly they then bid they say here's how much i'm willing to pay for this block or here's how much i want to get paid for this block and a proposer basically takes those bids and aggregates them and then submits to a network now one of the reasons this is supposed to be better at least in in some sort of more economic sense is that if there actually is a competitive market for block builders people who are like trying to like rearrange sequences and like find the optimal block to build uh then censorship becomes very expensive because you have to pay significantly more than the maximum price that a block builder is willing to offer for many blocks to effectively do the censorship attack and so the idea of like doing this splitting actually does sort of help but it doesn't mitigate the fact that you still have these like supply chain attacks on the the actual code base right where someone puts in like the the meme was like ofac like the ethereum client has like an ofac check so i guess the the main thing is these things are just still a little half baked to put in the protocol fully and they're not going to go in immediately but at the end of the day there's no way of you the best you can do is just add in mitigating mechanisms and then actually share the revenue the one problem in proof of work is that you actually cannot share the reps so imagine there's revenue that's earned from from mev you can actually distribute it to all miners so like let's say on each block when you enter a proof-of-work mev auction whoever mined that block gets all the emmy mev rewards there's no way of splitting it and the reason for that is with hash power you actually don't know and this is a feature and a bug depending on how you view it you don't actually know the distribution of all miners you don't know how much resource each miner is getting you only approximately know it and you're measuring that based on the difficulty adjustment of the blockchain and in proof of stake you could actually take a portion of the mev and redistribute it to all validators as sort of a bonus for staying honest and in some ways that's sort of the the direction that's being moved in to kind of eliminate the centralization effect of sort of a flashback auction so i would say that the ofac get thing got confounded with this thing that wants to be added and then there's lots of fun and people didn't bother reading like carefully any of the documentation then so hence we got the storm on the internet yeah the weird thing so all this mep stuff flashbots started what early last year like that yeah i mean i guess they're they were informal for longer yeah yeah um like before that the really interesting thing is that before that there was so initially when flashbacks was first conceived um i was very strongly against flashbacks we were actually investors in flashbacks now but i was like against flashback all three of us all three of us are investors yeah um and uh basically my view was that uh i thought they were playing with fire and that the idea like institutionalizing the idea of mvp extraction is going to make basically wall street and traditional enterprises be like what the hell is going on in there like you guys are just agreeing to all front run each other and steal from each other and that like anybody who's not smart enough or connected enough is just going to get destroyed and i thought one of two things so one there was this trend actually a lot of projects that were what we call accelerationist basically meaning that like this thing will eventually happen let's make it happen right now and then try to create the perfect version of the eventual state before that point obviously there were mev auctions and there were there was mev but it was kind of a gentleman's agreement not to extract it right and so i remember back that wasn't that wasn't true on chain though there are people definitely i mean on shape but it shows the miners themselves like they're they're remember in 2017 there was this famous instance one of the first instances of mvp that was very widely known of which was that f2pool during the status ico the status very old school ico back in the ico era in the status ico it was discovered that f2pool had put in one of their own transactions to basically mint uh a bunch or buy a bunch tokens in the ico before anybody else could and there was a huge storm about this but people pulled their hashtags from f2pool you were like oh my god how could you do this you're destroying the integrity of ethereum and after that the miners learned you don't mess with blocks it's just part of the ethereum like immune system there was this paper out i think this week um and it was like some uh basically actually talking about f2pool it was selfish yeah yeah thing yeah it's like single blocks running yeah yeah yeah um so empty pool has gotten with the handy feature sometimes but they've always been the kind of yeah they're the bad boy yeah they always are cut they were the first ones to move from flashbacks to whatever that uh competitor was like [Laughter] so like i feel like they're always yeah they're always living on the bleeding edge they are but but i think it's interesting because like that that single event every single mining pool that i'd ever met with here they remembered that they all knew about that event because they knew that look you don't there's certain things you don't mess with and one of the things you don't mess with is you don't reorder within a block and it was always understood that okay a mining pool is allowed to have their own transactions at the end of the block that are non-fee paying that just like you know do payouts and stuff and just kind of administrative stuff but you don't mess with the internals of a block and it was really flashbots that started to move the overton window of what is acceptable within ethereum which is that no muv's a thing these these uh mev auctions are happening on chain through pgas we should institutionalize them and remove the noise from the mempool and put in a separate section for pros over here and everyone arguably though i would say that i think that it would we would not be at the point where ethereum actually was able to support so many different types of applications with increasingly less sophisticated users without without flashbacks and it's not like it's inaccessible in theory like anyone could just change their rpc and use it so yeah i would just say that you know the the main thing i i always take kind of i'm always surprised that is there's always people like oh it's like so extractive and like nothing you you know like i don't really understand how you expect this thing to be an economic system and not have some type of like strat like non-strategy-proofness first of all there's no incentive compatibility in any of this stuff as designed like it only at the consensus layer does anyone even care about measuring whether incentives are sort of compatible once you get to application layer literally no one actually even bothers checking if their mechanism works they just try to deploy and mint the token and get out that's like and if people are like that then obviously they're going to create all these like horrible horribly inefficient things i remember when artbox came out which is like this big nft launch pad thing they had this like horribly implemented dutch auction where it would always start at a valuation that's lower than what all the bidders wanted and so they basically created they took this auction that was supposed to actually be like an orderly thing and then they turned into like the worst type of first price auction because everyone is like oh this is 50 cheaper than what i really think the value is so i'm gonna spam for this and stuff like that the average person who participated in art box auction would have gotten zero if not for flashbacks so you have to give them a lot of credit for i look to be quick i totally give flashbacks credit i mean at this point it's clear that we're not going back look at solana i mean a lot of the problems on salon happened because they didn't have an orderly mechanism and the fees were there fees right right wait before this turns into yet another salon fashion show i want to ask um because so again i am still doing my research on maybe but as far as i understand like people are pointing out that there are certain regulations against this type of thing and so some people are saying like oh this literally is kind of like illegal so i was wondering i think it's plausible that we move to proof of stake that some exchanges don't extract mvv 100 like yeah it's it's optional now right like if you're running uh an ethereum uh client you can use mev boost which is a software which liberace let you take these blocks and i suspect these big you know like coinbase right they're not going to run any boost um it's too too sketchy so yeah i find that weird that like one group is going to be like okay we'll do the thing that's illegal and then another group is like okay we have to abide by the law right but that's always been true in the sense yeah when does that not be why does that not matter we're just talking about tornadoes that's the perfect example of this well wait but tornado so obviously now it's sanctioned but i mean unless you're a north korean hacker like a lot of people were just using yeah tornado is obviously not sanctions are not backwards looking essentially okay but so you agree that mev boost then would be illegal like not really not really not really that it would be illegal it's that i mean if if anything were to happen it would probably be civil and it's like you're opening yourself up to lawsuits and like you're opening up your like you're just like the real point is why would you want to bother yeah the real question is does unisop get regulated as like a swap stealer or like a broker dealer at least if you care about us regulation if that ever was true and like kind of like the sanctions forward-looking any future game swap transaction gets profit then i agree it's true but right now it's like the the government doesn't even seem to be able to to distinguish the difference between like an lp share and the 20 for taxes forget about for like understanding how to redeem alp shirley yeah no i i think the the reality is that a lot of ethereum exists in a global environment right a lot of most people use ethereum don't live in america they're not americans mostly human beings the weird part though most developers do very long unfortunately a large proportion a lot of developers are unfortunately subject to american laws but um ethereum itself is not and you have to build ethereum in such a way that it works no matter where you are and the mev is is something that just comes out of the incentives it comes out of the game theory right and it kind of doesn't matter if you make me illegal in one country someone in a different country will extract any i i'll give you another example arguably if the u.s government ever said that an online ad impression which is sort of like when you go buy a facebook ad you're buying like a future right to a certain set of demographics that get a certain ad right it's basically a security you could argue that it like it actually is a [ __ ] common enterprise like and it is a security like if if the government really wanted to go after facebook like back when they cared more they would probably have just been like ad impressions or securities and you know you're a broker dealer so like you can't front run everyone but instead it's not right and like oh if you look at google and facebook they do their own their entire business model is do mev for yourself you run the auction you sequence when particular bidders are bidding and ninety percent of bidders use automated bidding strategies that you made as the the company their their business model is literally only mev at least here it's like competitive i like this idea of extending it to each other but that is what it is like let's not let's let's let's you know let's call it donkey and ask when it is announced you know it is in this case all right all right you heard of your first facebook the biggest mvp extractor wow i mean it's the same concept like i understand i understand the point i just have the point i just uh i always i always enjoy the fact that it's like a second price auction though i mean you do get it's not second price anymore yeah they literally got rid of it uh google sorted in sort of didn't like yeah some some some some auctions are some aren't but yeah um anyway all right let's move away from uh google and facebook auctions um so actually one of the things that i want to chat about that we we brought up before the show started when terron was still not here oh right is um see aren't you you were talking a lot well no you got more bonding you had a great discussion and it the listeners would have benefited but anyway this so there's been a lot of hubbub this week in the nft community about these exchanges that are no longer enforcing royalties the royalties for those who are not aware generally when you affect a sale of an nft on a platform like openc there's a certain percentage of each sale that goes back to the original creator and that creator the creator specifies what they want the royalty to be for that collection so it turns out and a lot of people did not know this i actually didn't know this until i learned it very recently is that these royalties are not enforced at the smart contract layer the way a lot of people talk about nfts is like oh nfts are this way that creators can get paid and blah blah blah but actually these royalties are kind of like a suggestion so it's kind of like you know you just sort of tape something on like your little you know bucket that you're uh busking with and it's just like please suggested donation is five percent um but it's up to the it's up to the actual exchange to actually enforce that and it turns out there are a couple of exchanges one of them is element and the other one is pseudoswap that are not enforcing the royalties and as a result they're actually growing quite a bit in trading volume because they're cheaper than the places that are foreign since tom is the real nft dj here i would um i would like love a little tldr of what pseudoswap actually does because i actually have not really understood i mean i feel like that's oh we can we can talk about it i feel i feel like the reason that they become popular is also their new mechanism on like open sea yeah it's just the lack of royalties oh really well no i think that's a portion of it but it's also you can think of it as i know you're a big nftx fan um you can think of it as basically a sort of univ3 version of nftx where basically any individual can set their own sort of curve for the nfts that they have and then they use a routing contract that aggregates over all the curves so you get better execution better collection or like per collection okay and lower fees um you're not doing the whole fractionalized uc swap thing so um yeah it's just like a better cheaper place to trade you know nfts and the energy meta is trending towards floor trading and so it sort of all kind of lines up oh so you don't even care which one you get you don't care what you can actually specify you sort of like ftx in that way but it's like hey if you're trying to move you know a lot of money through an ft collection maybe you're less you know picky about that and it's it's more optimized for that sort of meta within with nfts um but yes no royalties yeah i mean it's this very weird dynamic where i feel like we weren't even happy having this conversation had open c not opted in to have royalties from in the first place but they did which was the standard which created this impression among everybody including very sophisticated people that royalties are somehow enforced on a smart contract level as opposed to just being this suggestion that exchanges choose to choose to enforce and i think as a result you know it's like well our exchange is incentivized to use royalties what's like no because increases the price for you know their their the assets and sort of reduces trading um do users want royalties some do they think want to respect creators and give them attribution but most don't they just want a cheap cheaper nft and so it's like why are we even in this meta in the first place of people well remember there was a supply side problem in 2019 and 2020 where forget about the demand side there was just like no one you could convince who is like a relatively prominent artist to even make one of these things and so the royalties were actually like a way of like bootstrapping the supply side before kind of you know the demand side came after defy summer so like i i do think the supply side pieces that's an interesting argument is that the loyalties were there to bring people in at the beginning but now the democrats who were like who were a lot more the creators the creators yeah i mean but this is exactly my argument of like why creators were interested in nfts um you know mark cuban on my show was like oh i got interested when i realized i could sell tickets to dallas mavs games and you know enforce a royalty and all the resales so you know creators are very interested in this and you know as a creator myself i have to say that i personally would totally want to give you know some of my resale value over to other creators yeah i don't want to go into the economics uh necessarily being a writer oh okay so if you're if like for you for a unit of work you make like this amount of money for me for a unit of work i make like a lot of money you know especially with the writing in particular sure um so and and you it's like super offensive like you you don't even know how many people have like tweeted things at me like why don't you give things away for free and i'm like oh because it took me like x amount of time to make that and like that's what i do for a living i mean like yes people like you like vcs you can write for free because you make your money doing something else but this is actually what i do to make money right and this goes to my point i was we were discussing discussing this while truman was late i was kind of annoyed when i opened my twitter uh application and i see spencer noon no offenses spencer i've never met him in person but you know he's a variant fund and he and tweeted something like oh uh you know when artists songs are streamed they shouldn't make any money because the song is effectively an advertisement for their work and i was like you know i was like do you do you know any musicians because like musicians they are much more likely to say like i should earn so much more for my streams um they're uh more likely to complain about the fact that like they kind of have to tour to make enough money you know it's like the actual work they do doesn't make enough so they have to do this additional thing on top to actually make the money and so he you know i just was like and i was surprised because you know jesse walden is part of varian fund and i was a little bit like i feel like jesse definitely knows musicians so you guys should have talked to some to like understand what their world is like from a business perspective and then i was surprised like kyle simoni backed spencer and noon up and i was like i just tweeted back at them i was like you guys must not know any just he's married to a musician yeah yeah so that's why it surprises me spencer did not seem to understand the economics of being a musician and you know it's like they want musicians to be like entrepreneurs and like you know have this like oh i'm gonna like like spent because kyle's point was there's a ton of businesses where you give away the core business for free and then you charge for stuff on top and i'm like wait but a musician wants to make music and be paid for it not like at this whole business model that's super complicated where like they do the work but they do that for free and then they do this other thing to make the money that's like not what they want to do they want to make money they want to make money and they want to be paid and be paid for it yeah i was a little bit like and you know i don't normally get kind of emotional when i'm looking at twitter i'm like fascinated by the crypto discussion but i don't normally like have a sense of personal involvement but i have musician friends so like i just was like you do not understand this world at all but anyway okay so let me give the the super villain argument for why i think actually i'm fine with the idea of destroying royalties so here's here's the because you asked about the economic argument you asked about the economic government okay so if if um if when i let's say let's let's ignore music and all this nft stuff right the classic thing is selling tickets when you when you when you're selling tickets to like a you know some basketball game right very often what will happen is scalpers will come in and they'll buy the tickets so they can go and resell them later to people who actually want to sit down and watch the show so if a scalper bought the tickets from you right and they there was a tax that was automatically enforced when they resold the ticket to somebody else the scalper would pay you less right because they have to be so let's say let's say i have to pay 25 of what i make from you uh like you automatically enforce it let's not say how let's just say you have a software system that does all this right when i when i reassign the ticket to somebody else i have to pay 25 or whatever i charge them back to you then i'm going to be willing to pay you less the first time that i scout the tickets because i know i'm going to get less at the end because i have to pay 25 to hand it off to somebody right that the the tax that you pay when you resell the asset it flows through to the original value that the scalper is willing to pay if the scalper knows they're going to make less money because they have to resell it then they're not going to be willing to pay you are making some assumption about the velocity of resale here which i think the point is like musicians are not like they're not like constantly trying to turn their revenue they're not like they are this is the reason music nfts will never have here's the here's the basic shape of the argument i'm making right is that like if you if you remove um royalties then people will be willing to pay more for the initial mint because the initial mint is going to be worth more right like i can now sell uh this thing for higher than i could originally sell it for but you're assuming so i'll be willing resale is happening fast enough that people care like there's some trade-off between like royalty and resale frequency right and like that's sort of like i don't think for musicians it's like that for even for artists fine artists it's something like why why would they why would there's like these like collectibles it's clearly like people want to just constantly like beanie baby trade pokemon card trade i don't see if you're structuring it purely as like a donation and you're not actually yeah yeah yeah yeah user reseller or or if it's like in that case if it's like fine art where it's like a tax harbor for someone else then like yeah the royalty is the only way that the artist ever gets paid yeah i think that's kind of the part that seems ridiculous to me which is the velocity of trading of nfts which is like should board apes be making 50 million dollars a year from people trading board apes like that seems pretty high um maybe it should be a per transaction fee or should be you know kind of uh you know something nominal versus like you know the ten percent that you use but when you buy merch at uh i don't know if you have like a music festival or concert or something you're not going and trying to resell the merch immediately that's the problem with all these music entities they're assuming that people like want to resell the rights to it's like why would i even own intellectual property or fake intellectual property and like immediately sell it it only makes sense for these like weird collectible things i just don't think it like for people who are making these things where they're like not trying to be businesses and they're just like hey we're we're in our own creator i just don't think they care about the velocity well i i just don't think it makes a difference right i think at the end of the day if you get two and a half percent of every future sale of this asset right then it could be the economic expectation an economic expectation if you don't have those royalties you'll make that two and a half percent more upfront and you could decide that you want to spread out that two and a half percent over time by taking two and a half percent of whatever you're assuming a user wants no no no no this this is this the difference between like something that's like strategy proof and sort of obviously strategy for strategy proof means like i can bid my true valuation and i actually get but the problem with strategy proofness is these are these were like you know nobel prize winner um paul milgram's terminology for this sure strategy proof has this problem where i i still have to reason about if there's many rounds of this which is the frequency argument but i have to reason about the future rounds people's valuations when coming up with my valuation yeah obviously strategy proof is i don't care i just do it once and it works and the problem is the nft market has stratified itself into games that are like me really spending time thinking about the set of future value that's different than like what say like a fine art person creator cares about sure right and and so like i view the people who make board apes like the same as someone who like works at supreme they don't really give a [ __ ] about the quality of the product they're making it's not the quality of the product it's literally just like can i convince enough of this core group of speculators that there's a high enough velocity of re of churn that it's worth investing in now versus something where it's like i spent like my lifetime making this magnum opus and i just want to sell it one right and like understanding that those are two extremely different notions of how people on both sides have valuations for these things sort of means that like you can't expect this is why the music nft thing is a scam like it's like never gonna work like well in the case of someone with a magnum opus like you the royalty doesn't matter because no one's gonna resell it no but they resell once you're dead right well but wait actually uh going to what you were saying about the uh the dallas maps tickets i i have a similar argument to what chiron was saying where when they when they're selling the initial ticket for something like yeah a concert or like a game or whatever they set what the price is right and then the scalper finds what the actual like real prices yeah so like this is why you know nf like this is why creators like nfts because they can have that direct relationship with people and they can capture that value rather than a lot of it going to the scalper so just in your initial example it like there's this kind of middle person that hopefully wouldn't exist at least as much in nfts right so the middle person's open yeah but i don't think nft or open c is like buying you know the the the collection that you're dropping right the speculators are the middle person right unless they pull a zillow right so then when you make this whole argument about like oh the initial person will want to pay like no it doesn't because in the in this new world that we're talking about we don't have these scalpers or our idealist ideally we wouldn't you see what i'm saying we have the speculators right i mean that's why that's where you're making all the money from is the speculators that's what the royalty who's gonna pay the royalties the speculators who keep trading the entities with each other because they're all speculating no but i think a lot of people that buy in the initial it's gonna be a mix it's gonna be a mix of speculators and actual real fans that just want that thing i mean but the initial mints are like overwhelmingly i mean that's what like we're talking about solana going down because it's not normal people who are like running bots trying to get into the initial mint yeah yeah but that's why i compare most nfts are successful with like shoe drops which are equally botted yeah or like city watch drops it's like the same group of like hype beasts like 20 to 30 year old people who love like i love talking gambling because those are the this is the the the sort of more introverted version of the people waiting in line to buy stuff can you define height piece for us uh you know basically any anyone who like somehow finds a fad for particular materialistic items they pick a subset of goods that exist that are definitely bought and sold at a high enough velocity that they can they don't have to hold inventory for more than one day and they try to buy the thing right when it drops and then immediately resell it that's a hypebeast yeah i mean in some ways i kind of feel like they are the ultimate speculation sure sure and and and in some ways okay yeah sure those people like board apes i i don't think they have any taste for fine art or like for music ip or like any any of these things that are like assets that like the rest of the 99 percent of the world gives a [ __ ] about yeah i mean look it's clear once there's an equilibrium it's kind of like flashbacks right it's actually very annoying it's flashbacks we're like before anyone's extracting mev we can all kind of gentlemen's agreement okay we're going to enforce royalties royalties are good there's a great story about it and then suddenly somebody crosses the rubicon and it's okay now one person is over the line but like that person is bad and we don't i'm excited for this not because of like you know the like crypto twitter version of this world it's like oh kill open c whatever i don't think that's that's open c will absolutely capitulate no they start losing market share because other people i just think you just stratify the market into the like like we want it's purely speculative nfts so the ones that have like long term that's where the money is no right now creators will want to be on open yeah i i agree i agree i don't think like everyone wants to be like catering to the bag supreme kid like that's just not sorry really obviously you don't think that's what opencv wants to do i think they they grew off that but i i do think that like now they kind of like they're catering to a different look at their website look at suic's website come on i don't know i i think that look at magic eden's website even compare the two of them clearly one is going after like the ultimate speculative bubble people sure the other is like trying to be like we have fine art on our i think that i think what you're pointing out i understand what the argument you're making but i don't think that looking at the front page of the website like the hypebeast you're talking about don't look at the front page it's the random person off the street who looks at the front page and the random person off the street is very different than the average user but there are there are wannabe hypebeasts and magic eden is clearly more attractive to them sure right just like even aesthetically like i'm like how does one become a hypebeast you just like watch too many skate videos you gotta start your own course of like how to be a collection you watching me skate videos and you're like okay like yeah i really want to like buy all these skate shoes and resell them because like that skateboard's really expensive and like i think i can make money because like these people are idiots and like that's like the beginning of the cycle of doom and so those people need when they go to your website you need to be like oh like wait you're like trying to get sold at sotheby's nah this sucks like those people are not going to like look at that site and say that whereas like magic eden's clearly catering to that and i think like we're seeing the stratification of the nft market with high quality assets versus low quality assets low quality has high frequency uh churn high quality is like maybe it's more like fine art mate yeah exactly and like you know unfortunately they maybe got rugged by by mr zoo but uh i think uh and the fact that three arrows owns such a large portion of the art block collection oh yikes um but uh for bones i don't know who owns those keys technically right now someone owns those keys yeah um but uh but uh you know i think that that we're gonna see the market stratify and like the bear market is the perfect time for that because like there's all the speculative stuff has to concentrate in the highest velocity exchange and it will probably be bad for open c short term but i do think long term their brand recognition probably means they can go high up market yeah yeah i mean unfortunately i think like up market is bored apes that's the market yeah you should talk about southern bees i'm like guess what's getting slower the bees it's crypto punks i know i know i know i look look look i'm not i'm not disagreeing with that but my point is the new these people most of the volume you see right now is like not even if you ignore board and crypto volume and crypto punk volume it's like all these like random salon nfts which is why you can see magic eden beating open c some days and so i think the reason that's true is because it's like oh like the newcomer who like is like i saw all these people get rich last year where can i go but i only have 10 bucks oh it's salon nfts yeah what's the rate on openc 2.5 percent yeah actually going back to a much earlier point that tom made where he was like oh maybe it should be a fee or whatever like to my mind and getting a creator's perspective i'm like oh well if i create something and it becomes so huge then like yeah percentage makes sense because then i should benefit and this thing that's gotten so huge so the idea that like you would that you know no matter what the value is you would always get the same amount like that to me just doesn't make sense like it does make sense to me that it would be percentage based maybe it's also just a byproduct of the fact that well a i think if you did per transaction way more enforceable um versus you know trying to do it for exchange which is like we don't can't do that right now i think it's also just the norm where we see royalties getting set around like 10 percent just feels super high and that's why you see these np products that have insane treasuries because they're making money on all this volume um another thing we talked about was like you know basically making them opt-in and you can sort of see on chain who's paid you know else he's on their um who isn't and like you know maybe those kinds of assets or those people get something special higher quality those are the kinds of things that can get sold at sotheby's and like you know to hype these people who are flipping on openc it's like oh you didn't pay you know your royalty on this crypto punk we can't sell it at southwest anymore oh yeah yeah i i actually i do agree the the moment these things move to royalties i think i think the upshot is these newcomer exchanges have a really good shot of like actually cannibalizing opencv probably not magic eating magicking seems like ruthlessly fine about cutting fees like i don't think they give a [ __ ] about creators at all based on like the fact that they went to the eight coin community and were like hey we'll let you pay an ape so to subsidize any user and like they don't have to pay a royalty just to get the ap usage up so like they're willing to do anything versus like open c is like much more like trying to go highbrow like in it open c is definitely yeah i agree with that openc is is trying to hold on to their highbrow status but i think they're they are they're benefiting a lot from the fact that yes all the crypto not the the board apes are traded on open seas and i think i personally believe that if that changes and they need to get aggressive on cutting they will i think they will you bring up a good point though about this idea that these collections actually are weirdly decentralized in some sense and that they don't control their revenue stream because yes during like the speculative bubble they can like put up this like x percent uh royalty but when like the market crashes and people are just like i'm not gonna pay it then the treasury of this thing like suppose all the nouns were traded like on pseudoswap with no fee like the nouns treasury has just hit its peak then it's never it's never earning any more money they're still selling nouns yeah yeah now i'm just weird now i meant not someone who has like a fix there's kind of this interesting thing of like what happens these projects if like they become abandoned after the royalty goes away and and you know well i think board ape like shows you the model which is that like it's it's well you got to keep launching you shouldn't air droppings that's exactly right it's like it's i mean if you if you consider these things to basically be like luxury goods companies right it's like okay you created one line of watches okay it's important that those watches trade for a high value but you got to keep launching more watches there's more people in the world also there's this weird thing of like if you make it to a certain point you just get other brands basically using your address list as a customer list like tiffany's like the tiffany air dropper people was crazy yeah which is you know i mean look both people are equally tacky so i get why that's like a good customer yikes you know i have to admit i thought that they were cool i was like you know i'm not even one of these pf what no laura's trying to get tiffany's as a sponsor for the show so funny i was about to say i'm not even one of those pfp people but i have a pfp which i totally forgot it's crypto cup and of course my favorite um but yeah that was actually something that i thought was kind of interesting and cool um but i don't know do you feel like real world uh like yeah assets or whatever you want to call them based off of these digital things these digital nfts you think they're going to become a thing or is that just like because it just feels like it creates a whole host of yeah i find it kind of tacky yeah it's just real cringe but it it it maps to miami so it's like okay great yeah there's a quarter you literally figured out you've literally figured out the sales tactic in miami which is like oh you just go to the like some hotel and you're like hey put my product in your hotel and like you that's how you do all your marketing because like it's like the people who care about that aesthetic will buy your product because they see it at xyz place this is the same thing it's like oh now as a crypto punk owner you get to like get free stays at somebody i don't know it's just like you have to have like like taste that's only dictated strictly by dollar values of things for you to like care about this yeah it's a very it's a very like tick-tock house approach to like thinking about what nft status is i don't know yeah no no i got it but i do think that there are some brands that yeah they're like definitely i think the benefit is more for the traditional brand like there were a few that did um super bowl ads where they had like nft stuff in their ads and you know i feel like that was for the traditional brand to get more cred i mean it's crazy that tiffany's got 12 million dollars of revenue for like ostensibly what cost them a little bit of pr and like free customer list of like people who are guaranteed to buy it that's like insane it's a great move by the way yeah kind of genius and i bet you we're going to see a lot of cop like other luxury brands clown i've seen that the tag heuer nft watch um they had this watch with a screen on it that apparently i'm impressed by the tech they were able to get this out so quickly but basically it will like sync with your ethereum wallet and verify the owner of t and put your nft on your uh watch face oh my god uh wow oh boy i love people wearing signs that say mug me right now you know that's like that's literally yeah i mean look that's what wearing a rolex is too right it's like i mean it's not it's not in principle different but it just it's a it's a um it does feel like you're you're going on the wrong side of the aesthetic you know it's like yeah how did we go from cypherpunks to shitbags like you know somehow that's like if i ever write a book about about this industry that's the title of it yeah it is yeah it is a bit douchey like you know anyway whatever now all this stuff is arbitrary who the hell knows maybe maybe five years from now we're this is why i'm pulling for the fine arts stuff because at least there it's like you know people put thought and you know you really really like had to like make some social commentary about the world when they've created something versus some social commentary about like people hey there's a lot of people better social commentary than apes apes apes are literally like we've been talking about apes a lot you know that's just because the marketing is good doesn't mean that's a good social commentary i mean a lot of look a lot of ft art is cool most of it is not social commentary yeah you know like i mean looking like [ __ ] render or something like that it's really cool it's not really social commentary i guess i'm just not like personally into that that's what that's where we get all right i didn't have two like real artists on my show that made nft collections and their art was so interesting because it really engaged with blockchain technology in fascinating ways like one of them took her 23 and me uh genetic or dna whatever and um turn it into a hash or something and then um put it i think it was like this was so early it was like back in 2013 or 2014. she put it on a fork of uh it's like doge party or it's like some counterparty doge mixed up i don't even know mashup um it like doesn't exist anymore and the title was my soul i thought it was funny or like um yeah the uh mitchell chan who uh is an nft artist he did uh some of the first entities before the erc 721 standard his was um he found an artist like a traditional artist eve klein who he believes actually made the first nfts but they were with paper and what it was was um he had this like big exhibit and there were like lines around the block in paris and people walked into the gallery and um there would it was just like empty but there would be like numbers like number one number two and like you could buy one of the it was called like immaterial zones of pictorial sensibility or something like that and you could buy one of these and what you would get is a certificate of your authentic ownership of this so when mitchell found this it's like from the 1950s or whatever he was like oh my god this is the first art nft so he made the actual digital nft version of this in like august 2017 and this was like you know before cryptokitties whatever and um the funny thing is so eve klein said that um you could just buy this certificate but if you wanted to experience the true apotheosis of the artistic experience then he would take you to the river sen and um oh sorry you had to pay for your um yeah digital zone of whatever it was called immaterial zone anyway you to pay for it in gold and so if you wanted the true apotheosis of the artistic experience then eve klein would go with you to the river sin and you would have to um uh throw your certificate into the river and he would throw half of the gold you gave him into the river and then that would be like the true artistic experience so when mitchell this is like marina abramovic but like you know yes 50 years ago so when mitchell created his um his uh nft version of it in the smart contract you know you had to pay him east or whatever right but if you ever burned your um nft which you know he like somehow the contract would see that or whatever and it would trigger the burning of half of the eat that you gave him so he like created that aspect of it into his center anyway and the point is i'm saying is like these kinds of art entities interest me so much and they're like so different from yeah the pfps or whatever which again i have a crypto coven so i'm sort of a fan of those as well but um but like that kind of true nft art where it's like in conversation with art history and there is like it doesn't have to be social commentary but it's like engaging with the technology in a way that's like super creative and like makes you think like i really like those pretty cool well so speaking of true art we've got last piece of news for the week which is that biggest news of the week dragonfly which is that dragonfly uh just rebranded so we are uh we're now we used to be called dragonfly capital that's the biggest news of the week obviously uh i mean i think you guys just reduced yourself to three ascii symbols right now you have a logo that's an ascii because it looks very similar to tracer dao which recently got acquired by myself exactly that's great but they used to have a logo that looked a lot like ours but it's one weird greek symbol whereas ours is like you know to carrot and everything um anyway we also announced that we acquired a fund called medicinal capital which is the fund i used to be at when i started investing um and so we now i just wanted to say that to everybody on our show yeah i have to say like you guys have like a gang symbol not yet we may have to i'm trying to try to get it get it that's the idea it's very versatile you would be a good shadow puppeteer um yeah no this brought up for me like so many memories of kind of when i you know was covering this like earlier on because you know there was a time when it was like medicine was this sort of secretive thing and yeah and i don't think i even knew you at that time and like later on i found out that you used to work there but um yeah they're like i shoot is this um i'm trying to think yeah this is what eventually became my first forbes cover story where really it was the one i don't know if you guys remember the one where i put olaf on the cover oh olaf carlson yeah um because you know you could see the ico thing happening and like all these crypto hedge funds were popping up and whatever and um metastable was like the oldest uh you know hypno hedge fund but then um for various reasons i went with polly chain um as like the well olaf was always more public right yeah he had better hair than the lady well nevala's pretty good hair olaf still is better oh yeah sorry he does play better on a cover i think well uh naval the ball plays better on twitter but yes neval was one of the co-founders of madisonville and so when we acquired med school was you know it's it's it's a super og fund so it was founded in 2014 they were like in the ethereum pre-sale they did zcash and tazos and algorand and cosmos dfinity like you know a huge number of the lair ones that have been very very successful and then when i was there i did avalanche to near um you know filecoin coins truckware punch stuff so it's uh it's a very storied fund and so you know it's it's at least for us it's been pretty special to take it over but yeah it used to be a very shadowy fund back in the very early days of crypto and uh so we're now taking it into the dragonfly family anyway we're super over time so we need to wrap up um but once again thank you everybody for listening and to roone you are in very big trouble and uh i hope the audience finds it in this yeah i like to think of it as everyone got a blessing they got extra time to like talk about me exactly well we did but the audience was just stuck with them thank you everybody for listening to us another chopping block we'll come back to you in a couple weeks everybody [Music]
